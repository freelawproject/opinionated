Lambert, was involved in an automobile collision on the Brookport Bridge, which spans the Ohio River between Massac County, Illinois, and McCracken County, Kentucky. The defendant was initially charged in McCracken County with offenses stemming from the incident, but the charges were later dismissed on the grounds that the accident had actually occurred in Illinois. After the defendant was subsequently charged with\n   similar offenses in Massac County, he filed a motion to suppress evidence that had been obtained by the McCracken County sheriff's department. Following a hearing, the circuit court entered an order partially granting the defendant's motion to suppress. The State appeals, and for the reasons that follow, we reverse that portion of the circuit court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 In\n   <em>\n    Illinois v.

In March 2017, the defendant filed his motion to suppress. In December 2017, the cause proceeded to a hearing on the motion, where the following evidence was adduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 On the afternoon of November 11, 2014, Deputy Jerry Jones and Sergeant David Shepherd of the McCracken County sheriff's department were dispatched to the Brookport Bridge to respond to a reported head-on collision involving a pickup truck and a car. Officers Nick Myrick and Chris Hines of the Brookport, Illinois, police department also responded to the reported collision and assisted the Kentucky officers. Jones and Shepherd were the only witnesses called at the suppression hearing, but the parties stipulated that Myrick would have testified that he and Hines\n   were the first officers to arrive at the scene of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6 It was undisputed that the Brookport Bridge is approximately a mile long and that the defendant's accident occurred on the Illinois side of the bridge along a curve \"over dry land in Illinois.\" It was also noted that the curve where the accident occurred was a \"bad location\" that had been the scene of numerous prior collisions. The record indicates that the defendant is a resident of Kentucky and has prior convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 7 Jones testified that when he arrived at the scene of the accident, he saw the defendant and his female passenger, Katrina Warren, standing by the truck that had been involved in the crash. Jones then observed the defendant throw something off the bridge. Jones asked Myrick and Hines to look under the bridge, and on the dry land below, they discovered a small bag of marijuana, a pipe with marijuana residue, and a pack of rolling papers. Jones took possession of the items and later booked them into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 8 Jones testified that the car that had collided with the truck sustained \"quite a bit of damage\" and that its female occupant had to be removed from the vehicle so that she could be transported by ambulance to a local hospital. The record indicates that the ambulance had been dispatched from Kentucky. Jones indicated that Warren had sustained minor injuries and was also taken to a hospital for medical treatment. After the scene of the accident was \"cleared,\" Jones spoke with Warren at the hospital, and she advised him that the defendant had been driving the truck at the time of the collision. Jones testified that Warren also had an observable \"seat belt burn\" that was consistent with a passenger injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 9 Shepherd testified that when he had spoken with the defendant on the bridge, the defendant exhibited slurred speech and was unsteady on his feet. There was also an odor of alcoholic beverage about the defendant's person, and his eyes were red and glassy. Apparently, the defendant claimed that he had not been driving. Shepherd arrested the defendant for possessing the contraband recovered from under the bridge and transported him to the McCracken County jail. Before leaving Illinois, Shepherd read the defendant his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights (\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966) ) and questioned him about the contraband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 10 At the McCracken County jail, after Shepherd was advised that Warren had identified the defendant as the driver of the truck, Shepherd cited him for driving under the influence of alcohol and administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test. Shepherd testified that the defendant had refused to submit to further field sobriety tests and had also refused to submit to chemical testing of his blood, breath, or urine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 11 It was undisputed that all of the law enforcement officers who responded to the collision on the Brookport Bridge believed that the accident had occurred within Kentucky's jurisdiction. Jones testified that prior to \"this case,\" there had been \"an agreement with Illinois to where Kentucky would police every bit of the bridge[,] and Illinois would conduct maintenance on every bit of the bridge.\" Jones indicated that the agreement as to the policing of the entire bridge had been abandoned after the Kentucky charges against the defendant had been dismissed. Jones acknowledged that he had \"never seen a written agreement\" and had only been advised of the agreement's existence. The agreement had nevertheless provided \"the assumptions\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   that the officers had previously \"operated upon.\" Jones testified that the Kentucky charges against the defendant had been dismissed on jurisdictional grounds based on \"the case law\" regarding \"the low[-]water mark\" of the Ohio River. Jones indicated that there were now signs on the bridge \"delineating where that mark is.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 12 Shepherd testified that he had worked for the McCracken County sheriff's department for 21 years and that \"up until this case,\" the curve in the bridge had historically been considered Kentucky's jurisdiction. Shepherd explained that he had personally \"worked numerous collisions in that curve,\" but the McCracken County sheriff's department did not work them anymore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 13 Following the hearing on the defendant's motion to suppress, the parties submitted memorandums in support of their respective positions regarding the evidence that had been obtained by the Kentucky officers. Referencing sections 107-3 and 107-4 of Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 ( 725 ILCS 5/107-3, 107-4 (West 2014)), the defendant emphasized that the present case did not involve a \"fresh pursuit\" situation and that the Kentucky officers had exercised authority that \"went well beyond the authority that a private citizen would have in making a citizen[']s arrest.\" The defendant argued that \"[a]ll of the actions of the Kentucky officers were improper, if not illegal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 14 In response, the State maintained, among other things, that even assuming that the defendant's extraterritorial arrest had resulted in a violation of his constitutional rights, suppression of the evidence obtained by the Kentucky officers was not warranted under the \"good faith\" principles generally recognized in\n   <em>\n    People v. LeFlore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20IL%20116799\">\n    2015 IL 116799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=392%20Ill.%20Dec.%20467\">\n    392 Ill.Dec. 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20N.E.3d%201043\">\n    32 N.E.3d 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The State asserted that all of the officers who had responded to the defendant's accident had acted with a good-faith belief that the accident had occurred in Kentucky. The State also noted that signs designating the Illinois-Kentucky border had since been erected on the Brookport Bridge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 15 In March 2018, the circuit court entered a written order finding that all of the officers who had responded to the defendant's accident had \"believed that the Kentucky officers had jurisdiction of any incident that occurred on the Brookport Bridge,\" which \"was a mistake of fact.\" The court found that because of that mistake of fact, the Kentucky officers had taken charge of the accident scene. The court determined that the Kentucky officers' authority to make an arrest in Illinois was the limited authority afforded a private citizen pursuant to section 107-3. See\n   <em>\n    People v. Lahr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3278549\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/147/379/\">\n    147 Ill. 2d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=168%20Ill.%20Dec.%20139\">\n    168 Ill.Dec. 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=589%20N.E.2d%20539\">\n    589 N.E.2d 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). The court concluded that a private citizen could have arrested and questioned him with respect to the contraband he had thrown from the bridge but could not have subsequently detained and questioned him at the McCracken County jail. The court therefore granted the defendant's motion to suppress with respect to the evidence, \"including the officer's observations,\" obtained at the jail and denied the motion with respect to the cannabis, the drug paraphernalia, and the questioning and observations that had occurred in Illinois. The court did not address the State's argument that the suppression of the evidence was not warranted because the officers had acted in good faith. In April 2018, the State filed a certificate of substantial impairment and a timely notice of appeal pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 604(a)(1) (eff. July 1, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 16 DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 17 At the outset, we note that the State does not challenge the circuit court's\n   finding that the Kentucky officers exceeded the statutory authority that they had under the circumstances. The State also concedes for the sake of its argument on appeal that the defendant's extraterritorial arrest violated the fourth amendment and that the exclusionary rule applies. But see\n   <em>\n    People v. Fitzpatrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20IL%20113449\">\n    2013 IL 113449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20 n.1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=369%20Ill.%20Dec.%20527\">\n    369 Ill.Dec. 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=986%20N.E.2d%201163\">\n    986 N.E.2d 1163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The State's sole assertion is that by rejecting its contention that \"the present case falls squarely under the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule,\" the circuit court erred in suppressing the evidence that was obtained while the defendant was incarcerated in the McCracken County jail. In response, primarily relying on our supreme court's decision in\n   <em>\n    People v.

Const. 1970, art.

Thus, \"the majority resolved the case by applying the void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   doctrine and declined to address the good-faith exception due to its belief that application of the good-faith exception would be counter to the void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Because the void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   doctrine is not implicated in the present case,\n   <em>\n    Carrera\n   </em>\n   did not preclude the circuit court's application of the good-faith exception. We therefore reject the defendant's suggestion that the circuit court was right to ignore the State's argument that the officers who responded to his accident had acted with a good-faith belief that the accident had occurred in Kentucky's jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 28 Turning to the merits of the State's claim, as previously indicated, although\n   Myrick and Hines were the first officers to arrive at the scene of the defendant's accident, they did not assume control of the situation. Instead, they assisted Jones and Shepherd, who did assume control. Jones testified that prior to \"this case,\" there had been an agreement between Illinois and Kentucky providing that \"Kentucky would police every bit of the bridge[,] and Illinois would conduct maintenance on every bit of the bridge.\" Shepherd testified that he had worked for the McCracken County sheriff's department for 21 years and that \"up until this case,\" the curve in the bridge where the defendant's accident occurred had historically been considered Kentucky's jurisdiction. Shepherd further indicated that the McCracken County sheriff's department had been dispatched to the Illinois side of the bridge to work \"numerous collisions in that curve\" while the agreement was in effect. Jones explained that after the McCracken County charges against the defendant had been dismissed, signs had been placed on the bridge delineating the boundary between Kentucky and Illinois, and the agreement had been terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 29 Although it is not clear whether the agreement was formal or informal, it appears that prior to this case, the agreement had amicably governed the jurisdiction of the Brookport Bridge for at least 21 years without ever being questioned or challenged. Because the agreement represented the relevant legal landscape that existed at the time, all of the officers who responded to the defendant's accident believed that Kentucky had jurisdiction over any incident that occurred on the bridge. Mistaken or not, that belief was objectively reasonable, because prior to this case, Kentucky had been exercising such jurisdiction. Furthermore, while the agreement was in effect, there were no signs on the bridge marking the territorial boundary line between Kentucky and Illinois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 30 Under the circumstances, all of the officers who responded to the defendant's accident acted with an objectively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct was lawful, and by merely responding to the accident and working it as they had always worked accidents on the bridge, none would have suspected otherwise. They also acted as well-trained officers would be expected to act; the officers from Kentucky who were dispatched to handle the accident responded and took charge, and the Brookport officers who responded to assist had generously assisted. The officers did not deliberately violate the defendant's rights and only later learned that he had been subject to an extraterritorial arrest. A reasonably well-trained officer would not have believed that his or her conduct was improper under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 31 On appeal, the defendant intimates that because\n   <em>\n    Illinois v. Kentucky\n   </em>\n   was decided nearly 30 years ago, a reasonably well-trained officer should have known that because Kentucky's northern border did not extend past the Ohio River's low-water mark as it was in 1792, the curve in the Brookport Bridge was Illinois territory. The defendant relatedly argues that the present case demonstrates recurring negligence on the part of the police. We disagree. Not only do the defendant's claims suggest that the responding officers had a duty to determine whether\n   <em>\n    Illinois v. Kentucky\n   </em>\n   affected the validity of the longstanding agreement regarding the policing of the bridge, it presumes that\n   <em>\n    Illinois v. Kentucky\n   </em>\n   worked to immediately dissolve the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 32 Although it is axiomatic that a reasonably well-trained officer would be expected to know the boundaries of the areas that he or she is ordered to police, the officer does not establish those boundaries and does not have the authority\n   to do so. Police officers are \"entitled to rely on traditional sources for the factual information on which they decide and act\" (\n   <em>\n    Scheuer v. Rhodes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84435\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/232/#p246\">\n    416 U.S. 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 246,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84435\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/232/#p246\">\n    94 S.Ct. 1683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84435\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/232/#p246\">\n    40 L.Ed.2d 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974) ), which would necessarily include boundary markers and signs. Police officers are further entitled to rely on information received from their dispatchers (\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Workman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276122\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/1313/#p1320\">\n    863 F.3d 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1320-21 (10th Cir. 2017) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Kentucky\n   </em>\n   might have changed the legal landscape that had been governed by agreement, nor was it their responsibility to locate and mark the Illinois-Kentucky boundary line on the Brookport Bridge. See 605 ILCS 5/2-202, 4-201.12 (West 2014); 625 ILCS 5/11-301, 11-303 (West 2014);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ky.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20189.010\">\n    Ky.

Moreover, pursuant to the Supreme Court's decree, the maps and coordinates that might have assisted an officer's attempt to locate the boundary line were presented to the governmental authorities who were specifically named in the decree. It was seemingly incumbent on those authorities to anticipate any jurisdictional issues that might have arisen in the immediate wake of the Court's decision and to resolve, as they apparently did here, those that might later arise. As the State suggests, however, not only did the Court's decision not work to immediately dissolve the longstanding agreement regarding the policing of the Brookport Bridge, given that the Court's decree gave Kentucky and Illinois concurrent jurisdiction over the Ohio River, the decree might have been viewed as facially validating the agreement. But see\n   <em>\n    Bedell v.

We also note that even assuming that the Kentucky officers who responded to the defendant's accident had reason to question their informed belief that they had jurisdiction over the entire bridge, when they were dispatched to the bridge to handle the defendant's accident, they had no choice but to comply. \"A police officer does not have the prerogative of actively disobeying an order from a superior while seeking a determination as to the validity of that order.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin v.
