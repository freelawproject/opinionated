SHEEHAN, J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   {\u00b61} Defendant-appellant Scott R. Turner (\"Turner\") appeals from his conviction and sentence imposed by the Cleveland Municipal Court. Following a bench trial, Turner was found guilty of one count of sexual conduct with an animal (bestiality) in violation of R.C. 959.21(B). The court sentenced Turner to 90 days in jail, with credit for 17 days served, and a $ 750 fine. The court suspended the fine and 73 days in jail, pending completion of five years of inactive community control. Conditions of community control included (1) no contact with animals; and (2) random home inspections conducted by the Animal Protective League (\"APL\"). For the reasons that follow, we affirm the conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Procedural History and Substantive Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b62} Scott Turner was a parolee under the supervision of Jason Stasenko, parole supervisor for the sex offender unit of the adult parole authority. On May 25, 2017, Stasenko received from Hamilton County prison officials a sexually explicit letter detailing a sexual act with an animal. The letter that was intercepted by prison officials was written by Turner and mailed to\n   Turner's incarcerated boyfriend, Robert Mayberry, who was in prison on charges relating to sexual conduct against minors. The next day, Stasenko arrested Turner for violation of his parole. During an investigation, officers discovered additional letters at Turner's home. On September 21, 2017, the city charged Turner with bestiality in violation of R.C. 959.21(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b63} Defendant filed a motion in limine to prohibit the introduction of his extrajudicial statement (made through the initial letter to his boyfriend) absent proof of the offense. The trial court denied Turner's motion, and the matter proceeded to a bench trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b64} The city presented the testimony of the parole supervisor, Stasenko, and the owner of the animal victim, Valerie Lightner. The city also admitted into evidence three letters written by Turner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b65} Stasenko identified all three letters admitted at trial as letters written by Turner. He testified that the city's exhibit No. 1 was the letter the Hamilton County parole authority intercepted and forwarded to Stasenko, and the other two letters, exhibit Nos. 2 and 3, were letters that were confiscated at Turner's home at the time of the arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Exhibit No. 1 Dated 5-13-17 and 5-15-17\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b66} Exhibit No. 1 is a 20-page letter Turner wrote to his boyfriend, Mayberry. It is dated \"5-13-17,\" with a noted time of \"7:17 p.m.\" The letter contained sexually explicit language with graphic descriptions of sexual acts involving Turner, Mayberry, and a dog:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Hey baby girl [addressing Mayberry], I'm sitting here just thinking of you and wondering what you may be doing. * * * Jovan (my roommate in case you forgot) brought his girl dog over for a bit today and him and his girl went to eat so I ate to[o] and I enjoyed it to[o]. I never knew it could taste so f***ing good baby. Damn I want to do that again but with you f***ing me while I do. Boys are next at the first opportunity I get if I do. It was a 2-year-old boxer and something else but not sure what.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b67} On page 15 in that same letter, which portion is dated \"5-15-17\" and noted with a time of \"6:45 p.m.,\" Turner once again mentioned an animal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   I love when you give details and talk super dirty to[o] describing the sex you want with our little friends with 4 legs and also how we will do them together my love.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Exhibit No. 2 Dated 5-6-17\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b68} Exhibit No. 2 is a letter from Turner to Mayberry that predates exhibit No. 1 and is dated \"5-6-17, 2:00 p.m. - 8:30 p.m.\" In this sexually explicit letter, Turner stated his intention to acquire an animal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   I'll be sure to make it worth your while for sure. * * * I'm looking into getting a 4/legged friend still but it's hard to find the right one to get and then there's the money needed to get it also which I don't have either yet. I have to take care of you baby girl * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Exhibit No. 3, Undated\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b69} Exhibit No 3, an undated sexually explicit letter, stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   One other thing babe. I don't want to share you with another guy. Kay. I need to know if you still want to do that okay. I'll share you with a 4/legged friend though. I'm really looking forward to experiencing that baby girl. I'm sure it will be exciting to have your d*** in my mouth while I'm being pounded out by a friend and to watch you get pounded to with my d*** in your mouth * * * also videoing the sounds * * * and the f***ing between us so I can watch them\n   over and over, babe. You can too okay. * * * How would you like to have a young guy (teen) video us together? That is if you want to do any videoing at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b610} Stasenko testified that he spoke with Turner about exhibit No. 1. Turner admitted writing the letter but denied that any sex act with an animal occurred. According to Stasenko, Turner explained that he only wrote the information about the dog to distract his boyfriend from being sexually interested in boys. Stasenko did not find this explanation credible, and in fact, he stated that Turner's explanation was inconsistent with Turner's explicit references in the letters to engaging children in sexual conduct. Stasenko also testified that he was troubled by Turner's nickname for his penis, referring to it as \"his son.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Valerie Lightner, Dog Owner\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b611} Valerie Lightner testified concerning her dog, a two-year-old female possible pit bull/boxer mix named Athena. She owned the dog since it was nine weeks old. Lightner's boyfriend, Jovan Johnson, rented a room from the defendant. Lightner testified that on May 13, 2017, she drove to the defendant's house, with her dog, to pick up her boyfriend. She stated that it was her boyfriend's birthday and she was picking him up to buy him a birthday present, a skateboard. She was going to leave Athena in her boyfriend's bedroom for a couple of hours while they went out to purchase the skateboard. They would then pick the dog up and go to the skate park. Lightner stated that Turner offered to watch Athena while they were gone, so she agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b612} Lightner testified that when they returned after about two hours to pick up Athena, the dog ran straight to Lightner and her boyfriend and cowered by them, which was very unusual. Lightner stated that Athena is usually \"excited, jumping, happy to see you, happy that everyone is together [because] she really likes people so she likes being together with them.\" But on this afternoon, according to Lightner, her dog seemed scared. Lightner testified that Turner told her the dog \"just laid down with him in bed for the duration of the time that we were gone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b613} Lightner and her boyfriend put Athena in the car and drove to the skate park as planned. However, while at the park, Athena was acting unusual and again cowering behind Lightner, was skittish, and was barking. Because of the dog's unusual behavior, Lightner and her boyfriend brought Athena home after only 20 minutes at the park. They later canceled dinner reservations because the dog continued acting strangely, whining and licking her genitals excessively. Athena continued to \"aggressively\" lick her genitals and remained skittish around noises for several days. At the time of trial, she remained uncomfortable with anyone near her backside. In fact, as Lightner testified, Athena now required special care during a veterinarian examination, because she \"whimpers when someone is trying to insert [a rectal thermometer ] and will try to scoot away from them.\" Lightner testified that all of this behavior was highly unusual of Athena, and prior to the incident in May, Athena \"had no issues with boundaries with people\" and never had a problem with a rectal thermometer being used on her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b614} Finally, Lightner testified that she did not seek treatment for Athena after the incident because \"[i]t didn't seem like it was a life or death situation at the moment\" and the dog's behavior began to improve after a few days. She also stated that the costs for sedating Athena for an examination was part of the reason she did not seek treatment. Lightner first became aware of a possible issue with the defendant when Stasenko contacted her. Lightner\n   said she never would have suspected that something like this would have happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b615} At the conclusion of the evidence, defense counsel renewed his objection to the admission of the exhibits, arguing the state presented insufficient independent evidence of corpus delicti. Defense counsel also moved the court for a Crim.R. 29 dismissal. The court denied both motions and found Turner guilty of the offense charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b616} Turner appealed his conviction and sentence, assigning four errors for our review, which we will discuss out of order for ease of discussion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   I. There was insufficient evidence to permit a reasonable trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Scott Turner violated R.C. 959.21(B).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   II. Scott Turner's conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   III. The trial court erred and violated Scott Turner's due process rights by admitting Turner's extrajudicial statements into evidence without the prosecution having first established the \"corpus delicti\" of the crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   IV. The trial court erred and violated Scott Turner's due process rights by granting a private non-profit entity the right to conduct random, suspicionless searches of Turner's private residence for five years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Corpus Delicti\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b617} In his third assignment of error, Turner contends that the court erred in admitting his extrajudicial statements without independent evidence of a crime. In support, he argues that the city failed to establish the corpus delicti to permit introduction of his purported confession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b618} We note initially that the trial court is afforded wide discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence and this court will not reverse a trial court's decision on the admission of evidence absent an abuse of that discretion.\n   <em>\n    Cleveland v.

Only after staying with Turner, Athena became skittish around people and began aggressively licking her genitals. This behavior had never occurred before staying with Turner.

As discussed in the previous assignment of error, the statute prohibits a person from \"knowingly engag[ing] in sexual conduct with an animal.\" R.C. 959.21(B). \"Sexual conduct\" includes any act involving contact of the penis of one and the vulva of another, the penis of one and the anus of another, the mouth of one and the anus or vulva of the other, or insertion of a reproductive organ of one into an orifice of the other. R.C. 959.21(A)(4)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b637} Here, the city presented three letters Turner wrote to his boyfriend, a sexual offender, in prison. All of the letters are sexually explicit and contain graphic details of various sex acts. In a letter dated May 6, 2017, in the midst of discussing sex with his boyfriend, Turner expressed a desire to acquire an animal, stating, \"I'm looking into getting a 4/legged friend * * * but it's hard to find the right one to get and then there's the money needed. * * * I have to take care of you baby girl.\" In an undated letter, Turner told his boyfriend that he does not want to share him with another guy, but he would \"share [him] with a 4/legged friend\" and that he was \"really looking forward to experiencing that.\" Immediately thereafter, Turner proceeded to graphically describe various sexual scenarios. In a third letter, in a portion dated May 13, 2017, \"7:17 p.m.,\" Turner described an experience he had with a dog that his roommate, Jovan, brought home:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Jovan * * * brought his girl dog over for a bit today and him and his girl went to eat so I ate to[o] and I enjoyed it to[o].

Her boyfriend, Jovan, is Turner's roommate. Lightner testified that she left her dog alone with Turner for a couple of hours in the afternoon of May 13, 2017. Turner told Lightner that he and the dog laid in Turner's bed the entire time Lightner was gone. Lightner testified that when she picked up the dog from Turner's place, the dog ran to her and cowered in fear behind her, which was very unusual behavior for the dog. For the next several days, the dog licked her genitals excessively, she was skittish around noises, and she barked at people, which was all unusual behavior for Lightner's dog. Finally, Lightner testified that her dog was no longer comfortable with a veterinarian examination and rectal thermometer insertion. After her stay with Turner, she began to whimper and cower, covering her backside, when anyone approached her behind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b639} Viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that a rational trier of fact could conclude that Turner engaged in sexual conduct with a dog.

In support, Turner reiterates his sufficiency argument and remarks upon Lightner's testimony, arguing that Lightner did not suspect sexual abuse until the parole supervisor contacted her, nor did she seek medical attention for her dog's purportedly unusual behavior. Additionally, while Turner concedes he wrote the letters, he claims that the statement concerning the dog was fantastical, or imaginary, and was designed to distract his boyfriend from thinking about engaging in sexual acts with children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b646} We cannot find the factfinder lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice in this case. First, having overruled the sufficiency arguments, we need not consider them here. Second, Turner's argument essentially attacks the credibility of the dog owner, questioning the authenticity\n   of Lightner's observations of Athena's behavior and the timing of Lightner's concern. We are mindful, however, of the factfinder's role in assessing witness credibility. The record shows that Lightner did observe that something was wrong with her dog, and in response to Athena's uncharacteristically odd behavior, Lightner removed her from stressful situations, cancelled dinner plans, and cared for Athena in a way that she believed was appropriate under the circumstances. Noting that the matter was not one of \"life and death,\" Lightner did not seek medical treatment for Athena. It is likely that the factfinder considered the highly unusual factual scenario in evaluating Lightner's reaction to her dog's behavior and the fact that she did not immediately suspect sexual abuse, which it is free to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b647} It is also within the factfinder's discretion to disbelieve Turner's explanation for his statement concerning Lightner's dog. Although the letters contain many references to Turner's desire to perform certain sexual acts with his boyfriend in the future, the statement in the May 13 letter describes with vivid detail an act that occurred earlier in the day on May 13 with a \"2-year-old boxer.\" And Lightner's testimony corroborates these details. Furthermore, Turner's letters include references to engaging children in sexual conduct, stating \"boys are next at the first opportunity I get\" and offering to have a \"young guy (teen)\" videotape Turner and his boyfriend engaging in sexual acts.

Turner contends that the trial court's home inspection condition violates R.C. 2951.02(A), because (1) he has no probation officer, because he is on inactive probation; (2) the APL is not an authorized probation officer with the authority to conduct the searches of Turner's home; and (3) the random searches would violate his constitutional right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b651} R.C. 2951.02(A) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   During the period of a misdemeanor offender's community control sanction * * *, authorized probation officers who are engaged within the scope of their supervisory duties or responsibilities may search, with or without a warrant * * * real property in which the offender has a right, title, or interest * * * if the probation officers have reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is not abiding by the law or otherwise is not complying with the conditions of the misdemeanor offender's community control sanction * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b652} Thus, R.C. 2951.02(A) authorizes warrantless searches during an offender's misdemeanor community control where, for example, an officer who conducts the search possesses \"reasonable grounds\" to believe that the probationer has failed to comply with the terms of his or her probation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The statute therefore provides limitations on the \"authorized probation officers\" who conduct a search of a probationer's person or property in the course of\n   their duties. It does not limit, nor does it address, the trial court's ability to fashion an appropriate sentence for an offender.

The condition concerning random home inspections conducted by the APL has an obvious relationship to the crime for which Turner was convicted in that the APL will help ensure that Turner has no contact with animals or engages in sexual conduct with an animal. The condition is also reasonably related to rehabilitating Turner, since he will presumably be able to own animals, including dogs, once he has completed his community control. And the condition relates to future criminality and serves the statutory ends of community control since the home inspections will ensure that Turner has little opportunity to engage in sexual conduct with animals during the term of his community control. Thus, we find the condition satisfies the\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   test. Finally, we do not find the condition allowing random home inspections to be overly broad. Turner is prohibited\n   from having contact with animals. And the record shows that Turner did not object to this condition. The home inspections would be conducted by the APL for the specific purpose of ensuring that Turner is not in contact with any animals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b658} To the extent the defendant claims the APL is a private entity not authorized to conduct searches of Turner's home, we find no merit. We note initially that Turner did not object to the APL's involvement. At sentencing, defense counsel advised the court that Turner is subject to periodic inspections as a condition of his parole, and he offered that the APL could contact Turner's parole officer with any need to conduct an inspection for animals in order to avoid duplicative inspections:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   [Turner] has no objection to and would agree to any - no contact, no ownership of any kind. He currently has no pets. He has no desire in the near future to own a pet. We would ask that the court not grant intrusive home inspection. He is on post release control for a period of five years until * * * May 3, 2021 * * *. And they do periodic inspections.

But the crime Turner committed in this case is a new offense deserving of a separate punishment.

State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12357416\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/76/841/\">\n    76 N.E.3d 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ind.2017), as the basis for why appellant's letters were admissible. I think that case is distinguishable on its facts. While the court in\n   <em>\n    Shinnock\n   </em>\n   found \"ample\" circumstantial evidence of bestiality as the basis for concluding the defendant's confession was admissible, such evidence is not present here. In\n   <em>\n    Shinnock\n   </em>\n   , the dog did not greet its owner as usual as it had been shut in the defendant's bedroom with the defendant. When the owner opened the door, the dog immediately and atypically ran and hid under a couch. The floor was covered in dog feces which was also unusual. Most significantly, the defendant was found in his underwear and with an erection. The court thus found that the corpus delicti was established: these facts \"suffice[d] to demonstrate that both the dog was a victim and that [the defendant] committed the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12357416\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/76/841/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12357416\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/76/841/\">\n    at 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The only similarity that\n   <em>\n    Shinnock\n   </em>\n   bears with this case that both contain evidence that the dog behaved atypically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b671} Without evidence that the appellant committed a crime or expert testimony to establish that a sexual act did occur, the appellant's writings to his incarcerated partner, however distasteful they may be, should not have been admitted and without which, no conviction should stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b672} Further, I take issue with the trial court's sentencing order which includes the condition on his five-year term of inactive probation that \"APL permitted random inspection.\" This allows employees of the Cleveland Animal Protective League, a private nonprofit agency to enter the appellant's home. I recognize that agents of the APL, as a humane society, have authority, under Chapter 1717 of the Ohio Revised Code to arrest persons found violating that Chapter but there is no authority provided for them to enter a private home for inspection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   {\u00b673} The appellant was placed on inactive probation, a legal fiction. As a condition of such supervision, a probation officer, as a sworn officer of the court, may gain warrantless entry to a person's home. To grant a private citizen this same authority is unconscionable.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
