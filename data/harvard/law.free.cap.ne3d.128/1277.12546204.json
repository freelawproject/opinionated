A jury found him guilty of murder, among other things, and sentenced him to life without parole for that crime. Cardosi now directly appeals five issues, arguing that (I) insufficient evidence supported his convictions for auto theft and felony murder, (II) the trial court failed to properly admonish the jurors each time they were separated, (III) the trial court improperly admitted his co-conspirator's post-crime text messages, (IV) the trial court erred by reading a withdrawn accomplice liability instruction, and (V) the trial court improperly considered a non-statutory aggravator when sentencing him to life without parole. Finding each contention without merit, we affirm the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Ricky Thomas, along with his girlfriend Kim Spears and friend Justin Babbs, lived with his Grandma. From time to time, Sebastian Wedding, another of Ricky's friends, lived there too. Wedding's friend Derrick Cardosi lived in an apartment across the street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   One August night, Wedding sent a text message to Cardosi saying that he could get marijuana, with Cardosi responding, \"maybe tomorrow bro haha.\" St. Ex. 125. The next morning, at about six or six thirty, Grandma heard Ricky and Kim talking through a shared bedroom wall, with Kim at one point saying, \"Ricky no.\" Tr. Vol. IV, p. 20. Thinking nothing of it, Grandma went back to sleep. Around this time, Wedding and Cardosi exchanged a couple of text messages (later deleted), with Wedding asking if Cardosi was \"a go\" and telling him that a door was open and that he should \"go to work.\" St. Ex. 124. The two also traded several phone calls during these early morning hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When Grandma woke up a few hours later, she went out to the living room to find Justin unresponsive, his head and arm covered with blood. Grandma knocked on Ricky's door to get assistance, but no one responded. Grandma then tried to call for help, but her phone didn't work. Because an oxygen tank hobbled her mobility, Grandma waited outside her home for help from any passersby. While waiting, she noticed that Ricky's 1997 Mercury Grand Marquis was gone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Around that time, Cardosi (wearing black shoes with gray soles and a black, cut-off t-shirt reading \"Please, KEEP ON THE GRASS\") and Wedding entered a Dollar General store and bought a package of Hanes tank tops, two pairs of pants, slippers, and Pampers baby wipes. A few minutes later, Wedding and Cardosi arrived at a nearby gas station in Ricky's car. Wedding, who was driving, parked the car and put the gas pump nozzle into the car's gas tank. Cardosi then got out of the car and returned the nozzle to its holder before opening the trunk and putting two plastic bags inside. After two friends met them there, Cardosi got back into the passenger side of the car, and Wedding then drove them to a nearby lake to hangout. There, while Wedding and one of the friends were speaking alone, Cardosi texted to ask if he was telling the friend \"anything [a]bout today.\" St. Ex. 126. Wedding replied \"No.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When Cardosi later returned to the neighborhood where he and Grandma lived, Wedding asked what was happening \"over there.\" St. Ex. 127. Cardosi responded \"nothing since\" he had gotten back.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Meanwhile, Grandma had flagged down a couple of teenage neighbors passing by. Seeing her in shock, the teenagers ran into the house and called 911 to report that Justin wasn't breathing, had blood all over his body, and that a \"chunk\" was missing from his neck. Tr. Vol. III, p. 34. When emergency personnel arrived, EMTs confirmed that Justin was dead.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A police officer then kicked open Ricky's bedroom door and found Kim and Ricky's lifeless bodies inside. Blood was spattered across the walls and the police saw a pry bar next to a cracked-open safe. Ricky's cell phone was also in the room, with the last activity showing a text message sent around midnight. A text message from around ten that morning hadn't been read. The officer found no signs of forced entry into the home but noted that one of the exterior doors was unlocked. Post-mortem examinations showed Ricky, Kim, and Justin each died from multiple stab wounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As the investigation unfolded, Cardosi and Wedding exchanged a flurry of text messages. Cardosi informed Wedding that there was a \"[l]ot of activity this way now.\" St. Ex. 127. Wedding responded that they needed to dispose \"of that car like now,\" with Cardosi replying that they'd \"get rid of it tonight.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Later, when Wedding asked for a ride, Cardosi responded that \"cops have [the neighborhood] almost locked down.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After assuring Wedding that \"we all know [you]\" didn't commit the murders, Cardosi hoped Wedding had found \"somewhere safe for now\" and that he wouldn't \"tell anyone where\" he was.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Cardosi urged Wedding to \"remember\" that since he hadn't \"been [at Grandma's house] since yesterday,\" there was \"no way\" he could be involved in the murders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Wedding responded that he was at his grandparents' house and confirmed that he had disposed of the car in a nearby cul-de-sac. As the two ended text messaging for\n   the night, Cardosi told Wedding that \"no one knows anything,\" and that Grandma \"says there was no one else in the house.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After Wedding \"thank[ed] god\" for this news, Cardosi concluded that the police didn't \"have any murder weapons yet.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During that text-messaging spree, Wedding's ex-girlfriend visited him at his grandparents' house. While there, Wedding, acting strangely and nervously, offered her gas money and jewelry. This ex-girlfriend then noticed Ricky's car and, after observing Wedding's behavior and learning that Ricky had been murdered, called 911 to report her suspicion that Wedding had killed him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A few hours later, police arrested Wedding at his grandparents' house, seizing his cell phone in the process. Officers found Ricky's car in the nearby cul-de-sac, just a three-minute walk from his grandparents' house. In and around the car, officers found a Dollar General bag, a price tag for shoes, a package of Pampers baby wipes, Hanes tank top packaging, two black shoes with gray soles, a black rubber glove, and a black, cut-off t-shirt reading \"Please, KEEP ON THE GRASS.\" Officers also found a cell phone likely belonging to Ricky's mother, a white plastic bag, a red bandana, a paper towel, a cloth, a pair of sweatpants, a black hooded sweatshirt, bloody sheathed knives belonging to Cardosi and his roommate, a camouflage jacket, and a grey bandana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The next day, officers arrested Cardosi at his home and seized his cell phone too. The phone revealed that, in the days after the deaths, Cardosi had visited numerous websites with stories about the three homicides, the police investigation, the victims' autopsies, and Wedding's arrest. Although Cardosi eventually acknowledged that he and Wedding had talked about what to do with Ricky's car on the day the bodies were found, he denied having anything to do with the deaths. But inside Cardosi's home, officers found a bloodstained bedsheet and a box of black rubber gloves. Forensic testing later showed DNA profile matches for Ricky, Kim, Justin, and Cardosi on that sheet and the items found in and around Ricky's car: blood on the\n   <strong>\n    sheet\n   </strong>\n   matched Justin's profile; the\n   <strong>\n    knives\n   </strong>\n   found near the car had blood with DNA consistent with Justin, Kim, Ricky, and Cardosi; blood on the\n   <strong>\n    black rubber gloves\n   </strong>\n   found near the car had DNA consistent with Justin and Ricky; blood on the\n   <strong>\n    black shoes with gray soles\n   </strong>\n   had DNA consistent with Cardosi, Justin, Ricky, and Kim; blood on the black\n   <strong>\n    \"Please, KEEP ON THE GRASS\" t-shirt\n   </strong>\n   had DNA consistent with Ricky; and blood on the\n   <strong>\n    sweatpants\n   </strong>\n   had DNA consistent with Cardosi, Ricky, Kim, and Justin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The State then charged Cardosi with (1) murder, knowing or intentional killing of Justin; (2) murder, knowing or intentional killing of Ricky; (3) murder, knowing or intentional killing of Kim; (4) assisting a criminal (Wedding) by communicating police actions at the crime scene; (5) assisting a criminal (Wedding) by disposing of evidence; (6) auto theft of Ricky's vehicle; (7) theft of a gaming system and electronic tablet found in the back of the Grand Marquis; (8) felony murder of Ricky while committing or attempting burglary; and (9) felony murder of Ricky while committing or attempting robbery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2035-42-1-1\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7\u00a7 35-42-1-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), 35-44.1-2-5(a)(2) (2016), 35-43-4-2.5(b)(1) (2014), 35-43-4-2(a) (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A jury trial followed, with the theft charge being dropped. After voir dire, during preliminary instructions, and several times during the trial (but not every time the jurors separated), the court admonished the jurors that, while they could discuss the case in the juror room together, they couldn't talk about the case in any other instance. During the trial, and over\n   Cardosi's objection, the trial court admitted the text messages Cardosi exchanged with Wedding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the end of the trial, while the court read the final instructions, counsel for the State and Cardosi asked to discuss an instruction. After the jury left the courtroom, Cardosi asked the court to supplement a not-yet-given instruction on accomplice liability. The State, however, suggested removing the accomplice liability instruction altogether. Cardosi agreed to the removal after consulting with counsel. The court, in turn, agreed to omit any reference to accomplice liability. But after reconvening the jury and continuing with the final instructions, the court inadvertently read one of the withdrawn instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After concluding giving its final instructions to the jury, and after the jurors retired to deliberate, the trial court acknowledged its mistake but noted that the instruction was omitted \"from the written instructions we're going to give the jury.\" Tr. Vol. V, p. 129. Cardosi then objected, noting his belief that the instruction \"didn't properly advise on the elements of intent of the principal and the agent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2035-42-1-1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In response, the court opined that the instruction said \"nothing about\" convicting Cardosi as an accomplice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2035-42-1-1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The trial court concluded that, although it \"would have liked to have avoided\" reading it, its reading was harmless because it didn't \"direct the jury to do anything that has to do with the case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2035-42-1-1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2035-42-1-1\">\n    at 130, 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The jury then found Cardosi guilty of all the crimes charged. At the sentencing portion of trial, the State sought life without parole for the murder convictions. Along with incorporating all the evidence from the guilt phase, the State presented evidence that Cardosi had possessed marijuana stolen from Ricky's house and that Wedding had intended to sell that marijuana and the electronic devices found in the car. To the detective presenting this evidence, this was a \"classic example of a burglary or robbery case where subjects enter a residence, take something from the residence[,] and leave.\" Tr. Vol. V, p. 141.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Ultimately, the jury determined that the State proved the existence of three statutory aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, finding that Cardosi committed murder by intentionally killing the victims (1) while committing or attempting to commit burglary, (2) while committing or attempting to commit robbery, and (3) when he had committed another murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.C. \u00a7 35-50-2-9(b)(1)(B), (b)(1)(G), (b)(8) (2016). After resolving this, the jurors found that the aggravators outweighed any mitigators, and recommended a life sentence without parole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.C. \u00a7 35-50-2-9(l).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The court, after merging the felony-murder convictions with the knowing/intentional murder verdicts, then sentenced Cardosi consistent with this binding recommendation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.C. \u00a7 35-50-2-9(e). When imposing this sentence, the trial court adopted the mitigators offered by Cardosi, including his age, his minor child, his family's hardship, and his inability to recover from drug abuse. Along with the statutory aggravators found by the jury, the trial court considered the \"brutality of these offenses of murder.\" Tr. Vol. V, p. 176.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Cardosi objected to this consideration, the trial court replied that it was\n   merely addressing the \"[m]ultiple offenses\" of murder.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2035-42-1-1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Cardosi now directly appeals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ind.

We address both convictions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Sufficient evidence supports Cardosi's auto-theft conviction.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A defendant is guilty of auto theft if he \"knowingly or intentionally exerts unauthorized control over the motor vehicle of another person, with intent to deprive the owner of ... the vehicle's value or use.\" I.C. \u00a7 35-43-4-2.5(b)(1). Ordinarily, \"an individual's mere presence as a passenger in a stolen automobile\" can't support a conviction for auto theft.\n   <em>\n    Irvin v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11033943\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/501/1139/#p1140\">\n    501 N.E.2d 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1140 (Ind. Ct.

But even in cases with no \"direct evidence that [a defendant] was ever behind the wheel of\" a stolen car, we will affirm an auto-theft conviction if other substantial evidence supports it.\n   <em>\n    Alvies v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7242608\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/905/57/#p62\">\n    905 N.E.2d 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 62 (Ind. Ct. App. 2009) (holding that a reasonable jury could conclude that the defendant was guilty of auto theft when he \"took part in the initial burglary,\" \"rode in the car on the way to the woods,\" and \"was in the car when it left the scene of the murder\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Cardosi argues that the State provided no evidence that he stole Ricky's Grand Marquis. Instead, Cardosi insists, only Wedding could be charged with auto theft because it was found near\n   <strong>\n    his\n   </strong>\n   grandparents' house and surveillance footage showed\n   <strong>\n    him\n   </strong>\n   driving the car. The State counters that, despite Wedding driving the vehicle, Cardosi used it for his own purposes without Ricky's permission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Like the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Alvies\n   </em>\n   , no evidence showed Cardosi was \"behind the wheel of\" the stolen vehicle. But, also like\n   the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Alvies\n   </em>\n   , other substantial evidence supports his conviction. Cardosi rode in the Grand Marquis with Wedding to Dollar General, and then to the gas station where they met up with friends. While there, Cardosi put gas in the car, opened the trunk, put bags in the trunk, and closed the trunk. Cardosi then rode in the car with Wedding and the friends to a local lake, where Cardosi texted Wedding about getting rid of the car. Later that night, Cardosi and Wedding again texted about ditching the car, which Wedding had temporarily abandoned in a cul-de-sac near his grandparents' house. When officers found the car, they discovered incriminating evidence in and around it. Finally, after he was in police custody, Cardosi admitted to an investigating officer that he and Wedding discussed how to dispose of the car. Although no evidence shows Cardosi drove the vehicle, substantial evidence supported his conviction for auto theft because he used the car to travel around and to cover up crimes with his co-conspirator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B. We needn't address Cardosi's felony-murder challenge because the court merged those verdicts with his murder convictions.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A defendant commits felony murder if he \"kills another human being while committing or attempting to commit,\" among other things, burglary or robbery. I.C. \u00a7 35-42-1-1(2). The State charged Cardosi with felony murder for killing Ricky while committing burglary and robbery. Cardosi argues that the State failed to provide sufficient evidence to convict him for felony murder because \"there was no evidence\" that he killed Ricky while committing burglary or robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The State contends that Cardosi's challenge fails because the trial court merged Cardosi's felony-murder convictions with the three murder verdicts. We agree. As this Court has held before, when a trial court merges a felony-murder and murder conviction, we don't need to address the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the felony-murder conviction because there is no judgment on that charge.\n   <em>\n    Cutter v.

But strong evidence sustains all his convictions. The day before the murders, Wedding and Cardosi texted about obtaining marijuana the next day. The morning of the murders, they exchanged several early phone calls and texted about whether Cardosi was \"a go,\" with Wedding telling Cardosi to \"go to work.\" Later that day, Cardosi arrived in Ricky's stolen car at Dollar General while wearing clothes that were later found near the abandoned car. While at Dollar General, the two purchased items also later found around the vehicle. Cardosi arrived at a gas station in the stolen car, helped fill it with gas, and placed items into its trunk. After arriving at the lake, Cardosi asked if Wedding was telling a friend \"anything [a]bout today.\" Once the two returned to their homes, Cardosi and Wedding exchanged several texts about the police investigation and the disposal of the car. When police officers discovered the stolen car, they found, along with the clothing and items purchased at Dollar General, bloody knives belonging to Cardosi and his roommate (all the victims died from multiple stab wounds ) and a black, rubber glove (the same style found in Cardosi's house along with a bloody sheet). All these items, including the clothing and items purchased at Dollar General, had DNA matches for either the victims or Cardosi. In the days following the murders, Cardosi used his phone to search the internet almost seventy times for information about the murders. And while in custody, Cardosi admitted to police officers that he and Wedding discussed getting rid of the stolen car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Because this mass of evidence supports each of his convictions-for the murders of Justin, Ricky, and Kim, for assisting Wedding by communicating police action at the crime scene and by disposing of evidence, and for auto theft-no error in giving the accomplice instruction prejudiced Cardosi's substantial rights, so the trial court didn't abuse its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
