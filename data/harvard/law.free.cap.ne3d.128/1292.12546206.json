On August 23, 2019, the Executive Director of the Commission filed a \"Certification of Compliance,\" stating that Respondent has now cooperated with its investigation in this case. Pursuant to Admission and Discipline Rule 23 (10.1)(c)(3), the suspension from the practice of law imposed in this case is terminated as of the date the certification was filed. Respondent, however, is under suspension orders entered in other cases, which remain in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The Court therefore ORDERS that\n   <strong>\n    Respondent's suspension from the practice of law\n    <em>\n     in this case only\n    </em>\n    be shown as terminated as of August 23, 2019.\n   </strong>\n   Respondent's suspension ordered in other cases remains in effect, and Respondent shall not be shown as reinstated to the practice of law in this state until all causes for suspension are cured.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
