The commission concurred with a determination of ODJFS, Office of Unemployment Compensation. Appellant-appellee, Denise V. Lancaster, had a claim for unemployment compensation benefits which ODJFS disallowed based on its finding that her employer, Cheek Law Offices, LLC (\"CLO\"), terminated her employment for just cause. We affirm the judgment of the common pleas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} CLO is a law firm with offices located on the 12th floor of the Motorists Insurance Building (\"Motorists Building\") in Columbus, Ohio. Lancaster began working at CLO on July 25, 2016 as a skip tracer. The Motorists Building is a secured building. Employees are issued an identification badge which grants them access to the main ingress/egress and their work space and the elevator. For example, employees of CLO are granted access to the building, the elevator, and the 12th floor. The elevator provides access to the lobby of any floor in the building. However, the identification badge does not grant access to the offices on any other floor. The building has 21 floors and the executive offices of Motorists Insurance are on the 21st floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On October 18, 2016, Lancaster used the elevator during her lunch break to go to the 21st floor of the Motorists Building. The general manager of CLO, Toni Cheek, testified that its employees are \"free to do what they want\" during their lunch breaks. (Feb. 27, 2017 Record of Proceedings at E2686-T86.) Lancaster testified that she believed she had permission to enter the 21st floor because other people who worked in the building encouraged her to visit the 21st floor to see the view and meet the friendly people who work on that floor. Lancaster attempted to use her identification badge to open the office doors to the 21st floor, but it did not work. The chief legal officer, Marchelle Moore, employed at Motorists Insurance exited the restroom and approached Lancaster. Cheek testified that the lawyer asked Lancaster several questions and Lancaster was evasive in her answers. Lancaster testified that an administrative assistant, Kay Powell, came to the door at almost the same time as the lawyer. Powell escorted Lancaster around the floor and permitted her to take pictures of the view with her phone. Powell gave Lancaster her telephone number and told Lancaster that she could visit anytime with a prior telephone call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Lancaster testified she did not spend much time on the 21st floor because she was in a hurry with just a few minutes left during her lunchtime. As Lancaster was leaving, a security guard arrived in\n   the elevator. As she descended to the 12th floor, he asked her what she was doing and she replied that she was visiting another employee during her lunch break. Lancaster testified the security guard told her he had seen her on the security camera. She returned to work, and he continued down in the elevator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The next day, on October 19, 2016, Lancaster again went to the 21st floor during her lunchtime. Lancaster called Powell on her way up to the 21st floor and left a voicemail message. Powell met Lancaster in the lobby outside the office and informed her it was not a good time for a visit. Lancaster attempted to return to the elevator but was approached by security. Cheek testified that Lancaster took the elevator to the 10th floor instead of the 12th floor. Lancaster stated she forgot to push the correct elevator button. Lancaster testified that she had previously been stalked and, therefore, is hesitant to provide personal information. Since other people were also in the elevator, the security guard's questions made her feel uncomfortable. She exited the elevator on the 10th floor and answered the security guard's questions when they were alone and then she took another elevator to the 12th floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Cheek testified that late in the afternoon on October 18, the director of facilities, Todd Hayward, telephoned her and explained that Lancaster had been on the 21st floor and tried to use her identification badge to access the executive offices. He explained that the Motorists Insurance chief legal counsel saw Lancaster and became upset at Lancaster's evasiveness. Cheek intended to speak to Lancaster about the incident but did not do so before lunchtime on October 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} After Lancaster returned to the 21st floor on October 19, Cheek terminated Lancaster's employment for trespassing on another floor and being evasive when questioned. Cheek terminated Lancaster's employment deeming her a security risk. Cheek testified that Lancaster explained that she had been invited to the 21st floor the second time and that Powell gave her cell phone number to Lancaster in order to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Hayward sent Cheek an email on October 19, 2016, stating the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   I visited with Marchelle Moore and Kay Powell today regarding this. [Moore] is our Chief Legal Officer and [Powell] is her Executive Assistant. According to them, yesterday at approximately 1:10 pm [Lancaster] was standing at the entry door on the 21st floor when [Moore] came out of the women's restroom. [Moore] approached her and proceeded to ask her several questions. Can I help you? Are you an associate? Do you have an appointment? Who do you work for? And so on. [Moore] stated that [Lancaster] would not answer her questions and was being extremely vague. She even said she didn't like to tell people who she worked for. (Yet she shows up unannounced on another floor). During this exchange [Powell] came to the doors and [Moore] stated that she was so irritated she left to let [Powell] handle the situation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [Powell] stated that [Lancaster] indicated that she wanted to look around and that she heard that everyone on the floor was really nice. [Powell], (which she shouldn't have done) allowed her access and escorted her around the floor and showed her around. [Powell] indicated [Lancaster] stated that she had been standing out in the lobby for a while and now she was going to be late getting back from lunch but she would like to come up again another time. [Powell] states she was with [Lancaster] for probably 4-5 minutes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   In speaking with both of them today the words they used to describe the situation was weird and annoying. I hope this helps.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Record of Proceedings at E2686-S74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Lancaster applied for unemployment benefits which were denied on November 9, 2016. Lancaster filed an appeal the same day. On November 30, 2016, the director issued a redetermination disallowing claimant's application based upon the finding that claimant was discharged from employment with CLO for just cause in connection with work. That same day, Lancaster filed an appeal from the redetermination. On December 1, 2016, ODJFS transferred jurisdiction to the commission. On December 14, 2016, a telephone hearing was held by the hearing officer. The hearing officer affirmed the director's redetermination on December 22, 2016. On December 23, 2016, Lancaster requested a review by the commission which was denied on January 11, 2017. On February 1, 2017, Lancaster filed an appeal to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, which reversed the commission's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 10} ODJFS filed a timely notice of appeal and raised the following assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   1. In its decision of September 20, 2017, the lower court erred when it held that the January 11, [2017] decision of the Unemployment Compensation Review Commission was unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   2. The lower court erred in its decision of September 20, 2017 when it substituted its judgment, and failed to defer, to the Unemployment Compensation Review Commission on the resolution of factual issues including, but not limited to, just cause in the discharge of Ms. Lancaster.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 11} ODJFS initiated this appeal pursuant to R.C. 4141.282(A). R.C. 4141.282(H) governs judicial review of decisions of the commission. It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The court shall hear the appeal on the certified record provided by the commission. If the court finds that the decision of the commission was unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence, it shall reverse, vacate, or modify the decision, or remand the matter to the commission. Otherwise, the court shall affirm the decision of the commission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 12} A common pleas court and an appellate court employ the same standard of review in unemployment compensation appeals: \"An appellate court may reverse the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review's 'just cause' determination only if it is unlawful, unreasonable or against the manifest weight of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Tzangas, Plakas &amp; Mannos v.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The assignments of error are related and we address them together. The essence of the assignments of error is that the common pleas court erred in finding that the commission's decision was unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence because ODJFS argues that the common pleas court substituted its judgment, and failed to defer, to the commission in its resolution of factual issues including, but not limited to, the commission's just cause determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The Unemployment Compensation Act \" 'was intended to provide financial assistance to an individual who had worked, was able and willing to work, but was temporarily without employment through no fault or agreement of his own.' \"\n   <em>\n    Tzangas\n   </em>\n   at 697,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=653%20N.E.2d%201207\">\n    653 N.E.2d 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Irvine\n   </em>\n   at 17,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=482%20N.E.2d%20587\">\n    482 N.E.2d 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The Act does not exist to protect employees from themselves, but to protect them from economic forces over which they have no control.

She testified, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Well, I don't know if it's a, a work rule or just common knowledge, but the security badges are considered business property and you're only supposed to use it to come in and out of the building and in and out of our office and I believe that's made fairly clear to all people that come to work here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   This was such an unusual occurrence that there are certain things you have policies for that, that might be questionable, but entering another person's business uninvited and trying to use a security badge, your security badge is to access another person's business, nobody would ever write a policy about that just because you would know that's why they issue security badges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=498%20N.E.2d%20485\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at E2686-T87 through T88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Lancaster testified that she was unaware of any policy prohibiting her from visiting the 21st floor and, further, she had been encouraged by other employees to do so. Moreover, Powell had invited her to visit again and provided her cell phone number. CLO provided no evidence contradicting Lancaster's testimony. Cheek testified she did not know whether the policy was \"a work rule or just common knowledge.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=498%20N.E.2d%20485\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at E2686-T87. There was no written policy provided and no testimony that someone in authority from CLO had informed Lancaster of any such policy. Furthermore, Cheek testified that CLO's employees are \"free to do what they want\" during their lunch breaks.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=498%20N.E.2d%20485\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at E2686-T86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The evidence at the hearing, as noted above, was essentially undisputed. Given this evidence, it does not support the conclusion that Lancaster \"knew or should have known\" of the policy prohibiting her from visiting other floors in the building.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=498%20N.E.2d%20485\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at E2686-U30. There is no evidence that CLO informed Lancaster of the policy. Under these circumstances, we reverse the commission's decision because it reaches an unreasonable conclusion from essentially undisputed evidence. ODJFS's assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 25} For the foregoing reasons, ODJFS's two assignments of error are overruled and the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   TYACK, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   LUPER SCHUSTER, J., dissents.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
