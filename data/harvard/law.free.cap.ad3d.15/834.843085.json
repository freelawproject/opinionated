Daley, J.), entered April 15, 2004. The order, among other things, denied the motion of defendant for summary judgment dismissing the complaints in a personal injury action.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">It is hereby ordered that the order so appealed from be and the same hereby is unanimously affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Memorandum: This appeal arises in two consolidated actions commenced by plaintiffs to recover for personal injuries sustained in a single-car accident occurring at an intersection on a highway owned by defendant. It is well established that municipalities have a duty to maintain their roads in a reasonably safe condition for motorists and must guard against contemplated and foreseeable risks <em>(see Friedman v State of New York, </em>67 NY2d 271, 283 [1986]; <em>Tomassi v Town of Union, </em>46 NY2d 91, 97 [1978]; <em>Lopes v Rostad, </em>45 NY2d 617, 623 [1978]). Nevertheless, the duty is \u201cmeasured by the courts with consideration given to the proper limits on intrusion into the municipality\u2019s planning and decision-making functions\u201d <em>(Friedman, </em>67 NY2d at 283). Thus, in the field of traffic design engineering, the municipality is accorded a qualified immunity from liability arising out of a highway planning decision <em>(see Friedman, </em>67 NY2d at 283; <em>Alexander v Eldred, </em>63 NY2d 460, 465-466 [1984]; <em>Weiss v Fote, 7 </em>NY2d 579, 585-586 [1960], <em>rearg denied </em>8 NY2d 934 [I960]). Pursuant to that doctrine of qualified immunity, \u201cliability for injury arising out of the operation of a duly executed highway safety plan may only be predicated on proof that the plan either was evolved without adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>study or lacked a reasonable basis\u201d (Weiss, 7 NY2d at 589; <em>see Friedman, </em>67 NY2d at 284; <em>Alexander, </em>63 NY2d at 466).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">Applying the foregoing standards, we conclude that Supreme Court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaints. There is a triable issue of fact concerning whether defendant\u2019s choice of signage at the intersection and the absence of traffic signals was the product of adequate study and a reasonable planning decision on the part of defendant or was instead negligent (see <em>Forsythe-Kane v Town of Yorktown, </em>249 AD2d 505, 506 [1998]; <em>Appelbaum v County of Sullivan, </em>222 AD2d 987, 989 [1995]; see <em>also Scheemaker v State of New York, </em>70 NY2d 985, 986 [1988]; <em>cf. Abrahams v Town of Brookhaven, </em>220 AD2d 472 [1995]). Further, there is a triable issue of fact concerning whether such alleged negligence was a proximate cause of the accident and injuries (see <em>Ernest v Red Creek Cent. School Dist., </em>93 NY2d 664, 674-675 [1999], <em>rearg denied </em>93 NY2d 1042 [1999]; <em>Purves v County of Erie, </em>12 AD3d 1112 [2004]).
