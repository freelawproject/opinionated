We conclude that the appeals board\u2019s order denying reconsideration may incorporate and include the report of the referee, as long as the referee\u2019s report makes reasonably clear the basis of decision; but upon a review of the entire record we hold the appeals board\u2019s decision in this case lacks the support of substantial evidence and thus cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">1. <em>The Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">Petitioner worked for the Food Machinery and Chemical (FMC) Corporation as a Du-All Saw operator and bar stockkeeper in San Jose, California. Apparently both jobs must be performed together and involve the cutting and storage of metal. Although the petitioner could use an overhead crane for most lifting, the work at times required petitioner to lift by hand stock weighing 200 to 250 pounds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While in the course of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>employment, petitioner sustained three separate injuries. On August 14, 1967, he injured his right knee. Having received medical attention, and continuing in his.regular employment, he suffered an injury to his left knee on October 18, 1967. Again he received treatment and continued to work until he injured his right elbow on October 26, 1967. Petitioner ceased work on account of the third injury on November 3, 1967, and began receiving temporary disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Petitioner initially received treatment from Dr. Karl Schaffl, a physician for the insurance carrier, but Dr. Schaffl referred petitioner to Dr. John J. Dedinsky, an orthopedic specialist, who has treated petitioner for all three of his injuries under authorization from the insurance carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">One of Dr. Schaffl\u2019s earliest reports indicates that petitioner is suffering from olecranon bursitis, particularly in his right elbow. Since the FMC Corporation had terminated petitioner\u2019s employment, Dr. Schaffl concluded on November 13, 1967, that petitioner is \u201centitled to compensation until bursitis subsides.\u201d On December 11, 1967, Dr. Schaffl indicated that he was relying upon consultation with Dr. Dedinsky and that \u201c[pjatient will remain on compensation until recovered from all 3 injuries.\u201d Dr. Schaffl reported on January 3, 1968, that petitioner had recovered from his injuries to his right elbow and right knee but still required treatment for his left knee. Dr. Schaffl did not clear petitioner for work, but referred the matter to Dr. Dedinsky.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">On January 11, 1968, Dr. Roy Smith agreed with Dr. Schaffl that petitioner required treatment for olecranon bursitis but concluded that petitioner suffered no disability. Neither the referee nor the parties apparently rely upon Dr. Smith\u2019s very brief report or Dr. Schaffl\u2019s incomplete report. Dr. Smith only saw petitioner once. The referee concluded that petitioner continued disabled through March 1968 without citing Dr. Smith\u2019s or Dr. Schaffl\u2019s reports, but instead by relying on Dr. Dedinsky\u2019s many reports. Dr. Smith\u2019s and Dr. Schaffl\u2019s reports are not relevant to the period after March 1968 during which petitioner was under the care of Dr. Dedinsky and about which we are here concerned.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">Dr. Dedinsky reported on January 17, 1968, to Dr. Schaffl that petitioner was \u201cstill totally disabled.\u201d But on February 15, 1968, Dr. Dedinsky indicated that petitioner \u201ccould return to his former type of work as of February 26, 1968.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although petitioner continued unsuccessfully to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>seek employment, he received no temporary disability compensation after March 13, 1968. Following termination of temporary disability indemnity payments, petitioner applied for and received unemployment insurance benefits for the periods he remained without work. On March 21, 1968, Dr. Dedinsky cleared petitioner for work: \u201cTo Whom It May Concern: Louis LeVesque is under my care for an orthopedic problem. He may return to his former type of work, as a Do All operator on Monday, March 25th, 1968. He may not lift more than 25 lbs. of weight.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">Again on April 8, 1968, Dr. Dedinsky filed a report which the referee quoted: \u201cMr. LeVesque is showing good progress at the present time. He was encouraged to continue with the use of moist heat, elastic bandage support and increased active exercises with reference to the muscles in the region of both knees. At this time, it is felt he could return to his former type of work, as a Do All operator <em>not requiring heavy lifting. </em>I plan to recheck him in a period of six weeks.\u201d (Italics added.) The treating doctor has never released petitioner from the weight limitations imposed in his work clearance of March 21 and his medical report of April 8, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">After Dr. Dedinsky\u2019s limited work clearance, petitioner continued unsuccessfully to seek work until mid-summer 1968 when he secured a job as a cook for the County of Santa Clara, because he had worked as a cook in the past. While petitioner was employed by the county he visited Dr. Dedinsky on July 25 and Dr. Dedinsky reported his conclusion on August 6, which the referee quoted: \u201cMr. Louis LeVesque is showing some progressive stabilization of his injuries to both knees and the right elbow. At present, he is working as a cook and feels this is not causing him any particular problem with reference to his knees.. He was advised to continue with the use of periodic heat and active exercises for the muscles in both lower extremities. I plan to recheck him in a period of two months.\u201d Petitioner remained at work for the 30-day probationary period, but he could not work full time. At the end of the 30 days the county informed petitioner that his work appeared unsatisfactory and released him.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Petitioner\u2019s unemployment compensation coverage ended in September 1968. He continued to seek work and secured a job as a cook for Sweden House. While petitioner was employed at Sweden House, he reported to Dr. Dedinsky for his regular appointment. Dr. Dedinsky did not note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>petitioner\u2019s difficulty in keeping a job as a cook, but simply concluded, \u201cHis symptoms are not too disabling and he has been able to continue working as a cook.\u201d After working only one week at Sweden House, petitioner was dismissed because of his difficulty standing and lifting.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Dr. Dedinsky has reported further visits with petitioner on December 12, 1968, February 14, 1969, and May 22, 1969.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> All these reports and petitioner\u2019s testimony before the referee on March 4, 1969, indicate (1) that petitioner continues to suffer from his bursitis condition and the consequence of his three injuries, (2) that petitioner continues to receive treatment for his injuries, and (3) that Dr. Dedinsky has neither repeated nor withdrawn his weight lifting limitation. Continuing to seek work, petitioner requested the assistance of the Department of Rehabilitation. Upon the department\u2019s advice petitioner returned to school to learn basic mathematics and English so that he could secure other employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">At the request of petitioner\u2019s attorney, Dr. Messinger thoroughly examined petitioner on November 29, 1968, and rendered a conclusion which the referee quoted, \u201cThe patient has been advised to continue under the care of Dr. John Dedinski. I do not think this case will be ready for closure for at least another year. He still should be in a modified work category, trying to avoid squatting and kneeling wherever possible, as well as, trying to avoid contusing the right elbow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Petitioner filed an application for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits for the three injuries on January 22, 1969, and the three cases<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> were consolidated for a hearing held on March 4, 1969. The referee found that petitioner\u2019s occupation is that of a Du-All Saw operator and bar stock-keeper; that his condition arose from injuries in the course of his employment; that his condition is not yet permanent and stationary; that he did not suffer temporary disability beyond March 21, 1968; and that petitioner is entitled only to further medical treatment reasonably necessary to cure the effects of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Having filed a timely petition for reconsideration, petitioner contended that he continues to be temporarily disabled and deserves an award of temporary disability compensation until he can return to work. The referee filed a report and recommended denial of reconsideration. After summarizing the medical history of petitioner\u2019s condition, the referee con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>eluded, \u201cThe general tenor of the medical reports, especially when considered in the light of other factors, suggests that the doctor\u2019s cautions were more in the nature of prophylactic advice rather than rigid restrictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">On May 22, 1969, the appeals board filed an order denying reconsideration.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The petitioner sought a writ of review from the Court of Appeal for the First Appellate District, Division Four, which denied the petition without opinion on September 19, 1969. We granted a hearing to decide whether the appeals board can satisfy the requirements of Labor Code section 5908.5<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in denying a petition for reconsideration by incorporating by reference the referee\u2019s report. We also undertook consideration of the issue whether the appeals board\u2019s denial of temporary disability compensation rests upon substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">2. <em>The appeals board may deny a petition for reconsideration by memorandum order incorporating the report of the referee, so long as the report of the referee details the facts and reasons upon which it relies.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AqJ\">In <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 753 [68 Cal.Rptr. 825, 441 P.2d 633], we held that the appeals board did not regularly pursue its authority under Labor Code section 5908.5 in rendering a decision <em>after granting reconsideration </em>without specifying in detail the evidence relied upon and the reasons for the decision. Following our decision in <em>Evans </em>the Courts of Appeal have wrestled with the related issue of whether section 5908.5 requires the appeals board to state in detail the evidence relied upon and the reasons for its decision <em>to grant or deny a petition for reconsideration. </em>(Compare <em>Gaiera </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 246, 248 [76 Cal.Rptr. 656]; <em>Wasserman </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 33 Cal. Comp. Cases 790, 792; with <em>B-L Ranch, Inc. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 192, 194-195 [73 Cal.Rptr. 124]; <em>Holcomb </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 108, 110-112 [71 Cal.Rptr. 784]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number><em>California Comp. &amp; Fire Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1969) 34 Cal.Comp. Cases 231; see also <em>Krastins </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 33 Cal.Comp. Cases 751, 752.)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">We suggested two bases for the requirements of detailed findings of fact and statements of reasons as set forth in <em>Evans. </em>First, the Legislature indicated in section 5908.5 its intention to facilitate judicial review of decisions of the appeals board by affording the reviewing court detailed information about the basis for the appeals board\u2019s action. Second, the Legislature evidenced its concern that the appeals board avoid careless or arbitrary action by careful consideration of the facts and by reasoned analysis in support of any decision it may reach. <em>(Evans </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 753, 755; see <em>Lundberg </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 436, 440-441 [71 Cal.Rptr. 684, 445 P.2d 300]; <em>Granado </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 399, 406 [71 Cal.Rptr. 678, 445 P.2d 294]; <em>California Motor Transport Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Com. </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 270, 274-275 [28 Cal.Rptr. 868, 379 P.2d 324].)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Although these two reasons apply with great force to any decision rendered by the appeals board after reconsideration, they do not apply to an appeals board decision <em>denying </em>reconsideration. In <em>Evans, </em>having granted reconsideration, the appeals board reached its own decision without properly pursuing its authority under section 5908.5. In reviewing the appeals board\u2019s decision in that case, we lacked a detailed statement of the reasons and facts underlying the board\u2019s decision. In the absence of that recitation we could not adequately perform our responsibility of review under section 5952.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The appeals board in the present case, however, by adopting and incorporating the report of the referee, has provided the reviewing court with adequate guidance. The referee\u2019s report clearly indicates the basis of his decision. The appeals board has therefore fulfilled the first rationale of <em>Evans </em>by adopting and incorporating the referee\u2019s decision which clearly states the factual and rational basis of its order denying reconsideration.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">As to the second rationale of <em>Evans, </em>we must read section 5908.5 to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>gether with section 5909<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the Labor Code. Section 5909 permits the appeals board to deny a petition for reconsideration by simply not acting upon the petition for 30 days from the date of filing. The Legislature has thus provided that in denying a petition for reconsideration the appeals board need not detail its factual and rational basis for so doing. If we were to conclude that section 5908.5 required detailed findings and statements of reasons, the appeals board could simply by pocket denial dispose of cases under section 5909.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Hence, the appeals board in incorporating the referee\u2019s report substantially complied with the second rationale of <em>Evans </em>by indicating sufficient consideration of the petition under the strictures of sections 5908.5 and 5909.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">We hold that if the appeals board denies a petition for reconsideration its order may incorporate and include within it the report of the referee, provided that the referee\u2019s report states the evidence relied upon and specifies in detail the reasons for the decision. (See Lab. Code, \u00a7 5908.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">3. <em>The decision of the appeals board and the report of the referee lack the support of substantial evidence:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">In our appellate review of the decisions of the appeals board, which exercises a long-acknowledged administrative expertise, we have required that the record contain substantial evidentiary support for the appeals board\u2019s decisions. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5952; see, e.g., <em>McAllister </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 408, 419 [71 Cal.Rptr. 697, 445 P.2d 313]; <em>Zemke </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 794, 796-797 [69 Cal.Rptr. 88, 441 P.2d 928]; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 476, 478; <em>Argonaut Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 589, 593 [21 Cal.Rptr. 545, 371 P.2d 281]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number><em>Schaller v. Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1938) 11 Cal.2d 46, 50 [77 P.2d 836].) But from time to time we have somewhat inconsistently mentioned, but generally not utilized, tests of judicial review which depart from the substantial evidence approach. (See, e.g., <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 476, 479 (\u201cany evidence\u201d); <em>Rogers Materials Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 717, 721 [48 Cal.Rptr. 129, 408 P.2d 737] (\u201cany evidence\u201d) ;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Fred Gledhill-Chevrolet </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1964) 62 Cal.2d 59, 61 [41 Cal.Rptr. 170, 396 P.2d 586] (\u201cany substantial evidence\u201d);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Douglas Aircraft, Inc. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc.

(Compare, e.g., <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 818, 822 [72 Cal.Rptr. 545] (\u201csubstantial evidence\u201d; \u201cany evidence\u201d) ;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc.

Com. </em>(1957) 154 Cal.App.2d 737, 742 [316 P..2d 680] (\u201csubstantial evidence\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">We must return to the very explicit language of section 5952 to determine the proper scope of judicial review of the evidence in workmen\u2019s compensation cases: \u201cThe review by the court shall not be extended further than to determine, based upon the entire record . . . whether . . . [t]he order, decision, or award was not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We must disapprove of any contradictory language in the above opinions and in the cases that generated and derive from them. (E.g., <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1967) 68 Cal.2d 7, 15 [64 Cal.Rptr. 440, 434 P.2d 992].) In reviewing the evidence our legislative mandate and sole obligation under section 5952 is to review the entire record to determine whether the board\u2019s conclusion was supported by substantial evidence. (See <em>O\u2019Keeffe </em>v. <em>Smith, Hinchman &amp; Grylls Associates, Inc. </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 359, 362 [13 L.Ed.2d 895, 897, 85 S.Ct. 1012], but cf. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 238, 246 [340 P.2d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Petitioner contends that the referee lacked substantial evidence for his conclusion that the petitioner was not entitled to temporary compensation. Petitioner contends that he still suffers from a considerable handicap which renders him unable to return to his occupation as a bar stockkeeper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>and Du-All Saw operator. Having reviewed the entire record, we conclude that the referee\u2019s conclusion lacks the support of substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The referee himself summarized the evidence in such a way as to compel the conclusion that petitioner was \u00bfntitled to temporary disability compensation. The referee established that petitioner still suffers from the temporary injuries incurred in the course of his employment; indeed, the referee granted compensation for further treatment of petitioner\u2019s condition. Thus the referee recognized that Dr. Dedinsky, the insurance carrier\u2019s physician who has treated petitioner throughout, released petitioner for work with a lifting limitation of 25 pounds; and that although the doctor has seen petitioner several times since the limited work release, the doctor has never removed the limitation. Since the referee stated, that petitioner\u2019s occupation at the time of the injury was that of a Du-All Saw operator and bar stock-keeper, any discussion of subsequent unsuccessful attempts to find work as a cook becomes irrelevant.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The referee understood that petitioner\u2019s occupation as a Du-All Saw operator and bar stockkeeper sometimes re: quired that petitioner lift stock weighing from 200 to 250 pounds. Even petitioner\u2019s work as a cook required lifting which petitioner could not perform adequately for him to remain employed. Having established all these facts, the referee illogically concluded that petitioner did not qualify for temporary disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The referee\u2019s only support for his conclusion appears in his report and recommendation on the petition for reconsideration. After reviewing Dr. Dedinsky\u2019s reports and Dr. Messinger\u2019s report, the referee observed, \u201cThe general tenor of the medical reports, especially when considered in the light of other factors[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>] suggests that the doctor\u2019s cautions were more in the nature of prophylactic advice rather than rigid restrictions.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Dr. Dedinsky stated on April 8, 1969, \u201cAt this time, it is felt he could return to his former type of work, as a Do All operator not requiring heavy lifting.\u201d Dr. Messinger reported that petitioner on November 29, 1968, \u201cstill should be in a modified work category, trying to avoid squatting and kneeling wherever possible, as well as, trying to avoid contusing the right elbow.\u201d The referee could expect no more definitive statement than this that petitioner could not perform the lifting required in his occupation. (See 2 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1968) \u00a7 80.32, at pp. 322-323.)</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">The referee himself summarized the medical evidence as follows: \u201cDr. Dedinsky released him, with a lifting limitation of 25 pounds\u201d; or as follows: \u201cIn about February of 1968, Dr. Dedinsky gave him a return-to-work slip, with a lifting limitation.\u201d No substantial evidence can support the referee\u2019s rejection of the uncontradicted medical opinion in the record or his characterization of the \u201cdoctor\u2019s cautions\u201d as \u201cmore in the nature of prophylactic advice rather than rigid restrictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The referee and appeals board \u201cmust accept as true the intended meaning of [evidence] both uncontradicted and unimpeached.\u201d <em>(McAllister </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 408, 413.) Although we have long permitted a referee to rely upon the clearly relevant judgment of a single physician in making his decision <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 588, 592; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 476, 479-480; <em>Standard Rectifier Corp. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp.

Com. </em>(1948) 33 Cal.2d 89, 94 [199 P.2d 302]), the referee here relies upon no medical authority in concluding that petitioner is not disabled from performing the lifting required in his occupation.

But reading and construing sections 5909 and 5908.5 together we cannot believe the Legislature intended by section 5908.5 to require detailed findings and reasons upon a denial of reconsideration if the appeals board can avoid the requirement so easily under section 5909. In granting a petition for reconsideration, however, the appeals board should comply with section 5908.5 in order to apprise the parties and the referee as to the basis for reconsideration. We cannot find any provision analogous to section 5909 which applies to the granting of reconsideration; if the appeals board complies with section 5908.5, the parties will understand what new evidence or arguments they should present upon reconsideration. (See Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5906, 5908.) If the appeals board grants reconsideration, and without taking further evidence, affirms, rescinds, or amends the original award (see Lab.
