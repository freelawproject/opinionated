(Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11530.) After a hearing, the superior court granted defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the information (Pen. Code, \u00a7 995), and dismissed the case. The People appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">On September 16, 1968, about 7:30 p.m., Officers Rada and Carreon of the Los Angeles Police Department were patrolling in a black and white police car on Gage between Avalon and Central in south-central Los Angeles. Theirs was the only vehicle on the street. Several days earlier, the officers had been informed at \u201crollcall\u201d that a grand theft auto suspect, described only as a male Negro, 6 feet tall and weighing 160 pounds, might be found in an area centered a block from that location.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">They saw defendant and a companion walking on a well lit sidewalk on the opposite side of the street. Although defendant met the general description of the auto theft suspect, Officer Rada testified that he would not have stopped the defendant but for the latter\u2019s \u201cfurtive actions.\u201d These actions consisted of defendant\u2019s turning towards the police car\u2014when it emitted \u201ca clanging noise in the muffler\u201d\u2014and thrusting his hand into his left front pants pocket. Officer Carreon \u201cwhipped\u201d the car around and brought it to a stop. As Officer Rada approached on foot, the defendant again thrust his hand into his pocket and quickly withdrew it. The officers ordered defendant to stop, and he complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">After approaching further cautiously because \u201cmaybe [defendant] had a weapon,\u201d the officers asked for identification. Defendant replied that he had none. Thereupon Officer Carreon commenced a \u201cpat-down\u201d search of defendant, while Officer Rada searched the inside of defendant\u2019s companion\u2019s pockets. When he ran his hand over defendant\u2019s left front pants pocket, Officer Carreon felt a \u201clittle lump;\u201d at that instant, defendant pushed the officer\u2019s hand away and said, \u201cGet your hand away from there. You can\u2019t search me.\u201d Officer Carreon had not seen the bulge before feeling it. \u201cThinking it was a weapon,\u201d the officer put his hand into defendant\u2019s pocket and extracted what turned out to be a \u201clid\u201d of marijuana loosely packed in a plastic bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Initially, we have grave doubts as to the lawfulness of defendant\u2019s detention, based as it was upon his meeting a general description, turning towards the source of an unusual noise, and making two gestures towards his pocket. <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 16, 19, fn. 16, 20-22 [20 L.Ed.2d 889, 902, 904, 905-906, 88 S.Ct. 1868]; <em>People </em>v. <em>One 1960 Cadillac Coupe, </em>62 Cal.2d 92 [41 Cal.Rptr. 290, 396 P.2d 706]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bunt, </em>250 Cal.App.2d 311 [58 Cal.Rptr. 385].) A description as general as \u201cA male <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Negroe [sz'c], six foot, 160 pounds\u201d fails to distinguish defendant from a substantial portion of the population of south-central Los Angeles. The President\u2019s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, Task Force Report: The Police (1967)\u2014cited by <em>Terry </em>for the proposition that misuse of field interrogations is a major source of friction between police and minority groups (392 U.S. at p. 14, fn. 11 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 901])\u2014strongly criticizes the use of such descriptions. (Task Force Report: The Police, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 186-187.)</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">We find it unnecessary, however, to determine the validity of the detention. Even assuming the detention was lawful, the search of defendant exceeded lawful bounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\"><em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>reaffirmed the settled principles that \u201ca search which is reasonable at its inception may violate the Fourth Amendment by virtue of its intolerable intensity and scope\u201d and that the \u201cscope of the search must be \u2018strictly tied to and justified by\u2019 the circumstances which rendered its initiation permissible.\u201d (392 U.S. at pp. 17-19 [20 L.Ed.2d at pp. 903-904].) With reference to self-protective weapons searches justified by circumstances short of probable cause for arrest, the court noted: \u201cThe sole justification of the search ... is the protection of the police officer and others nearby, and it must therefore be confined in scope to an intrusion reasonably designed to discover guns, knives, clubs, or other hidden instruments for the assault of the police officer.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 29 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 911].) And in upholding the search before it, the court was careful to point out that the officer \u201cpatted down the outer clothing of petitioner and his two companions. He did not place his hands in their pockets or under the outer surface of their garments until he had felt weapons, and then he merely reached for and removed the guns. He never did invade [one companion\u2019s] person beyond the outer surfaces of his clothes, since he discovered nothing in his pat-down which might have been a weapon. Officer McFadden confined his search strictly to what was minimally necessary to learn whether the men were armed and to disarm them once he discovered the weapons. He did not conduct a general exploratory search for whatever evidence of criminal activity he might find.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 29-30 [20 L.Ed.2d at pp. 910-911].)</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\"><em>Sibron </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1968) 392 U.S. 40 [20 L.Ed.2d 917, 88 S.Ct. 1889], reversed a possession of heroin conviction of a defendant who was observed talking over a period of eight hours to six or eight persons known to the arresting officer to be narcotics addicts. At midnight, the end of this period, the defendant entered a restaurant and spoke to three more known addicts. Although the arresting officer heard none of the conversations, he approached the defendant, asked that the latter accompany him outside, said \u201cYou know what I am after,\u201d and, when the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>mumbled something and reached into his pocket, the officer simultaneously thrust his hand into the pocket and withdrew the heroin. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that there were adequate grounds to search the defendant for arms, the court held: \u201c[T]he nature and scope of the search conducted . . . were so clearly unrelated to that justification as to render the heroin inadmissible. The search for weapons approved in <em>Terry </em>consisted solely of a limited patting of the outer clothing of the suspect for concealed objects which might be used as instruments of assault. Only when he discovered such objects did the officer in <em>Terry </em>place his hands in the pockets of the men he searched, In this case, with no attempt at an initial limited exploration for arms, Patrolman Martin thrust his hand into Sibron\u2019s pocket and took from him envelopes of heroin. His testimony shows that he was looking for narcotics, and he found them. The search was not reasonably limited in scope to the accomplishment of the only goal which might conceivably have justified its inception\u2014the protection of the officer by disarming a potentially dangerous man. Such a search violates the guarantee of the Fourth Amendment, which protects the sanctity of the person against unreasonable intrusions on the part of all government agents.\u201d (392 U.S. at pp. 44-45, 65-66 [20 L.Ed.2d at pp. 924-925, 936].)</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">In balancing the safety of police officers against the Fourth Amendment\u2019s proscription of unreasonable intrusions, <em>Terry </em>and <em>Sibron </em>thus conclude that in searching a legally detained individual reasonably suspected of being armed, a police officer must be limited to \u201ca careful exploration of the outer surfaces of [the] person\u2019s clothing\u201d <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. at p. 16 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 903]) until and unless he discovers specific and articulable facts reasonably supporting his suspicion. Only then may an officer exceed the scope of a pat-down and reach into the suspect\u2019s clothing for the limited purpose of recovering the object thought to be a weapon. As with other searches without warrants, the burden of pointing to \u201cspecific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant\u201d such an intrusion properly rests with the People. (Compare <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. at p. 21 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 906], with <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>68 Cal.2d 629, 632 [68 Cal.Rptr. 441, 440 P.2d 921].)</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Feeling a soft object in a suspect\u2019s pocket during a pat-down, absent unusual circumstances, does not warrant an officer\u2019s intrusion into a suspect\u2019s pocket to retrieve the object. A pat-down must \u201cbe confined in scope to an intrusion reasonably designed to discover guns, knives, clubs, or other hidden instruments for the assault of the police officer.\" (Terry v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. at p. 29 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 911].) The obvious purpose of holding that officers cannot go beyond exploration of the surfaces of a suspect\u2019s clothing without being \u201cable to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>from those facts, reasonably warrant that [additional] intrusion\u201d is to ensure that the scope of such a search cannot be exceeded at the mere discretion of an officer, but only upon discovery of tactile evidence particularly tending to corroborate suspicion that the suspect is armed. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 21-22 [20 L.Ed.2d at pp. 905-906].) To permit officers to exceed the scope of a lawful pat-down whenever they feel a soft object by relying upon m.ere speculation that the object might be a razor blade concealed in a handkerchief, a \u201csap,\u201d or any other atypical weapon would be to hold that possession of any object, including a wallet, invites a plenary search of an individual\u2019s person. Such a holding would render meaningless <em>Terry\u2019s </em>requirement that pat-downs be limited in scope absent articulable grounds for an additional intrusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">Accordingly, we hold that an officer who exceeds a pat-down without first discovering an object which feels reasonably like a knife, gun, or club must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which reasonably support a suspicion that the particular suspect is armed with an atypical weapon which would feel like the object felt during the pat-down. Only then can judges satisfy the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirement of a neutral evaluation of the reasonableness of a particular search by comparing the facts with the officer\u2019s view of those facts. <em>(Id.) </em>Thus, for example, an officer who believes a soft object is a \u201csap\u201d in the form of a small bag of sand must be able to point to its weight and consistency to justify an intrusion into the suspect\u2019s pocket. \u201cTo allow less would be to leave law-abiding citizens at the mercy of the officers\u2019 whim or caprice.\u201d (Cf. <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1949) 338 U.S. 160, 176 [93 L.Ed. 1879, 1890, 69 S.Ct. 1302].)</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">For similar reasons, two recent Court of Appeal decisions held that discovery of a soft bulge did not warrant an intrusion beyond a pat-down. <em>(Byrd </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>268 Cal.App.2d 495 [73 Cal.Rptr. 880]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Britton, </em>264 Cal.App.2d 711 [70 Cal.Rptr. 586].)</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The Attorney General relies upon <em>People v. Armenia, </em>268 Cal.App.2d 248 [73 Cal.Rptr. 819], which approved a search of a suspect\u2019s pocket after a pat-down revealed a soft object therein. The Court of Appeal reasoned that the suspect might have had a \u201crubber water pistol loaded with carbolic acid or some other liquid, which if used by a suspect could permanently blind an officer.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 251.) For the reasons stated above, to condone fanciful speculations such as that indulged in by <em>Armenia </em>would be to permit officers to exceed the scope of a pat-down upon discovering any object on a suspect\u2019s person. <em>People </em>v. <em>Armenia, supra, </em>is disapproved insofar as it conflicts with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The search of defendant in the instant case must be held un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>reasonable in its scope in that prior to the intrusion into defendant\u2019s pocket, Officer Carreon\u2019s search had not disclosed evidence which would reasonably support a belief that he had located a weapon on defendant\u2019s person. Defendant\u2019s disclosure that he had no identification cannot justify bypassing a pat-down for a more extensive intrusion. By pushing the officer\u2019s hand away and objecting orally to the search, the defendant provided no basis for a reasonable belief that defendant was reaching for a weapon or that continuing the pat-down would increase any risks to the officer\u2019s safety. If merely posing an objection to a search were sufficient to provide justification for a more extensive intrusion upon defendant\u2019s personal security, \u201cthe right to be free from unreasonable police intrusions would be vitiated by its mere assertion.\u201d (Cf. <em>Tompkins </em>v. <em>Superior Court, 59 </em>Cal.2d 65, 68 [27 Cal.Rptr. 889, 378 P.2d 113]; <em>Hood </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>220 Cal.App.2d 242, 247-248 [33 Cal.Rptr. 782].) Had Officer Carreon remained suspicious of the \u201clittle lump\u201d in defendant\u2019s pocket, he should have conducted another more extensive exploration thereof from the exterior of defendant\u2019s clothing to determine whether a further intrusion was justified. (Cf. <em>Byrd </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>268 Cal.App.2d 495.)</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">The Attorney General suggests that Officer Carreon might have suspected the \u201clittle lump\u201d as a \u201csap.\u201d Although the officer stated he thought the lump was a weapon, he did not indicate that he thought the weapon was a \u201csap\u201d or otherwise indicate the nature of the weapon he thought he felt. The feel of a \u201clid\u201d of loosely packed marijuana would not reasonably support a suspicion that defendant had a \u201csap\u201d because a \u201csap,\u201d to be useful as a weapon, would have to possess considerably more mass than the heaviest \u201clid\u201d of marijuana. In these circumstances, an officer\u2019s conclusory statement that he thought there was a weapon does not meet the prosecution\u2019s burden of pointing to specific and articulable facts to justify his intrusion into a defendant\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Accordingly, even if the pat-down before us was justified at its inception, the search became impermissible in its scope when Officer Carreon reached into defendant\u2019s pocket. <em>People </em>v. <em>Nunn, </em>264 Cal.App.2d 919 [70 Cal.Rptr. 869], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Kraps, </em>238 Cal.App.2d 675 [48 Cal.Rptr. 89], cited by the Attorney General, are inapposite in that they upheld searches incident to a valid arrest. In addition, the object felt in <em>Nunn </em>was hard. (264 Cal.App.2d at pp. 921, 925.)</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The Attorney General suggests that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to Officer Carreon\u2019s \u201cconclusion[s]\u201d amounted to a waiver of defendant\u2019s contention that the officer\u2019s suspicions were insufficient reasonably to support the intrusion into his pocket. Officer Carreon testified that he thrust his hand into defendant\u2019s pocket after feeling the bag of loosely packed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>marijuana \u201c[tjhinking it was a weapon\u201d and pulled out \u201cwhat I thought to be a weapon at the time.\u201d There was no basis for objection on grounds that the responses quoted were conclusory (cf. <em>Cope </em>v. <em>Davidson, </em>30 Cal.2d 193, 200 [180 P.2d 873, 171 A.L.R. 667]), as the officer merely testified as to what he thought\u2014a fact relevant to the reasonableness of his intrusion <em>(Sibron </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>392 U.S. at p. 64 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 935]), but not determinative thereof <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. at pp. 21-22 [20 L.Ed.2d at pp. 905-906]).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">The People\u2019s final argument is that the officers had probable cause to arrest defendant immediately before searching the interior of his pocket, and hence that the final search was incident to a valid arrest. However, it is clear that prior to discovering that the soft object was marijuana, the officers did not have probable cause for arrest, and \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that an incident search may not precede an arrest and serve as part of its justification.\u201d <em>(Sibron </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>392 U.S. at p. 63 [20 L.Ed.2d at pp. 934-935].)</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The trial court\u2019s order setting aside the information and dismissing the case is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Traynor, C.
