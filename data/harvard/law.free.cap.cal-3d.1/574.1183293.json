(Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a).) While in a drunken rage, defendant brutally assaulted the landlady of the rooming house at which: he was living and a roomer, who came to the landlady\u2019s assistance. The assaults were triggered when the landlady told defendant to stop drinking or move out. Defendant\u2019s only contention on appeal is that the trial court failed to consider the fact that he was intoxicated in determining whether he had the requisite criminal intent to commit the assaults. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 22.) We determined this contention adversely to defendant in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hood </em>(1969) ante, pp.444, 458-459 [82 Cal.Rptr. 618, 462 P.2d 370],</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
