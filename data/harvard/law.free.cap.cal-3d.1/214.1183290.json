(Ed. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12905, 13251.) On August 5, 1965, an accusation was filed with the State Board of Education charging that petitioner\u2019s life diplomas should be revoked for cause. On March 11, 1966, following a hearing, and pursuant to the recommendations of a hearing examiner, the board revoked petitioner\u2019s life diplomas because of immoral and unprofessional conduct and acts involving moral turpitude as authorized by section 13202 of the Education Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This revocation rendered petitioner ineligible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>employment as a teacher in any public school in the state.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On February 14, 1967,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> petitioner sought a writ of mandate from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County to compel the board to set aside its decision and restore his life diplomas. After a hearing the superior court denied the writ, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">For the reasons hereinafter set forth we conclude (a) that section 13202 authorizes disciplinary measures only for conduct indicating unfitness to teach, (b) that properly interpreted to this effect section 13202 is constitutional on its face and as here applied, and (c) that the record contains no evidence to support the conclusion that petitioner\u2019s conduct indicated his unfitness to teach. The judgment of the superior court must therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">I. <em>The Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">For a number of years prior to 1964 petitioner worked as a teacher for the Lowell Joint School District. During this period, so far as appears from the record, no one complained about, or so much as criticized, his performance as a teacher. Moreover, with the exception of a single incident, no one suggested that his conduct outside the classroom was other than beyond reproach.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Sometime before the spring of 1963 petitioner became friends with Mr. and Mrs. Fred Schneringer. Mr. Schneringer also worked as a teacher in the public school system. To the Schneringers, who were involved in grave marital and financial difficulties at the time, petitioner gave counsel and advice. In the course of such counseling Mr. Schneringer frequently visited petitioner\u2019s apartment to discuss his problems. For a one-week period in April, during which petitioner and Mr. Schneringer experienced severe emotional stress, the two men engaged in a limited, non-criminal<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>relationship which petitioner described<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as being of a homosexual nature. Petitioner has never been accused<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or convicted of any criminal activity whatever, and the record contains no evidence of any abnormal activities or desires by petitioner since the Schneringer incident some six years in the past. Petitioner and Schneringer met on numerous occasions in the spring and summer after the incident and nothing untoward occurred. When Schneringer later obtained a separation from his wife, petitioner suggested a number of women whom Schneringer might consider dating.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Approximately one year after the April 1963 incident, Schneringer reported it to the Superintendent of the Lowell Joint School District. As a result of that report petitioner resigned his teaching position on May 4, 1964.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Some 19 months after the incident became known to the superintendent, the State Board of Education conducted a hearing concerning possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>revocation of petitioner\u2019s life diplomas. Petitioner there testified that he had had some undefined homosexual problem at the age of 13, but that, with the sole exception of the Schneringer incident, he had not experienced the slightest homosexual urge or inclination for more than a dozen years. Mr. Cavalier, an investigator testifying for the board, stated that the Schneringer incident \u201cwas the only time that [petitioner] ever engaged in a homosexual act' with anyone.\u201d No evidence was presented that petitioner had ever committed any act of misconduct whatsoever while teaching.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq6\">The Board of Education finally revoked petitioner\u2019s life diplomas some three years after the Schneringer incident. The board concluded that that incident constituted immoral and unprofessional conduct, and an act involving moral turpitude, all of which warrant revocation of life diplomas under section 13202 of the Education Code.</p>\n<p id=\"A15\">II. <em>Petitioner\u2019s actions cannot constitute immoral or unprofessional cpnduct or conduct involving moral turpitude within the meaning of section 13202 unless those actions indicate his unfitness to teach.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AxT\">Section 13202 of the Education Code authorizes revocation of life diplomas <em>for </em>\u201cimmoral conduct,\u201d \u201cunprofessional conduct,\u201d and \u201cacts involving moral turpitude.\u201d Legislation authorizing disciplinary action against the holders of a variety of certificates, licenses and government jobs other than teaching<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> also contain these rather general terms. This court has not attempted to formulate explicit definitions of those terms which would apply to all the statutes in which they are used. (See <em>Yakov </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 67, 73.) Rather, we have given those terms more precise meaning by referring in each case to the particular profession or the specific governmental position to which they were applicable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>In <em>Hallinan </em>v. <em>Committee of Bar Examiners </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 447 [55 Cal.Rptr. 228, 421 P.2d 76], for example, we considered the meaning of \u201cacts of moral turpitude\u201d as applied to an applicant for admission, to practice law. (See 65 Cal.2d at pp. 452, 461.) In that case the applicant had been arrested and convicted of a number of minor offenses in connection with peace demonstrations and civil rights \u201csit ins\u201d; he had likewise been involved in a number of fistfights. We held that the applicant could not be denied admission to the bar. The nature of these acts, we ruled, \u201cdoes not bear a direct relationship to petitioner\u2019s fitness to practice law. Virtually all of the admission and disciplinary cases in which we have upheld decisions of the State Bar to refuse to admit applicants or to disbar, suspend, or otherwise censure members of the bar have involved acts which bear upon the individual\u2019s manifest dishonesty and thereby provide a reasonable basis for the conclusion that the applicant or attorney cannot be relied upon to fulfill the moral obligations incumbent upon members of the legal profession [citations] .... Although petitioner\u2019s past behavior may not be praiseworthy it does not reflect upon his honesty and veracity <em>nor does it show him unfit for the proper discharge of the duties of an </em>attorney.\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(Hallinan </em>v. <em>Committee of Bar Examiners, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d 447, 471-472; compare <em>Schware </em>v. <em>Board of Bar Examiners, supra, </em>353 U.S. 232.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>In <em>Yakov </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 67, we were also concerned with moral turpitude. In that case a doctor had been convicted of nine counts of violation of section 4227 of the Business and Professions Code (furnishing dangerous drugs without prescription), and the Board of Medical Examiners had revoked his medical certificate. The superior court reversed the board\u2019s action; we upheld that'court\u2019s disposition of the matter, stating, inter alia, \u201cThe purpose of an action seeking revocation of a doctor\u2019s certificate is not to punish the doctor but rather to protect the public. . . . [Citations.] While revocation of a certificate certainly works an unavoidable punitive effect, the board can seek to achieve a legitimate punitive purpose only through criminal prosecution. <em>Thus, in this proceeding the inquiry must be limited to the effect of Dr. Yakov\u2019s actions upon the quality of his service to his patients.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) <em>(Yakov, </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 67, 73, fn. 6.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Swan </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 546 [261 P.2d 261], and <em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Owens </em>(1962) 206 Cal.App.2d 147 [23 Cal.Rptr. 710], dealt with the term \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d as applied to teachers. In <em>Swan </em>we stressed: \u201cOne employed in public service does not have a constitutional right to such employment and is subject to reasonable supervision and restriction by the authorized governmental body or officer <em>to the end that proper discipline may be maintained, and that activities among the employees may not be allowed to disrupt or impair the public service.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) (41 Cal.2d 546, 556.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <em>Owens </em>the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Appeal held that in deciding whether certain conduct by a teacher constituted unprofessional conduct which warranted discipline, a trial court must inquire whether that conduct had produced \u201cany disruption or impairment of discipline or the teaching process . . . .\u201d (206 Cal.App.2d 147, 157.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">In <em>Orloff </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Turf Club, Inc. </em>(1951) 36 Cal.2d 734 [227 P.2d 449], we dealt with a statute authorizing the exclusion from theaters, museums, and race courses of persons of \u201cimmoral character.\u201d We reasoned that the objective of the statute was \u201cthe protection of others on the premises.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 740.) Accordingly we held that a person might be excluded if, for example, he committed a lewd act or an act inimical to the public safety or welfare after gaining admittance to the place of entertainment. But we stressed that no sweeping inquiry could be made into the background and reputation of each person seeking admission. \u201c[T]he private business, the personal relations with others, the past conduct not on the premises, of a person applying for or admitted to the [race] course, whether or not relevant to indicate his character, are immaterial in the application of the statutory standards . . . . \u201d <em>(Orloff </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Turf Club, Inc., supra, </em>36 Cal.2d 734, 741.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In <em>Jarvella </em>v. <em>Willoughby-Eastlake City School Dist. </em>(1967) 12 Ohio Misc. 288, 41 Ohio Ops.2d 423 [233 N.E.2d 143], the court faced the issue of whether a teacher could be dismissed for \u201cimmorality\u201d merely because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>had written a private letter to a friend containing language which some adults might find vulgar and offensive. The court held that Ohio Revised Code section 3319.16, authorizing dismissal for \u201cimmorality,\u201d did not cover the teacher\u2019s actions, and that he could not therefore be dismissed. The court explained, \u201cWhatever else the term \u2018Immorality\u2019 may mean to many, it is clear that when used in a statute it is inseparable from \u2018conduct\u2019..... But it is not \u2018immoral conduct\u2019 considered in the abstract. It must be considered in the context in which the Legislature considered it, as conduct which is hostile to the welfare of the general public; more specifically in this case, conduct which is hostile to the welfare of the school community. ... In providing standards to guide school boards in placing restraints on conduct of teachers, the Legislature is concerned with the welfare of the school community. Its objective is the protection of students from corruption. This is a proper exercise of the power of a state to abridge personal liberty and to protect larger interests. But reasonableness must be the governing criterion. . . . <em>Orloff </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Turf Club, Inc. </em>36 Cal.2d 734 .... The private conduct of a man, who is also a teacher, is a proper concern to those who employ him only to the extent it mars him as a teacher .... Where his professional achievement is unaffected, where the school community is placed in no jeopardy, his private acts are his own business and may not be the basis of discipline.\u201d (233 N.E.2d 143, 145-146.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">By interpreting these broad terms to apply to the employee\u2019s performance on the job, the decisions in <em>Hallinan, Yakov, Swan, Owens, Orloff </em>and <em>Jarvella </em>give content to language which otherwise would be too sweeping to be meaningful. Terms such as \u201cimmoral or unprofessional conduct\u201d or \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d stretch over so wide a range that they embrace an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>unlimited area of conduct. In using them the Legislature surely did not mean to endow the employing agency with the power to dismiss any employee whose personal, private conduct incurred its disapproval. Hence the courts have consistently related the terms to the issue of whether, when applied to the performance of the employee on the job, the employee has disqualified himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">In the instant case the terms denote immoral or unprofessional conduct or moral turpitude of the teacher which indicates unfitness to teach. Without such a reasonable interpretation the terms would be susceptible to so broad an application as possibly to subject to discipline virtually every teacher in the state.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In the opinion of many people laziness, gluttony, vanity, selfishness, avarice, and cowardice constitute immoral conduct. (See Note (1967) 14 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. 581, 582.) A recent study by the State Assembly reported that educators differed among themselves as to whether \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d might include \u201cimbibing alcoholic beverages, use of tobacco, signing petitions, revealing contents of school documents to legislative committees, appealing directly to one\u2019s legislative representative, and opposing majority opinions . . . . \u201d (Report of the Subcommittee on Personnel Problems of the Assembly Interim Committee on Education, Appendix to the Journal of the Assembly, <em>supra </em>(1965) vol. 2, p. 25.) We cannot believe that the Legislature intended to compel disciplinary measures against teachers who committed such peccadillos if such passing conduct did not affect students or fellow teachers. Surely incidents of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>extramarital heterosexual conduct against a background of years of satisfactory teaching would not constitute \u201cimmoral conduct\u201d sufficient to justify revocation of a life diploma without any showing of an adverse effect on fitness to teach.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Nor is it likely that the Legislature intended by section 13202 to establish a standard for the conduct of teachers that might vary widely with time, location, and the popular mood. One could expect a reasonably stable consensus within the teaching profession as to what conduct adversely affects students and fellow teachers. No such consensus can be presumed about \u201cmorality.\u201d \u201cTodays morals may be tomorrow\u2019s ancient and absurd customs.\u201d (Note, <em>supra, </em>14 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. 581, 587.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> And conversely, conduct socially acceptable today may be anathema tomorrow. Local boards of education, moreover, are authorized to revoke their own certificates and dismiss permanent teachers for immoral and unprofessional conduct (Ed. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13209, 13403); an overly broad interpretation of that authorization could result in disciplinary action in one county for conduct treated as permissible in another. (See Report of the Subcommittee on Personnel Problems of the Assembly Interim Committee on Education, Appendix to the Journal of the Assembly (1965) vol. 2, p. 25.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> A more' constricted int\u00e9rpretatio\u00f1 of \u201cimmoral,\u201d \u201cunprofessional,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>and \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d avoids these difficulties, enabling the State Board of Education to utilize its expertise in educational matters rather than having to act \u201cas the prophet to which is revealed the state of morals of the people or the common conscience.\u201d (Note (1935) 24 Cal.L.Rev. 9, 22.)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">That the meaning of \u201cimmoral,\u201d \u201cunprofessional,\u201d and \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d must depend upon, and thus relate to, the occupation involved finds further confirmation in the fact that those terms are used in a wide variety of contexts. Along with public school teachers, all state college employees (Ed. Code, \u00a7 24306, subd. (a)), all state civil service workers (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19572, subd. (1)), and all barbers (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6582)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> can be disciplined for \u201cimmoral conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The prohibition against \u201cacts involv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>ing moral turpitude\u201d applies to attorneys (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6106) and to technicians, bioanalysts and trainees employed in clinical laboratories (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 1320), as well as to teachers. The ban on \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d is particularly common, covering not only teachers, but also dentists (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 1670), physicians (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2361), vocational nurses (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2878, subd. (a)), optometrists (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 3090), pharmacists (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 4350), psychiatric technicians (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 4521, subd. (a)), employment agency officials (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 9993), state college employees (Ed. Code, \u00a7 24306, subd. (b)), certified shorthand reporters (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 8025), and funeral directors and embalmers (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 7707).Surely the Legislature did not intend that identical standards of probity should apply to more than half a million<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> professionals and government employees in widely varying fields without regard to their differing duties, responsibilities, and degree of contact with the public.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>We therefore conclude that the Board of Education cannot abstractly characterize the conduct in this case as \u201cimmoral,\u201d \u201cunprofessional,\u201d or \u201cinvolving moral turpitude\u201d within the meaning of section 13202 of the Education Code unless that conduct indicates that the petitioner is unfit to teach. In determining whether the teacher\u2019s conduct thus indicates unfitness to teach the board may consider such matters as the likelihood that the conduct may have adversely affected students or fellow teachers, the degree of such adversity anticipated, the proximity or remoteness in time of the conduct,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the type of teaching certificate held by the party involved,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the extenuating or aggravating circumstances, if any, surrounding the conduct,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the praiseworthiness or blameworthiness of the motives resulting in the conduct,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the likelihood of the recurrence of the questioned conduct, and the extent to which disciplinary action may inflict an adverse impact or chilling effect upon the constitutional rights of the teacher involved or other teachers.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>\n                   These factors are relevant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>extent that they assist the board in determining whether the teacher\u2019s fitness to teach, i.e., in determining whether the teacher\u2019s future classroom performance and overall impact on his students are likely to meet the board\u2019s standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">III. <em>If interpreted in this manner section 13202 can be constitutionally applied to petitioner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Petitioner urges three substantive reasons to support his contention that section 13202 upon its face or as construed by the board deprived him of his constitutional rights. As we shall show, however, that section, as we have interpreted it, could constitutionally apply to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Petitioner first suggests that the terms \u201cunprofessional,\u201d \u201cmoral turpitude,\u201d and- particularly \u201cimmoral\u201d are so vague as to constitute a denial of due process.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Civil as well as criminal statutes must be sufficiently clear as to give a fair warning of the conduct prohibited, and they must provide a standard or guide against which conduct can be uniformly judged by courts and administrative agencies. <em>(Connelly </em>v. <em>General Constr.

(See Note (1964), 15 Hastings L.J. 339, 341.) Courts and commentators<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> have exposed and condemned the uncertainty of words such as \u201cunprofessional,\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> \u201cimmoral,\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Indeed, in <em>Orloff </em>v. <em>Los </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>Angeles Turf Club, Inc., supra, </em>36 Cal.2d 734, 740, this court recognized that the term \u201cimmoral\u201d might well be unconstitutionally vague. (Compare <em>Konigsberg </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1957) 353 U.S. 252, 263 [1 L.Ed.2d 810, 819, 77 S.Ct. 722].</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><em>Orloff </em>also indicated, however, that such vagueness could be resolved by a more precise judicial construction and application of the statute in conformity with the legislative objectives. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 740.) In this manner we upheld in <em>Orloff </em>a provision authorizing the exclusion from certain public accommodations of a person of immoral character. We sustained in a similar way the term \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d against a challenge of vagueness in <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Swan, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d 546, 553-554.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark>\n                   As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>we have explained above, the prohibitions against immoral and unprofessional conduct and conduct involving moral turpitude by a teacher constitutes a general ban on conduct which would indicate his unfitness to teach. This construction gives section 13202 the required specificity. Teachers, particularly in the light of their professional expertise, will normally be able to determine what kind of conduct indicates unfitness to teach.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Teachers are further protected by the fact that they cannot be disciplined merely because they made a reasonable, good faith, professional judgment in the course of their employment with which higher authorities later disagreed. (See <em>Yakov </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 67, 74.)<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">Petitioner secondly contends that the ban on immoral conduct in section 13202 violates his constitutionally protected right to privacy. It is true that an unqualified proscription against immoral conduct would raise serious constitutional problems.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Conscientious school officials concerned with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>enforcing such a broad provision might be inclined to probe into the private life of each and every teacher, no matter how exemplary his classroom conduct. Such prying might all too readily lead school officials to search for \u201ctelltale signs\u201d of immorality in violation of the teacher\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>(Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut </em>(1965) 381 U.S. 479, 485 [14 L.Ed.2d 510, 515, 85 S.Ct. 1678].)<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The proper construction of section 13202, however, minimizes the danger of such sweeping inquiries.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> By limiting the application of that section to conduct shown to indicate unfitness to teach, we substantially reduce the incentive to inquire into the private lives of otherwise sound and competent teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Finally, petitioner urges that the board cannot revoke his life diplomas because his questioned conduct does not rationally relate to his duties as a teacher,  No person can be denied government employment because of factors unconnected with the responsibilities of that employment. <em>(Pickering v.

Thus an individual can be removed from the teaching profession only upon a showing that his retention in the profession poses a significant danger of harm to either students, school employees, or others who might be affected by his actions as a teacher. Such a showing may be based on testimony (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11513), on official notice (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11515), or on both. Petitioner\u2019s conduct in this case is not disputed. Accordingly, we must inquire whether any adverse inferences can be drawn from that past conduct as to petitioner\u2019s teaching ability,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> or as to the possibility that publicity surrounding past conduct may in and of itself substantially impair his function as a teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>As to this crucial issue, the record before the board and before this court contains no evidence whatsoever. The board called no medical, psychological, or psychiatric experts to testify as to whether a man who had had a single, isolated, and limited homosexual contact would be likely to repeat such conduct in the future. The board offered no evidence that a man of petitioner\u2019s background was any more likely than the average adult male to engage in any untoward conduct with a student. The board produced no testimony from school officials or others to indicate whether a man such as petitioner might publicly advocate improper conduct. The board did not . attempt to invoke the provisions of the Government Code authorizing official notice of matters within the special competence of the board.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">This lack of evidence is particularly significant because the board failed to show that petitioner\u2019s conduct in any manner affected his performance as a teacher. There was not the slightest suggestion that petitioner had ever attempted, sought, or even considered any form of physical or otherwise improper relationship with any student.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> There was no evidence that petitioner had failed to impress upon the minds of his pupils the principles of morality as required by section 13556.5 of the Education Code.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> There is no reason to believe that the Schneringer incident affected petitioner\u2019s apparently satisfactory relationship with his co-workers.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>The board revoked petitioner\u2019s license three years after the Schneringer incident; that incident has now receded years into the past. Petitioner\u2019s motives at the time of the incident involved neither dishonesty nor viciousness, and the emotional pressures on both petitioner and Schneringer suggest the presence of extenuating circumstances. Finally, the record contains no evidence that the events of April 1963 have become so notorious as to impair petitioner\u2019s ability to command the respect and confidence of students and fellow teachers in schools within or without the Lowell Joint School District.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Before the board can conclude that a teacher\u2019s continued retention in the profession presents a significant danger of harm to students or fellow teachers, essentia] factual premises in its reasoning should be supported by evidence or official notice. In this case, despite the quantity and quality of information available about human sexual behaviour,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> the record contains no such evidence as to the significance and implications of the Schneringer incident. Neither this court nor the superior court is authorized to rectify this failure by uninformed speculation or conjecture as to petitioner\u2019s future conduct. (See <em>H. D. Wallace &amp; Associates </em>v. <em>Department of Alcoholic etc. Control </em>(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 589, 593 [76 Cal.Rptr. 749]; <em>Bley </em>v. <em>Board of Dental Examiners </em>(1927) 87 Cal.App. 193, 196 [261 P. 1036].)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The facts in this case closely resemble those in <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Macy, supra, </em>417 F.2d 1161. In <em>Norton </em>a federal employee was dismissed for homosexual behavior outside of working hours which the United States Civil Service Commission labeled \u201cimmoral.\u201d The court held that he could be dismissed only if he had committed or was likely to commit some act with an \u201cascertainable deleterious effect'on the efficiency of the service.\u201d (P. 1165.) The employee\u2019s immediate superior testified that he was competent and performed very good work. Federal officials conceded that the \u201cimmoral\u201d conduct caused no problems of national security and that the \u201cimmorality\u201d had provoked no difficulties with fellow employees. The employee had neither openly flaunted nor carelessly displayed his unorthodox sexual conduct in public. The government justified the dismissal only by a vague <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>reference to the unsubstantiated possibility that the conduct might tend to embarrass the agency for which the employee had worked. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia declined to speculate on the record before it whether the employee might someday prove unfit for government service; the court ruled the dismissal arbitrary and thus invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Respondent relies heavily on <em>Sarac </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 58 [57 Cal.Rptr. 69]. The facts involved in <em>Sarac </em>are clearly distinguishable from the instant case; the teacher disciplined in that case had pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of disorderly conduct arising from his homosexual advances toward a police officer at a public beach; the teacher admitted a recent history of homosexual activities. The court\u2019s discussion in that case includes unnecessarily broad language suggesting that all homosexual conduct, even though not shown to relate to fitness to teach, warrants disciplinary action. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 63-64.) The proper construction of section 13202, however, as we have demonstrated, is more restricted than indicated by this dicta in <em>Sarac, </em>and to the extent that <em>Sarac </em>conflicts with this opinion it must be disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Although the superior court in the instant case rendered a conclusion of law that petitoner had demonstrated his unfitness to teach, we cannot ascertain with certainty whether or not the court in so ruling relied upon this erroneous dicta in <em>Sarac: </em>(Compare <em>Screws </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1945) 325 U.S. 91, 106-107 [89 L.Ed. 1495, 1505-1506, 65 S.Ct. 1031].)  In any event, \u201cthe ultimate conclusion to be drawn from undisputed facts is a question of law for an appellate court [citations].\u201d <em>(Yakov </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 67, 74, fn. 7.  Even if the trial court\u2019s statement were to be construed as a finding of fact it would not permit us to affirm the board\u2019s action, since, as indicated, no \u201ccredible, competent evidence\u201d supports any such inference of petitioner\u2019s unfitness to teach. <em>(Yakov </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 67, 69; <em>Konigsberg </em>v. <em>State Bar, supra, </em>353 U.S. 252, 262, 273 [1 L.Ed.2d 810, 819, 825, 77 S.Ct. 722]; <em>Schware </em>v. <em>Board of Bar Examiners, supra, </em>353 U.S. 232, 246-247 [1 L.Ed.2d 796, 805-806, 77 S.Ct. 752, 64 A.L.R.2d 288].) .</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">V. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">In deciding this case we are not unmindful of the public interest in the elimination of unfit elementary and secondary school teachers. (See <em>Beilan </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1958) 357 U.S. 399, 406-408 [2 L.Ed.2d 1414, 1420-1421, 78 S.Ct. 1317]; <em>Adler </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1952) 342 U.S. 485, 493 [96 L.Ed. 517, 524, 72 S.Ct. 380, 27 A.L.R.2d 472]; <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Swan, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d 546, 553-554; <em>Vogulkin </em>v. <em>State Board of Education </em>(1961) 194 Cal.App.2d 424, 429-430 [15 Cal. Rptr. 335].) But petitioner is entitled to a careful and reasoned inquiry into his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>fitness to teach by the Board of Education before he is deprived of his right to pursue his profession. (See Report of the Senate Interim Committee on Licensing Business and Professions (1955) App.J. Senate, vol. 2, pp. 38-39, 63; Note, <em>supra, </em>44 Cal.L.Rev. 403, 405; Note, <em>supra, </em>15 Hastings L. J. 339, 346; Note (1962) 14 Stan.L.Rev. 533, 541.)  \u201cThe right to practice one\u2019s profession is sufficiently precious to surround it with a panoply of legal protection\u201d <em>(Yakov </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 67, 75), and terms such as \u201cimmoral,\u201d \u201cunprofessional,\u201d and \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d constitute only lingual abstractions until applied to a specific occupation and given content by reference to fitness for the performance of that vocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The power of the state to regulate professions and conditions of government employment must not arbitrarily impair the right of the individual to live his private life, apart from his job, as he deems fit. Moreover, since modern hiring practices purport to rest on scientific judgments of fitness for the job involved, a government decision clothed in such terms can seriously inhibit the possibility of the dismissed employee thereafter successfully seeking non-government positions.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> <em>(See Matthews </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>(1901) 23 Ky.LawRep. 750 [63 S.W. 785, 786]; Note (1966) 66 Colum.L.Rev. 719, 720; Note (1952) 52 Colum.L.Rev. 787, 798.) That danger becomes especially acute under circumstances such as the present case in which loss of certification will impose upon petitioner \u201ca \u2018badge of infamy,\u2019 . . . fixing upon him the stigma of an official defamation of character.\u201d <em>(Norton </em>v. <em>Macy, supra, </em>417 F.2d 1161, 1164, fns. 8 &amp; 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Our conclusion affords no guarantee that petitoner\u2019s life diplomas cannot be revoked. If the Board of Education believes that petitioner is unfit to teach, it can reopen its inquiry into the circumstances surrounding and the implications of the 1963 incident with Mr. Schneringer.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The board also has at its disposal ample means to discipline petitioner for future misconduct.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Finally, we do not, of course, hold that homosexuals must be permitted to teach in the public schools of California. As we have explained, the relevant statutes, as well as the applicable principles of constitutional law, require only that the board properly find, pursuant to the precepts set forth in this opinion, that an individual is not fit to teach. Whenever disciplinary action rests upon such grounds and has been confirmed by the judgment of a superior court following an independent review of the evidence,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> this court will uphold the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The judgment of the superior court denying the writ of mandate is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the superior court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Traynor, C. J., Peters, J., and Mosk, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-10\">Section 13202 provides: \u201cThe State Board of Education shall revoke or suspend for immoral or unprofessional conduct, or for persistent defiance of, and refusal to obey, the laws regulating the duties of persons serving in the Public School System, or for any cause which would .-have warranted the denial of an application for a certification .document or the renewal thereof, or for evident unfitness for service, life diplomas, documents, or credentials issued pursuant to this code.\u201d Among the causes warranting denial of such documents is the commission of \u201cany act involving moral turpitude.\" (Ed. Code, \u00a7 13129, subd. (e).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Since the ruling of the state board deprived every local school board of its discretion to decide, upon taking into account special local problems, needs and policies, whether a candidate was fit to teach in its particular area, we must subject the state board\u2019s decision to careful scrutiny.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b310-9\">This delay of almost one year in seeking judicial relief apparently resulted from the board\u2019s failure to provide petitioner with a copy of the transcript of the December 1965 hearing until February 1967.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b310-10\">Neither sodomy (Pen. Code, \u00a7 286), oral copulation (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288a), public solicitation of lewd acts (Pen. Code \u00a7 647, subd. (a) ), loitering near public toilets (Pen. Code, \u00a7 647, subd. (d) ), nor exhibitionism (Pen. Code, \u00a7 314) were involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">Conviction of such offenses would have resulted in the mandatory revocation of all diplomas and life certificates issued by the State Board of Education. (Ed. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12912, 13206, 13207; see also Ed. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13216, 13218, 13255, 13586, and 13742.)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">The Education Code thus draws an important distinction between different types of sexual indiscretions by teachers, dealing with such conduct in two different parts of the code. Conviction of certain sex crimes entails automatic dismissal. (Ed. Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 13192, 13206.) But other sexual misconduct results in discipline only if it is \u201cimmoral,\u201d \u201cunprofessional\u201d or involves \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13202, 13129, subd. (e).) A teacher is entitled to a hearing if charged under section 13202, but not if charged with conviction of a crime under section 13206. <em>DiGenova </em>v. <em>State Board of Education </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 255 [288 P.2d 862].) A rule that homosexual conduct was \u201cimmoral\u201d or \u201cunprofessional\u201d per se would obliterate the distinction between criminal convictions and other sexual misconduct, since discipline for immoral or unprofessional conduct is mandatory, and would substantially reduce the significance of the hearing contemplated by statute. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 13203.) With regard to the possibility of such a per se rule, moreover, we note that the Assembly subcommittee which proposed sections 12912, 13206, 13207, 13216, 13218, 13255, 13586, and 13742 of the Education Code dealing with sex crimes, questioned whether even persons \u201cconvicted of sex offenses\u201d could always be deprived of their teaching credentials under section 13202. (See Report of the Subcommittee on Sex Crimes of the Assembly Interim Committee on Judicial System and Judicial Process, Journal of the Assembly (1952) Second Ex. Sess., pp. 136, 171-175.)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">As to whether non-criminal sexual conduct can be \u201cimmoral\u201d within the meaning of federal civil service regulations, see <em>Pelicone </em>v. <em>Hodges </em>(Dist. Col. 1963) 320 F.2d 754, 757 fn. 8 [116 App. D.C. 32]. The federal government apparently takes the position that even criminal sexual behavior is not ground for dismissal unless it is widely regarded as repugnant. (See Note (1969) 82 Harv.L.Rev. 1738, 1742.) In determining whether discipline is authorized and reasonable, a criminal conviction has no talismanic significance. (See, e.g., <em>Yakov </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 67 [64 Cal.Rptr. 785, 435 P.2d 553]; <em>Lorenz </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 684 [298 P.2d 537]; <em>In re Hollinan </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 243 [272 P.2d 768].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Petitioner\u2019s candor can hardly be held against him.

They also cover much the same conduct as \u201cevident unfitness for service,\u201d which is also a ground for revocation of certificates under section 13202. We noted such redundancy in <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Swan </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 546, 551 [261 P.2d 261].) (See also <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Weiland </em>(1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 808 [4 Cal.Rptr. 286].) This overlap has also been recognized by the Legislature, which has, for example, provided in various contexts that unprofessional conduct includes both gross immorality (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1680, 2361, 3105, and 4350.5, subd.

The precise question before us is this: Did the Board properly revoke petitioner\u2019s life diplomas upon determining that petitioner, while employed as a teacher, had committed homosexual acts and engaged in a homosexual relationship with a fellow teacher and that such acts constituted immoral and unprofessional conduct within the meaning of sections 13202 and 13209 of the Education Code?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The record is clear and without dispute. Petitioner, while employed as a teacher in the Lowell Joint School District, engaged in homosexual acts with Fred Schneringer, also a public schoolteacher. The acts took place in petitioner\u2019s apartment on four separate occasions, over a period of one week, in April 1963; both parties consented. It would serve no useful purpose to describe or detail them except to note that they did not fall within the statutory offenses of sodomy or oral copulation. Nor is it necessary to set forth the somewhat longer history of the relationship between the two men or interpret the overtones of petitioner\u2019s testimony concerning it. Petitioner admitted the commission of the acts and acknowledged that they were homosexual acts; he makes the same admissions on this appeal. Nevertheless it should also be noted that although making these admissions before the hearing officer, petitioner specifically denied that what he had done was an immoral act or unprofessional conduct or \u201ca situation of moral turpitude.\u201d He also testified that he had become a homosexual at the age of 13, that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>had received treatment in his \u201cmid-twenties\u201d before entering the teaching profession and that \u201cthere had been no homosexual contact either desired or actual, from my time of entering the teaching profession until the situation with Fred Schneringer.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">In August 1965 an accustation was filed against petitioner with respondent Board alleging the foregoing incidents or at least one of them<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as cause for the revocation of petitoner\u2019s life diplomas under sections 13202 and 13129 of the Education Code. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11501, 11503.) After a hearing at which petitioner appeared without counsel and testified, the hearing officer found that petitioner had committed acts involving immoral conduct in that (a) he engaged \u201cin unnatural sex acts and practices of a homosexual nature\u201d with Schneringer and (b) engaged \u201cin a homosexual relationship\u201d with the latter; that petitioner committed acts involving moral turpitude; that petitioner\u2019s showing did not establish extenuation or mitigation; that the homosexual relationship developed during a period of time when petitioner was counseling Schneringer with respect to the latter\u2019s marital problems; and that petitioner \u201cdoes not regard his conduct as being censorable, and created the impression from his testimony that he was more concerned about Schneringer\u2019s having terminated the homosexual relation with [petitioner] under circumstances that indicated to respondent that Schneringer preferred female companionship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The hearing officer concluded (under \u201cDetermination of Issues\u201d) that petitioner violated sections 13202 and 13129 of the Education Code in that he (1) \u201cCommitted acts involving moral turpitude; (2) Committed acts involving unprofessional conduct.\u201d Revocation of petitioner\u2019s life diplomas was recommended. On March 11,1966, the Board adopted the decision of the hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">On February 14, 1967, petitioner sought in the superior court a writ of mandate commanding the Board to set aside its decision. In those proceedings, petitioner was represented by the same counsel who appears for him on this appeal. Upon the issuance of an alternative writ, the matter was submitted upon the administrative record which was received in evidence. The trial court, the Honorable Ralph Nutter, Judge, exercising its independent judgment on the evidence (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (c); see <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 907, 913-916 [80 Cal.Rptr. 89, 458 P.2d 33]) found, so far as is here material, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>follows: That the weight of the evidence adduced at the administrative hearing supported the findings of fact and the findings of fact supported the determination of issues; that the decision was fully supported by the findings of fact and the determination of issues; that, upon consideration of the evidence adduced at the administrative hearing, petitioner committed the homosexual acts involved and that \u201c[tjhese acts involved moral turpitude and constituted unprofessional conduct....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The trial court concluded that petitioner committed homosexual acts involving moral turpitude and that such acts constituted immoral and unprofessional conduct within the meaning of sections 13202 and 13209 of the Education Code; and that the action of the Board in revoking the life diplomas was correct \u201cin that petitioner <em>demonstrated he was unfit for service as a teacher </em>in the California public school system within the meaning\u201d (italics added) of the above sections. The court entered judgment discharging the alternative writ and denying the petition for the peremptory writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">On appeal the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division Two, affirmed the denial of mandate in an opinion prepared by Presiding Justice Roth and concurred in by Justice Herndon and Justice Fleming, in which they declared that \u201cwe cannot say there is no rational connection between petitioner\u2019s homosexual conduct and his fitness for service in the public school system.\u201d I am firmly convinced that the superior court and the Court of Appeal correctly disposed of the matter. I must disagree with the analysis proffered by the majority opinion of this court. I would affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Section 13202 of the Education Code which is at the center of this controversy provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe State Board of Education shall revoke or suspend for immoral or unprofessional conduct, ... or for any cause which would have warranted the denial of an application for a certification document or the renewal thereof, or for evident unfitness for service, life diplomas, documents, or credentials issued pursuant to this code.\u201d Section 13129 of the same code provides that the Board \u201c. . . may deny any application for the issuance of a credential or a life diploma . . . made by an applicant who . . . (e) Has committed any act involving moral turpitude. . . .\u201d Although the first section is couched in mandatory terms and the second in permissive terms (\u00a7 36),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I do not think this is an issue since the Board did in fact impose discipline under section 13202.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The crucial question before us is whether the homosexual acts and relationship in which petitioner engaged constituted immoral or unprofessional conduct within the meaning of section 13202.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>We have said that \u201cThe term \u2018immoral\u2019 has been defined generally as that which is hostile to the welfare of the general public and contrary to good morals. Immorality has not been confined to sexual matters, but includes conduct inconsistent with rectitude, or indicative of corruption, indecency, depravity, dissoluteness; or as wilful, flagrant, or shameless conduct showing moral indifference to the opinions of respectable members of the community, and as an inconsiderate attitude toward good order and the public welfare.\u201d <em>(Orloff </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Turf Club </em>(1951) 36 Cal.2d 734, 740 [227 P.2d 449].)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">In <em>Sarac </em>v. <em>State Board of Education </em>(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 58 [57 Cal.Rptr. 69], the court upheld the Board\u2019s revocation of a general secondary teaching credential pursuant to section 13202 upon the rationale that homosexual acts constituted immoral and unprofessional conduct within the compass of that section. In that case the acts were committed on a public beach and the teacher was arrested for violation of Penal Code section 647, subdivision (a), and convicted, on his plea of guilty, of violation of a municipal ordinance. However, the accusation filed before the Board charged that he was unfit for service in the public school system under section 13202 because of his conduct as well as because of the criminal proceedings occasioned by his conduct. There, as in the instant case, the trial court on review of the administrative proceedings concluded that the teacher had committed a homosexual act involving moral turpitude which conduct constituted both immoral and unprofessional conduct within the meaning of section 13202. There, as in the instant case, the trial court concluded that the teacher had <em>demonstrated that he was unfit for service in the public school system. </em>There, as in the instant case, on appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of a writ of mandate, the teacher challenged the Board\u2019s action on the ground among others that it had failed to establish any rational connection between his homosexual conduct and \u201c. . . immorality and unprofessional conduct as a teacher on his part and his fitness for service in the public schools;. . .\u201d (249 Cal.App.2d at p. 62.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The court\u2019s rejection of the appeal in that case is a convincing answer to the question now confronting us: \u201c. . . Homosexual behavior has long been contrary and abhorrent to the social mores and moral standards of the people of California as it has been since antiquity to those of many other peoples. It is clearly, therefore, immoral conduct within the meaning of Education Code, section 13202. It may also constitute unprofessional conduct within the meaning of that same statute as such conduct is not limited to classroom misconduct or misconduct with children. (See <em>Beilan </em>v. <em>Board of Public Education, </em>357 U.S. 399, 406-408 [2 L.Ed.2d 1414, 78 S.Ct. 1317].) It certainly constitutes evident unfitness for service in the public school system within the meaning of that statute. (Cf. Ed. Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 13206-13208.) In view of appellant\u2019s statutory duty as a teacher to \u2018endeavor to impress upon the minds of the pupils the principles of morality\u2019 (Ed. Code, \u00a7 7851) and his necessarily close association with children in the discharge of his professional duties as a teacher, there is to our minds an obvious rational connection between his homosexual conduct on the beach and the consequent action of respondent in revoking his secondary teaching credential on the statutory grounds of immoral and unprofessional conduct and evident unfitness for service in the public school system of this state.\u201d (249 Cal.App.2d at pp. 63-64.)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The majority argue that <em>Sarac </em>is distinguishable from the instant case on its facts. It is asserted that the teacher\u2019s homosexual conduct occurred on a public beach, whereas this petitioner\u2019s conduct occurred in the privacy of his apartment. Apparently this asserted difference reflects the view that, absent a criminal offense, petitioner\u2019s private life is his own business and the state \u201c. . . must not arbitrarily impair the right of the individual to live his private life, apart from his job, as he deems fit. . . .\u201d But the clandestine character of petitioner\u2019s acts did not render them any the less homosexual acts. These still remained, to borrow the language of <em>Sarac </em>\u201c. . . contrary and abhorrent to the social mores and moral standards of the people of California. . . .\u201d <em>(Sarac </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, supra, </em>249 Cal.App.2d 58, 63.) It would be fatuous to assume that such acts became reprehensible only if committed in public. One would not expect petitioner and Schneringer to commit the acts here involved (which, as I have said, need not be detailed) in full view of the citizenry.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">It is also asserted by the majority that the teacher in <em>Sarac </em>pleaded guilty to and was convicted of a criminal charge. However, as I have pointed out, the accusation filed with the Board, in that case was based primarily on the teacher\u2019s homosexual conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, it is manifest from the opinion in <em>Sarac, </em>that it was the teacher\u2019s homosexual conduct, apart from his subsequent arrest, which fell within the compass of section 13202 and warranted revocation of his credentials. <em>(Sarac </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, supra, </em>249 Cal.App.2d 58, 62-63.) Nowhere in the statute is there a <em>requirement that the conduct must </em>constitute a crime before the diploma or credential can be suspended or revoked. In fact other sections of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Education Code provide for the revocation of any credential for conviction of specified crimes (\u00a7 13206)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or sex offenses (\u00a7 13207).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, not only from an examination of the language of the sections but also from a consideration of the sections in the light of the full statutory pattern, it is clear that sections 13202 and 13129 apply to a teacher\u2019s immoral and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>unprofessional conduct and to his acts of moral turpitude, even though such conduct does not constitute a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The court in <em>Sarac </em>also sustained the trial court\u2019s finding that the homosexual act there committed was one involving moral turpitude. As already stated, a similar finding and determination were made in the instant matter not only in the administrative proceedings but also in the superior court proceedings on review. The determination is unassailable. Although we have recognized on occasion that the problem of defining moral turpitude is not without difficulty <em>(In re Hallinan </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 243, 247 [272 P.2d 768]; <em>In re Hatch </em>(1937) 10 Cal.2d 147, 150-151 [73 P.2d 885]), nevertheless this court has for many years followed the lodestar of <em>Matter of Coffey </em>(1899) 123 Cal. 522, 524 [56 P. 448], which relying on <em>Bouvier, </em>defined moral turpitude as \u201c. . . everything done contrary to justice, honesty, modesty or good morals. . . .\u201d (See for example: <em>Marlowe </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 304, 308 [46 Cal.Rptr. 326, 405 P.2d 150]; <em>Arden </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 310, 321 [341 P.2d 6]; <em>Call </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 104, 109 [287 P.2d 761]; <em>In re McAllister. </em>(1939) 14 Cal.2d 602, 603 [95 P.2d 932]; <em>In re Hatch, supra, </em>10 Cal.2d 147, 150-151 [73 P.2d 885]; <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1933) 219 Cal. 59, 64 [25 P.2d 401]; <em>Lantz </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1931) 212 Cal. 213, 218 [298 P. 497].)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\"><em>In In re Boyd </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 69 [307 P.2d 625] this court ordered the suspension from the practice of law of an attorney convicted on his plea of guilty of a violation of former Penal Code section 647, subdivision 5, providing that \u201c . . . [e]very lewd or dissolute person is a vagrant. . . .\u201d The court held that the acts constituting the offense in question involved moral turpitude, declaring: \u201cMoral turpitude has been defined as: \u2018An act of baseness, vileness, or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellow men or to society in general, contrary.to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and man.\u2019 [Citations.] [Par.] No citation of authority or argument is needed to support the conclusion that the conduct of petitioner fell within the purview of the above definition. His offense was one of depravity, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and man, and was therefore an offense involving moral turpitude. The act was committed in a public place. Without further recitation of the facts, it is enough to say that such conduct is unworthy of a member of the legal profession.\u201d (48 Cal.2d at p. 70.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">If the foregoing applies to an attorney whose professional contacts presumably are almost invariably with adults, how much more significant is the rationale when applied to a school teacher whose professional duties are directed exclusively towards the <em>moral </em>as well as the intellectual, social and civic development of young and impressionable minds. Section 13556.5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>enjoins all teachers to . . endeavor to impress upon the minds of the pupils the principles of <em>morality, </em>truth, justice, patriotism. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Quite apart from this statutory mandate, petitioner stood <em>in loco parentis; </em>his young charges looked to him as the person taking the place of their parents during school hours. They looked to him not only for explicit words of guidance but as an example of good conduct. Nevertheless, as the board and the trail court determined, he not only was a potential danger to them because of his immoral acts but especially so because of his insistence that such acts which he frankly admitted, were not in his view immoral at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">In view of the foregoing, as I have already said, I am in agreement with the trial court and the Court of Appeal, and like them, I cannot say on this record that there is no rational connection between petitioner\u2019s homosexual acts and his fitness for service in the public school system.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">A considerable part of the majority opinion is devoted to a consideration of the terms \u201cimmoral conduct,\u201d \u201cunprofessional conduct,\u201d and \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d in a wide variety of contexts other than that of the teaching profession and in reference to numerous occupations having no relevance to the instant problem, which need not be enumerated and require no attention other than to say they cover a range from barbers to veterinarians. After a survey of this catalogue, the majority posit the following views, among others: That in using the above-quoted terms, \u201cthe Legislature surely did not mean to endow the employing agency with the power to dismiss any employee whose personal, private conduct incurred its disapproval\u201d; that unless a reasonable and restrictive interpretation of the term is adopted, the statutes before us would possibly \u201csubject to discipline virtually every teacher in the state\u201d; that the Legislature for example did not intend to compel disciplinary action against teachers for \u201cpeccadillos\u201d or \u201cpassing conduct\u201d if it \u201cdid not affect students or fellow teachers\u201d; that \u201cincidents of extramarital heterosexual conduct against a background of years of satisfactory teaching would not constitute \u2018immoral conduct\u2019 sufficient to justify revocation of a life diploma without any showing of an adverse effect on fitness to teach\u201d; that by enacting section 13202 the Legislature did not intend \u201cto establish a standard for the conduct of teachers that might vary widely with time, location, and the popular mood\u201d; that the meaning of the above terms \u201cmust depend upon, and thus relate to, the occupation involved. . . .\u201d; and that the Board \u201ccannot abstractly characterize the conduct in this case as \u2018immoral,\u2019 \u2018unprofessional,\u2019 or \u2018involving moral turpitude.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Finally from this extensive disquisition the majority arrive at the conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>sion that \u201cPetitioner\u2019s actions cannot constitute immoral or unprofessional conduct or conduct involving moral turpitude within the meaning of section. 13202 unless those actions indicate his unfitness to teach.\u201d But, assuming arguendo that this thesis has some validity, while reserving full acceptance of the opinion\u2019s ethical relativism, the plain, hard fact of the matter is that petitioner\u2019s conduct <em>did </em>indicate his unfitness to teach\u2014indeed as the learned trial judge <em>determined:\u2014demonstrated </em>that petitioner <em>was </em>unfit for service as a teacher in the public schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Faced with this decision made by the Board with its expertise in educational matters upon a record vividly disclosing the homosexual acts involved, the majority nevertheless maintain that the record \u201ccontains no evidence whatsoever\u201d indicating petitioner\u2019s unfitness to teach. Initially they assert that the Board called no medical, psychological, or psychiatric experts for an opinion as to the likelihood of petitioner\u2019s repeating the acts. Nowhere do I find in the Education Code, nor does the majority point out, that such evidence is indispensable to proceedings under the statute. The majority further argue that the Board offered no evidence that petitioner would be more likely to act improperly towards a student \u201cthan the average adult male\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and no evidence as to whether \u201cpetitioner might publicly advocate improper conduct.\u201d The majority opinion also asserts that no evidence was produced that petitioner failed to impress on the minds of his pupils the principles of morality as required by former section 7851. I am afraid that in all of this my colleagues of the majority lose sight of the fact that we are reviewing the record as brought before us, not the record which might have been more to their liking.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Petitioner made no attempt to introduce any of the evidence which.the majority now deem so crucial and even indispensable and the Board found that the showing he did make did not establish extenuation or mitigation. While I realize that he chose to appear before the Board without counsel, nevertheless he did have counsel at all times during the proceedings in the trial court. Nevertheless at no time in the trial court did he offer to produce any additional evidence (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (d); see also <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 907, 914, fn. 10 and accompanying text), much less any evidence which the majority deem so essential, contenting himself with submitting the matter on the administrative transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Finally, I point out that, if the record of the procedures before the Board and the superior court were as defective as the majority would make it out to be in that it lacks \u201cessential factual premises\u201d and contains \u201cerroneous findings and conclusions,\u201d petitioner\u2019s counsel made no effort to bring such defects or errors to the attention of the trial court by appropriate objections or requests for specific findings (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 634) or to move for a new trial, (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 657) or to move to vacate the judgment and enter a different judgment (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 663). A short answer to all this is that, as two reviewing courts have already determined, the record is not inadequate, is free of error, and is fully supportive of the Board\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">In sum, the majority opinion boils down to this: \u201c. . . the Board failed to show that petitioner\u2019s conduct in any manner affected his performance as a teacher\u201d and \u201cpetitioner is entitled to a careful and reasoned inquiry into his fitness to teach by the Board of Education before he is deprived of his right to pursue his profession.\u201d Taking this position, the majority remand this case to the superior court presumably, although they do not say so, to be remanded by that court in turn to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">I feel it my duty to observe, with all due respect to the majority, that this action is taken without proper recognition of our function of review in cases of administrative boards as recently spelled out by this court unanimously in the <em>Merrill </em>case. (See <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 907.) To recapitulate: The Board in this case found on overwhelming evidence, indeed on the frank but unrepentent admissions of petitioner, that he had committed homosexual acts with another teacher and concluded that these acts constituted immoral and unprofessional conduct and acts involving moral turpitude. The trial court reached the same conclusion. The majority opinion is silent on this point. Yet I would respectfully suggest that it is an essential step in any process of reasoning which seeks to strike down the Board\u2019s action. Were petitioner\u2019s acts immoral or not? Or was he perhaps correct after all in maintaining they were not? The majority do not answer this question; nevertheless they reverse the judgment and remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings. I would think that under the circumstances the question should be answered for the guidance of the court below on retrial; that court, as well as the Board, should be told whether or not they were in error in concluding that petitioner\u2019s homosexual acts were immoral and involved moral turpitude. As I said at the beginning, this is the pivotal question and I think it was correctly answered by the Board, the trial judge and the three appellate justices.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">This brings me to the next step in the record. The Board, possessing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>expertise in passing upon the fitness of teachers for the public school system and having the petitioner before it, hearing his testimony, and reviewing his immoral and unprofessional conduct, determined that he was unfit and revoked his diplomas. The trial court, reviewing' this administrative record which petitioner chose not to augment, arrived at the same findings and conclusions, and found or concluded (it makes little difference how we categorize it) that petitioner had demonstrated his unfitness and that the decision of the Board was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Finally, I am unable to understand how the majority can reject the pertinent precedent and compelling rationale of the <em>Sarac </em>case <em>(Sarac </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, supra, </em>249 Cal.App.2d 58) as being distinguishable, which it is not, and embrace the out-of-state decision of <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Macy </em>(D.C. Cir. 1969) 417 F.2d 1161 as one closely resembling the instant case, which it definitely does not. <em>Norton </em>involved a federal employee charged with off-duty homosexual conduct. He was not a school teacher, much less one who had committed the acts with a fellow teacher; he was not, like this petitioner, a person charged with the responsibility of impressing the principles of morality on young minds; so far as appears, he had no dealings with children at all, nor, so far as appears, was he a person like petitioner, who while frankly admitting homosexual acts, insisted nevertheless that he had done nothing immoral. In <em>Norton </em>the court stated that \u201cthe employer agency must demonstrate some \u2018rational basis\u2019 for its conclusion that a discharge \u2018will promote the efficiency of the service.\u2019 \u2018The ultimate criterion [is] whether the employer acted reasonably. . . .\u2019 \u201d It found the dismissal arbitrary because the employer had shown no such basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In the instant case, both the Board and the trial court concluded that petitioner was unfit. I cannot say there is no rational connection between petitioner\u2019s homosexual acts and his fitness to teach. As the trial court properly determined, the Board\u2019s findings were supported by the weight of the evidence and its determination of the issues was supported by its findings. The Board, therefore, did not abuse its discretion. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (c).) We have no right to upset its action. I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">McComb, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-10\">Hereafter, unless otherwise indicated, all section references are to the Education Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b333-7\">At the time of the administrative hearing in December 1965 petitioner was 39 years old which would indicate he was about 37 years old at the time of the acts involved.

Yet no factual or evidentiary issues are presented to a reviewing court by this case; it is agreed that the facts found by the State Board of Education are supported by the evidence produced before it. The majority\u2019s reversal of the board\u2019s action, therefore, must be viewed as a ruling on a question of law, that is, a holding that on the facts found here it is error to conclude that immoral or unprofessional acts were committed or that the acts that were committed involved moral turpitude. I do not agree with that conclusion for it is evident to me that the State Board of Education properly exercised the statutory discretion vested in it in this case and that its decision should be sustained on judicial review in any court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Beyond that issue, however, lie the continuing difficulties inherent in a system of judicial review that requires courts to reweigh the evidentiary matters that are presented to it in the cold record of an administrative proceeding. This case, and other recent cases,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> have involved the courts in the untenable position of attempting to assess factual issues of conduct, motive and intent that could better be left to the governmental agencies upon whom the discretion has been conferred by the Legislature. I acknowledge, of course, the statutory requirement for reweighing evidence under which trial courts must now conduct the judicial review of some administrative actions (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5), but that category of proceedings was created and is defined by this court\u2019s opinions in the field of constitutional law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After long and earnest consideration of the matter I must express my own conviction that neither the Constitution of the United States nor the Constitution of the State of California compels any such result.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In California, unlike most other jurisdictions, trial courts are presently required to exercise their own independent judgment, based upon the weight of the evidence, in reviewing those decisions of statewide, legislatively created administrative agencies that are alleged to deprive one of his \u201cvested rights.\u201d However, our trial courts are permitted to employ the ordinary substantial evidence review of all other administrative decisions, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the rulings of \u201clocal agences\u201d* <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and statewide agencies constitutionally empowered to exercise \u201cjudicial functions,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> **even if their rulings affect \u201cvested rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Apart from the artificiality of any distinction which makes the applicable scope of review dependent upon the type of agency involved and the type of rights affected, each of the above-quoted phrases has raised its own peculiar interpretive problems, thereby requiring an undesirable \u201ccase-by-case\u201d approach to deciding what kind of judicial review is appropriate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A return<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to uniform use of substantial evidence review of administrative decisions would eliminate these unworkable distinctions, and would assure that administrative expertise and discretion in factfinding are given the weight and consideration accorded by courts in other jurisdictions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Our courts could then perform the function courts perform elsewhere, that of ruling on issues of law, including the question of whether administrative orders are supported by substantial evidence, except in cases where the Legislature provides for a judicial reweighing of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">McComb, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Compare <em>Yakov </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 67 [64 Cal.Rptr. 785, 435 P.2d 553].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\">See Tenth Biennial Report, Judicial Council of California (1945) pp. 139-143.
