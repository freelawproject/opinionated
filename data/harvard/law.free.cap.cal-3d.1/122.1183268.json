He was sentenced to death by a jury, and on appeal this court affirmed the judgment in its entirety. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tahl </em>(1967) 65 Cal.2d 719 [56 Cal.Rptr. 318, 423 P.2d 246].)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">In this habeas corpus proceeding petitioner contends (1) that his guilty plea was not made voluntarily and with full understanding of its consequences; and (2) that the manner of selection of the jury for the penalty phase of his trial was in violation of the standards subsequently established in <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 510 [20 L.Ed.2d 776, 88 S.Ct. 1770]. We conclude that petitioner\u2019s first contention lacks merit, but his second requires a reversal of his death sentence and a new penalty trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">Petitioner contends that the trial court failed to inform him of the nature and consequences of his guilty plea, and that he at no time expressly waived his right to a jury trial or any other constitutional right. Whether or not petitioner is factually, correct, we cannot agree with his legal conclusion that the guilty plea was therefore rendered invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">Following initial pleas of \u201cnot guilty\u201d on all counts, empanelment of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>jury, and the prosecuting attorney\u2019s opening statement to the jury, petitioner asked for and received the trial court\u2019s permission to withdraw his pleas and enter pleas of \u201cguilty\u201d in their stead. The trial judge questioned petitioner and his attorney at length regarding these changed pleas; the significant portions of the colloquy among the trial court, petitioner, and his attorney are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is apparent that petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>rights were waived more by inference than by express language. Whether such a record is sufficient to indicate a voluntary and understanding plea and an intelligent waiver of rights depends upon the standards which we must apply. As will be seen, these standards, fairly well established at the time of petitioner\u2019s conviction, have been altered since that time. It will be necessary to examine first the law as it existed when petitioner pleaded guilty, and then the extent to which that law has been changed by recent Supreme Court pronouncements and the effect, if any, of those changes on petitioner\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Several states and the federal courts have developed over the years an extensive body of law regarding the procedural requirements for acceptance of a guilty plea. (E.g., <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 459 [22 L.Ed.2d 418, 89 S.Ct. 1166]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bumpus </em>(1959) 355 Mich. 374 [94 N.W.2d 854]; <em>Rudolph </em>v. <em>State </em>(1925) 32 Okla. Crim. 265 [240 P. 761]; <em>Commonwealth </em>ex rel. <em>West </em>v. <em>Rundle </em>(1968) 428 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Pa. 102 [237 A.2d 196]; Annot. (1964) 97 A.L.R.2d 549.) Either by statute, by case law, or by court rule, these jurisdictions have generally established the principle that before accepting a guilty plea a trial court must be satisfied that the accused understands and freely waives his constitutional rights, especially his rights to counsel and to a jury trial, and further understands the nature of the charge against him and the consequences of his plea of guilty. While courts have stressed the desirability of an affirmative showing on the record as to waiver of rights and understanding of consequences (see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>ex rel. <em>West </em>v. <em>Rundle, supra, </em>at pp. 197-198), no specific language is usually prescribed, the court looking to the overall record and the surrounding circumstances to ascertain the voluntary nature of the plea. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Doyle </em>(1960) 20 Ill.2d 163 [169 N.E.2d 250]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bumpus, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">California law provides relatively few pronouncements, either legislative or judicial, regarding the acceptance of a guilty plea; but such authorities as exist appear to be in general agreement with the rules in other jurisdictions. Any variance tilts somewhat toward more tolerance and less precision. A review of these authorities convinces us that the guilty plea in the instant case was in conformity with then existing California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The most recent definitive statement by this court is found in <em>People </em>v. <em>Mendez </em>(1945) 27 Cal.2d 20 [161 P.2d 929], in which we stated unequivocally that \u201cThere is no statutory requirement in this state that any special admonition be given by the court when accepting a plea of guilty.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 22.) As that case demonstrates, there was also no judicially imposed requirement of any admonition. The trial court in <em>Mendez, </em>after an abbreviated colloquy with the defendant, determined that the defendant had \u201cadvised with counsel,\u201d and concluded that the plea was thus free and voluntary. There was neither an inquiry or explanation by the trial court nor an express waiver by the defendant of specific rights; and the court did not enumerate in detail the nature of the charge or the consequences of a guilty plea.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Manifestly the examination of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>ant was briefer than that undertaken in the instant case. Yet the <em>Mendez </em>court concluded that \u201cThe [trial] court\u2019s acceptance of the plea after such examination cannot be deemed to have prejudiced the defendant\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Emigh </em>(1959) 174 Cal.App.2d 392 [344 P.2d 851], a similar record appears. The defendant pleaded \u201cnot guilty by reason of insanity,\u201d a plea which admits commission of the offense itself. Defense counsel stated that the defendant was aware of his rights; the court inquired of defendant if this was correct, and the defendant replied, \u201cYes.\u201d The court then asked the defendant whether he knew the nature of the charge, and upon receiving an affirmative reply accepted the insanity plea. On appeal, the defendant contended he should have been informed of his rights to a speedy trial; a public trial; counsel at all stages of the proceedings; freedom from double jeopardy, self-incrimination, and unlawful search and seizure; a jury trial; and confrontation of his accusers. Only his right to a jury trial had apparently been expressly waived. The Court of Appeal stated, at page 395: \u201cThe other rights enumerated by [the defendant] were rights <em>that would be protected by counsel. </em>There is no statutory provision which requires that the accused in a criminal case who is represented by counsel be informed as to all his rights. . . . [A]nd where an accused is represented by counsel the court is not under a duty to inform the accused of the effect of such pleas.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The transcendent importance under California law\u2014as well as that of other jurisdictions\u2014of the presence of counsel at the time of a plea was also emphasized in <em>People </em>v. <em>Loeber </em>(1958) 158 Cal.App.2d 730 [323 P.2d 136] (hearing denied), in'which the defendant claimed the trial court had failed to advise him of the consequences of his guilty plea. The Court of Appeal replied, \u201cThe trial court was not required to so \u2018admonish\u2019 [the defendant]. . . . Furthermore, the record also shows that when [the defendant] entered his pleas in the municipal court he was represented by counsel, <em>who presumably informed him </em>of the consequences of the plea entered.\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 735-736; see also <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Cox </em>(10th Cir. 1965) 350 F.2d 847, 849; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Von der Heide </em>(D.D.C. 1959) 169 F.Supp. 560, 566.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Thus the crucial factor has generally been the presence of counsel. In a capital case California law does not allow a plea of guilty without counsel; and for lesser offenses counsel must be clearly and expressly waived, a provision our courts scrupulously enforce. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1018; <em>In re Johnson </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 325 [42 Cal.Rptr. 228, 398 P.2d 420]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ector </em>(1965) 231 Cal.App.2d 619 [42 Cal.Rptr. 388].) It is for good reason that the prerequisites for acceptance of a guilty plea are far less precise when counsel is present than when he is not, and the rules regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>waiver of counsel are more stringent than those regarding waiver of most other rights. If an accused has counsel, courts have generally assumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, counsel will perform his duty as an advocate and an officer of the court to inform the accused of and take steps to protect the other rights afforded by the law; whereas if he is without counsel courts have not assumed, again in the absence of a clear showing to the contrary, that the accused will be \u201csufficiently articulate and adequately conversant with his constitutional and legal rights and his procedural duties to protect himself throughout the course of criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mattson </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 777, 789 [336 P.2d 937]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Evanson </em>(1968) 265 Cal.App.2d 698, 701 [71 Cal.Rptr. 503] (hearing denied).) Thus the California rule has been stated as follows: \u201cThe court must inform the defendant of his right to counsel, but need not inform him of the consequences of his plea; that is the responsibility of his counsel, not the court.\u201d (Witkin, Cal. Criminal Procedure (1963) \u00a7 253, p. 234.)</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In light of these authorities, it is clear that the trial court here adequately examined petitioner prior to accepting his plea of guilty. In fact, rather than simply presuming from the presence of counsel that petitioner had been informed of his rights, the court specifically ascertained from petitioner that he had in fact conferred with counsel as to his rights and the nature of his plea to the charge.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We do not mean to imply that the trial court could not have undertaken a more searching examination on the record before accepting the plea; an overabundance of caution is never inappropriate when an accused\u2019s rights are in the balance. Indeed, a doubt arises whether a record such as this would be adequate under the recent standards prescribed by the United States Supreme Court, discussed <em>infra. </em>We conclude only that, under California law as it existed at the time of petitioner\u2019s plea, the examination by the trial court was sufficient and the plea was procedurally valid.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">We turn next to ascertain whether the law in effect at the time of petitioner\u2019s plea retains its vitality today.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>In the recent case of <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 238 [23 L.Ed.2d 274, 89 S.Ct. 1709], the United States Supreme Court held it could not be assumed from a silent record that a guilty plea had been voluntarily made and that the constitutional rights necessarily forfeited by such a plea had been freely and intelligently waived. We conclude, however, that <em>Boykin </em>must be applied prospectively only and thus cannot be of aid to Tahl.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">In <em>Boykin </em>the defendant pleaded guilty to five counts of armed robbery and was sentenced to death, a permissible' penalty for robbery under Alabama law. Although the defendant was represented, by court-appointed counsel, the record was \u201cwholly silent\u201d as to any questions by the court or statements by the defendant regarding his plea. The Supreme Court concluded that \u201c[I]t was error ... for the trial judge to accept petitioner\u2019s guilty plea without an affirmative showing that it was intelligent and voluntary.\u201d (395 U.S. at p. 242 [23 L.Ed.2d at p. 279].) The court\u2019s rationale is expressed in this manner:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u201cSeveral federal constitutional rights are involved in a waiver that takes place when a plea of guilty is entered in a state criminal trial. First, is the privilege . against compulsory self-incrimination. . . . [Citations.] Second, is the right to trial by jury. [Citation.] Third, is the right to confront one\u2019s accusers. [Citation.] We cannot presume a waiver of these three important federal rights from a silent record.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u201cWhat is at stake for an accused facing death or imprisonment demands the utmost solicitude of which courts are capable in canvassing the matter with the accused to make sure he has a full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence. When the judge discharges that function, he leaves a record adequate for any review that may be later sought [citations], and forestalls the spin-off of collateral proceedings that seek to probe murky memories.\u201d (395 U.S. at pp. 243-244 [23 L.Ed.2d at p. 280].)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The quoted language, while not establishing precise guidelines, makes clear that a plea of guilty cannot stand unless the record in some manner indicates a free and intelligent waiver of the three enumerated rights necessarily abandoned by a guilty plea and an understanding of the nature and consequences of the plea. Clearly the judge\u2019s active participation \u201cin canvassing the matter with the accused\u201d is essential, and a fortiori a silent record is insufficient. The troublesome question is the type and quantum of affirmative record required to satisfy the newly prescribed constitutional standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">There are at least two plausible interpretations of <em>Boykin. </em>First, it may be sufficient that there are statements and facts in the record from which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>reasonable presumption could be drawn that a defendant has been apprised of and has voluntarily waived his rights, and has intelligently pleaded guilty. The record in the instant case might well support such a presumption, based largely on the circumstances surrounding petitioner\u2019s plea, including but not limited to the presence of and statements by counsel. It is clear from the record, for example, that petitioner knew the nature of the charge and the consequences of his plea: he was present at the <em>voir dire </em>examination of prospective jurors, during which the indictment was read in substance and the possibility of the death penalty was announced by the prosecution and made the subject of an extensive inquiry of the jurors. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Murray </em>(1967) 247 Cal.App.2d 730, 733 [56 Cal.Rptr. 21]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Doyle </em>(1960) <em>supra, </em>169 N.E.2d 250, 252.) In addition, petitioner was asked whether he understood \u201cthe nature of the charges,\u201d to which he answered, \u201cYes, sir, I do.\u201d As to the degree of the crime, the court, at the prosecutor\u2019s behest, inquired, \u201cThis has been explained to you, about murder in the first degree if it\u2019s committed while committing a robbery? You understand that, is that right, Mr. Tahl?\u201d Petitioner replied, \u201cYes,\u201d and agreed that the murder was first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Similarly we can presume petitioner was advised of his rights of confrontation and against self-incrimination from his acknowledgment that his attorney had explained his \u201cconstitutional rights\u201d to him. However, there was an apparent deficiency regarding a specific waiver of petitioner\u2019s right to a jury trial, since in California such a waiver must be expressed <em>in words by the defendant </em>and cannot be implied from the defendant\u2019s conduct. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7; <em>People </em>v. <em>Holmes </em>(1960) <em>supra, </em>54 Cal.2d 442; <em>People </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(1959) 170 Cal.App.2d 159 [338 P.2d 536]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>McDaniel </em>(1958) 157 Cal.App.2d 492 [321 P.2d 497]; see fn. 4, <em>ante.) </em>Waiver by counsel is not sufficient; a fortiori, having been \u201cadvised\u201d by counsel is not sufficient. On the other hand, there can be little dispute under the unusual circumstances of this case that the record demonstrates petitioner actually knew of his right to a jury, since a jury had already been empaneled when he changed his plea. To Tahl, a jury was not an esoteric concept but an existential reality in the guise of 12 identifiable veniremen before whom he stood face to face. But if it is now necessary that an accused specifically waive his right to a jury, California law would seem to require some express courtroom statement by the accused and to preclude waiver by even the most redoubtable inference from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">However, we need not resolve this specific issue since it is our view that <em>Boykin </em>necessitates a more precise showing on all phases of a guilty plea than mere inferences however plausibly drawn from circumstances on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the record. Thus we reach the second possible interpretation of <em>Boykin: </em>that each of the three rights mentioned\u2014self-incrimination, confrontation, and jury trial\u2014must be specifically and expressly enumerated for the benefit of and waived by the accused prior to acceptance of his guilty plea. This, the People concede, was not done in the instant case. While the <em>Boy-kin </em>text contains no such requirement in express terms, we believe it is not only a fair inference from the opinion\u2014especially in light of the court\u2019s references therein to the recently strengthened federal guidelines (see <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969) <em>supra, </em>394 U.S. 459)\u2014but it is the only realistic means of assuring that \u201cthe judge . . . leaves a record adequate for any review that may be later sought.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">This does not require the recitation of a formula by rote or the spelling out of every detail by the trial court. It does mean that the record must contain <em>on its face </em>direct evidence that the accused was aware, or made aware, of his right to confrontation, to a jury trial, and against self-incrimination, as well as the nature of the charge and the consequences of his plea. Each must be enumerated and responses elicited from the person of the defendant. Because mere inference is no longer sufficient, the presence of an attorney cannot alone satisfy these requirements; as noted, the defendant in <em>Boykin </em>was represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">However, where, as here, the accused has been present at <em>voir dire </em>and has heard the indictment read and the consequences in terms of penalty discussed, the court would not necessarily be expected to repeat each of those matters verbatim, a brief examination to ascertain defendant\u2019s understanding being sufficient. While much remains within the trial court\u2019s discretion, in light of the importance of the rights involved and the consequent exactitude with which constitutional guarantees must necessarily be protected, a trial court would be well advised to err on the side of caution and employ the time necessary to explain adequately and to obtain express waiver of the rights involved. At stake is the protection of both the accused and the People, the latter by the assurance that an otherwise sound conviction will not fall due to an inadequate record.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">As we have indicated, an express waiver on the record has long been required in regard to the right to a jury trial; there appears no sound reason why the court should not likewise advise the accused as to, and obtain an express waiver of, his rights to confrontation and against self-incrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>prior to acceptance of his plea of guilty. We have no doubt that in the course of a trial a waiver of constitutional rights may be implied and need not necessarily be preceded by a full explanation of each right and its consequences. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Evanson </em>(1968) <em>supra, </em>265 Cal.App.2d 698, 701-702.) But in proceedings related to a formal plea, at which time the court is required at a minimum to ascertain whether the plea is knowingly made without threat or inducement, it is salutary for the court at the same time to explain the full import of his guilty plea to the accused. Something short of this procedure <em>may, </em>in a proper context, be held sufficient; on that we need not rule today.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, in this <em>post-Boykin </em>milieu courts and prosecutors are forewarned and will be well advised to avoid any such uncertainty and to produce for the record the required information. Similar advice, given the bench and bar of Pennsylvania in <em>Commonwealth </em>ex rel. <em>West </em>v. <em>Rundle </em>(1968) <em>supra, </em>237 A.2d 196, 197-198, was quoted with approval in the <em>Boykin </em>opinion. (395 U.S. at p. 244, fn. 7 [23 L.Ed.2d at p. 280].) It is good advice, and we adopt it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">As already indicated, we believe that <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>and any new procedures dictated by that decision should be given only prospective application. This determination is based on a consideration of the standards for retroactivity recently delineated by the Supreme Court, notably in <em>Halliday </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 831 [23 L.Ed.2d 16, 89 S.Ct. 1498]. <em>Halliday </em>denied retroactivity to <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969) <em>supra, </em>394 U.S. 459, in which the requirements of rule 11 of the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding acceptance of a guilty plea were held to be mandatory; a violation of rule 11 necessitates that the guilty plea be set aside.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">In concluding that <em>McCarthy </em>should apply only to guilty pleas accepted subsequent to that decision, the court relied on its recently developed three criteria for determining retroactivity of constitutional rulings:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201c(1) the purpose of the new rule; (2) the extent of reliance upon the old rule; and (3) the effect retroactive application would have upon the administration of justice.\" (394 U.S. at p. 832 [23 L.Ed.2d at p. 19].) The court then explained the purposes of <em>McCarthy, </em>to assure application of the procedural safeguards of the rule and to provide a \u201ccomplete record\u201d for a \u201cmore expeditious disposition of a post-conviction attack on the plea.\u201d Similar purposes are expressed in <em>Boykin, </em>the gist of the constitutional defect there being a silent record, inutile on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">After pointing out that a defendant could attack an involuntary plea even in the absence of compliance with rule 11 by the trial court\u2014as can a state defendant whose plea was accepted prior to <em>Boykin </em>(cf. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(1966) <em>supra, </em>384 U.S. 719, 730 [16 L.Ed.2d 882, 890, 86 S.Ct. 1772])\u2014the <em>Halliday </em>court explained what it obviously considered the most significant factors under the circumstances\u2014reliance on the old rule and the effect on the administration of justice\u2014as follows: \u201cIn <em>McCarthy </em>we noted that the practice we were requiring had been previously followed by only one Circuit; that over 85% of all convictions in the federal courts are obtained pursuant to guilty pleas; and that prior to Rule 1 l\u2019s recent amendment, not all district judges personally questioned defendants before accepting their guilty pleas. Thus, in view of the general application of Rule 11 in a manner inconsistent with our holding in <em>McCarthy, </em>and in view of the large number of constitutionally valid convictions that may have been obtained without full compliance with Rule 11, we decline to apply <em>McCarthy </em>retroactively.\u201d (394 U.S. at p. 833 [23 L.Ed.2d at p. 20].)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>As indicated above, the prior practice in this and many other jurisdictions, upon which trial courts and prosecutors justifiably relied for decades, included the substance but not the form of the <em>Boykin </em>requirements as we have interpreted them. In addition, while we endorse the Supreme Court\u2019s determination that more explicit proceedings are both necessary and desirable to assure the utmost constitutional protection to an accused, we also must recognize that a \u201clarge number of constitutionally valid convictions . . . may have been obtained\u201d\u2014and indeed were obtained\u2014under the previous practice.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To invalidate all such prior guilty pleas years and decades after their acceptance would have a dolorous effect upon the administration of justice. (See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(1966) <em>supra, </em>384 U.S. 719, 731 [16 L.Ed.2d 882, 891, 86 S.Ct. 1772].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In light of these combined legal and pragmatic factors, we believe <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>and the procedures adopted herein must be given prospective application only , i.e., to those cases in which pleas were entered subsequent to the effective date of that decision.  As petitioner pleaded guilty well prior to that date, and we have determined his plea to be voluntary and in conformity with then prevailing California law and practice, petitioner\u2019s procedural attack on his plea must fail. As petitioner makes no other substantial allegation that his plea was involuntary, his conviction must be upheld.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Finally, we consider petitioner\u2019s contention that the jury selection violated the standards established in <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1968) <em>supra, </em>391 U.S. 510. We agree, and remand the case for a new trial on the issue of penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In <em>Witherspoon </em>the United States Supreme Court, recognizing that a jury which excludes all those persons with some bias against the death penalty \u201ccannot perform the task [of determination of penalty] demanded of it,\u201d announced the retroactive rule that a death penalty imposed by such a death-oriented jury cannot stand. \u201cA man who opposes the death penalty, no less than one who favors it, can make the discretionary judgment entrusted to him by the State and can thus obey the oath he takes as a juror.\u201d (391 U.S. at p. 519 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 783].) Before he can be excluded a juror must make \u201cunmistakably clear (1) that [he] would <em>automatically </em>vote against the imposition of capital punishment without regard to any evidence that might be developed at the trial of the case before [him], or (2) that [his] attitude toward the death penalty would prevent [him] from making an impartial, decision as to the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d(Italics in original.) <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 522-523,fn. 21 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 785].)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The first juror improperly excluded in the instant case was Mrs. Sonneborn. She initially told the court she was \u201cagainst capital punishment.\u201d The court then stated generally to the veniremen: \u201cI think I should ask any of you at this time if you feel so strongly against the death penalty that you can\u2019t impose the death penalty under any circumstances, I wish you\u2019d tell me now.\u201d Had the court stopped at this point, Mrs. Sonneborn\u2019s reply, \u201cI would not, no\u201d might have been sufficient to exclude her. However, before that reply the court added to its general statement the following specific question: \u201cWe\u2019ll take Mrs. Sonneborn\u2014you are against capital punishment and <em>would not want to sit on such a case, </em>I take it?\u201d (Italics added.) The juror then replied, as indicated, \u201cI would not, no.\u201d She was then excused for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The People urge us to look to the entire <em>voir dire </em>record, putting Mrs. Sonneborn\u2019s answer into \u201cfull context,\u201d and thus to consider it as in reality a reply to the court\u2019s general question whether any juror could not \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d impose the death penalty. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Varnum </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 480, 493 [75 Cal.Rptr. 161, 450 P.2d 553].) As we said in <em>Varnum, </em>however, \u201cTo ascertain what the juror meant by what he said, we must consider not merely the words of his answers but also the words of <em>the question he was asked </em>and additionally all of the circumstances in which the colloquy took place.\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(Id. </em>at p. 493.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Applying the above test, looking to the only specific question asked of Mrs. Sonneborn and the answer she gave to that question, which answer resulted in her exclusion, the court clearly excused Mrs. Sonneborn after having ascertained only that she \u201cwould not <em>[want to sit on such a case], </em>no.\u201d  We need not belabor an obvious point: a prospective juror\u2019s personal wants or desires, so long as they do not preclude an impartial determination of guilt or render automatic a vote against the death penalty, are wholly irrelevant and provide no basis for exclusion under the <em>Wither-spoon </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">After Mrs. Sonneborn was excused, the court proceeded to elicit from each juror in turn an answer to the following question: \u201cDo you have any feeling against the imposition of the death penalty that would make you feel you couldn\u2019t sit as a fair and impartial juror <em>if that matter was placed to you?\u201d </em>\u201cMrs. Delaney: I do have. The Court: You feel that <em>if it came to the second phase of this case, </em>if that does transpire, that you couldn\u2019t sit as a fair and impartial juror, is that right? Mrs. Delaney: Yes. The Court: All right, I\u2019ll excuse you for cause then.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The above exchange indicates only that Mrs. Delaney entertained a bias against the death penalty which would preclude her sitting as a \u201cfair and impartial\u201d juror at the penalty (second) phase of the trial.  As set out earlier, the <em>Witherspoon </em>court made it abundantly clear that partial jurors could only be excused where their bias would result in an <em>automatic </em>vote against the death penalty or would preclude impartiality on the question of <em>guilt. </em>(391 U.S. at pp. 522-523, fn. 21 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 785].)  Mrs. Delaney stated only that she could not be impartial on the question of penalty\u2014a circumstance she necessarily shared with all persons predisposed against the death penalty. Again, the only question asked Mrs. Delaney, like that asked Mrs. Sonneborn, in no way related back to the court\u2019s original general statement about imposition \u201cunder any circumstances.\u201d The exclusion of both Mrs. Sonneborn and Mrs. Delaney was reversible error under <em>Witherspoon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">The writ is granted as to the penalty trial. The remittitur issued in <em>Peo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number><em>pie </em>v. <em>Tahl, </em>Crim. 9960, is recalled, and the judgment imposing the death penalty is reversed insofar as it relates to the penalty. In all other respects the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Traynor, C. J., Tobriner, J., Burke, J., and Sullivan, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Upon petitioner\u2019s request, through his attorney, to withdraw his plea of not guilty, the following exchange is revealed by the record: \u201cThe Court: All right, Mr. Tahl, you come up here with your attorney. Mr. Tahl, your attorney has indicated you want to withdraw your plea of not guilty as to the charges, and we\u2019ll take them one at a time.

The question of degree was then taken up (R.T. 274-275):</p>\n<p id=\"b217-32\">\u201cThe Court: All right. The Court will find that the degree of murder as to Count one and Count two is first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-33\">\u201cMr. Iredale [the deputy district attorney]: Your Honor, I think on that matter, if the defense is willing, we\u2019d be willing to stipulate to that.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-34\">\u201cThe Court: I think so. I understood there would be a stipulation that it was first degree, is that right? \u25a0 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b217-35\">\u201cMr. Smith: So stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>\u201cMr. Iredale: The People so stipulate; does the defendant?</p>\n<p id=\"Ang\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Tahl, I think since you\u2019ve entered your plea, you\u2019ve got to concur also that this is murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"A0d\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"ALK\">\u201cMr. Smith: Your Honor, is it my understanding that murder in the first degree is stipulated to, since the robbery Count would be first degree robbery, and this is a murder committed in the course of a robbery or attempted robbery?</p>\n<p id=\"AJ5\">\u201cThe Court: Well, I don\u2019t know if the District Attorney wants to be limited to that or not:</p>\n<p id=\"Ax4\">\u201cMr. Iredale: My feeling is that <em>I would assume that the defense attorney has explained to his client, and l would appreciate it if the Court would inquire of the defendant whether he fully understands what we are now talking about, and it has been explained to him, </em>so that he would stipulate.</p>\n<p id=\"AdX\">\u201cThe Court: I think so. <em>This has been explained to you, about murder in the first degree if it\u2019s committed while committing a robbery?

Mr. Tahl, I think in the third Count I neglected to ask you if at the time of the commission of the offense\u2014it says \u2018said defendant was armed with a deadly weapon, to-wit, a .410 gauge shotgun.\u2019 Do you admit that you were so armed?</p>\n<p id=\"AzR\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, I do.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The entire examination of the defendant by the trial court, as set out in the <em>Mendez </em>opinion, is as follows <em>{id. </em>at p. 21):</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Mendez, you have considered that matter [of pleading guilty] carefully, have you?</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, I have, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">\u201cThe Court: You have advised with your attorney, Mr. Hill?</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">\u201cThe Defendant: I did talk it over with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">\u201cThe Court: You feel, because you are guilty, that you want to plead guilty, and that you want the court to hear evidence to determine the degree of your guilt; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">\u201cThe Defendant: That is correct, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">\u201cThe Court: You have been fully advised, so the District Attorney may rearraign you.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Petitioner contends that his answers of \u201cyes\" to the queries of the trial court are not sufficient substitutes for more elaborate statements of fact by petitioner himself. He cites no supporting authority in this or any other jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b221-11\">California law has long required that waiver of a jury trial be express. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Holmes </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 442 [5 Cal.Rptr. 871, 353 P.2d 583].) However, prior to <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>discussed <em>infra, </em>it was not necessary that acceptance of a guilty plea be preceded by a specific waiver of the right to a jury trial, or any other right (except the right to counsel, where none was present). Therefore, although the present record would be insufficient now to constitute a valid waiver of a jury trial, this does not necessarily preclude holding the plea of guilty to be acceptable under then existing California law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Of course, even if we could interpret the <em>Boykin </em>decision more narrowly, we are not precluded from adopting for California a more exacting standard than is minimally required by the federal Constitution, whether to afford greater assurance of the validity of convictions, to protect more fully defendants\u2019 rights, or to anticipate future constitutional developments. (See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 719, 733 [16 L.Ed.2d 882, 892, 86 S.Ct. 1772].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b225-7\"> Thus were the court to ask counsel whether he had advised the defendant of his right of confrontation and ask the defendant whether he waived that right, receiving an affirmative reply to both inquiries, this would satisfy the requirement of an express, on-the-record waiver of that right. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Evanson </em>(1968) <em>supra, </em>265 Cal.App.2d 698.) What is required is evidence that the particular right was known to and waived by the defendant. The explanation need not necessarily be by the court, although the waiver must be by the defendant. We reiterate, however, that wherever there is doubt an explicit and direct canvassing of the right with the defendant by the trial court is to be preferred, and may be necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b225-8\">That quotation is as follows: \u201cA majority of criminal convictions are obtained after a plea of guilty. If these convictions are to be insulated from attack, the trial court is best advised to conduct an on the record examination of the defendant which should include, inter alia, an attempt to satisfy itself that the defendant understands the nature of the charges, his right to a jury trial, the acts sufficient to constitute the offenses for which he is charged, and the permissible range of sentences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">This is in effect the type of inquiry long recognized in California as essential if the accused desires to proceed without counsel. (E.g., <em>In re Johnson </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 325 [42 Cal.Rptr. 228, 398 P.2d 420]; <em>In re James </em>(1952) 38 Cal.2d 302 [240 P.2d 596]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chesser </em>(1947) 29 Cal.2d 815 [178 P.2d 761, 170 A.L.R. 246].) Our holding today may thus be seen as an extension of the concepts first developed in those cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Rule 11 provides, in pertinent part, that a court \u201cshall not accept [a guilty plea] without first addressing the defendant personally and determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea. . . . The court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In <em>McCarthy </em>there was a failure to address the defendant personally to determine whether he understood the nature of the charge against him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Although <em>McCarthy </em>was based solely on rule 11 and not on constitutional considerations, the court in <em>Halliday </em>found it \u201cappropriate to analyze the question of that decision\u2019s retroactivity in terms of the same criteria we have employed to determine whether constitutionally grounded decisions that depart from precedent should be applied retroactively.\u201d (394 U.S. at p. 832 [23 L.Ed.2d at p. 19].) Thus the <em>Halliday </em>determination is properly applicable to the constitutionally grounded decision in <em>Boykin.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The magnitude of the potential effect on the administration of justice is apparent when we note that in California for the years 1960 through 1967 felony convictions obtained on pleas of guilty totaled 173,496. (Crime and Delinquency in California (1967) p. 100.) The number of misdemeanor convictions would be considerably higher.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b227-6\">A plea of guilty is in essence a confession in open court, and the procedures necessitated by the <em>Boykin </em>decision are analogous to those set out for in-custody interrogation in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974.] In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey, supra, </em>the Supreme Court declined to apply <em>Miranda </em>retroactively, recognizing that confessions lacking <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not necessarily involuntary and that those warnings simply added \u201cimportant new safeguards\u201d against coerced confessions. Similarly, the absence of <em>Boykin </em>warnings does not necessarily negate the voluntary nature of a guilty plea, and the \u201cimportant new safeguards\u201d herein established may fairly be applied prospectively only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Petitioner now alleges that at the time he pleaded guilty he was under the influence of \u201csix dosages of phenobarbital,\u201d allegedly obtained partly from a cellmate and partly from prison authorities. This is petitioner\u2019s first mention of the ingestion of a drug, or indeed of any condition rendering his plea of guilty or his conduct at any other stage of his trial involuntary, although petitioner filed an extensive brief on direct appeal from his conviction. Petitioner offers no explanation of his failure to raise this issue on his automatic appeal. (See <em>In re Shipp </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 547 [43 Cal.Rptr. 3, 399 P.2d 571]; <em>In re Swain </em>(1949) 34 Cal.2d 300 [209 P.2d 793].) Moreover, petitioner relates no details as to how, when, or why the drugs were taken, and offers no information as to the probable or necessary effect of \u201csix dosages\u201d of phenobarbital. The only evidence of any relevance on this point is contained in the People\u2019s brief, which points out that petitioner was apparently receiving three 14 grain doses of phenobarbital per day while in jail three weeks <em>following </em>his guilty plea. We take judicial notice under Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (h), that six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Va-grain doses of phenobarbital would be the normal \u201chypnotic\u201d (sleep-inducing) dose (see Osol, Pratt &amp; Altschule, The United States Dispensatory and Physicians\u2019 Pharmacology (26th ed. 1967) pp. 886-887; Goodman &amp; Gilman, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (3d ed. 1965) p. 122); we consider it most unlikely that a man who had taken ruo more than the normal sleep-inducing amount of a common sleeping medicine would be disabled from understanding the consequences of a plea of guilty to murder. Nothing in the record shows that petitioner was less than fully conscious and alert at the time of his plea. Petitioner\u2019s allegation is patently improbable and affords no basis for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b230-5\">McCOMB, J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"A6Q\">I would deny the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b230-6\">PETERS, J., Concurring and Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"AOk\">I concur with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the exclusion of jurors Sonneborn and Delaney constituted reversible error as to the penalty verdict, and with the majority\u2019s reading of <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 238 [23 L.Ed.2d 274, 89 S.Ct. 1709] as requiring a trial judge expressly to explain, and a defendant expressly to waive, constitutional rights to a jury trial, to confrontation, and against self-incrimination before a guilty plea is accepted. I also concur with the majority\u2019s refusal to apply to decisions final prior to <em>Boykin </em>that case\u2019s requirement that express explanations and waivers appear on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">I believe, however, that the realities of criminal justice demand a more basic reform of plea procedures than that undertaken' by the majority if we are to serve the laudable objectives of <em>Boykin. </em>A trial judge cannot meaningfully assess the voluntariness of a guilty plea, and the record of plea proceedings cannot fairly preclude a claim of the plea\u2019s invalidity, as long as defendants are expected to hide the most common motivation for such pleas: plea bargains. I would require that all plea bargains be set forth on the record and that defendants be fully advised of the possible consequences of the bargain they have entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">We have recognized that a substantial portion \u2014 probably the vast majority\u2014of criminal cases are disposed of through the process of plea bargaining. <em>(In re Hawley, </em>67 Cal.2d 824, 828 [63 Cal.Rptr. 831, 433 P.2d 919].) We also know that most bargains do not appear on the record, and that defendants whose pleas have been obtained by promises of leniency are usually expected to deny the existence of such promises in spite of the common knowledge of judge, prosecutor, and defense counsel to the contrary. (See, e.g., American Bar Assn. Advisory Committee on the Criminal Trial, Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty (tentative draft 1967) p. 61.) The result, in such cases, is that the entry of the plea is a ritual in which the recitations of the participants have little relation to reality. A defendant who is expected to lie when the judge asks if a guilty plea is the result of a promise of leniency is in no position to engage in a forthright exchange with the same judge at the same time when the question is the defendant\u2019s understanding and relinquishment of his constitutional rights. Only if the defendant can be expected to be truthful will the <em>Boykin </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>procedure protect against unknowing or involuntary waivers. If the defendant is expected merely to recite a script, a full record will be of absolutely no use in distinguishing the meritorious from the frivolous collateral attacks on guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">An important part of a trial judge\u2019s task is to ensure that a guilty plea is not the product of \u201c \u2018duress, fraud, or other fact overreaching the free will and judgment of a defendant\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wadkins, </em>63 Cal.2d 110, 114 [45 Cal.Rptr. 173, 403 P.2d 429]), and to forestall frivolous attacks on such pleas. Accordingly, I believe that whenever such information is relevant to the terms of a disclosed bargain, a defendant should be told of the broad discretion of the Adult Authority (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1168, 3020, 5077), that the authority is apprised of the prosecutor\u2019s and judge\u2019s views of the defendant and his crime (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203.01), and that in determining the defendant\u2019s sentence and parole eligibility, the authority may consider charges that the prosecutor has agreed to drop in return for the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">When the trial judge is fully aware of the terms of a plea bargain, and satisfied that the plea is otherwise valid, he should give the defendant an opportunity to withdraw the plea if the judge will not accept those terms. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Delles, </em>69 Cal.2d 906 [73 Cal.Rptr. 389, 447 P.2d 629].)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">In two respects, I disagree with the majority. I would hold (1) that <em>Boykin\u2019s </em>formal requirement of record proof of explanations and waivers applies to all cases not yet final, and (2) that <em>Boykin\u2019s </em>substantive requirement that valid waivers <em>in fact </em>accompany a plea\u2014regardless of the state of the record\u2014is entitled to full retroactive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">As to the first point, I believe that <em>Boykin\u2019s </em>formal requirement should apply to cases not yet final in accord with \u201c[t]he historic pattern of applying the court\u2019s current expression of a basic principle to cases pending on appeal. . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>66 Cal.2d 330, 334 [57 Cal.Rptr. 745, 425 P.2d 545].) Especially where only decisions based on guilty pleas are involved, and the time between plea and finality relatively short, I do not believe that the burden on the administration of justice or the dimming memories of potential witnesses justifies any departure from the \u201chistoric pattern.\u201d (See also my dissents in <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>71 Cal.2d 1096, 1110 [80 Cal.Rptr. 633, 458 P.2d 713]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Feggans, </em>67 Cal.2d 444, 449 [62 Cal.Rptr. 419, 432 P.2d 21]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rivers, </em>66 Cal.2d 1000, 1005 [59 Cal.Rptr. 851, 429 P.2d 171]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>65 Cal.2d 681, 693 [56 Cal.Rptr. 293, 423 P.2d 221].)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">My second disagreement with the majority relates to the substantive law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>enunciated by <em>Boykin. </em>Faced with a record which revealed nothing more than the fact of the petitioner\u2019s guilty plea, <em>Boykin </em>noted that such a plea is \u201cmore than a confession\u201d and involves a waiver of rights to a jury trial, to confrontation, and against self-incrimination. (395 U.S. at pp. 242-243 [23 L.Ed.2d at pp. 279-280].) <em>Boykin </em>reasoned that since the admission of a confession must be based on a \u201c \u2018reliable determination on the voluntariness issue,\u2019 \u201d and since a waiver of the right to counsel is invalid unless the record, or allegation and evidence, shows an intelligent and understanding rejection of counsel by the accused, \u201c[w]e think that the same standard must be applied to determining whether a guilty plea is voluntarily made.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 242 [23 L.Ed.2d at p. 279].) Because prior case law precluded presuming a waiver of counsel from a silent record, and in order to facilitate direct and collateral review, <em>Boykin </em>concluded that \u201c[w]e cannot presume a waiver of these three important federal rights from a silent record.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 242-244 [23 L.Ed.2d at pp. 279-280].) I agree with the majority that <em>Boykin\u2019s </em>concern with the state of the record means that in the future we must presume the <em>absence </em>of constitutional waivers from the existence of a silent record. This is the formal and prophylactic aspect of <em>Boykin. </em>But <em>Boykin </em>also stands for the proposition that a guilty plea includes constitutional waivers and is therefore invalid unless in fact entered by a defendant who understands the implications of the plea and has decided voluntarily to forego his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Although the majority does not address itself to this substantive aspect of <em>Boykin, </em>its affirmance of petitioner\u2019s guilt verdict in the face of his allegations implies a denial of retroactivity not only to <em>Boykin\u2019s </em>formal demands, but also to the substantive rights which those demands were designed to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In so doing, the majority has departed from the practice of both this court and the United States Supreme Court. Thus, although both courts have denied retroactivity to decisions excluding confessions obtained in the absence of counsel, both courts have recognized that collateral relief is available for those who can show that their confessions were in fact involuntary. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 719, 730 [16 L.Ed.2d 882, 86 S.Ct. 1772]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rollins, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 686; <em>In re Lopez, </em>62 Cal.2d 368, 375-377 [42 Cal.Rptr. 188, 398 P.2d 380].) Similarly, although both courts have denied retroactivity to decisions demanding the presence of counsel at lineups to ensure fairness, both courts have recognized that collateral relief is available for those who can show that their lineups were in fact violative of due process. <em>(Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 293, 299 [18 L.Ed.2d 1199, 1204, 87 S.Ct. 1967]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Feggans, supra, 61 </em>Cal.2d at pp. 448-449.)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Even the federal decisions' upon which the majority relies are in full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>accord with retroactive application of the substantive rights protected by the prospective procedure with which they deal. In denying retroactive effect to <em>Boykin, </em>the majority analogizes the <em>Boykin </em>case to <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 459 [22 L.Ed.2d 418, 89 S.Ct. 1166], and today\u2019s case to <em>Halliday </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 831 [23 L.Ed.2d 16, 89 S.Ct. 1498], <em>McCarthy </em>interpreted rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to require that a district judge personally address a defendant to determine that he understands the nature of the charges against him and the consequences of a guilty plea, and to demand that a district judge refuse to accept such a plea until he is satisfied that it has a basis in fact. The <em>McCarthy </em>court held that any defendant whose plea was accepted without full compliance with rule 11 could plead anew. Although <em>Halliday </em>denied retroactive effect to <em>McCarthy\u2019s </em>rule that a formal violation of rule 11 per se entitles a defendant to withdraw his guilty plea, the court was careful to point out that \u201ca defendant whose plea has been accepted without full compliance with Rule 11 may still resort to appropriate post-conviction remedies to attack his plea\u2019s voluntariness. Thus, if his plea was accepted prior to our decision in <em>McCarthy, </em>he is not without a remedy to correct constitutional defects in his conviction. Cf. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey, supra, </em>at 730 [16 L.Ed.2d at 890].\u201d (394 U.S. at p. 833 [23 L.Ed.2d at p. 20].) The <em>Halliday </em>court noted that the petitioner before it had already been afforded a hearing on the voluntariness of his plea, at which \u201cthe Government had met its burden of demonstrating that petitioner entered his plea voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charges aganist him.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 831-832 [23 L.Ed.2d at p. 19).)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Accordingly, the logic of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey, supra, Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, supra, </em>and <em>Halliday </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>means that today\u2019s decision should deny retroactive effect only to the formal requirements of <em>Boykin, </em>and that we should give full retroactive effect to the substantive rights which the formalities were designed to protect. Any prisoner convicted on a guilty plea should be entitled to collateral relief if he can show that the plea was not voluntary in the constitutional sense because unaccompanied by understanding and voluntary waivers of constitutional rights to confrontation, to a jury trial, and against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">We should accord the substantive rights <em>Boykin </em>enunciated full retroactive effect because any violation of those rights fundamentally and completely \u201cinfects the integrity of the truth-determining process at trial. . . .\u201d <em>(Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, supra, </em>at p. 298 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 1204].) Unlike a violation of <em>Boykin\u2019s </em>formal requirements, any departure from <em>Boykin\u2019s </em>substantive rule necessarily means that a defendant has pleaded guilty without voluntarily and intelligently waiving his rights to a jury trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>to confrontation, and against self-incrimination. In turn, any violation of <em>Boykin\u2019s </em>substantive demand means that an invalid plea has precluded <em>any </em>truth-determining .process; thus considerations of reliance and the burden on the administration of justice are improper. (Cf. <em>Desist </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 244, 251-252 [22 L.Ed.2d 248, 256-257, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 1048].)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The majority indicates that a prisoner who pleaded guilty prior to <em>Boykin </em>will be forced to rely on <em>pre-Boykin </em>California law to attack that plea\u2014law which did not require that a trial judge give a defendant any admonition prior to accepting his guilty plea if that defendant were represented by counsel <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mendez, </em>27 Cal.2d 20, 22 [161 P.2d 929]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Loeber, </em>158 Cal.App.2d 730, 735-736 [323 P.2d 136]), and which held that \u201cno error in the [plea] procedure could have prejudiced [an] appellant because of a failure of the court to enumerate\u201d constitutional rights. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Emigh, </em>174 Cal.App.2d 392, 394-395 [344 P.2d 851].) In short, California law conclusively presumed waiver from a silent plea record whenever the defendant was represented by counsel. (Cf. Witkin, Cal.Criminal Procedure (1963) \u00a7 253, p. 234.)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Although the petition before us is primarily concerned with the inadequacy of the record of the plea proceedings, the petitioner expressly alleges that at the time of his plea he did not comprehend the nature of the charges against him, that he was ignorant of the felony-murder doctrine, and had no appreciation of the fact that his plea made him eligible for capital punishment\u2014in part because he was under the influence of \u201csix doses\u201d of phenobarbital. In response, the majority cites <em>In re Cameron, </em>68 Cal.2d 487, 501, fn. 8 [67 Cal.Rptr. 529, 439 P.2d 633], for the proposition that \u201c[w]ith a hypnotic drug ... the fact that the individual is conscious indicates that he is no longer under the influence of the drug.\u201d That quote paraphrases medical testimony in a totally unconnected case which is in no way binding on the present petitioner. Especially when the People admit that petitioner had been receiving three <em>lA </em>grain doses of phenobarbital a day, and when medical authorities indicate that barbituates affect different subjects in different ways and may result in the subject becoming mentally confused (see Brown, The Enigma of Drug Addiction (1961) p. 27; 1 Lundquist, Methods of Forensic Science (1962) p. 377), I do not think we should dismiss the allegation summarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The majority also alludes to the petitioner\u2019s affirmative responses to questions as to whether he had been advised of his rights, the nature of the charges against him, and the consequences of his plea. But these responses beg the questions in issue: only if petitioner in fact understood the felony-murder doctrine, the nature of the charges against him, the fact that his plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>made him eligible for capital punishment, and the extent of his constitutional rights could he have been competent to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">In my view the petitioner has sufficiently alleged that his plea was involuntary and that he did not knowingly waive his rights. I believe he should be afforded a hearing to determine the truth of his allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Petitioner\u2019s application for a rehearing was denied December 10, 1969, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Peters, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
