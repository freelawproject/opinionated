The County of San Diego sought prohibition and we issued the alternative writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">However, as noted in <em>Thorn </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>the act has now been amended to require that a certified patient be informed of his right to counsel including court-appointed counsel; and the relevant issues are discussed in <em>Thorn. </em>Additionally, it appears that Callahan has long since been released, and that no useful purpose would be served by further proceedings with respect to his certification. Accordingly, the alternative writ is discharged, and the peremptory writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Traynor, C. J., McComb, J., Peters, J., Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., and Sullivan J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
