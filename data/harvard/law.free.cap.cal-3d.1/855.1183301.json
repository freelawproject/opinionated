(Welf. &amp; Inst. Cede, \u00a7 800.) For the reasons we shall point out, the court committed reversible error in reviewing the social study report before the jurisdictional hearing (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 701, 702, 706; <em>In re Steven F. </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 603 [75 Cal.Rptr. 887]; <em>In re Corey </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 295, 296 [72 Cal.Rptr. 115]). We also conclude that the juvenile court should consider whether a child appreciates the wrongfulness of her conduct in determining whether the child should be declared a ward under section 602<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Welfare and Institutions Code (Pen. Code, \u00a7 26). Finally, we hold that the juvenile court may declare a juvenile a ward under section 602 for perpetration of an act proscribed by Penal Code section 647a with an abnormal sexual interest or intent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pallares </em>(1952) 112 Cal.App.2d Supp. 895, 901 [246 P.2d 173].)</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">The Santa Clara County Superior Court, sitting as a juvenile court, found that the appellant\u2019s conduct brought her within the terms of Welfare and Institutions Cede section 602 because she committed an act proscribed by Penal Code section 647a (annoying or molesting a child under 18). Immediately after accepting factual allegations that the child committed acts which could invoke the jurisdiction of the court under section 602, the juvenile court proceeded: \u201cNow, we come to the question of what action should be taken, and in this connection, the Court has been supplied with a special report called a social study, which is ordered admitted in evidence at this time <em>and which has been thoroughly reviewed by the Court. </em>The social study tells the Court whether the child has a prior record, where the child is now, what the child told the probation officer when interviewed, what the parents told the probation officer when interviewed, the child\u2019s school report, welfare report, juvenile hall report, psychological, psychiatric and medical reports, personal history and family backgrounds, and last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>of all the probation officer evaluates that information and data and makes a recommendation to the Court.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">The quoted comments clearly indicate that the court examined the social study report prior to its determination of whether appellant had committed an act that would warrant the court\u2019s declaration of a wardship. The report contains matter not relevant to the jurisdiction of the court and therefore inadmissible at the hearing on that issue. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7701.)</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">1. <em>The court committed reversible error in reviewing the social study report before the determination of the issue of jurisdiction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">The history of Welfare and Institutions Code sections 701,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 702,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 706<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> clearly indicates that the Legislature intended to create a bifurcated juvenile court procedure in which the court would first determine whether the facts of the case would support the jurisdiction of the court in declaring a wardship and <em>thereafter </em>would consider the social study report at a hearing on the appropriate disposition of that ward.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>affords a necessary protection against the premature resolution of the jurisdictional issue on the basis of legally incompetent material in the social report.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">A prohibition of review of the social report before a determination of the jurisdictional issue does not hinder the creation of a court atmosphere conducive to a just consideration of the juvenile\u2019s case.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We recognize that the juvenile court in this case acted entirely within its view of the best interest of the child. It undoubtedly believed that its perusal of the report prior to a decision on the jurisdictional issue would provide helpful background information.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n                   We hold, however, that Welfare and Institutions Code sections 701, 702, and 706 prohibit the judge from reading the social report before the jurisdictional hearing. <em>(In re Corey, supra, </em>266 Cal.App.2d 295, 296.)</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">A recent decision of the Court of Appeal correctly holds that the construction given in <em>Corey </em>to the new statutory scheme of Welfare and Institutions Code sections 701, 702, and 706 must apply to all juvenile proceedings, including the instant case, initiated since the 1961 amendments. <em>(In re Steven F., supra, </em>270 Cal.App.2d 603.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Corey </em>did not involve a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>new constitutional rule that overturned prior decisions (cf., e.g., <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 293, 296 [18 L.Ed.2d 1199, 1203, 87 S.Ct. 1967]), but rather interpreted statutory provisions whose interpretation had previously remained unsettled.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n                   Furthermore, the failure of the minor\u2019s attorney to object at the juvenile court hearing to the court\u2019s premature use of the social study does not bar the consideration of this issue on appeal; we cannot expect an attorney to anticipate that an appellate court will later interpret the controlling sections in a manner contrary to the apparently prevalent contemporaneous interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">We must hold that the court\u2019s review of the social study prior to the jurisdictional hearing constituted prejudicial error. Both <em>In re Corey, supra, </em>266 Cal.App.2d 295, 299, and <em>In re Steven F., supra, </em>270 Cal.App.2d 603, 604, state: \u201cWhere the commission of a crime is alleged as the jurisdictional fact and the allegation is disputed, the court\u2019s error in [reviewing] the social study before the jurisdictional hearing goes so directly to the fairness of the hearing that the resulting adjudication is not saved by article VI, section 13, of the California Constitution.\u201d The court\u2019s review of the social report in advance of the jurisdictional hearing would perhaps not require reversal in a case in which the contents of the social study entirely favored the minor and his home environment. But in the present case the social study showed some inquiry into appellant\u2019s intent under section 647a and some negative indications about appellant\u2019s home environ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>ment. Hence, the court\u2019s review of the social study prior to the jurisdictional hearing, at which the jurisdictional facts were far from conclusive, constituted prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">We turn now to several contentions by appellant that we consider in order to give guidance to the juvenile court upon any further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">2. <em>A child under the age of 14 must appreciate the wrongfulness of her conduct in order to become a ward of the juvenile court under section 602.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">As we have stated, section 602 provides that any minor who violates \u201cany law of this State,\u201d that defines crime, comes under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. We shall point out that in order to become a ward of the court under that section, clear proof must show that a child under the age of 14 years at the time of committing the act appreciated its wrongfulness. This conclusion follows from the statutory postulate that the jurisdiction of the <em>court </em>must rest upon a violation of a law that defines crime and from the further statutory requirement of Penal Code section 26, subdivision One,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that, by definition, a child under the age of 14 years does not commit a crime in the absence of clear proof that he \u201cknew its wrongfulness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">A ruling that a child could be committed to the juvenile court under section 602,* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in the absence of such clear proof, would compel the disregard of section 26 or the assumption of its repeal. Indeed, the Welfare and Institutions Code provides that the juvenile courts exercise exclusive jurisdiction over all minors under the age of 16; these children cannot otherwise be tried as criminal offenders. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707; 40 Ops. Cal.Atty.Gen. 83 (1962).) Hence, if section 26 pertains at all to a definition of criminal conduct it must apply to proceedings under section 602 which, in turn, covers \u201c[a]ny person under the age of 21 years who violates any law of this State . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>We cannot presume the repeal of section 26 by implication; the decisions clearly establish the contrary presumption. <em>(Warne </em>v. <em>Harkness </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 579, 588 [35 Cal.Rptr. 601, 387 P.2d 377].) We have said that \u201cTo overcome the presumption the two acts must be irreconcilable, clearly repugnant, and so inconsistent that the two cannot have concurrent operation. The courts are bound, if possible, to maintain the integrity of both statutes if the two may stand together.\u201d <em>(California Drive-In Restaurant Assn. </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 287, 292 [140 P.2d 657, 147 A.L.R. 1028]; see <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 733, 752 [63 Cal.Rptr. 689, 433 P.2d 697].)</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">In enacting section 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, the Legislature must have considered the pre-existing section 26 ;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that section constituted practically the only special provision for children in the entire legal system. Section 26 did not lie at the periphery of the statutory scheme, bearing only tangentially upon juvenile offenders. Necessarily confronted with the section, the Legislature must have intended in its later enactment of section 602 a definition of crime consistent with the older section. If the Legislature had intended to repeal section 26 or to sever it from section 602, it could have done so expressly. Yet the legislative history of the present California Juvenile Court Law, of which section 602 forms a part, indicates no such intent. In fact, the commission that drafted the present law refers to the necessity of \u201crespectable proof of the jurisdictional facts\u201d for the institution of proceedings under section 602 for the violation of <em>\u201cserious </em>crimes against persons and property.\u201d (Report of the Governor\u2019s Special Study Commission on Juvenile Justice, Part I\u2014 Recommendations for Changes in California\u2019s Juvenile Court Law (1960) p. 21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">Section 26 accords with the historical treatment of juveniles, deriving from the early common law that children under the age of seven could not be held responsible for criminal conduct. (See <em>In re Gault </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 1, 16 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 539, 87 S.Ct. 1428].) Between the ages of seven and fourteen the common law rebuttably presumed children incapable of criminal acts, unless the particular child possessed the requisite age and experience to understand the wrongfulness of his act. (R. Perkins, Criminal Law (2d ed. 1969) p. 837.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>\n                   California likewise rebuttably pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>sumes all minors under the age of 14 incapable of committing a crime, but does not totally exclude any child from criminal responsibility. Section 26 embodies a venerable truth, which is no less true for its extreme age, that a young child cannot be held to the same standard of criminal responsibility as his more experienced elders. A juvenile court must therefore consider a child\u2019s age, experience, and understanding in determining whether he would be capable of committing conduct proscribed by section 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">As we observed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Lara </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 365, 380 [62 Cal. Rptr. 586, 432 P.2d 202], section 26 plays a very definite role in the overall system of protections afforded to minors under the criminal law and under our special juvenile court system.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We know of no change that has occurred since the rendition of this decision that prompts its abandonment. To the contrary, one Court of Appeal has apparently considered Penal Code section 26 applicable to section 602 proceedings. (See <em>In re T.R.S. </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 178, 181 [81 Cal.Rptr. 574].)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Furthermore, section 26 provides the kind of fundamental protection to children charged under section 602 which this court should not lightly discard. Section 602 is clearly distinguishable from sections 600 and 601 with respect to the consequences of their operation upon the child: upon the application of section 602, commitment of the youth to the custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>of the California Youth Authority becomes far more likely.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Section 600 concerns dependent children who need care because of home conditions or medical deficiencies.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Section 601 covers delinquent children whose acts fall short of criminal conduct.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Section 602 pertains to minors who have violated a court order or a criminal law. (R. Boch\u00e9s &amp; J. Goldfarb, California Juvenile Court Practice (1968) p. 35.)</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">If a juvenile court finds a lack of clear proof that a child under 14 years at the time of committing the act possessed knowledge of its wrongfulness under sections 602 and 26, the court might well declare the child a ward under section 600 or 601.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> These latter provisions carry far less severe consequences for the liberty and life of the child.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> After all, it is the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>pose of the Welfare and Institutions Code to \u201cinsure that the rights or physical, mental or moral welfare of children are not violated or threatened by their present circumstances or environment.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 19.) Strong policy reasons cast doubt upon the placement of a child who is unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct with an institution where he will come into contact with many youths who are well versed in criminality.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (See President\u2019s Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice, Task Force Report: Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime (1967) p. 422; Note, <em>The California Juvenile Court </em>(1958) 10 Stan.L.Rev. 471, 518-519; Council of State Governments, Juvenile Delinquency (1962) pp. 28-31.) To argue that we should trust entirely to the discretion of the juvenile court in this matter does not justify a ruling that section 26 is inapplicable to the definition of crime within section 602. We cannot condone a decision which would both misinterpret the statute and expose the child to consequences possibly disastrous to himself and society as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>Other sections may possibly be invoked to provide for a wardship for this child with no injurious potentials. Section 601 provides that a child who disobeys the lawful orders of his parents or school authorities, who is beyond the control of such persons, or who is in danger of leading an immoral life may be adjudged a ward of the court. Section 601 might clearly cover younger children who lack the age or experience to understand the wrongfulness of their conduct. If the juvenile court considers section 601 inappropriate for the particular child, he may be covered by the even broader provisions of section 600. (Report of the Governor\u2019s Special Study Commission on Juvenile Justice, Part I\u2014Recommendations for Changes in Juvenile Court Law (1960) pp. 18-21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Section 602 should apply only to those who are over 14 and may be presumed to understand the wrongfulness of their acts and to those under the age of 14 who clearly appreciate the wrongfulness of their conduct.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>\n                   In the instant case we are confronted with a 12-year-old girl of the social and mental age of a 7-year-old. Section 26 stands to protect her and other young people like her from the harsh strictures of section 602.  Only if the age, experience, knowledge, and conduct of the child demonstrate by clear proof that he has violated a criminal law should he be declared a ward of the court under section 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">3. <em>A child may be declared a ward of the juvenile court under section 602 for conduct proscribed by Penal Code section 647a.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">Penal Code section 647a provides: <em>\u201cEvery person </em>who annoys or molests any child under the age of 18 is a vagrant . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Clearly, the words \u201c[e]very person\u201d include a minor as well as an adult. We believe, therefore, that a juvenile court may declare a juvenile to be a ward of the court under section 602 for an act violative of Penal Code section 647a.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">We point out, however, the comparatively narrow province of section 647a; it applies only to offenders who are motivated by an unnatural or abnormal sexual interest or intent. <em>People </em>v. <em>Pallares, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.2d Supp. 895, 901, in rejecting a contention that the words \u201cannoys or molests\u201d in section 647a rendered the section impermissibly vague, stated in part: \u201cWhen [these words] are used in reference to offenses against children, there is a connotation of abnormal sexual motivation on the part of the offender. Although no specific intent is prescribed as an element of this particular offense, a reading of the section as a whole in the light of the evident purpose of this and similar legislation enacted in this state indicates that the acts forbidden are those motivated by an unnatural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>or abnormal sexual interest or intent with respect to children.\u201d Several Courts of Appeal have cited and followed <em>Pallares. </em>(E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Carskaddon </em>(1959) 170 Cal.App.2d 45, 47 [338 P.2d 201]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1959) 167 Cal.App.2d 727, 733 [335 P.2d 249]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1955) 137 Cal.App.2d 197, 200 [290 P.2d 40]; see <em>In re Sheridan </em>(1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 365, 372 [40 Cal.Rptr. 894]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mizer </em>(1961) 195 Cal.App.2d 261, 268-269 [15 Cal.Rptr. 272]; 2 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1963) \u00a7 619, pp. 567-568.)</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">\u201cThe primary purpose of [section 647a] is the \u2018protection of children from interference by sexual offenders, and the apprehension, segregation and punishment of the latter.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Moore, supra, </em>137 Cal.App.2d 197, 199; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pallares, </em>112 Cal.App.2d Supp. 895, 900 ... . )\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carskaddon </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 423, 425-426 [318 P.2d 4]; see <em>Mandel </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1969) 276 Cal.App.2d 649, 670-671 [81 Cal.Rptr. 173]; <em>In re Sheridan, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.2d 365, 371; <em>In re Huddleson </em>(1964) 229 Cal.App.2d 618, 623-624 [40 Cal.Rptr. 581]; cf. <em>In re Cregler </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 308 [14 Cal.Rptr. 289, 363 P.2d 305].) Considering this purpose, the connotation of the words \u201cannoy\u201d and \u201cmolest\u201d as used in the section, and the rule that we must give a criminal defendant the benefit of every reasonable doubt as to whether the statute is applicable to him <em>(People </em>v. <em>Baker </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 44, 46 [69 Cal.Rptr. 595, 442 P.2d 675]; <em>In re Zerbe </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 666, 669 [36 Cal.Rptr. 286, 388 P.2d 182, 10 A.L.R.3d 840]), we reaffirm the construction given section 647a in <em>Pallares </em>and subsequent cases.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">During the 17 years since the decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Pallares, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.2d Supp. 895, the Legislature has not amended section 647a to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>exclude motivation by an abnormal sexual interest or intent as an element of the offense, and during those years the Legislature has amended the section in other respects on three occasions. (Stats. 1955, ch. 169, \u00a7 3, p. 639; Stats. 1957, ch. 1735, \u00a7 1, p. 3120; Stats. 1967, ch. 154, \u00a7 1, p. 1241.) Under the circumstances, we must generally presume the Legislature has acquiesced in the judicial construction. (See <em>Richfield Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Com. </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 419, 430 [6 Cal.Rptr. 548, 354 P.2d 4].)</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">We conclude that a juvenile court may declare a juvenile to be a ward of the court under Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 for commission of an act proscribed by Penal Code section 647a. We need not decide however, whether sufficient evidence, particularly under section 26, was introduced in the instant case to support a finding that an abnormal sexual interest or intent motivated appellant\u2019s conduct. Nor need we decide whether the court failed to render such a finding since, as we have seen, the court\u2019s review of the social study report prior to the jurisdictional hearing in itself requires reversal of the judgment. The parties may, of course, introduce, in any further proceeding, additional evidence of such abnormal sexual interest, as well as additional evidence of the minor\u2019s appreciation of the wrongfulness of her conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">We summarize our position on the two chief issues of this case in a few words. Our first major holding precludes the juvenile court from reading the social study report prior to the determination of jurisdiction since reliance upon legally incompetent material in the report could induce prejudice. In reaching our second ruling we have recognized that over the past centuries our society has attained a stage of relative sophistication in which it realizes that antisocial conduct in most cases stems from psychological motivation in the individual that cannot be segregated into the easy categories of \u201ccriminal\u201d or \u201cnon-criminal.\u201d It would be particularly undesirable for a juvenile court, arbitrarily, without analysis of the child\u2019s appreciation of the \u201cwrongfulness\u201d of her conduct, to hold this emotionally disturbed child of 12 years guilty of criminal conduct. To reach that result we would, in our judgment, be compelled to misread the pertinent statutes, to disregard even our presently inadequate knowledge of psychology, and to retreat to an approach which pre-dates the early common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Santa Clara County Superior Court, sitting as a juvenile court, for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">Traynor, C.

It appears likely that the very minors so excluded would be those in greater need of receiving such care than others more sophisticated who. plainly knew that their acts were wrongful.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">The majority state, \u201cIf a juvenile court finds a lack of clear proof that a child under 14 years at the time of committing the act possessed knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>edge of its wrongfulness under sections 602 and 26, the court might well declare the child a ward under [Welfare and Institutions Code] sections 600 or 601.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The quoted statement, however, fails to give adequate consideration to the fact that many children who violate a law defining a crime may not be found to come within either section 600 or 601. Under the majority position such children will be deprived of the attention they need in order to become law-abiding citizens. For example, a 12-year-old boy on one occasion exhibits a loaded gun in a threatening manner in the presence of another (Pen. Code, \u00a7 417), and the evidence does not show his conduct was the result of \u201ca mental or physical deficiency, disorder, or abnormality\u201d (see Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 600, subd. (c)). A 13-year-old girl has possession of marijuana (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11530). A 13-year-old boy on one occasion commits statutory rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261, subd. 1), with a willing 13-year-old girl in a private place, or goes joyriding (Pen. Code, \u00a7 499b) or commits petty theft (Pen. Code, \u00a7 488). In none of the foregoing instances is there \u201cclear proof\u201d that the minor at the time of committing the crime had knowledge of its wrongfulness. In the foregoing instances some juvenile courts might conclude that the minor did not come within either section 600 or 601, and additional proof to bring the minor within section 600 or 601 might not be available.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">It is implicit in the above quoted statement of the majority that knowledge of the wrongfulness of the act is not required for an adjudication that a minor under 14 is a person described by section 601. A minor may be adjudicated to come within section 601 where he has persistently refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>to obey the reasonable and proper orders of school authorities. It would have been anomalous had the Legislature required knowledge of the wrongfulness of his act by a minor under 14 who committed a serious crime in order for the court to have jurisdiction under one section and not to have required it for a relatively lesser transgression under another. The welfare of the child and the best- interests of society manifestly would make jurisdiction of the former child more imperative than jurisdiction over the latter child. Although one difference exists with respect to the disposition that may be made of a minor found to come within section 601 and a minor found to come within section 602<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> otherwise the same dispositions are authorized for both such minors and both may be ordered confined, for example, in a juvenile home. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 725, 730, 731, 733, and 734.)</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">The common law rebuttable presumption of lack of criminal capacity of a child between 7 and 14 has been regarded as inapplicable in juvenile court proceedings. <em>(Borders </em>v. <em>United States </em>(5th Cir. 1958) 256 F.2d 458, 459; <em>sec Juvenile Court v. State </em>(1918) 139 Tenn. 549 [201 S.W. 771, 773]; 31 Am.Jur. (1958 ed.) Juvenile Courts, etc., \u00a7 39, p. 317; Rubin, Crime and Juvenile Delinquency (1961) p. 56.) The cited cases reasoned that juvenile court proceedings are not criminal in nature and are not instituted to punish the child for any offense but rather have the purpose of providing for the child\u2019s welfare. In this state the Legislature has specifically provided that a juvenile court proceeding shall not be deemed a criminal proceeding. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 503.) In the light of <em>In re Gault </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 1 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 87 S.Ct. 1428], which held that certain procedural protections required by due process are applicable in juvenile court proceedings, such proceedings may not be regarded in all cases for every purpose as civil rather than criminal. However, as we pointed out in <em>In re Dennis M., supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 444, 456, \u201ceven after <em>Gault . . </em>. juvenile proceedings retain a <em>sui generis </em>character; although certain basic rules of due process must be observed, the proceedings are nevertheless conducted for the protection and benefit of the youth in question.\u201d Thus the conclusion reached in <em>Borders </em>and <em>Juvenile Court </em>remains valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">In support of its position that subdivision One of section 26 applies in a juvenile court proceeding under section 602, the majority state that \u201cthe juvenile courts exercise exclusive jurisdiction over all minors under the age of 16\u201d and that \u201cwe cannot presume the repeal of [subdivision One of] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>section 26 by implication; the decisions clearly establish the contrary presumption.\u201d Even if it be assumed that the former quoted statement is correct, it does not follow that subdivision One of section 26 is repealed by implication by a determination of the inapplicability of that subdivision in a juvenile court proceeding under section 602. As the majority recognize, that subdivision is applicable where an adult defendant charged with a sex crime against a child contends that the latter is an accomplice whose testimony requires corroboration (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1111). (E.g. <em>People </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>180 Cal.App.2d 48, 59 [4 Cal.Rptr. 597]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>12 Cal.App.2d 207, 208 et seq. [55 P.2d 223]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>140 Cal.App. 162, 164 [35 P.2d 196]; see 1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1963), p. 122.)</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">The majority also note that \u201cSection 602 is clearly distinguishable from sections 600 and 601 with respect to the consequences of their operation upon the child: upon the application of section 602, commitment of the youth to the custody of the California Youth Authority becomes far more likely.\u201d However, the Welfare and Institutions Code places restrictions on such a commitment (\u00a7 \u00a7 733 and 734),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and where such a commitment is authorized it is only one of several possible alternatives.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under the circumstances the fact that Youth Authority commitment may be an alternative available for a minor found to be a person described by section 602 should not preclude holding subdivision One of section 26 is inapplicable in a juvenile court proceeding under section 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">The majority rely upon statements quoted from <em>People </em>v. <em>Lara, </em>67 Cal.2d 365, 380-381 [62 Cal.Rptr. 586, 432 P.2d 202]. Those statements, however, were made in connection with our rejection of the claim that defendants, aged 17 and 18 at the time of the crime, had not knowingly waived their rights to counsel and to remain silent, and <em>Lara </em>did not involve or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>decide the question of the applicability of subdivision One of section 26 in a proceeding to determine whether a minor is a person described by section 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\"><em>In re T.R.S., </em>1 Cal.App.3d 178, 181 [81 Cal.Rptr. 574], also cited by the majority, appears to have merely assumed without deciding that subdivision One of section 26 applies in a preceding to determine whether a minor less than 14 is a person described by section 602.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">Subdivision <em>Three </em>of Penal Code section 26 (insanity) has been held applicable in a juvenile court proceeding to determine whether a minor is a person described by section 602 <em>(In re M.G.S., </em>267 Cal.App.2d 329, 337 [72 Cal.Rptr. 808]), but it does not follow that subdivision <em>One </em>of section 26 is likewise applicable in such a proceeding. Permitting the defense of insanity in such a proceeding does not deprive the minor of needed care (see, e.g., Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 705), whereas holding subdivision One of section 26 applicable in such a proceeding can, as we have seen, deprive minors of needed care.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">For the reasons above stated I would uphold the position of the Attorney General that subdivision One of section 26 is inapplicable in a juvenile court proceeding to determine whether a minor comes within section 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">McComb, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b962-6\">Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 provides: \u201cAny person under the age of 21 years who violates any law of this State . . . defining crime ... is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, which may adjudge such person to be a ward of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">Penal Code section 26 provides: \u201cAll persons are capable of committing crimes except those belonging to the following classes: One.
