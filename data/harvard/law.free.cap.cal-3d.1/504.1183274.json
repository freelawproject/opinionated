After a joint trial, a jury found both defendants guilty of first degree murder and fixed the punishment of Whitehorn at death and the punishment of Hummel at life imprisonment. Hummel did not appeal. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitehorn </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 256 [32 Cal.Rptr. 199, 383 P.2d 783], we affirmed in its entirety the judgment of conviction as to Whitehorn. Subsequently Whitehorn\u2019s sentence was commuted by the Governor to life imprisonment without possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">In the instant proceeding for a writ of habeas corpus we are presented with the question whether Whitehorn\u2019s conviction should be set aside under the authority of <em>Bruton v. United States </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 123 [20 L.Ed.2d 476, 88 S.Ct. 1620], on the ground that the admission at the joint trial of Hummel\u2019s extrajudicial statements inculpating Whitehorn violated the latter\u2019s right of cross-examination secured by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution although the jury was instructed that such evidence was admitted only against his codefendant Hummel.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">We briefly state the relevant facts. In the early hours of April 22, 1962, Whitehorn and Hummel, met Mrs. Gums in a Hollywood restaurant and offered to drive her home. Instead they drove her first to a place in the North Hollywood hills and then to a place near Santa Monica, in each of which spots Whitehorn had intercourse with her in the car, in the presence of Hummel and apparently without her consent although she did not resist to any great extent. Later, while Whitehorn held the victim with her arms pinned to her body, Hummel strangled her with a necktie.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">Petitioner and Hummel were arrested after Hummel, who was a private in the United States Marine Corps, admitted to a Marine Corps investigator that petitioner and he were implicated in the death of Mrs. Gums. Hummel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>made a number of statements to law enforcement officers in petitioner\u2019s absence and one statement in petitioner\u2019s presence at. a joint interview. Petitioner, himself, also made free and voluntary statements to law enforcement officers. All of the above statements of both men (except those made by petitioner during a polygraph examination) were admitted in evidence during the prosecution\u2019s case in chief subject to the limiting instruction that they were to be considered only against the respective declarant-defendant making them.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">On April 26, 1962, Hummel made an oral statement to a Marine Corps\u2019 investigator in the presence of a Catholic priest, in which he related the circumstances of the murder. That evening he made practically the same statement to Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputies, which was tape recorded and later transcribed. These statements were substantially as follows: Hummel who had known Whitehorn previously met the latter at a USO recreation center on the evening of April 21, 1962. After this both men visited a number of bars and finally a restaurant where they met the victim and offered to drive her home. Whitehorn, however, drove by her house and into the hills, first stopping at a service station to check his tires. After threatening to hurt Mrs. Gums if she did not consent, Whitehorn had intercourse with her twice, once in the hills and once near Santa Monica. On the second occasion, according to Hummel, the victim managed to climb over into the rear seat where Hummel was sitting. Whitehorn told Hummel to grab her. Hummel put his arms around her and <em>Whitehorn </em>took a tie out of his pocket, placed it around her neck and strangled her. They then threw the victim\u2019s nude body over a fence and scattered pieces of her underclothing along a highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">After making the last statement, Hummel led the investigating officers to the victim\u2019s underclothing and to the location of her body, as well as to the place where she had been strangled. Statements made by him during this time were confined to directing the officers to each of the locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Whitehorn was arrested on April 27, 1962. The officers on that day conducted a joint interview of both men which was tape recorded and transcribed. At this interview Hummel repeated, but in more detail, his earlier statements in which among other things he said that <em>Whitehorn </em>was the one who actually did the strangling. In the afternoon of that day, Hummel, in the absence of Whitehorn gave the officers still another statement furnishing additional details of Whitehorn\u2019s intercourse with, and strangling of, the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Beginning on May 1, 1962, Hummel began to change portions of his previous statements. His tape-recorded, statement, given to the officers on that day, related inter alia that it was he and not Whitehorn who placed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>necktie around the victim\u2019s neck and strangled her, that it was he and not Whitehorn who threw her clothing from the car, and that Mrs. Gums did not struggle or cry out.when Whitehorn stripped off her clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Hummel\u2019s last statement, given on August 9, and stenographically recorded, made the following additions to his May 1st statement: When the two men stopped at the service station, they alighted from the car and Whitehorn asked Hummel if he would like to go into the hills and have intercourse with Mrs. Gums, adding that if \u201cshe went out she wasn\u2019t coming back.\u201d Hummel indicated his agreement. During the ride Hummel kept motioning to Whitehorn \u201cwith my hand, taking my thumb and passing it from left to right across my throat, . . .\u201d This meant, according to Hummel, \u201cknocking her off, ...\u201d It was Hummel\u2019s not Whitehorn\u2019s tie that was used. During the acts of intercourse, Mrs. Gums was crying and struggling with petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">At the trial both defendants took the stand. Hummel testified generally in accordance with his extrajudicial statements as to the events of the evening which led up to the first act of intercourse in the hills. He \u201chad done some considerable drinking and there\u2019s several periods of time during this I don\u2019t know whether I was awake or not, but I just can\u2019t remember what happened.\u201d On direct examination he testified that when Whitehorn finally stopped the car in the hills, he, Hummel, was in the rear seat and Whitehorn and the victim were in the <em>front seat; </em>that he saw certain movements in the front seat during the course of which Whitehorn lowered his trousers; that at no time did he hear the victim scream or remonstrate with Whitehorn; and that finally the parties straightened up and Whitehorn started the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">As to the second act of intercourse, Hummel testified on direct examination that after the car came to a stop, Whitehorn and the victim got into the rear seat and Hummel into the front seat; that he did not witness any act of sexual intercourse at any time; that he recalled holding a tie around Mrs. Gums\u2019 neck and that he \u201crelieved the pressure from the necktie around Mrs. Gums\u2019 throat,\u201d although he did not recall putting the tie around her neck; and that he \u201cjust let go of the necktie. I don\u2019t know. She sort of dropped\u201d; and that he then drove the car to another spot where both men removed the victim\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Under cross-examination by the prosecutor, Hummel admitted that statements made to the investigating officers on April 26 and April 27, 1962, were to the effect that the first act of intercourse was riot voluntary on the victim\u2019s part; and that in such statements and others made to two doctors at the county jail he had indicated some recollection of having put the tie around the victim\u2019s neck at the second place where the car was stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Whitehorn testified that both acts of intercourse were free and voluntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>on Mrs. Gums\u2019 part and that he and Mrs. Gums had torn off all her clothing \u201cin the heat of passion.\u201d He further testified that, although he knew what was happening when Hummel had the necktie around her throat it happened too fast for him to do anything about it but he did not assist him in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">As we have indicated at the outset, petitioner contends that the admission into evidence of Hummel\u2019s extrajudicial statements violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and denied him due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Since our affirmance five years ago of petitioner\u2019s conviction, the United States Supreme Court has decided the case of <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>391 U.S. 123.  As we recently explained in <em>In re Hill </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 997, 1008 [80 Cal.Rptr. 537, 458 P.2d 449], <em>\u201cBruton </em>holds that it is a denial of the right to cross-examination, guaranteed to a defendant in a criminal case by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment, to admit at a joint trial an extrajudicial confession of a codefendant which implicates the defendant, despite instructions to the jury to disregard the confession as evidence against the nonconfessing defendant.\u201d The basic reason underlying this holding is the substantial risk that the jury despite the instruction to the contrary, will consider such statement in determining the defendant\u2019s guilt. In <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Russell </em>(1968) 392 U.S. 293 [20 L.Ed.2d 1100, 88 S.Ct. 1921], the high court held that the above rule announced in <em>Bruton </em>was to be applied both to state and federal prosecutions, with full retroactivity without regard to time, since the error involved goes to the fairness of the guilt-determining process. (See <em>In re Hill, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">We think it is manifest that the admission of Hummel\u2019s extrajudicial statements in the instant case falls within the above rules announced in <em>Bruton </em>and <em>Roberts. </em>The Attorney General, however, contends that there was no error under <em>Bruton </em>since, Hummel having testified and having been available for cross-examination at the joint trial, Whitehorn\u2019s constitutional right under the Sixth Amendment was respected, and alternatively that if there- was error, it was harmless. We proceed to consider this bifurcated contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">First, however, we decline, as we must, the Attorney General\u2019s invitation to resolve the question before us on the basis of our holdings in <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 518 [47 Cal.Rptr. 353, 407 P.2d 265], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Charles </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 330 [57 Cal.Rptr. 745, 425 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>545], In <em>Aranda, </em>we adopted new rules governing the introduction of extrajudicial statements of a codefendant at a joint trial; taking pains to point out that \u201cIn the absence, however, of a holding by the United States Supreme Court that the due process clause requires such change, the rules we now adopt are to be regarded, not as constitutionally compelled, but as judicially declared rules of practice to implement section 1098.\u201d (63 Cal.2d at p. 530; fn. omitted.) In <em>Charles, </em>which was also decided before <em>Bruton, </em>we said that the \u201cpurposes of <em>Aranda </em>thus do not require its application to convictions long since final\u201d (66 Cal.2d at p. 333) and while we held \u201cthat cases still pending on direct review should be adjudicated in accord with the principles which <em>Aranda </em>established\u201d (66 Cal.2d at p. 334), we declined to accord to <em>Aranda </em>full retroactive operation without regard to time. While we intimate no intention to qualify our <em>Aranda </em>rules, we point out that the principles of <em>Bruton, </em>while dealing with the same area, have been cast in a constitutional mold. In applying them, we are under the compulsion of <em>Roberts </em>to give them full retroactive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">We turn to the Attorney General\u2019s contention that there is no <em>Bruton </em>error in the first place because Hummel took the stand. He asserts that <em>Bruton </em>in language set forth in the footnote<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cstrongly implies\u201d that the confrontation requirement is satisfied in such a situation. He also directs our attention to <em>Santoro </em>v. <em>United States </em>(9th Cir. 1968) 402 F.2d 920, and <em>Rios-Ramirez </em>v. <em>United States </em>(9th Cir. 1968) 403 F.2d 1016, which distinguished <em>Bruton </em>and held it inapplicable where the confessing defendant testified and was available for cross-examination. While it is arguable that some implication, as urged by the People, can be found in <em>Bruton, </em>we do not apprehend therein anything either explicitly stating or convincingly indicating that <em>Bruton </em>should have no application where the confessing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>defendant testifies at the joint trial. Furthermore, we considered<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the above two federal cases in <em>In re Hill, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 997, 1009 and observed: \u201cWe do not believe that such is a proper interpretation of <em>Bruton </em>in the light of recent right-to-confrontation eases decided by the Supreme Court and by this court.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]  Rather, we think that the admission at a joint trial of an extrajudicial confession of a codefendant which seriously implicates the defendant deprives the latter of his right to confrontation even if the confessing codefendant takes the stand and gives testimony in accordance with his prior confession. However, the testimony so given by the confessing party has a significantly mitigating effect as to any prejudice which might be claimed to result from the admission of the extrajudicial confession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">As we said in <em>Hill, </em>\u201cthe Sixth Amendment right to confrontation is intended to give to defendants in criminal cases the right to cross-examine as to statements made by the witness <em>at the time the witness makes those statements, before the same trier of fact which sits on the issue of his guilt </em>providing that there is no showing of a legal necessity to justify the admission of such statements without cross-examination.\u201d (71 Cal.2d at p. 1012.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Applying <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>391 U.S. 123 and <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Russell, supra, </em>392 U.S. 293, as we did in <em>Hill, </em>we conclude that the admission of Hummel\u2019s extrajudicial statements inculpating Whitehorn was error despite the fact that the jury was instructed to disregard such hearsay evidence in determining Whitehorn\u2019s guilt and despite the fact that Hummel testified at their joint trial. We must now determine whether the People have proved \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u201d <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710, 87 S.Ct. 824]; see <em>In re Hill, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 997, 1014.)</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">We note at the outset that the prosecution\u2019s case was presented, argued and submitted to the jury as one of first degree murder based upon two theories: first, that the murder was a \u201cwillful, deliberate and premeditated killing\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 189); and second, that it was first degree felony murder, since it was.\u201ccommitted in the perpetration of . . . [a] rape, . . .\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 189.) Whitehorn\u2019s defense was essentially a denial that the murder was deliberate or premeditated and, as to the second theory, a denial that it was first degree felony murder because, as he claimed, the acts of intercourse were consented to by Mrs. Gums and therefore could not constitute rape. On this vital issue of consent, Whitehorn testified at trial that the acts of intercourse were free and voluntary on the victim\u2019s part, and not resisted by her. This in-court testimony was contrary in significant respects to his extrajudicial statements received in evidence, wherein he stated to the officers that the first act of intercourse was <em>not </em>voluntary on the victim\u2019s part, that, although not resisting, she was not happy about it, that she asked him <em>not </em>to do it, and that she was very possibly in fear. At trial, Whitehorn explained this inconsistency by stating that she merely objected to the act taking place in Hummel\u2019s presence. The defense also introduced on this issue of consent evidence as to particular previous conduct of the victim and as to her general reputation to the end of establishing that she was an unchaste woman and one likely to have given her consent on the night in question. To the same end, Whitehorn testified that she had been stripped of her clothing not by a violent unwanted attack upon her but in the course of a frenzy of passion in which she was a willing participant. In short, one must conclude from all of this that Whitehorn had raised this issue of consent and thus of the rape itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Since we cannot ascertain from the record, upon which of the prosecution\u2019s theories the jury based its verdict finding petitioner guilty of murder of the first degree, in order to uphold the verdict despite the <em>Bruton </em>error resulting from the admission of Hummel\u2019s extrajudicial statements, we \u201cmust be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>doubt\u201d <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710]) as to <em>both </em>of such theories. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 351, 360 [46 Cal.Rptr. 763, 406 P.2d 43]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 373, 405-406 [38 Cal.Rptr. 890, 392 P.2d 790]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Orcalles </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 562, 573 [197 P.2d 26]; see <em>Huebotter </em>v. <em>Follett </em>(1946) 27 Cal.2d 765, 770-771 [167 P.2d 193].)</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">We therefore proceed to assess the impact of the <em>Bruton </em>error on each of the prosecution\u2019s theories of case. Following <em>Bruton </em>we accept the premise that the extrajudicial statements of Hummel must be deemed to have been considered by the jury against petitioner despite the court\u2019s limiting instruction to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Although Hummel\u2019s several extrajudicial statements differed in some of their details and were even conflicting in some parts where he subsequently made corrections or changes, nevertheless all of the statements were consistent in asserting that the victim did not voluntarily engage in the acts of intercourse. In the statement made to the officers on April 26, 1962, Hummel declared that at the time of the first act of intercourse, Whitehorn told the victim \u201cDon\u2019t fight me or I\u2019ll hurt you\u201d and that Mrs. Gums in turn had pleaded with him to desist; had started crying and eventually had become angry, saying \u201cyou\u2019re going to regret this the rest of your life.\u201d He also stated at the same time that at the time of the second act of intercourse the victim \u201cstarted screaming and hollering, and everything else. She wasn\u2019t exactly screaming and hollering but she was raising quite a fuss, ...\u201d On April 27, Hummel repeated his statement of the preceding day in White-horn\u2019s presence when both men were jointly interviewed by the officers. On the same day, Hummel gave a separate statement which was stenographically recorded and was substantially the same as his prior statements but in more detail. These were followed by a statement on May 1, wherein Hummel, changing his earlier account of the victim\u2019s death, said that it was he who had strangled Mrs. Gums with the necktie while Whitehorn held her and answered in the negative a question as to whether the victim was \u201cstruggling or screaming or crying\u201d at the time of the second act of intercourse. Finally, in his statement of August 9, Hummel said that on such occasion the victim <em>was </em>struggling and crying but was not screaming.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In this last statement, Hummel also recounted a conversation between Whitehorn and himself at a service station on the way to the first stop in the hills. This took place outside the car and the victim\u2019s presence. In substance, Whitehorn asked Hummel \u201cif I would like to go out with this woman for the purpose of having intercourse\u201d and added that \u201cif she goes out she\u2019s not coming back.\u201d Later on, en route to the location where the second act of intercourse took place, Hummel \u201ckept motioning to Norman with my hand, taking my thumb and passing it from left to right across my throat,...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>In summary, Hummel\u2019s statements essentially boil down to this: White-horn and he took the victim to two isolated spots in each of which Whitehorn had sexual intercourse with her over her protests and against her will. Finally, Whitehorn held the victim while Hummel strangled her.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There had been some understanding between the two of them that the victim was to be killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">As we have stated earlier, Whitehorn also made free and voluntary statements to law enforcement officers, which were admitted in evidence during the prosecution\u2019s case in chief. In the morning of April 27th, Whitehorn directed officers to the beach where the victim\u2019s clothes had been buried. En route to the beach and while he was there, Whitehorn, in a conversation with a Marine investigator, related a story similar to Hummel\u2019s as to how the two men met and as to their activities up to the time of the first act of intercourse. Whitehorn admitted that he had engaged in intercourse with the victim on two separate occasions and that after the second time at Hummel\u2019s direction he grabbed and held the victim while Hummel took a necktie off the front seat and strangled her. Whitehorn then explained how the two men disposed of the body and of the victim\u2019s clothing and personal effects. When asked if the woman \u201cfought him off\u201d Whitehorn replied \u201cwhat could she do with two men in the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">In the afternoon of April 27th, Whitehorn made a statement which was stenographically recorded. He stated that he was the first to have sexual intercourse with the victim implying that Hummel also had intercourse with her. In response to the question \u201cWas this act of sexual intercourse free and voluntary on her part?\u201d Whitehorn declared \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say so, no.\u201d He was then asked: \u201cIn other words, she wasn\u2019t happy about the situation?\u201d to which defendant answered \u201cNo.\u201d When asked if she resisted, he replied, \u201cNot to any great extent.\u201d In this statement Whitehorn also said that while they were driving and Mrs. Gums was sitting in the back seat, Hummel made a gesture doubling up his fist and pointing his thumb downward, indicating to Whitehorn that apparently Hummel wanted to do away with her, although Hummel did not say so. Whitehorn also stated that when they stopped the second time, he tore off all of the victim\u2019s clothes, that although she \u201cmade several statements\u201d she did not physically resist; that he believed she asked him not to do it; and that she was very possibly in fear. Upon completion of the act and while he held her arms pinned to her sides, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Hummel strangled her. In summary then, Whitehom\u2019s statements were to the effect that he drove Mrs. Gums and Hummel to two different locations; that without Mrs. Gums\u2019 consent he had intercourse with her at each location; and that while he was holding her after the second act of intercourse, Hummel strangled her.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">The testimony of both defendants at the trial differed substantially from their respective extrajudicial statements. As we have pointed out, Hummel testified that the victim did not remonstrate or protest when Whitehorn first had intercourse with her and that when the car was stopped the second time, he did not witness any act of intercourse and did not hear the victim object to being in the car or request to be let out of it. On cross-examination, Hummel denied that he had had any conversation with petitioner about killing Mrs. Gums after having intercourse with her, explained that by doubling up his fist and pointing \u201cthumbs down\u201d he meant that he wanted Whitehorn to turn down the radio, and that he did not know exactly what was said between petitioner and the victim at the time of the first act of intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Whitehorn, as we have already said, testified that both acts of intercourse were voluntary on the victim\u2019s part, that her objections were not to the intercourse itself but to its taking place in Hummel\u2019s presence, and that he and the victim had stripped off her clothing during moments of passion.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">However, for the purposes of our present inquiry as to whether the admission of Hummel\u2019s statements was prejudicial to petitioner, the significance of the evidentiary setting we have depicted lies not in the fact that each defendant attempted to change his extrajudicial statements but in the fact that the extrajudicial statements of each were essentially the same. Out of court, both defendants gave the same account of the evening\u2019s events; their initial statements to the officers (although Hummel\u2019s were in more detail) made clear that Mrs. Gums had been subjected to two acts of intercourse despite her protests and over her resistance. To put it another way, she did not consent to either act and had been raped twice and murdered in the perpetration of both rapes or at least of the second one. It is manifest then that in respect to the prosecution\u2019s theory of first degree felony murder-rape, the jury heard the same evidence from petitioner\u2019s extrajudicial statements as they heard from Hummel\u2019s; that is, that the victim did not freely and voluntarily engage in the acts of intercourse. We cannot see how petitioner could have been prejudiced by the error relating to Hummel\u2019s statements, when he had made essentially the same statements himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Nor do we find the <em>Bruton </em>error prejudicial when we consider it in respect to the prosecution\u2019s theory that the killing was willful, deliberate and premeditated. Although petitioner\u2019s extrajudicial statements did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>coincide with Hummel\u2019s as to the conversation at the service station prior to the first act of intercourse at which time, according to Hummel, petitioner indicated Mrs. Gums might not \u201ccome back,\u201d nevertheless both men made statements to the effect that en route to the second spot, Hummel kept motioning with his hand, taking his thumb and passing it across his throat. Petitioner admitted .that this sign indicated to him \u201cthat apparently he [Hummel] would want to dispose of her, . . .\u201d He further stated that he held the victim with her arms pinned while in his plain sight Hummel strangled her. When we consider this episode in the light of the full narrative of the statements of both men, we cannot see how the admission of Hummel\u2019s statements prejudiced petitioner in respect to this theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">In short we can find no prejudice to petitioner in the fact that the jury might have considered Hummel\u2019s statements against him, because in general petitioner made essentially the same statements himself. Additionally we may speculate that he had the benefit of more favorable testimony from Hummel at trial. But, quite apart from this, petitioner had the opportunity to cross-examine Hummel at trial, to exploit the latter\u2019s change of story and to challenge his out-of-court narrative of events. Pertinent here are our observations in <em>In re Hill, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 997, where the confessions of defendants Hill and Saunders were admitted in evidence under instructions of the court that they were to be considered only against the confessing defendant and not as evidence against any other defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hill\u2019s confession implicated Saunders and Saunders\u2019 confession implicated Hill; neither defendant took the stand at trial. Holding that any resulting <em>Bruton </em>error was not prejudicial, we reasoned: \u201cHowever, most persuasive to us of the harmless nature of the error was that each confessed to the crime and each confession was properly admitted in evidence against the confessing party. As we have said in another context: \u2018[T]he confession operates as a kind of evidentiary bombshell which shatters the defense.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Schader </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 716, 731 [44 Cal.Rptr. 193, 401 P.2d 665].) A \u2018confession . . . constitute] persuasive evidence of guilt, . . .\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Parham </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 378, 385 [33 Cal.Rptr. 497, 384 P.2d 1001]) and necessarily has a strong impact on the jury. Since there was no evidence whatsoever in favor of Hill\u2019s innocence and only Saunders\u2019 initial exculpatory statement as evidence of his innocence the confession of each was evidence which was \u2018merely cumulative\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jacobson </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 319, 331 [46 Cal.Rptr. 515, 405 P.2d 555]) of evidence properly admitted against the other. \u2018Where the jury has heard not only a codefendant\u2019s confession but defendant\u2019s own confession no such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>\u201cdevastating\u201d risk attends the lack of confrontation as was thought to be involved in <em>Bruton.\u2019 (United States </em>ex rel. <em>Catanzaro </em>v. <em>Mancusi </em>(2d Cir. 1968) 404 F.2d 296, 300;. . .)\u201d <em>(In re Hill, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 997, 1014-1015.)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">In the instant case petitioner\u2019s own extrajudicial statements established not only that he raped Mrs. Gums on each occasion but also that after the second rape petitioner with full knowledge of what was going on participated in her strangulation. Under the circumstances we are satisfied that the error in admitting Hummel\u2019s statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710].)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The order to show cause is discharged and the petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Traynor, C.

The court also adverted to its action in 1966 in amending rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure as evidencing its repudiation of the basic premise in <em>Delli Paoli </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1956) 352 U.S. 232 [1 L.Ed.2d 278, 77 S.Ct. 294], that the encroachment on the right to confrontation consequent upon the admission of the confessing defendant\u2019s extrajudicial statement could be avoided by an instruction to the jury, quoting the following explanation from the Advisory Committee on the rules: \u201c \u2018A defendant may be prejudiced by the admission in evidence against a co-defendant of a statement or confession made by that co-defendant. This prejudice cannot be dispelled by cross-examination if the co-defendant does not fake the stand.
