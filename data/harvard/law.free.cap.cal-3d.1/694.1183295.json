Code, \u00a7 211) and first degree murder (Pen Code, \u00a7 187) and sentenced them to death. This appeal is automatic. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1239, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">On January 10, 1967, about 1 p.m., a Los Angeles Rapid Transit District busdriver, named Hartzel, was robbed, shot and killed by two male passengers. Two other passengers identified Floyd and one passenger identified Milton as the robbers; Floyd was identified as the triggerman. An eyewitness outside the bus observed Floyd and Milton fleeing; he identified Milton as one of those fleeing the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">A fingerprint of Floyd was found on the bus. Miscellaneous change, but no currency, was found on and near the bus. Twenty-one one-dollar bills, folded individually, and a numbered transfer from the busdriver\u2019s transfer book were found in Floyd\u2019s shirt when he was arrested on the day of the robbery. Thirty one-dollar bills and a five-dollar bill, folded individually, were found in Milton\u2019s pants pocket after he was arrested on the day of the robbery. A later search, authorized by warrant, of the apartment at which Milton and Floyd were arrested yielded a gun, which, according to expert ballistics testimony, was the murder weapon, and a numbered transfer, one number lower than the transfer found on Floyd and also' from the busdriver\u2019s transfer book. Both the gun and the transfer were found in the same place in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Floyd did not testify at either the guilt or penalty trials. Milton testified at both trials. Milton\u2019s defense was that of alibi; he testified that he had been at his half-brother\u2019s apartment (where he and Floyd were arrested) since 11 or 11:30 a.m.; his testimony was corroborated by testimony of his half-brother, a woman who had been the common law wife of his half-brother, and his younger sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">Right to Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">Milton contends that he was denied his right to represent himself, or, in the alternative, denied his right to effective counsel because the trial court refused to appoint another attorney despite defendant\u2019s demands for another attorney. Neither contention has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">A \u201cdefendant in a criminal case has the constitutional right to waive counsel and represent himself if he knowingly and intelligently elects to do so.

However, the decision whether the defendant is capable of making a knowing and intelligent election is a dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>cretionary matter, which, absent a showing of abuse, will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>66 Cal.2d 666, 672 [58 Cal.Rptr. 614, 427 P.2d 214]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Shroyer, </em>203 Cal.App.2d 478, 482-483 [21 Cal.Rptr. 460].)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Although the defendant\u2019s right to represent himself cannot be denied simply because he is unable to \u201cdemonstrate either the acumen or the learning of a skilled lawyer\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harmon, </em>54 Cal.2d 9, 15 [4 Cal.Rptr. 161, 351 P.2d 329]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Linden, </em>52 Cal.2d 1, 18 [338 P.2d 397]; see also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Addison, </em>256 Cal.App.2d 18, 24 [63 Cal.Rptr. 626]), a defendant may waive counsel and choose to represent himself only if the defendant has an intelligent conception of the consequences of his act <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carter, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 666, 670) and understands the nature of the offense, the available pleas and defenses, and the possible punishments <em>(In re Johnson, 62 </em>Cal.2d 325, 335 [42 Cal.Rptr. 228, 398 P.2d 420]).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Milton contends that the questions asked by the trial court, in response to his request to represent himself, and the court\u2019s refusal to allow him to do so violated the rule that a defendant need not have the knowledge or learning of an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The particular questions quoted by Milton, without more, may not have justified denying him his right to represent himself. But the questions cannot be isolated from the answers, nor from other factors of which the court was aware.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>The record makes clear that by May 22, when the motion was made, the court had adequate opportunity to observe and listen to Milton, and adequate grounds to decide that he could not intelligently waive the right to counsel nor represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">First, the charges against Milton were serious, murder and robbery, with the prosecution seeking the death penalty. Second, the court had been requested to appoint a psychiatrist to examine Milton, and a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, although later withdrawn, had been entered. Third, Milton was only 21 years of age at the time of trial, had no prior adult record of convictions, and had a 10th or 11th grade education.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Moreover, Milton\u2019s conduct in court after the court denied his motion to proceed in propria persona makes clear that he was incapable of defending himself. Had a defendant like Milton represented himself in a death penalty case, this court would have been required to reverse any conviction resulting from those proceedings, based on a fundamental denial of due process. There was no error in refusing to allow Milton to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Milton contends that because of an alleged conflict between himself and his court-appointed counsel, he was entitled to have another attorney appointed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n                   \u201c[T]here is no constitutional right to an attorney who will conduct the defense of the case in accordance with an indigent defendant\u2019s whims.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nailor, </em>240 Cal.App.2d 489, 494 [49 Cal.Rptr. 616], cert. den., 385 U.S. 1030 [17 L.Ed.2d 678, 87 S.Ct. 763]; see also <em>People v. Mattson, </em>51 Cal.2d 777, 793 [336 P.2d 937]; <em>In re Atchley, </em>48 Cal.2d 408, 418-419 [310 P.2d 15]; <em>In re Luna, </em>257 Cal.App.2d 754, 757 [65 Cal.Rptr. 121].)  Further, it is well established that an attorney representing a criminal defendant has the power to control the court proceedings. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>67 Cal.2d 105, 114-115 [60 Cal.Rptr. 234, 429 P.2d 586], cert. den. 389 U.S. 1009 [19 L.Ed.2d 607, 88 S.Ct. 572]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>67 Cal.2d 604, 606 [63 Cal.Rptr. 288, 432 P.2d 976]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Darling, </em>58 Cal.2d 15, 19 [22 Cal.Rptr. 484, 372 P.2d 316]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mattson, supra, </em>51 Cal.2d <em>777, </em>789; <em>People </em>v. <em>Merkouris, </em>46 Cal.2d 540, 554-555 [297 P.2d 999].)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Milton\u2019s reliance on <em>People </em>v. <em>Moss, </em>253 Cal.App.2d 248, 250 [61 Cal.Rptr. 107], in which the defendant and his court-appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>attorney had reached an \u201cimpasse on a crucial issue\u201d is misplaced. The court in <em>Moss </em>stated: \u201cWe believe the basic right to representation by counsel . . . encompasses the right to the appointment of different counsel when a legitimate difference of opinion develops between a defendant and his appointed counsel as to a fundamental trial tactic.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 251.) We need not decide whether the rule proposed in <em>Moss </em>correctly states the law as to right to counsel (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Maddox, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d 647, 654, fn. 2), since Milton\u2019s repeated requests that a different attorney be appointed were premised on a lack of confidence in his appointed counsel not on a disagreement as to trial tactics.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The record makes crystal clear that the only substantial \u201cconflict\u201d between Milton and his attorney was that Milton refused to cooperate in order to permit his attorney to prepare a defense consistent with a not guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Change of Venue</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Both Floyd and Milton contend that the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a change of venue deprived them of due process, because defendants were tried \u201cin a county inflamed with passion and prejudice against individuals accused of the type of crimes charged . . . .\u201d The contention is based solely on public concern for and publicity concerning \u201cthe increasing number of crimes being committed in the South Central part of the City against persons involved in various service industries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">\u201cA motion for change of venue . . . shall be granted whenever it is determined that because of the dissemination of potentionally prejudicial material, there is a reasonable likelihood that in the absence of such relief, a fair trial cannot be had.\u201d <em>(Maine </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>68 Cal.2d 375, 383 [66 Cal.Rptr. 724, 438 P.2d 372].) Crime is always a matter for public concern, and if the fact that the public has expressed concern as to a rising crime rate or certain classes of crime meant that a fair trial could not be had, it is doubtful whether a fair trial could ever be had. Such general concerns are in large part balanced by the community\u2019s desire to convict the true wrongdoer and acquit the innocent, and the general concern to reduce crime and apprehend criminals does not furnish the basis for a change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">In all of the cases on which defendants rely, the determination that a fair trial could not be had was based on a showing of prejudice against the particular defendant or defendants. <em>(Sheppard </em>v. <em>Maxwell </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 333, 339-342 [16 L.Ed.2d 600, 606-608, 86 S.Ct. 1507]; <em>Maine </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 375, 385-386; <em>People </em>v. <em>McKay, </em>37 Cal.2d 792, 794 [236 P.2d 145]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Suesser, </em>132 Cal. 631, 633-634 [64 P. 1095]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Yoakum, </em>53 Cal. 566, 569-570; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>5 Cal. 353, 354.) Defendants, however, cite no pub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>licity whatsoever concerning their crime, or arrest, or trial; they concede that only two jurors had even heard of the crime involving Floyd and Milton.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Right to Speedy Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Floyd and Milton claim that they were deprived of their right to a speedy trial, as guaranteed by the United States and California Constitutions. The contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Defendants were arrested on January 10, 1967, for the robbery and murder occurring on that same day. A preliminary hearing was held on January 24, and defendants were bound over for trial in superior court. Floyd pleaded not guilty in February. After separate counsel was appointed for Milton on February 21 <em>(ante, </em>fn. 2), he pleaded not guilty on March 6. Trial was set for March 27. On motion of both defendants\u2019 counsel, trial was continued until May 22. The trial was again continued until July 6, over Milton\u2019s objections but on motion of his defense counsel, because Milton refused to discuss the case with his attorney who, accordingly, was not prepared for trial. The matter trailed until July 7, when Milton again refused to waive time, and petitioned \u201cfor a change of Court on the ground of prejudice.\u201d Trial counsel again stated that Milton refused to cooperate, the trial was put over until July 18, when the challenged judge agreed to transfer the case to another judge. On that same day, both defendants\u2019 counsel joined in a motion to dismiss the case, on grounds that the defendants had been deprived of a speedy trial; the motion was denied on July 19. With both defendants personally consenting, the matter was put over until July 28, so that counsel could file a petition for writ of prohibition with the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal then stayed the matter until August 18, pending decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">On August 16, the People obtained a grand jury indictment; on August 18, the information was dismissed on motion of the prosecution; on August 22, the Court of Appeal dismissed the writ of prohibition as moot. Thereafter, various continuances were granted, on motion of defendants, to seek writs of prohibition from the Court of Appeal and this court, which were denied. The matter finally came to trial on December 21, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">All of the continuances after the filing of the indictment were with the consent of Milton and his attorney. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tahtinen, </em>50 Cal.2d 127, 131 [323 P.2d 442].) All of the earlier continuances were with the consent of counsel although Milton objected to the continuances from May 22 through July 18. Even assuming that the attorney\u2019s consent to the continuances over the client\u2019s objection would not constitute a waiver of the right to speedy trial (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Addison, supra, </em>256 Cal.App.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>18, 22, 26), Milton\u2019s claim of a denial of his right to a speedy trial must be rejected for another reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Although a criminal defendant may not be deprived of a speedy trial because the prosecution\u2014or the defense\u2014is lazy or indifferent, or because the prosecution seeks to harass the defendant rather than bring him.^fairly to justice, a criminal defendant may not juggle his constitutional rights in an attempt to evade prosecution. He may not demand a speedy trial and demand adequate representation, and, by the simple expedient of refusing to cooperate with his attorney, force a trial court to choose between the two demands, in the hope that a reviewing court will find that the trial court has made the wrong choice. \u201cWe cannot tolerate such bad faith and we are not constitutionally required to do so. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smyers, </em>261 Cal.App.2d 690, 700 [68 Cal.Rptr. 194].)</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">In the instant case, the continuances granted over Milton\u2019s objections were requested by the attorney and granted by the trial court because of Milton\u2019s obdurateness in refusing to talk to his attorney. Milton\u2019s refusal to cooperate combined with his insistence on an immediate trial were properly characterized by the trial court as \u201ca very neat device for anybody to escape prosecution.\u201d The device should not be permitted to succeed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Felony-Murder Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Milton contends that an unarmed accomplice to a killing occurring in the perpetration of a robbery should not \u201cper se\u201d be deemed to be guilty of first degree murder. He asks us to judicially invalidate section 31 of the Penal Code, which defines \u201cprincipals\u201d to a crime as including all who \u201cdirectly commit the act . . . or aid and abet in its commission, . . .\u201d to overrule <em>People </em>v. <em>Cabaltero, </em>31 Cal.App.2d 52, 56-57 [87 P.2d 364], which held that the felony-murder rule applies to all participants in one of the enumerated felonies under section 189 of the Penal Code, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>62 Cal.2d <em>777, </em>782-783 [44 Cal.Rptr. 442, 402 P.2d 130], which reiterated the <em>Cabaltero </em>rule. The suggestion is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">Milton relies on the 1949 amendment to section 1203 of the Penal Code, which deals with the granting of probation. Before the 1949 amendment, probation could not be granted \u201cto one who, although not personally armed with a deadly weapon, acted with a companion who was so armed. [Cita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>tions.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>37 Cal.2d 62, 63 [230 P.2d 353].) In 1949, the Legislature amended the words \u201cwho . . . was armed\u201d to \u201cwho . . . was <em>himself </em>armed . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1949, ch. 1329, \u00a7 1, at pp. 2324, 2325.)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\"><em>Perkins </em>construed the amendment to grant the trial court discretion to order probation where the participant in the crime seeking probation was not himself armed. (37 Cal.2d at p. 64.) But <em>Perkins </em>made clear that the amendment to section 1203 did not change the definition of the substantive crime involved: \u201cIt should be noted that . . . the fact that defendant Perkins was not \u2018himself armed with a \u2018dangerous or deadly weapon\u2019 does not make him any the less, in a legal sense, guilty of robbery in the first degree, which is defined by section 21 la of the Penal Code. Perkins is guilty of first degree robbery, regardless of the precise acts which he committed personally, because he aided and abetted in its commission (Pen. Code, \u00a7 31). Indeed it was by analogy to this rule, which makes all willful participants in a crime guilty as principals, that it was originally held that a defendant in the situation of Perkins could not have probation. . . .\u201d (37 Cal.2d at pp. 64-65; fns. omitted; see also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Barclay, </em>40 Cal.2d 146, 155-156 [252 P.2d 321].)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Milton contends nonetheless that the application of the felony-murder rule to unarmed accomplices conflicts with the legislative <em>policy </em>underlying section 1203 of the Penal Code. That contention is untenable. The purpose .of the 1949 amendment was not to discourage felons from arming themselves but to extend the discretion of the trial court in determining when probation is appropriate. That purpose is made clear by subsequent amendments to section 1203.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">In 1957, section 1203 was amended to allow the trial court \u201cin unusual cases\u201d to grant probation to a person convicted of robbery who was himself armed. (Stats. 1957, ch. 2054, \u00a7 1, at pp. 3648, 3649.) In 1965, section 1203 was again amended to allow the trial court \u201cIn unusual cases . . . with the concurrence of the district attorney\u201d to grant probation to persons convicted of murder who were themselves armed. (Stats. 1965, ch. 1720, \u00a7 1, at pp. 3867, 3870.) Thus, the distinction between armed and unarmed felons, and \u201cordinary\u201d felonies and murder, rather than being enhanced, as defendant would find, has been diminished, for purposes of the trial court\u2019s discretion in deciding whether probation would be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Finally, the conclusive presumption of malice as to Milton is not \u201cneedlessly harsh.\u201d Milton contends that \u201che neither committed nor encouraged commission of a homicide.\u201d That contention baldly misstates the record; Floyd held the gun, and Milton struggled with the driver for the money. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Assuming that a case might exist in which the accomplice strove to his utmost to engage in a simple second degree robbery, this is not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Effective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Milton contends that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel, and that the proceedings were reduced to a farce and a sham, because his trial attorney (1) called only three of five possible alibi witnesses, and did not interview those not called; (2) did not move to exclude in-court identifications of Milton at the guilt trial on grounds that the identifications were a product of an unfair pretrial confrontation; (3) did not move to exclude in-court identifications of Milton at the penalty trial, for the same reasons. None of these contentions has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Ibarra, </em>60 Cal.2d 460, 464 [34 Cal.Rptr. 863, 386 P.2d 487], we held that it is \u201ccounsel\u2019s duty to investigate carefully all defenses of fact and of law that may be available to the defendant, and if his failure to do so results in withdrawing a crucial defense from the case, the defendant has not had the assistance to which he is entitled. [Citations.]\u201d In <em>Ibarra, </em>the record made clear that the attorney did not know the \u201ccommonplace\u201d rule concerning standing to challenge an illegal search and seizure. (60 Cal.2d at p. 465.) <em>Ibarra </em>emphasized that \u201cIt must appear that counsel\u2019s lack of diligence or competence reduced the trial to a \u2018farce or a sham.\u2019 \u201d (60 Cal.2d at p. 464.)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">It is not sufficient to allege merely that the attorney\u2019s tactics were poor, or that the case might have been handled more effectively. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>64 Cal.2d 766, 773 [51 Cal.Rptr. 691, 415 P.2d 35], cert. den., 385 U.S. 952 [17 L.Ed.2d 229, 87 S.Ct. 332]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>64 Cal.2d 130, 140 [48 Cal.Rptr. 879, 410 P.2d 383]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>271 Cal.App.2d 84, 111 [76 Cal.Rptr. 725]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>255 Cal.App.2d 493, 496 [63 Cal.Rptr. 93].)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">Rather, the defendant must affirmatively show that the omissions of defense counsel involved a critical issue, and that the omissions cannot be explained on the basis of any knowledgeable choice of tactics.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">Milton\u2019s sole defense was that of alibi. His counsel on appeal contends that the defense was reduced to a farce and a sham because Milton\u2019s attorney at the trial called \u201conly\u201d three of five possible alibi witnesses. However, the choice of which, and how many, of potential witnesses is precisely the type of choice which should not be subject to review by an appellate court. Indeed, there is not even any basis for accusing Milton\u2019s counsel of poor tactics in his choice of witnesses: He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>called Milton\u2019s half-brother and sister, and a woman who formerly lived with the half-brother, who all supported the alibi defense. None of these witnesses was impeached on the grounds of prior criminal records. The half-brother also provided an explanation for Milton\u2019s possession of the currency in small denominations. The attorney did not call a cousin, Richard Myles, who was imprisoned at the time of trial, and who (because he was the same height as Milton) the defense attempted to insinuate might be the real culprit. He did not call a woman, Carolyn Billie Whitley, whose name Milton could not remember at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Milton complains that the trial attorney did not interview the two prospective witnesses. We know of no rule which requires an attorney to interview all prospective witnesses, particularly when, as here, one of the prospective witnesses was prima facie undesirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">To support the allegation that Milton\u2019s attorney was \u201cincompetent,\u201d counsel on appeal have submitted affidavits from the witnesses who were not called, stating they were not interviewed and request that we take further evidence on the matter. Our function on appeal is limited to a consideration of matters contained in the record of the trial proceedings. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>66 Cal.2d 390, 396-397 [58 Cal.Rptr. 1, 426 P.2d 161].) In any event, there is nothing in Milton\u2019s allegations of incompetence to justify our expanding a more than adequate record. The motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">One of the passengers on the bus who identified Floyd and Milton at the trial was a Mrs. Foster, who sat opposite defendants on the bus for 25 to 30 minutes, before they committed the robbery and murder. She described the defendants as follows: Floyd was wearing light green pants, a long-sleeved white dress shirt, high-topped light-brown shoes, glasses and a hat, and was considerably shorter and heavier than Milton. Milton was wearing dark pants, black shoes, and a \u201cprint-type\u201d shirt; the right cuff on Milton\u2019s pants had fallen down. In court, she estimated that Floyd was about 5 feet, 7 inches tall, and that Milton was about 6 feet, 1 or 2 inches tall. She identified both Floyd and Milton in a lineup conducted at the police station the evening of the same day the defendants were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Charles McAfee, who was stopped in his car behind the bus, identified Milton as one of the men who ran away from the bus after the robbery. He furnished the police with a detailed description of Floyd and Milton, although at the trial he testified only that Floyd was about 5 feet 6 or 7 inches tall, and weighed about 160 pounds, and that Milton was around 6 feet 6 inches tall, weighed about 190 pounds, and had an \u201corangish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>brown\u201d sweater or light shirt. McAfee indentified Milton at the police station shortly after Milton was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Milton claims that the pretrial identification by Mr. McAfee and Mrs. Foster was impermissibly suggestive and deprived him of due process of law, and that the failure of Milton\u2019s counsel to demand a hearing outside the presence of the jury on the issue of improper pretrial identification reduced the proceedings to a sham and a farce.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\"><em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 218, 237 [18 L.Ed.2d 1149, 1162, 87 S.Ct. 1926], held that a defendant who is required to appear in a lineup for purposes of identification by a witness has a right, absent knowledgeable waiver, to have counsel present at the lineup. If this right is violated, the government must then be allowed \u201cthe opportunity to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the in-court identifications were based upon observations of the suspect other than the lineup identification.\u201d (388 U.S. at p. 240 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 1164].) <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 263, 272 [18 L.Ed.2d 1178, 1186, 87 S.Ct. 1951], made clear that where a defendant is placed in a lineup without counsel being present or waived, it is constitutional error to admit the \u201cin-court identifications without first determining that they were not tainted by the illegal lineup but were of independent origin . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\"><em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 293 [18 L.Ed.2d 1199, 87 S.Ct. 1967], applied the lineup rules to individual confrontations of the defendant and witness (388 U.S. at p. 295 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 1202]), and held that the rules of <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>must be applied only to confrontations occurring after the date of those opinions <em>(id., </em>at p. 296 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 1203]). The majority of this court adopted the same rule in <em>People </em>v. <em>Feggans, </em>67 Cal.2d 444, 448 [62 Cal.Rptr. 419, 432 P.2d 21]. However, <em>Stovall </em>also held that a <em>pre-Wade </em>or <em>pre-Gilbert </em>lineup could be so \u201cunnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification\u201d as to deny a defendant due process of law. (388 U.S. at p. 302 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 1206].) Whether a confrontation was so unfairly suggestive \u201cdepends on the totality of the circumstances surrounding it, ...\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">Thus, unlike cases to which <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>apply, in which the mere fact of the confrontation having occurred without an attorney being present or the right to an attorney having been waived places the burden on the prosecution to show that the in-court identification was not tainted, in cases where <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>do not apply, before the defendant \u201cmay invoke an exclusionary concept he must demonstrate that the lineup \u2018resulted in such unfairness that it infringed his right to due process of law.\u2019 <em>(Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 293, 299 . . . .)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caruso, </em>68 Cal.2d 183, 184 [65 Cal.Rptr. 336, 436 P.2d 336]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>see also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>270 Cal.App.2d 238, 244 [75 Cal.Rptr. 688]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>263 Cal.App.2d 590, 593 [69 Cal.Rptr. 748].)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Where a defendant does establish that an identification has been \u201cunnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification\u201d <em>(Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, supra, </em>388 U.S. 293, 302 [18 L.Ed.2d 1199, 1206, 87 S.Ct. 1967]), the prosecution must then, as in cases to which <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>apply, \u201con <em>voir dire </em>show by clear and convincing proof that the in-court identifications were based upon observations of the accused at the scene of the robbery.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caruso, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 183, 189.)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">There is, however, nothing in the language of <em>Wade, Gilbert, Stovall, Caruso, </em>or any of the cases following that suggests that a demand for a <em>voir dire </em>hearing on the issue is required or appropriate regardless of the circumstances of the lineup.  A hearing outside the jury\u2019s presence is required only where there is some factual conflict concerning the fairness of the lineup. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burns, supra, </em>270 Cal.App.2d 238, 244-245; <em>People </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>259 Cal.App.2d 694, 697-698 [66 Cal.Rptr. 492].)  There is no factual conflict in the instant case as to the composition of the lineup or the circumstances of the identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Nor was the pretrial identification of Milton unfair. Mrs. Foster was asked to identify Milton and Floyd out of a lineup consisting of six young male Negroes, including defendants. Two of the men were apparently intended to be matched to Floyd, and the propriety of the identification of Floyd is not challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The other two men were presumably to be matched to Milton. Milton was 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighed 140 pounds. One man was 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighed 198 pounds. The other man was 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighed 175 pounds. Milton was wearing the unhemmed pants which he wore when arrested; his pants had been taken from him after he was arrested, and he was requested to change back into the unhemmed pants for the lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Although the other men may have been darker in complexion and not as thin, the men in the lineup were sufficiently similar in appearance to Milton so that the lineup was not <em>\u201cunnecessarily </em>suggestive.\u201d <em>(Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, supra, </em>388 U.S. at p. 302 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 1206]; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Farley, </em>267 Cal.App.2d 214, 218 [72 Cal.Rptr. 855], the mere fact that others in the lineup were \u201ctaller\u201d than the defendant did not make the identification unfair. Similarly, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Lasiter, </em>265 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Cal.App.2d 361, 363, 366 [71 Cal.Rptr. 218], where all six men were of similar height and similarly garbed, the lineup was not unfair because only the defendant was of Anglo-Saxon extraction, the others being Latin-American extraction. (Compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Menchaca, </em>264 Cal.App.2d 642, 644-645 [70 Cal.Rptr. 843].)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\"><em>Wade </em>itself provides examples of the types of suggestive lineups that the <em>Wade </em>rule was formulated to prevent: A six-man lineup consisting of only one Oriental, the defendant; one black-haired person among light-haired persons; a tall defendant with short men; a youthful defendant with men over 40 years of age. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Wade, supra, </em>388 U.S. 218, 232 [18 L.Ed.2d 1149, 1160, 87 S.Ct. 1926].) In <em>Foster </em>v. <em>California </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 440 [22 L.Ed.2d 402, 89 S.Ct. 1127], the defendant was nearly 6 feet tall, and placed in a lineup consisting of two others who were 5 feet 5 or 6 inches tall. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Caruso, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 183, 187, footnote 1, the defendant was 6 feet 1 inch tall, weighed 238 pounds, had a very dark complexion and dark wavy hair. <em>None </em>of the persons in the lineup <em>approximated </em>his size and not one had his dark complexion.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">No such suggestiveness is found in the lineup in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Milton contends, however, that the lineup is unfair because he was required to wear the trousers in which he was arrested, the right cuff of which was loose. We are, however, cited to no authority for the proposition that it is a denial of due process to require a suspect to wear the clothes in which he was arrested. Milton places great weight on the fact that he was asked to remove his trousers when arrested (and given other trousers) but that his trousers were returned to him before he was placed in the lineup. Whether a defendant is required to change clothes one time or twenty times is irrelevant to the issue whether it is unfair to require a defendant to appear in a lineup in the clothes he was wearing when arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">We recognize, of course, that a suspect might be dressed in such a striking outfit that to place him in a lineup with others not similarly garbed would be as unfairly suggestive as to place one Oriental in a lineup of all Caucasians. That is not the situation in the instant case. According to Milton\u2019s testimony, when arrested he was wearing black pants, a T-shirt, and black shoes. His outfit was ordinary. There was no need for the police to match the outfits of everyone in the lineup anymore than the police were required to match the physical proportions of the other men with scientific exactitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">Milton contends that requiring him to wear the trousers in which he was arrested was, in this particular situation, unfair, because witness \u201cFoster\u2019s memory with regard to [Milton] focused solely upon a pair of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>pants with an unhemmed cuff.\u201d This is a bald misstatement of the record, as is made clear from the description provided by Mrs. Foster, discussed above. It is true that Mrs. Foster conceded that it would be \u201ca fair statement\u201d that she remembered the pants worn by Milton more than anything else about him, but that concession hardly qualifies as a statement that her recollection was directed \u201csolely\u201d to his trousers.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Milton contends that the confrontation with witness McAfee was improperly suggestive. The contention is without merit. Milton was arrested at 2:30 or 3 p.m., and apparently was booked about 4 p.m. Shortly thereafter, between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m., McAfee was requested to come to the police station, where Milton was with a police officer. McAfee positively identified Milton as one of the two men who ran away from the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The \u201csingle person showup\u201d is not inherently unfair. <em>(Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, supra, </em>388 U.S. 293, 302; <em>People </em>v. <em>Burns, supra, </em>270 Cal.App.2d 238, 246; <em>People </em>v. <em>Singletary, </em>268 Cal.App.2d 41, 45 [73 Cal.Rptr. 855]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Irvin, </em>264 Cal.App.2d 747, 759-760 [70 Cal.Rptr. 892]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>263 Cal.App.2d 631, 636-637 [69 Cal.Rptr. 670]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Romero, supra, </em>263 Cal.App.2d 590, 593.)  Milton concedes that McAfee was brought to the jail shortly after Milton was arrested, and within several hours of the robbery. The police are not to be criticized because they attempted to establish an affirmative identification as promptly as possible. The sole grounds for Milton\u2019s arrest was that he matched the description provided by the witnesses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">It was in the interest of both Milton and the police to be confronted with a witness as promptly as possible. (See, <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, supra, </em>388 U.S. 293, 302 [\u201cHere was the only person in the world who could possibly exonerate Stovall. . . .\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Irvin, supra, </em>264 Cal.App.2d 747, 760 [\u201cIf innocent men had been apprehended should they await the assembling of a lineup, and the summoning of counsel, while the real perpetrators put more time, and presumably distance, between themselves and the focal point of the offense?\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Romero, supra, </em>263 Cal.App.2d 590, 593.)</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">When McAfee saw Milton at the police station Milton was \u201cdown to a T shirt.\u201d However, McAfee also saw \u201ca piece of material of a brownish orange color, a shirt or a sweat shirt or something like that.\u201d Milton contends that the presence of the sweater or shirt was unnecessarily suggestive, because an orange brownish shirt or sweater was all that McAfee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>could recall of Milton\u2019s clothing, and because the police did not have in their possession at the time of Milton\u2019s arrest an orangish brown sweater. The contention misstates the record. According to the Affidavit in Support of Search Warrant, and Police Property Report,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> when arrested the police took a gold-colored shirt in custody which Milton stated was the one he carried into the apartment. Further, in the Affidavit in Support of Search Warrant, McAfee provided the police with a detailed description of Milton, both as to his physical appearance and clothes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The confrontation between McAfee and Milton was not so suggestive as to deprive Milton of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Finally, Milton challenges the competence of his attorney for not attempting to exclude the in-court identification of Milton, at the penalty trial, in connection with two alleged prior crimes, because the pretrial confrontation which preceded the in-court identification was improper.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The contention is without merit. When the penalty trial was reached, Milton had been convicted of first degree murder and first degree robbery. Evidence was introduced to prove that he had committed a bus robbery in October 1966, a bus robbery in March 1966, a liquor store robbery in December 1966, and a service station robbery in August 1966.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Even assuming that the testimony of one of the two witnesses to the December 1966 liquor store robbery and the testimony of each of the witnesses to the March and October 1966 bus robberies could have been excluded, the failure of Milton\u2019s counsel to object cannot be said to have constituted conduct equivalent to \u201cwithdrawing a crucial defense from the case,\u201d thus depriving him of effective assistance of counsel. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ibarra, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d 460, 464.)</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">Penalty Phase Prior Crimes\u2014Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">At the penalty trial, the prosecution attempted to prove that Milton or Floyd or both of them had committed other crimes. Milton challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to prove two of the crimes, a bus robbery with Floyd in March 1966 and another bus robbery in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>October 1966.  Evidence of such crimes, even though defendants were not charged or convicted of the crimes, is admissible at the penalty trial, but they must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt before the jury may consider them.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Varnum, </em>70 Cal.2d 480, 485 [75 Cal.Rptr. 161, 450 P.2d 553]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Durham, </em>70 Cal.2d 171, 187, fn. 15 [74 Cal.Rptr. 262, 449 P.2d 198].) However, on appeal our sole function is to determine whether or not substantial evidence was presented from which the jury could reasonably have found that defendant had committed the uncharged offenses. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Durham, supra, </em>at p. 189, fn. 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\"><em>March 1966 Bus </em>Robbery\u2014Mr. Raziano, a bus driver, provided the only evidence concerning the bus robbery in March 1966. He tentatively identified both Floyd and Milton in court, stating, \u201cI think\u201d the robbers were Floyd and Milton. Raziano testified that in January 1967 he had picked out Floyd and Milton from about 10 or 12 photographs which the police showed him, and that he had picked Floyd and Milton from a lineup of 10 or 12 men.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">He conceded, however, on cross-examination that the lineup occurred 10 or 11 months after the robbery; that the whole incident on the bus took about a minute or two; that when the robbery occurred \u201cI was worrying about myself\u201d; that at the lineup he told the police he was not sure of his identification; that after being shown photographs, he told the police he was not sure of his identification, and that, as to his courtroom identification of Floyd and Milton, \u201cI am not certain, no,\u201d that Floyd or Milton or either of them robbed him. A special agent for the Rapid Transit District testified that Raziano had never identified Floyd or Milton from mug shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Although on redirect examination, he stated, \u201cYes, I am sure of one. . . . Mr. Floyd,\u201d he did not commit himself as to Milton. Cross-examination by Milton\u2019s attorney made clear his uncertainty as to Milton.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-8\">\u201cQ But any Negro that would be sitting, about Milton\u2019s complexion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>and about the same height, as long as he is sitting near Floyd, you would say he is the man?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-5\">\u201cA I imagine so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The lack of positive identification of Milton merely went to the weight of the foregoing testimony and not to its admissibility <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>68 Cal.2d 467, 472 [67 Cal.Rptr. 551, 439 P.2d 655]). In view of certain similarities between the March 1966 robbery and the robbery of which Milton was convicted at the guilt trial, we are not prepared to hold that Raziano\u2019s testimony could have furnished no substantial evidence whatsoever from which the jury could have determined that Milton also committed the prior offense.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Moreover, the record discloses that Milton\u2019s counsel failed to object to the admission of this evidence at trial, failed to move to strike Raziano\u2019s testimony, and failed to request an instruction admonishing the jury to disregard that testimony.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since Milton interposed no objection at trial to the introduction of the evidence of this prior offense, he cannot now raise the objection for the first time on appeal <em>(People </em>v. <em>Varnum, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 480, 486; <em>People </em>v. <em>Teale, </em>70 Cal.2d 497, 519-520 [75 Cal.Rptr. 172, 450 P.2d 564]).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\"><em>October 1966 Bus </em>Robbery\u2014The contention that the evidence is insufficient to prove that Milton robbed one Ross, a driver for the Los Angeles Rapid Transit District, in October 1966, is without merit. Ross testified that Milton \u201clooked like the man\u201d who held him up; that he \u201cbelieve[d]\u201d Milton was the man who held him up; that he was \u201csaying he looks like the man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Confession of Codefendant Floyd</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Prior to the penalty trial, Milton\u2019s counsel had moved to sever the trial on the ground that codefendant Floyd had made a confession to a psychiatrist, Dr. Tweed, which implicated Milton. The court denied the motion, but instructed Floyd\u2019s counsel and the prosecutor to admonish Tweed to delete all references to Milton and to testify only on those matters pertaining to the possibility of Floyd\u2019s rehabilitation. Milton\u2019s counsel suggested that it would be impossible effectively to delete such testimony, and requested the court to review Tweed\u2019s report, but the court indicated that such a reading would be premature, stating that \u201cI want to meet this issue clear-cut at the time I am confronted with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Floyd did not testify at either the guilt or penalty trials. At the penalty trial, Dr. Tweed related to the jury Floyd\u2019s confessions to Tweed that he had robbed and shot the busdriver. The point of the testimony was to show that Floyd did not intend to shoot the busdriver, but that \u201call of a sudden the gun went off.\u201d At no time did Tweed use Milton\u2019s name in relating Floyd\u2019s confession. However, during Tweed\u2019s examination, the following testimony was elicited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-6\">\u201cQ [by Floyd\u2019s counsel]: Did he [Floyd] say where he had gotten the gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-7\">\u201cA Yes, he said he had gotten the gun from some friend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-8\">\u201cQ Did he say where he was taking it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-9\">\u201cA He stated he was taking it to a relative of this friend from whom he had gotten the gun.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">Milton\u2019s counsel did not object to the foregoing testimony. However, after Tweed was excused, and in the judge\u2019s chambers, Milton\u2019s counsel requested a mistrial on the penalty phase, on the ground that the only possible inference from Tweed\u2019s testimony was that Floyd had obtained the gun from Milton, since other evidence disclosed that the gun was found in the apartment of Milton\u2019s half-brother, where defendants had been apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">The court denied the motion, but subsequently instructed the jury \u201cthat the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony during this penalty trial which disclosed defendant\u2019s statements should be considered only for the purpose of exposing the information upon which the psychiatrist based his opinion [regarding Floyd\u2019s rehabilitation] and not as evidence of the truth of the statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">In <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 123, 129-130 [20 L.Ed.2d 476, 481-482, 88 S.Ct. 1620], the Supreme Court \u201cheld that the intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>duction into evidence of a codefendant\u2019s extrajudicial statement which inculpates the defendant violates the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him even though the jury is instructed not to consider the statement as evidence against him.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flores, </em>68 Cal.2d 563, 568 [68 Cal.Rptr. 161, 440 P.2d 233].) However, the court in <em>Bruton </em>made it clear that not every admission of inadmissible hearsay or other evidence can be considered to be reversible error unavoidable through limiting instructions; the challenged evidence must present a substantial risk that the jury will ignore the instruction. (391 U.S. at p. 135 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 484].) Accordingly, in <em>Flores, supra, </em>we refused to overturn a conviction where the inadmissible evidence provided, at most, only a tenuous basis for an inference of defendant\u2019s guilt, and other evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated defendant\u2019s culpable knowledge. (68 Cal.2d at p. 568; see also <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U.S. 250 [23 L.Ed.2d 284, 89 S.Ct. 1726].)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Prior to the <em>Bruton </em>decision, we had recognized in <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda, </em>63 Cal.2d 518, 530 [47 Cal.Rptr. 353, 407 P.2d 265], that the introduction of such statements could be prejudicial and that a mere instruction to the jury to \u201cdisregard\u201d the confession as to the codefendant might be inadequate. Consequently, we established alternative procedures for situations in which the prosecution proposes to introduce the extrajudicial statement of one codefendant which implicates another codefendant. If the prosecution wishes a joint trial \u201call parts of the extrajudicial statements implicating any codefendants\u201d must be \u201ceffectively deleted without prejudice to the declarant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Milton contends that <em>Aranda </em>and <em>Bruton </em>apply to both the penalty and guilt phases of a criminal proceeding, and that <em>Aranda </em>and <em>Bruton </em>apply whether the incriminating statement is introduced by the prosecution or, as in the instant case, by a codefendant. He further contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for severance at the penalty trial.  We agree that <em>Aranda </em>and <em>Bruton </em>apply to the penalty phase of a criminal proceeding. The importance of the right to timely cross-examination has been sufficiently emphasized by this court and the United States Supreme Court and requires no prolonged discussion. (See, e.g., <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Page </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 719, 721 [20 L.Ed.2d 255, 258, 88 S.Ct. 1318]; <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 400, 404 [13 L.Ed.2d 923, 926, 85 S.Ct. 1065]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, </em>70 Cal.2d 654, 664-665 [75 Cal.Rptr. 782, 451 P.2d 422]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>68 Cal.2d 646, 651-652 [68 Cal.Rptr. 599, 441 P.2d 111]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Boggs, </em>255 Cal.App.2d 693, 702-703 [63 Cal.Rptr. 430] [assuming the applicability of <em>Aranda </em>and <em>Bruton </em>to the penalty phase].)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>At least where one defendant makes a timely objection to the introduction of the extrajudicial statement of a codefendant, we can see no reason why <em>Aranda </em>and <em>Bruton </em>should not apply to such statements when it is the codefendant, rather than the prosecution, who seeks to introduce the statement. To hold that the interests of codefendants in a joint trial\u2014especially a joint penalty trial\u2014are identical is to defy reality. Frequently, as in the instant case, one defendant attempts to show that he is less, or his codefendant more, blameworthy, in the hope of avoiding the death penalty. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Chacon, </em>69 Cal.2d 765, 775 [73 Cal.Rptr. 10, 447 P.2d 106].)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The contention that, under <em>Aranda, </em>the trial court was required to grant Floyd and Milton separate penalty trials is without merit.  The trial court has full discretion to determine a motion for severance, and that discretion will not ordinarily be disturbed by a reviewing court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>62 Cal.2d 870, 883 [44 Cal.Rptr. 784, 402 P.2d 856]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gant, </em>252 Cal.App.2d 101, 112 [60 Cal.Rptr. 154].) <em>Aranda </em>makes clear that a separate trial is required only if \u201call parts of the extrajudicial statements implicating any codefendants\u201d are not or cannot be \u201ceffectively deleted without prejudice to the declarant.\u201d (63 Cal.2d at p. 530; see also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Massie, </em>66 Cal.2d 899, 918 [59 Cal.Rptr. 733, 428 P.2d 869].)  The testimony complained of did not relate to the question of rehabilitation, the subject of Dr. Tweed\u2019s testimony, and could easily have been deleted.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">However, although defendants were not entitled to a separate penalty trial, Milton did have a right, under <em>Aranda, </em>to exclude any portions of Floyd\u2019s admission which incriminated Milton. The question arises whether or not Milton waived that right by failing to object to the admission of Dr. Tweed\u2019s testimony regarding Floyd\u2019s statements to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">We have seen that the court previously had instructed counsel to admonish Tweed to delete all references to Milton. Further, the court indicated that it would meet the issue regarding the implications of Tweed\u2019s testimony as deleted, \u201cat the time I am confronted with it.\u201d Thus, Milton\u2019s-counsel was forewarned that at the trial, Tweed might be asked certain questions which could implicate his client. Nevertheless, although counsel did object to various questions asked of Tweed, he failed to object to the questions \u201cDid he [Floyd] say where he had gotten the gun?\u201d and \u201cDid he say where he was taking it?\u201d Since these questions clearly had no relevance to the subject of Floyd\u2019s rehabilitation, an objection could have been made on that ground, and the challenged testimony excluded without disclosing to the jury that the testimony would have implicated Milton.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">However, we need not rely solely upon counsel\u2019s failure to. object <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>to the introduction of this evidence, for we have concluded that any violation of the principles of <em>Bruton </em>or <em>Aranda </em>was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065].)  As we stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 563, 568, footnote 5, \u201cThe improper admission into evidence of a codefendant\u2019s extrajudicial statement does not automatically require reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">In relating Floyd\u2019s confession, Tweed made no mention of Milton by name, and in fact did not even indicate that Floyd spoke of an accomplice. Although the jury conceivably could have inferred that Milton was the \u201cfriend\u201d who, according to Floyd, gave Floyd the gun, we cannot conclude that any substantial risk was thereby created that the jury would believe Floyd, ignore the court\u2019s instruction, and sentence Milton to death. Other evidence was admitted to show that on at least three prior occasions Milton had committed <em>armed </em>robbery; on two such occasions he was accompanied by Floyd. Seen in this light, the admission of evidence that Milton possessed a gun and gave it to Floyd cannot be characterized as \u201csubstantial error\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>61 Cal.2d 164, 168-170 [37 Cal.Rptr. 622, 390 P.2d 398]), which reasonably may have influenced the jury to impose the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Prosecutor\u2019s Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Floyd and Milton contend that the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct in asking the jury to return the death penalty based on considerations of retribution. The prosecutor\u2019s argument covered some 28 pages of transcript. Among his statements were: \u201cDon\u2019t forget about this man here, Mr. Hartzel, who is now six feet under. He cries out for justice and Mrs. Hartzel, his wife, you think a day will pass the rest of her life when she won\u2019t be reminded of the horror of what happened to her husband and suffer very much for it? . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-8\">\u201cThe question is what would be equal punishment for that act. We are not only talking about avenging Mr. Hartzel\u2019s death, but Mrs. Hartzel. A great, great, an enormous loss. Sometimes it is too easy to forget about the victim and his loved ones. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-9\">\u201cShould these defendants be permitted to live like that [in the prison where it \u2018is not that bad\u2019], we should say that Mr. Hartzel would never eat another meal, never see his wife again, never listen to music again, never see another sunrise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">Although this court has never held that it is improper for a prosecutor in closing argument in a penalty trial to ask the jury to impose the death penalty for reasons of retribution or vengeance, we have stated in other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>contexts that \u201cThere is no place in the scheme for punishment for its own sake, the product simply of vengeance or retribution.\u201d <em>(In re Estrada, </em>63 Cal.2d 740, 745 [48 Cal.Rptr. 172, 408 P.2d 948].) And, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Love, </em>53 Cal.2d 843 [3 Cal.Rptr. 665, 350 P.2d 705], where the issue was the admissibility at the penalty trial of a photograph indicating that the victim had died in great pain, we stated, in finding the photograph prejudicially inflammatory: \u201cProof of such pain is of questionable importance to the selection of penalty unless it was intentionally inflicted.3\u201d And in footnote 3, it was pointed out: \u201cPain unintentionally inflicted is relevant only to the extent that criminal penalties are designed to exact retribution for the evil done by criminals. Whatever may have been the fact historically, retribution is no longer considered the <em>primary </em>objective of the criminal law [citation] and is thought by many not even to be a proper consideration [citations]. Granted, however, that retribution may be a proper consideration, it is doubtful that the penalty should be adjusted to the evil done without reference to the intent of the evildoer. Modern penology focuses on the criminal, not <em>merely </em>on the crime. [Citations.]\u201d (53 Cal.2d at pp. 856-857, fn. 3; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Although the prosecutor asked the jury to consider retribution in deciding whether to impose the death penalty, he also discussed other pertinent factors, including defendants\u2019 commission of other crimes, their premeditation and intent to kill, their lack of remorse, and their amenability to rehabilitation. In these circumstances, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks concerning the widow of the slain busdriver did not constitute misconduct. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Garner, </em>57 Cal.2d 135, 156 [18 Cal.Rptr. 40, 367 P.2d 680]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Love, </em>56 Cal.2d 720, 731 [16 Cal.Rptr. <em>777, </em>17 Cal.Rptr. 481, 366 P.2d 33, 809].)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Furthermore neither counsel objected to the statements at the trial, and \u201cMisconduct of the prosecuting attorney may not be assigned as error on appeal if it has not been assigned at the trial unless, the case being closely balanced and presenting grave doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt, the misconduct contributed to the verdict or unless the harmful results of the misconduct could not have been obviated by a timely admonition to the jury.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Varnum, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 480, 488 [75 Cal.Rptr. 161, 450 P.2d 553].) Here the remarks of the prosecutor fall within the general rule and not within either of the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Witherspoon\u2014Exclusion of Jurors for Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Defendants challenge the exclusion under section 1074, subdivision 8, of the Penal Code of certain jurors, based on those jurors\u2019 opposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>tion to the death penalty. <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 510, 522 [20 L.Ed.2d 776, 784, 88 S.Ct. 1770], holds that \u201ca sentence of death cannot be carried out if the jury that imposed or recommended it was chosen by excluding venirmen for cause simply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction.\u201d The court excepted from this ruling prospective jurors who \u201cmade unmistakably clear . . . that they would <em>automatically </em>vote against the imposition of capital punishment without regard to any evidence that might be developed at the trial of the case before them . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 522, fn. 21 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 785].)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">We must then determine whether all of the excused jurors made it \u201cunmistakably clear\u201d that he or she would automatically vote against the death penalty regardless of the evidence in the case. Of course, as we explain <em>infra, </em>our determination in the instant case must be made on the basis of the <em>voir dire </em>examination of the entire panel of veniremen conducted during the time the particular veniremen were present in the courtroom and until the time they were excused for cause, including all questions posed and answers given, and additionally all of the circumstances in which each colloquy took place. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Varnum, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 480, 492-493].)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Defendants specifically challenge the exclusion of jurors Rogers, Willis, Bishop and Polizzi. We have independently reviewed the <em>voir dire </em>of the other six jurors excluded under section 1074, subdivision 8, of the Penal Code, and find that they were properly excluded under the applicable <em>Witherspoon </em>rules.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>(1) <em>Juror Rogers. </em>We have set forth in an appendix that portion of the transcript pertaining to the <em>voir dire </em>of jurors Rogers and Willis. As to Miss Rogers, the court had inquired whether \u201cthere is any juror that entertains such a conscientious opinion that he would under no circumstances vote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>for the death penalty,\u201d and Miss Rogers replied \u201cI wouldn\u2019t vote for the death penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">On <em>voir dire, </em>Miss Rogers further stated that in her opinion she could not vote for the death penalty no matter how heinous the crime. However, defense counsel then posed the extreme hypothetical example of a defendant who had killed 10 women and children, had stated that he would kill again if released, and had offered to disclose the location of the bodies of his other victims for $100 each. Miss Rogers replied that she did not \u201cknow about that type of person; I never heard,of that type of person.\u201d Upon further questioning along these lines, Miss Rogers agreed that as to such a hypothetical case, the death penalty was a question of \u201cdegree,\u201d and that she would \u201chave to get all the facts,\u201d before deciding whether or not to impose it.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Subsequently, Miss Rogers was asked by the prosecutor whether she would be willing to vote for a verdict of death under any particular circumstances, and she replied \u201cI can\u2019t think of any circumstances now.\u201d However, once again she was presented with the hypothetical-example described above, and was asked whether she would vote for death in that case. Miss Rogers replied \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would or not. I really can\u2019t say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Finally, the prosecutor addressed the jurors as a group, explained that the jury had absolute discretion to determine whether or not a proper case existed to justify the death penalty, and then asked the jury whether they would have the courage to vote for a verdict of death if they determined that this was a proper case. Miss Rogers replied \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d and was excused by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Although the instant trial preceded the decision in <em>Witherspoon, </em>the standards which the trial court imposed comported fully with those announced in <em>Witherspoon. </em>Therefore, we could base our decision as to Miss Rogers upon the rule that \u201cWhere a prospective juror gives conflicting answers to questions relevant to his impartiality, the trial court\u2019s determination as to his state of mind is binding upon an appellate court. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Linden, </em>52 Cal.2d 1, 22 [338 P.2d 397].)</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">Moreover, we have concluded Miss Rogers made it unmistakably clear that under no circumstances would she impose the death penalty, and, therefore, was properly excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">(2) <em>Juror Willis. </em>In response to the question whether there was \u201cany juror that entertains such a conscientious opinion that he would under no circumstances vote for the death penalty,\u201d Juror Willis replied \u201cI am. . . . I don\u2019t believe I could send a man to death. I don\u2019t believe I could vote to go to the gas chamber.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Subsquently, defense counsel examined Miss Rogers on <em>voir dire </em>and, as we noted above, elicited her testimony that she could not vote for the death penalty in any situation, although as to the extreme hypothetical example posed to her, she \u201creally didn\u2019t know,\u201d since \u201cit depends upon the degree,\u201d and \u201cI would have to get all the facts.\u201d Thereupon Juror Willis agreed that his answers to the questions posed to Miss Rogers would be \u201csubstantially the same\u201d as hers.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Finally, Juror Willis was told that the state sought the death penalty for a killing which occurred during an alleged robbery. Willis stated that he was opposed to sitting on the case for the reason that the death penalty was sought, stating further that \u201cI don\u2019t think I would be fair to the State. I don\u2019t think it would be fair to the State for me to sit on it.\u201d When asked if he had a bias or prejudice in the proceeding, Willis replied, \u201cI am against capital punishment, yes.\u201d Thereupon, Juror Willis was excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">We have previously held in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>70 Cal.2d 678, 701, footnote 3 [76 Cal.Rptr. 225, 452 P.2d 329], that a juror was properly excluded who answered \u201cI believe so,\u201d in response to the question whether the venireman would be unable to return a verdict imposing the death penalty regardless of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Moreover, by his initial testimony and by adopting the answers previously given by Miss Rogers, Juror Willis made it unmistakably clear that under no circumstances would he impose the death penalty and, therefore, we conclude that Juror Willis was properly excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">(3) <em>Juror Bishop. </em>Juror Bishop was asked: \u201cCan you imagine a case in which you would be willing to vote for the death penalty, or is your state of mind that you would be unlikely in any situation to vote for death?\u201d He answered: \u201cI would be unlikely in any situation to vote for death.\u201d He was then asked, \u201cWell, Mr. Bishop, in a proper case, would you impose the death penalty?\u201d He then answered, \u201cNo, I would not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">We have heretofore discussed the ambiguity inherent in the phrase, \u201cproper case.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Teale, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 497, 514-515; <em>People </em>v. <em>Varnum, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 480, 494-495.) However, in <em>Teale </em>and <em>Varnum, </em>we held that a juror could be properly excluded, based on a response to a question using the phrase, \u201cproper case,\u201d where the court has, during the <em>voir dire </em>proceedings, \u201cmade clear to the assembled panel that the jury would in its sole discretion decide whether the case before it was a \u2018proper case\u2019 for the infliction of the death penalty.\u201d (70 Cal.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>p. 516.) In the instant case, the court explained to the assembled veniremen: \u201cThe law imposes neither death nor life imprisonment, but presents the two alternatives in the absolute discretion of the jury. The Legislature has formulated no rules to control the exercise of the jury\u2019s decision.\u201d In these circumstances, juror Bishop was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">(4) <em>Juror </em>Polizzi. Juror Polizzi stated: \u201c. . . I don\u2019t believe in the death penalty.\u201d She was questioned further by the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">\u201cQ ... In a proper case are you telling the Court that you would not impose the death penalty?</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">\u201cA Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">\u201cQ Under any circumstances?</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">\u201cA (Nods in the affirmative.) \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">Juror Polizzi was properly excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">Witherspoon\u2014Exclusion of Jurors</p>\n<p id=\"AnQJ\">by Peremptory Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">Defendants contend that the use by the prosecution of peremptory challenges to exclude jurors who expressed negative views concerning the death penalty is improper under <em>In re Anderson, </em>69 Cal.2d 613 [73 Cal.Rptr. 21, 447 P.2d 117]. However, a different question was raised in <em>Anderson, </em>where the Attorney General had argued that any <em>Witherspoon </em>error was nonprejudicial since the prosecution had sufficient peremptory challenges remaining to remove all jurors improperly excluded for cause. We rejected this argument, stating that we could not engage in conjecture that the prosecutor would have used his peremptory challenges to excuse such jurors. (69 Cal.2d at p. 620.)</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">Similarly, we cannot engage in conjecture regarding the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for exercising some of his peremptory challenges to excuse some jurors who had reservations concerning the death penalty. Instead, we must assume \u201cthat the prosecutor is acting on acceptable considerations related to the case he is trying, the particular defendant involved and the particular crime charged.\u201d <em>(Swain </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202, 223 [13 L.Ed.2d 759, 774, 85 S.Ct. 824].) <em>Swain </em>held that the prosecutor could properly exclude all Negroes from a particular jury, regardless of the factual basis for his belief that such jurors, either as individuals or as a class, might be biased in the particular case to be tried. As the court stated, \u201cIn the light of the purpose of the peremptory system and the function it serves in a pluralistic society in connection with the institution of jury trial, we cannot hold that the Constitution requires an examination of the prosecutor\u2019s reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>for the exercise of his challenges in any given case.\u201d (380 U.S. at p. 222 [13 L.Ed.2d at p. 773].)</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">In any event, the <em>voir dire </em>examination of the jurors fails to establish that any juror was peremptorily challenged solely because of his scruples against the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Other Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Defendant\u2019s further contentions concerning the constitutionality of the death penalty and the denial of equal protection in imposing more severe punishment for murder than for attempted murder are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">The judgments are affirmed in their entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">McComb, J., Mosk, J., and Sullivan, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\"><em>VOIR DIRE </em>Examination of Veniremen Rogers and Willis</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-11\">\u201cThe Court: If there is any juror that entertains such a conscientious opinion that he would under no circumstances vote for the death penalty, will you so indicate? \u201cMiss Rogers, what is your feeling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-12\">\u201cMiss Rogers: I wouldn\u2019t vote for the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-13\">\u201cQ By the Court: Do you have any conscientious objection to finding the defendants guilty under those circumstances, is that what you are telling the Court? \u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-14\">\u201cThe Court: Who else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-15\">\u201cMr. Willis: I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-16\">\u201cQ By the Court: Mr. Willis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-17\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-18\">\u201cQ What do you have to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-19\">\u201cA I don\u2019t believe I could send a man to death.

Thus the instant case presents a much clearer violation of <em>Witherspoon </em>than the many previous cases which we have reversed for <em>Witherspoon </em>error because of the exclusion for cause of jurors who, although expressing opposition to the death penalty, were not questioned sufficiently so as to make clear that this opposition was automatic and immutable. In contrast to such prior cases, the two jurors in the present case were questioned at length concerning their opposition to the death penalty and expressly indicated that their opposition was <em>not </em>automatic and immutable.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">At the outset of <em>voir dire </em>both Miss Rogers and Mr. Willis indicated they would not vote for the death penalty under any circumstances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number><em>voir dire </em>of these jurors ended at this point, I would agree that they were properly excluded for cause under <em>Witherspoon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">However, upon questioning by defense counsel thereafter, Miss Rogers stated that she did not know whether she could impose the death penalty in a case such as the aggravated hypothetical case posed to her and that whether she could impose the death penalty if \u201cthe proper case\u201d were presented \u201cdepends on the degree\u201d and on \u201call the facts.\u201d Mr. Willis expressly adopted these answers given by Miss Rogers and added that with him too \u201cit would be a question of degree.\u201d <em>Miss Rogers and Mr. Willis thereby expressly retracted their initial statements and indicated a willingness to consider the death penalty in certain cases. Neither juror subsequently repudiated this view either expressly or impliedly.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Defense counsel\u2019s questioning of Miss Rogers and Mr. Willis was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-7\">\u201cMr. Boags: Miss Rogers, it is your belief that no matter what the person did that you could not vote the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-8\">\u201cMiss Rogers: Yes, that is my opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-9\">\u201cQ By Mr. Boags: No matter how heinous the crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-10\">\u201cA Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-11\">\u201cO You cannot think of a situation where you could say the death penalty would be a proper one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-12\">\u201cA No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-13\">\u201cQ What if\u2014I would like to give you an example. Say, if a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>is proven he killed 10 persons, children and women, and very heinous-type crimes. Then this person, after he was arrested, said, \u2018Yes, I did it and if released I will do it again, and that besides the 10 I killed, for every $100 that you give me, I will show you where the body of another is that I killed.\u2019 And if all those facts are proven and the man testified in court substantially the same way, do you think you could impose the death penalty on that person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-4\">\u201cA I don\u2019t know about that type of person.

It is true that Mr. Willis\u2019 initial testimony did indicate an opposition to the death penalty no matter what the circumstances. However, the <em>voir] dire </em>transcript above quoted clearly demonstrates that the answers of Miss Rogers that Mr. Willis adopted were those indicating that she was uncertain whether she could vote for the death penalty in the aggravated hypothetical case and that whether she could impose the death penalty in \u201cthe proper case\u201d \u201cdepends on the degree.\u201d Mr. Willis\u2019 adoption of these answers, far from making clear an unalterable opposition to the death penalty under any circumstances, indicated that there were indeed circumstances in which he would consider the death penalty. Moreover, Mr. Willis, in addition to adopting the answers of Miss Rogers, stated that imposition of the death penalty was \u201ca question of degree.\u201d Thus Mr. Willis expressly retreated from his initial position by indicating that he would be willing to consider the death penalty in certain cases, and it is clearly incorrect to hold\u2014as the majority do\u2014that \u201cby his initial testimony and by adopting the answers previously given by Miss Rogers, Juror Willis made it unmistakably clear that under no circumstances would he impose the death penalty . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Moreover, it should be noted that Mr. Willis\u2019 statements made after his expression of willingness to consider the death penalty under certain circumstances are consistent with that expression. The majority do not contest this point; they do not contend that his later statements justified his exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Mr. Willis subsequently stated that he was opposed to sitting on the robbery-murder case before him for the reason the death penalty was sought and that he could not be \u201cfair to the State\u201d in the case before him. He was then asked if he had a bias or prejudice in the proceeding, and replied \u201cI am against capital punishment, yes.\u201d He was thereupon excused for cause. These final statements by Mr. Willis indicated merely a general opposition to the death penalty, and, as such, are not only clearly insufficient in themselves as a ground for his exclusion, according to the repeated holdings of this court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but also are not inconsistent with his earlier statements that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>could consider the death penalty in certain circumstances and therefore clearly cannot be construed as a retraction of those earlier statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">In view of his expressed ability to consider the death penalty in. the \u201cproper case,\u201d Mr. Willis did not\u2014as the majority argue\u2014make it \u201cunmistakably clear that under no circumstances would he impose the death penalty . . . .\u201d Quite the contrary, his statements \u201cclearly left open the possibility that in some case [he] might impose the death penalty\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vaughn, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 406, 416), and therefore he was improperly excluded under <em>Witherspoon. </em>(See <em>id., </em>at pp. 413-416; <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>391 U.S. 510, 522, fn. 21 [20 L.Ed.2d 776, 784, 88 S.Ct. 1770].)</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The erroneous exclusion of Mr. Willis alone requires reversal of the penalty trial. (E.g\u201e <em>People </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>71 Cal.2d 1170, 1177 [81 Cal. Rptr. 5,459 P.2d 259]; /\u201e re <em>Arguello, 11 </em>Cal.2d 13, 15-16 [76 Cal.Rptr. 633, 452 P.2d 921]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradford, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 333, 344-345; <em>In re Anderson, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 613, 619.)</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>It is also apparent that Miss Rogers did not repudiate her expressed uncertainty toward the hypothetical case and ability to consider the death penalty in \u201cthe proper case.\u201d When asked by the prosecutor whether she would be willing to vote for a death verdict under any particular circumstances, she equivocally replied \u201cI can\u2019t think of any circumstances now.\u201d Such a response falls far short of the unambiguous response demanded by <em>Witherspoon. </em>(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Vaughn, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 406, 413.) Moreover, when the hypothetical case was thereafter again posed to her she once again expressed uncertainty as to whether she could impose the death penalty in such a case, stating that \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would or not. I really couldn\u2019t say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Finally, the prosecutor asked each juror then present<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> whether he would be willing and have the courage to vote for a verdict of death \u201cin this case\u201d if he thought \u201cthis\u201d was a proper case for the death penalty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Miss Rogers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question whether she would be willing and have the courage to vote for a verdict of death if she \u201cthought that <em>this </em>was a proper case for the imposition of the death penalty, ...\u201d (Italics added.) The prosecutor then asked her, \u201cEven if you thought <em>it </em>was a proper case, you would not have the courage to vote for a verdict of death?\u201d (italics added), to which she replied, \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d She was then excused by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The word \u201cit\u201d in the latter question clearly refers to the words \u201cthis . . . case\u201d in the prior question\u2014 so that both of Miss Rogers\u2019 answers indicated only her inability to return the death penalty in \u201cthis\u201d case.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">This court has held, in an opinion written by the author of the majority opinion in the instant case, that it is not sufficient grounds for exclusion under <em>Witherspoon </em>for a juror to indicate an inability to return the death penalty \u201cin this case.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Risenhoover, </em>70 Cal.2d 39, 55 [73 Cal.Rptr. 533, 447 P.2d 925].) Such an attitude does not necessarily preclude the juror \u201cfrom concurring in such a verdict in all cases or in this case irrespective of the evidence that might be introduced at the trial,\u201d and thus it is \u201cnot . . . \u2018unmistakably clear\u2019 that [such a juror] \u2018would <em>automatically </em>vote against the imposition of capital punishment without regard to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>evidence that might be developed at the trial. . . .\u2019 <em>(Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>391 U.S. 510, 522, fn. 22 [20 L.Ed.2d 776, 785].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Risenhoover, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 39, 55.)</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">It should be noted that at the time Miss Rogers stated she would not impose the death penalty in \u201cthis\u201d case, she knew only that the case before her involved a robbery and a killing during the commission of the robbery; she had not been informed that at the penalty trial evidence would be introduced as to prior armed robberies allegedly committed by the defendants. Since the introduction at trial of defendant\u2019s \u201cpriors\u201d is an extremely important factor in a jury\u2019s decision to impose the death penalty <em>(A Study of the California Penalty Jury in First-Degree-Murder Case </em>(1969) 21 Stan.L.Rev. 1297, 1326-1327), it cannot even be said that Miss Rogers\u2019 responses indicate that she would not impose the death penalty in the particular case before her \u201cirrespective of the evidence that might be introduced at the trial.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>In summary, Miss Rogers stated to the defense attorney that whether she could impose the death penalty in \u201cthe proper case\u201d \u201cdepends on the degree\u201d and on \u201call the facts\u201d and stated to both the defense attorney and the prosecutor that she did not know whether she would vote for the death penalty in the hypothetical situation. Her subsequent statements that she would not be willing to vote for the death penalty in \u201cthis\u201d case after being informed that the case before her involved a robbery-murder clearly cannot be construed as a repudiation of her earlier expressions of ability to consider the death penalty in certain circumstances. In view of her expressed ability to consider the death penalty in certain circumstances, she did not\u2014as the majority contend\u2014make it \u201cunmistakably clear that under no circumstances would she impose the death penalty, . . .\u201d Like Mr. Willis, Miss Rogers \u201cclearly left open the possibility that in some case [she] might impose the death penalty\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vaughn, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 406, 416), and thus she was improperly excluded under <em>Witherspoon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">The majority suggest an alternative ground for upholding the exclusion of Miss Rogers: \u201cAlthough the instant trial preceded the decision in <em>Wither-spoon, </em>the standards which the trial court imposed comported fully with those announced in <em>Witherspoon. </em>Therefore, we could base our decision as to Miss Rogers upon the rule that \u2018Where a prospective juror gives conflicting answers to questions relevant to his impartiality, the trial court\u2019s determination as to his state of mind is binding upon an appellate court. [Citations.]\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Linden, </em>52 Cal.2d 1, 22 [338 P.2d 397].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">First, whether the standards imposed by the trial court \u201ccomported fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>with those announced in <em>Witherspoon\u201d </em>is the very point at issue, and for the reasons set forth at length above, I disagree with the majority on this point. It might be noted in this regard that, since the instant trial took place prior to the <em>Witherspoon </em>decision\u2014when the state of the statutory and case law was materially different from the constitutional standard enunciated in <em>Witherspoon </em>and it was proper to excuse for cause prospective jurors who cannot be excluded under <em>Witherspoon (In re Anderson, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 613, 618-619)\u2014it would be entirely fortuitous for the judge to have applied standards which were in accordance with <em>Witherspoon. (People </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>71 Cal.2d 614, 629 [79 Cal.Rptr. 65, 456 P.2d 633].)</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Moreover, it is doubtful that the rule quoted from <em>Linden, </em>if applied in the scrupled-juror situation, could ever \u201ccomport fully\u201d with the <em>Wither-spoon </em>holding that it must be \u201cunmistakably clear\u201d the excluded juror would automatically vote against the imposition of the death penalty. If the juror gives \u201cconflicting answers\u201d to the question as to whether he could ever impose the death penalty and the conflict is not subsequently resolved on <em>voir dire, </em>it simply cannot be said that his automatic opposition to the death penalty is \u201cunmistakably clear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">For the above reasons, it is my opinion Miss Rogers also was improperly excluded in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Each of the erroneous exclusions\u2014that of Mr. Willis and that of Miss Rogers\u2014independently requires reversal of the penalty trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Aranda-Bruton Error</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\"><em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 123 [20 L.Ed.2d 476, 88 S.Ct. 1620], held that a defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination is violated when he is inculpated by the introduction of an extrajudicial statement of a jointly tried codefendant in spite of an instruction that the jury consider the statement only against the codefendant. As the majority concede, <em>Bruton </em>must apply to statements introduced by a codefendant at the penalty phase of a capital trial. The majority also concede that <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda, </em>63 Cal.2d 518 [47 Cal.Rptr. 353, 407 P.2d 265], applies to statements introduced by a codefendant\" at a penalty trial, so that a trial judge faced with the likelihood that such a statement will be introduced must either grant a motion for separate penalty trials or see to it that all references to the nondeclarant defendant are \u201ceffectively deleted without prejudice to the declarant.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p, 530.)</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">When Dr. Tweed took the stand, Floyd\u2019s counsel asked him to repeat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>Floyd\u2019s version of the crime. Dr. Tweed\u2019s response mentioned the gun and Floyd\u2019s admission that he shot the bus driver. Floyd\u2019s counsel then initiated the following dialogue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-4\">\u201cQ Did he say where he had gotten the gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-5\">\u201cA Yes, he said he had gotten the gun from some friend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-6\">\u201cQ Did he say where he was taking it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-7\">\u201cA He stated he was taking it to a relative of this friend from whom he had gotten the gun.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">The jury was already aware from prior evidence that the gun was found in the home of Milton\u2019s half-brother, and the necessary implication of Dr. Tweed\u2019s testimony is that Milton had supplied Floyd with the murder weapon. The majority concede that Milton\u2019s <em>Aranda </em>rights were violated by the introduction of the portion of Dr. Tweed\u2019s testimony quoted above, and that \u201cthe jury conceivably could have inferred that Milton was the \u2018friend\u2019 who, according to Floyd, gave Floyd the gun, . . .\u201d Nonetheless, the majority deem this error nonreversible because Milton\u2019s counsel failed to object to the offending questions and because the majority conclude any error was insubstantial <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>61 Cal.2d 164, 168-170 [37 Cal.Rptr. 622, 390 P.2d 398]) and harmless beyond reasonable doubt. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065].)</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">Milton\u2019s counsel did not object to the questions of Dr. Tweed as to where Floyd obtained the gun or where he was taking it. Counsel did not move to strike the answers, but at the next recess out of the presence of the jury, he moved for a mistrial. The court denied the request, but ultimately instructed the jury \u201cthat the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony during this penalty trial \u2018which disclosed defendant\u2019s statements should be considered only for the purpose of exposing the information upon which the psychiatrist based his opinion and not as evidence of the truth of the statements.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">The record shows that Milton\u2019s counsel did all that can reasonably be required to prevent this error and that under the settled principles relating to errors committed in the penalty trial, the error was reversible.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">Immediately prior to the penalty trial, Milton\u2019s counsel raised the possibility that Dr. Tweed would testify as to a confession by Floyd which inculpated Milton. After extended discussion and seme research, the trial judge denied Milton\u2019s request for a separate penalty trial while instructing Floyd\u2019s counsel to see to it that Dr. Tweed would not refer to Milton, and directing the prosecutor to avoid any such reference in cross-examination. When Milton\u2019s counsel suggested that it would be impossible effectively to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>delete such references, the trial judge indicated that he would \u201cmeet this issue clearcut at the time I am confronted with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The failure to object to the specific questions asked of Dr. Tweed may not be held to constitute a waiver of the <em>Aranda </em>error. The court had expressly and without equivocation directed Floyd\u2019s counsel to admonish Dr. Tweed to delete all references to Milton. Thus, when Floyd\u2019s counsel asked the doctor did Floyd \u201csay where he had gotten the gun?\u201d Milton\u2019s counsel could reasonably have assumed that the court\u2019s instruction would be obeyed and that the response would not refer to Milton. In fact, such an assumption would have been correct; Dr. Tweed replied simply that Floyd received the gun from \u201csome friend.\u201d Similarly, when Dr. Tweed was asked whether Floyd said \u201cwhere he was taking\u201d the gun, Milton\u2019s counsel could again reasonably have assumed that the court\u2019s instruction would be obeyed and that the response would not refer to Milton. For example, counsel could have assumed that Dr. Tweed, who was not purporting to quote Floyd, would have answered that Floyd was taking the gun to another friend. Hence, prior to Dr. Tweed\u2019s second response, Milton\u2019s counsel was fully justified in relying upon the court\u2019s instruction and in foregoing the tactical risks of objecting. In fact, however, Dr. Tweed\u2019s second response\u2014that Floyd \u201cwas taking [the gun] to a relative of this friend from whom he had gotten the gun\u201d\u2014connected this dialogue with Milton because the jury already knew the gun was found in the home of Milton\u2019s half-brother. Even though pretrial discussion left open the possibility that the court would have to resolve problems posed by unavoidable references to Milton when they arose, there is nothing in the record suggesting that this reference to Milton was unavoidable. Hence Milton\u2019s counsel cannot be expected to have anticipated the reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">To hold, as the majority do, that failure to object should preclude Milton from raising the <em>Aranda </em>error would mean that Milton\u2019s counsel, in order to protect his client\u2019s rights, would have had to object to every question of Dr. Tweed where there was any possibility of reference to Milton. In view of the court\u2019s order to delete all reference to Milton, it is manifestly unfair to place such a burden upon Milton\u2019s counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Such a requirement would be purely formalistic and serve no useful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>The majority do not claim that the failure to move to strike Dr. Tweed\u2019s testimony constituted a waiver by Milton of his right to confrontation, and it would be improper to so hold. A motion to strike the answers was not necessary to alert the trial judge and other counsel to Milton\u2019s right to have all references to him excluded or to his assertion of that right. He had previously asserted the right and the judge had seemingly vindicated it by his order directing deletion of all such references. More importantly, the granting of a motion to strike or a limiting instruction, as recognized by <em>Aranda </em>and <em>Bruton, </em>would not have eliminated the harmful results of the error, and therefore the requirement of a motion to strike is not applicable. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Varnum, </em>70 Cal.2d 480, 488 [75 Cal.Rptr. 161, 450 P.2d 553].)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Critical to both <em>Aranda </em>and <em>Bruton </em>is the recognition that \u201cthe erroneous admission into evidence of a confession implicating both defendants is not necessarily cured by an instruction that it is to be considered only against the declarant.\u201d <em>(Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>391 U.S. at p. 133, fn. 9 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 483], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 526.) It was precisely because of the inherent inefficacy of such an instruction when the jury has already heard a confession implicating a nondeclarant defendant that <em>Aranda </em>established the alternatives of separate trials or effective deletions of all references to the nondeclarant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aranda, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at pp. 528-531.) And, \u201c[b]y effective deletions, we mean not only direct and indirect identifications of codefendants but any statements that could be employed against nondeclarant codefendants once their identity is otherwise established.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 530; footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Here the deletions were ineffective. The evidence that the murder weapon was found in the home of Milton\u2019s half-brother was an important part of the prosecution\u2019s case at the guilt trial and undoubtedly made an indelible impression upon the jury. When coupled with this evidence, Dr. Tweed\u2019s repetition of Floyd\u2019s statement clearly implied Milton had supplied the gun to Floyd. As soon as the questions were asked, Milton\u2019s counsel was put in the very dilemma <em>Aranda </em>sought to prevent. An objection or motion to strike would only have served to crystallize the damaging implications of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>Dr. Tweed\u2019s testimony, and a limiting instruction might also have done more harm than good. In my view, it is absurd to condition the raising of an error upon an objection when the whole theory of the violated rule is premised upon the inefficacy of objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The majority\u2019s application of harmless error rules is as unsatisfactory as their invocation of the requirement of objection. The majority seek to depress the prejudicial effect of Dr. Tweed\u2019s implication that Milton gave Floyd the murder weapon by pointing to Milton\u2019s prior armed robberies, two of which were committed with Floyd. Although nothing has altered our ignorance as to just what factors prompt a particular jury to return a death verdict in any given case, we now have empirical evidence that certain factors <em>generally </em>have a significant impact on the penalty verdicts of California juries. <em>(A Study of the California Penalty Jury in First-Degree-Murder Cases, supra, </em>21 Stan.L.Rev. 1297, 1420.) This study supports the majority\u2019s implication that the introduction of a defendant\u2019s criminal record significantly increases the likelihood that a death verdict will be returned against him. <em>{Id., </em>at pp. 1326-1330.) On the other hand, the circumstance that a defendant did not personally kill a victim strongly reduces the likelihood that a death penalty will be returned; in fact, only 4 of the 52 defendants included within the study\u2019s sample of 238 penalty trials who did not personally commit an act of homicide were condemned to death by a penalty jury. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1348-1349.) More important for the case before us, the study found a significant relationship between a defendant\u2019s status as a \u201cnon-triggerman\u201d and life sentence verdicts <em>'after eliminating the effects of other factors\u2014including the introduction of prior offenses. </em>(Compare <em>id., </em>at pp. 1348-1349 with <em>id., </em>at pp. 1316-1326.) In other words, the fact that a defendant is a \u201cnon-triggerman\u201d <em>by itself </em>significantly increases his chance of obtaining a life verdict, even assuming that'his \u201cpriors\u201d are introduced at the penalty trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">In sum, Dr. Tweed\u2019s testimony furnished the sole basis for an inference that Milton supplied Floyd with the murder weapon. Since it is impossible for us to know whether this inference affected the decision of the particular jury which condemned Milton to die, and since this inference tends to negate Milton\u2019s status as \u201cnon-triggerman\u201d\u2014a status which generally weighs heavily in favor of a life sentence regardless of a prior record\u2014this court is in no position to declare that the conceded <em>Aranda </em>error did not contribute to Milton\u2019s death verdict. If Floyd\u2019s admissions were believed, it is not at all unlikely that any tendency of the jury to distinguish for purposes of punishment between Floyd and Milton was neutralized by the showing that Milton was at least equally involved in the use of the gun in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Although the majority concede <em>Aranda </em>error, their discussion of <em>Bruton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>leaves me uncertain whether they have concluded that there was harmless error or that there was no <em>Bruton </em>error. In my view there was such error, and it was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">In concluding that any <em>Bruton </em>error was not prejudicial, the majority deny that Dr. Tweed\u2019s testimony created a substantial risk that the jury would ignore the court\u2019s instruction. In so doing the majority have intertwined the incidents of <em>Bruton </em>error with rules designed to determine whether a conceded error is reversible because prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">I think a fair reading of the <em>Bruton </em>language cited by the majority<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> indicates <em>Bruton </em>was concerned not with the question of harmless error, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>but rather with defining a <em>context </em>in which a limiting instruction cannot cure error. The court\u2019s conclusion was that because extrajudicial statements of a codefendant which inculpate a nondeclarant defendant are inherently \u201cpowerfully incriminating,\u201d the introduction of such statements when the declarant does not take the stand presents a context \u201cin which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is . . . great,\u201d and that therefore \u201cin the context of a joint trial we cannot accept limiting instructions as an adequate substitute for petitioner\u2019s constitutional right of cross-examination.\u201d <em>(Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>391 U.S. at pp. 135-137 [20 L.Ed.2d at pp. 484-485].)</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Thus <em>Bruton </em>deems erroneous the mere context presented by the introduction of a statement by a codefendant who does not testify when that statement inculpates a jointly tried nondeclarant defendant. The court\u2019s discussion of the incriminating nature of such statements and of the risk that a jury will ignore a limiting instruction explains the rule, but does not establish factual prerequisites to a finding that the rule has been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Even if findings of incrimination and of risk are prerequisite to establishing <em>Bruton </em>error, however, it is perfectly clear that these findings do not determine the question whether an error\u2014like the one here\u2014is reversible. <em>Bruton </em>acknowledged \u201cthe impossibility of determining whether in fact the jury did or did not ignore\u201d a limiting instruction. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 136 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 485].) Thus, once both incrimination and risk are established, it must be assumed the jury did not follow the instruction: \u201cThe effect is the same as if there had been no instruction at all.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 137 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 485].)</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Here, incrimination is established by Dr. Tweed\u2019s testimony, which furnished the sole basis for the inference that Milton supplied the murder weapon. The risk that the jury improperly used that testimony against Milton is even greater than in <em>Bruton. </em>In <em>Bruton, </em>the jury was clearly instructed not to consider the codefendant\u2019s confession as evidence against the non declarant. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 125, fn. 2, 137 [20 L.Ed.2d at pp. 479, 485].) Here the jury was never given a clear and unambiguous instruction that it could not use Dr. Tweed\u2019s testimony concerning Floyd\u2019s statements against Milton. Instead, the jury was told it could consider those statements \u201c \u2018only for the purpose of exposing the information upon which [Dr. Tweed] based his opinion and not as evidence of the truth of the statements.\u2019 \u201d The jury might have adhered to the literal meaning of this instruction by considering the evidence that the gun was found in the apartment of Milton\u2019s half-brother as proof of \u201cthe truth of the statements\u201d which were exposed by Dr. Tweed\u2014and by considering the resulting inference that Milton supplied the murder weapon as evidence in aggravation of the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>Hence the fact of <em>Bruton </em>error as to Milton seems clear. But the critical question remains whether that error was reversible. (E.g., <em>In re Hill, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 997, 1013-1015.) It cannot be disputed that <em>Bruton was a </em>constitutional decision, or that a conviction must not be sustained in the face of constitutional error unless an appellate court can declare that it is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. at p. 24 [17 L.Ed.2d at p. 710].)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">The California harmless error rule for all penalty trial errors is stated by <em>People </em>v. <em>Hines, supra, </em>61 Cal.2d 164. In that case, we examined the unique aspects of penalty trials which render inapposite the \u201creasonably probable\u201d harmless error rule which is applicable to guilt errors. Because of the absolute discretion afforded a jury presented with \u201ca mass of material,\u201d because \u201c[t]he precise point which prompts the penalty in the mind of any one juror is not known to us and may not even be known to him,\u201d and because \u201c \u2018[t]o attempt to assess the effect of error in this legal vacuum is to superimpose one untestable surmise upon another,\u2019 \u201d we reaffirmed the rule that \u201c \u2018any substantial error occurring during the penalty phase of the trial, that results in the death penalty, since it reasonably may have swayed a juror, must be deemed to have been prejudicial.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 168-170, and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">My view of the relationship between the <em>Hines </em>and <em>Chapman </em>tests in the context of a penalty trial constitutional error is that they are perfectly consistent: it is impossible to declare beyond reasonable doubt that any substantial error did not contribute to a death verdict. In any case, we are bound by the supremacy clause to apply the <em>Chapman </em>test here, and to reverse the penalty verdict unless we can say beyond a reasonable doubt that the implications of Dr. Tweed\u2019s testimony did not contribute to Milton\u2019s death verdict. I submit such a declaration would fly in the face of reality\u2014especially in view of the factors discussed at length in <em>Hines. </em>Accordingly, I would reverse Milton\u2019s penalty verdict because of prejudicial <em>Bruton </em>error in the penalty trial below.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">It is clear the prosecutor argued that the jury should impose the death penalty to exact retribution. The majority note that we have never addressed the question of the propriety of such argument in a penalty trial, that we have held \u201cin other contexts\u201d that vengeance or retribution has no place in \u201c \u2018the scheme\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Estrada, </em>63 Cal.2d 740, 745 [48 Cal.Rptr. 172, 408 P.2d 948]), that we have expressed doubts as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>propriety of introducing a photograph displaying a murder victim\u2019s pain because \u201cretribution is no longer considered the <em>primary </em>objective of the criminal law\u201d which \u201cfocuses on the criminal, not <em>merely </em>on the crime\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Love, </em>53 Cal.2d 843, 856-857, fn. 3 [3 Cal.Rptr. 665, 350 P.2d 705]; italics added), and that the prosecutor argued other factors besides retribution in appellants\u2019 penalty trial. From this the majority conclude: \u201cIn these circumstances, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks concerning the widow of the slain bus driver did not constitute misconduct. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Garner, </em>57 Cal.2d 135, 156 [18 Cal.Rptr. 40, 367 P.2d 680]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Love, </em>56 Cal.2d 720, 731 [16 Cal.Rptr. <em>777, </em>17 Cal.Rptr. 481, 366 P.2d 33, 809].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">I believe the prosecutor\u2019s retribution argument was clearly misconduct. <em>In re Estrada, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 740, culminated in California a trend reflected in the opinions of a variety of state and federal courts which have indicated a growing disapproval of retribution as a penal objective. (E.g., <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1949) 337 U.S. 241, 248 [93 L.Ed. 1337, 1342, 69 S.Ct. 1079]; <em>Ronan </em>v. <em>Stevens </em>(1963) 93 Ariz. 375 [381 P.2d 100, 102-103]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Love, supra, </em>53 Cal.2d 843, 856-857, fn. 3; <em>Tuel v. Gladden </em>(1963) 234 Ore. 1: [379 P.2d 553, 554-556].)</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Perhaps this trend was most eloquently described closer to its inception: \u201cHistorically, it may be said that the origin of all legal punishments had its root in the natural impulse of revenge. At first this instinct was gratified by retaliatory measures on the part of the individual who suffered by the crime committed, or, in the case of murder, by his relatives. Later, the state took away the right of retaliation from individuals, and its own assumption of the function of revenge really constituted the beginning of criminal law. The entire course, however, of the refinement and humanizing of society has been in the direction of dispelling from penology any such theory.\u201d <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ritter </em>(Phila. Co. 1930) 13 Pa.D. &amp; C. 285, 290.)</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\"><em>Estrada </em>altered the previous California position that penalty-ameliorating amendments apply only to crimes committed after the effective date of the amendment. In holding that such amendments apply to all cases not yet final, we stated: \u201cThis intent seems obvious, because to hold otherwise would be to conclude that the Legislature was motivated by a desire for vengeance, a conclusion not permitted in view of modern theories of penology.\u201d <em>(In re Estrada, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 745.)</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\"><em>Estrada </em>continued by quoting with approval <em>People </em>v. <em>Oliver </em>(1956) 1 N.Y.2d 152, [151 N.Y.S.2d 367, 134 N.E.2d 197, 201-202], a case which reached a similar result on the same theory: \u201cThis application of statutes reducing punishment accords with the best modern theories <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>concerning the functions of punishment in criminal law. According to these theories, the punishment or treatment of criminal offenders is directed toward one or more' of three ends: (1) to discourage and act as a deterrent upon future criminal activity, (2) to confine the offender so that he may not harm society and (3) to correct and rehabilitate the offender. There is no place in the scheme for punishment for its own sake, the product simply of vengeance or retribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Although <em>Estrada </em>arose in \u201cother contexts\u201d than review of a death penalty trial, it is clear that \u201cthe scheme\u201d with which <em>Estrada </em>was concerned was the whole of criminal law and penology. And the \u201ccontext\u201d was riot that far removed from a' death penalty case: <em>Estrada </em>expressly overruled <em>People </em>v. <em>Harmon, </em>54 Cal.2d 9 [4 Cal.Rptr. 161, 351 P.2d 329]. <em>(In re Estrada, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 742.) Harmon was convicted of nonfatal assault by a life prisoner at a time when such a conviction carried a mandatory death penalty. We rejected Harmon\u2019s suggestion that we follow the rule of <em>People </em>v. <em>Oliver, supra, </em>to apply an amendment which was enacted prior to his appeal and which provided a discretionary death penalty for such an assault. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harmon, supra, </em>54 Cal.2d at pp. 20-27.) Harmon was executed on August 9, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">None of the cases cited by the majority indicate any regression from <em>Estrada\u2019s </em>recognition that retribution has no legitimate place in the criminal law. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Love, supra, </em>53 Cal.2d 843, the appellant challenged the admission into evidence of a tape recording and photograph of a murder victim prior to and at death, respectively. Finding this evidence tended to prove only that the victim died in unusual pain, we held its introduction prejudicially erroneous when compounded by the prosecutor\u2019s argument to the same effect. We noted in passing that proof of unintentionally inflicted pain is of \u201cquestionable importance to the selection of penalty\u201d because relevant only to retribution, and because \u201cretribution is no longer considered the primary objective of the criminal law . . . and is thought by many not even to be a proper consideration . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 856-857, &amp; fn. 3, citations omitted.) <em>Love </em>was a part of the trend which <em>Estrada </em>culminated; it foreshadowed <em>Estrada\u2019s </em>recognition that retribution has no place in modern penology. For this court to cite <em>Love </em>to limit <em>Estrada </em>would be. to announce an egregious retreat from the \u201cevolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\u201d <em>(Trop </em>v. <em>Dulles </em>(1958) 356 U.S. 86, 101 [2 L.Ed.2d 630, 642, 78 S.Ct. 590].)</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Moreover, the rationale of <em>People </em>v. <em>Love, supra, </em>fully supports the conclusion that retributive argument at a penalty trial is misconduct. With regard to the challenged eviderice, and in view of other evidence of the victim\u2019s pain, we reasoned that \u201ceven if relevant and material, . . . the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>photograph and the tape recording served primarily to inflame the passions of the jurors and both should have been excluded.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Love, supra, </em>53 Cal.2d at pp. 856-857.) Denying that the wide scope of the penalty trial justifies the admission of such evidence, we explained: \u201cAllegedly inflammatory evidence is admissible only when its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect. . . . Since the jury has complete discretion to choose between the alternative penalties <em>in the light of the objectives of criminal law . . </em>. the permissible range of inquiry on the issue of penalty is necessarily broad. . . . The determination of penalty, however, like the determination of guilt, must be a rational decision. Evidence that serves primarily to inflame the passions of the jurors must therefore be excluded, and to insure that it is, the probative value and the inflammatory effect of proffered evidence must be carefully weighed.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 856; citations omitted, italics added.) Since the jury\u2019s task is to choose the appropriate penalty \u201cin the light of the objectives of criminal law,\u201d and since <em>Estrada </em>flatly denies that retribution is such an objective, it follows that evidence and argument relevant only to retribution is erroneous and should be excluded from penalty trials. Furthermore, such argument inherently \u201cserves primarily to inflame the passions of the jurors,\u201d and for that reason alone must be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">To whatever extent retributive argument might amount to a dispassionate appeal for execution as a means of preventing extralegal vengeance or of maintaining community respect for the administration of' justice,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> another of the authorities relied upon by the majority provides ample reasons for the exclusion of such argument. <em>People </em>v. <em>Love, supra, </em>56 Cal.2d 720, held that evidence and argument as to the deterrent effect of capital punishment are improper because argument must be based on properly admitted evidence or matters of common knowledge, because there is \u201cno legislative finding, and it is not a matter of common knowledge, that capital punishment is or is not a more effective deterrent than imprisonment,\u201d because argument may not be calculated to mislead the jury or appeal primarily to passion, and, inferentially, because \u201c[j]uries in capital cases cannot become legislatures <em>ad hoc, </em>and trials on the issue of penalty cannot be converted into legislative hearings.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 729-732, 726.) I submit that all of these reasons apply as forcefully to retribution as to deterrence. <em>Estrada </em>held that concluding that the Legislature was motivated by vengeance would be impermissible \u201cin view of modern theories of penology.\u201d <em>(In re Estrada, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 745.) Whether or not the imposition of capital punishment serves to prevent extralegal vengeance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>or to maintain community respect for the administration of criminal justice are certainly not matters of common knowledge. To the extent that retributive argument urges these propositions, a fair resolution of the factual propriety of such propositions in any given penalty trial would require presentation of such a wide range of evidence and argument that penalty trials might indeed resemble legislative hearings. To every other extent, retributive argument appeals solely to passion.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Hence I believe it settled that retribution has no place in the criminal law of in proceedings to determine penalty. I think it indisputable that this court would not even consider qualifying these principles but for the existence of capital punishment, and the existence of capital punishment is obviously not a judicially cognizable reason for doing so now. I am not sure that the majority do intend to retreat from <em>Estrada, </em>but because they have cited language which <em>might be so </em>viewed, I find it necessary to express my views.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Love, supra, </em>56 Cal.2d at p. 731, discussed the prosecutor\u2019s erroneous deterrence argument in the context of prior cases. Although the language cited by the majority might be taken to approve argument \u201cthat it is necessary swiftly and severely to punish the guilty,\u201d this hardly amounts to\" approval of retributive argument\u2014because swift and severe punishment may be suggested by legitimate penal objectives. It follows that the implied necessity of showing that a \u201cprosecutor went beyond merely urging severe punishment\u201d does not support a conclusion that merely urging retributive punishment is nonprejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">The majority\u2019s remaining authority is <em>People </em>v. <em>Garner, supra, </em>57 Cal.2d 135, 156, which held that concededly erroneous argument concerning deterrence was nonprejudicial because \u201conly a minor part of [the prosecutor\u2019s] appeal to the jury . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Although the prosecutor\u2019s references to retribution were few quantitatively, I believe the context of those references rendered them a substantial portion of his appeal for execution. Apart from several sentences commending the jurors for their conscientiousness, thanking them for their attention, and expressing confidence that their verdict would be just, the prosecutor\u2019s references to retribution constituted the conclusion of his entire argument.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although his tone of voice is impossible to glean from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>the record, his language obviously reflects an appeal to the passions of the jurors. He argued that although \u201cour society is becoming more and more permissive. ... I don\u2019t think we have reached the point yet where equal punishment for our crimes can only take place in the second life and not in this life,\u201d that \u201c[tjhese defendants snuffed the life of a precious human being,\u201d that \u201c[w]e are not only talking about avenging Mr. Hartzel\u2019s death, but Mrs. Hartzel,\u201d and that the defendants should not be permitted to live in prison when \u201cMr. Hartzel would never eat another meal, never see his wife again, never listen to music again, never see another sunrise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">As noted above, the appropriate test of harmless error in a penalty trial examines whether the error was substantial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because the prosecutor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>references to retribution amounted to a passionate concluding appeal for death sentences, I do not see how they can be deemed insubstantial and therefore harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">In sum, I would reverse both penalties because of <em>Witherspoon </em>error. I believe the improper admission of Floyd\u2019s statement through Dr. Tweed independently calls for a reversal of Milton\u2019s death verdict. Finally, I disagree with the majority\u2019s treatment of the misconduct contention to the extent that it implies either that retributive argument is proper or that the erroneous argument in this case was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Traynor, C. J., and Tobriner, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Appellants\u2019 petitions for a rehearing were denied February 25, 1970.

Yet, in a nation less than half of .whose people believe in the death penalty, a jury composed exclusively of such people cannot speak for the community. Culled of all who harbor doubts about the wisdom of capital punishment\u2014of all who would be reluctant to pronounce the extreme penalty\u2014such a jury can speak only for a distinct and dwindling minority.\u201d (391 U.S. at pp. 519-520 [20 L.Ed.2d at pp. 783-784]; footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">An approach which would require the exclusion of prospective jurors based on their views as to the particular case would provide in effect that the less heinous the defendant\u2019s crime or the more exemplary his conduct prior to the crime, the greater the likelihood of securing a death-oriented jury. Under such an approach, the more favorable the circumstances for imposing life imprisonment in a given case, the more prospective jurors would state that they could not return the death penalty in that case, the less would the resulting jury \u201cexpress the conscience of the community,\u201d and the more \u201cdistinct and dwindling\u201d the minority represented by the jury would become. And if a particular case involved such extremely mitigating circumstances that the overwhelming majority of citizens or prospective jurors would not consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>the death penalty after hearing all the relevant factors, the resulting jury would be even <em>more </em>of a \u201changing jury\" than that which <em>Witherspoon </em>proscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Suppose, for example, that the prospective jurors in the instant case were informed not only that the case involved a murder committed in the course of a robbery, but also that one of the defendants\u2014Milton\u2014was not the triggerman. The fact that a defendant did not himself pull the trigger, but is being prosecuted for first degree murder as an accomplice or under the felony-murder doctrine, is extremely mitigating \u2014such a defendant was very rarely given the death penalty by even the <em>pre-Witherspoon </em>\u201changing juries\" from which prospective jurors with general conscientious scruples were excluded for cause. (Compare, <em>In re Anderson, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 613, 618-619, with <em>A Study of the California Penalty Jury in First-Degree-Murder Cases, supra, </em>21 Stan.L.Rev. 1297, 1348-1349.) Thus many \u201changing jurors\u201d that do not generally object to capital punishment apparently do object to its application to nontriggermen. If prospective jurors could be excluded for cause because the cases before them involve such nontriggermen and they state that they would never impose the death penalty against such defendants, the resulting juries would be culled not only of \u201call who harbor doubts about the wisdom of capital punishment\u201d generally, but <em>also </em>of those who, though generally in favor of capital punishment, are opposed to its application in the vicarious liability situation. The resulting jury would be even <em>less </em>representative of the \u201cconscience of the community\u201d than the \u201changing jury\" that was proper under California law prior to <em>Witherspoon </em>and which <em>Witherspoon </em>attempted to preclude.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b835-7\">I find untenable the majority\u2019s suggestion that Milton\u2019s counsel should have objected on the ground that the questions relating to where Floyd obtained the gun and where he was taking it were irrelevant. Dr. Tweed was called to testify as to Floyd\u2019s susceptibility to rehabilitation. Dr. Tweed testified that the killing was neither premeditated nor deliberate, but was instead \u201csort of automatic.\u201d Dr. Tweed\u2019s account of the story he heard from Floyd implied that Floyd\u2019s possession of the gun was temporary. Such testimony is clearly relevant for purposes of disclosing the basis of Dr. Tweed\u2019s expert opinion, and the fact that Floyd told Dr. Tweed where he got. and where he was taking the gun would tend to support Dr. Tweed\u2019s conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Floyd was telling him the truth. Thus, had Milton\u2019s counsel objected that the questions were irrelevant, the objection would probably have been overruled. Moreover, all of Dr. Tweed\u2019s testimony should have been irrelevant to Milton, as the trial judge had ordered. Absent a question calling unavoidably for reference to Milton, Milton\u2019s counsel was justified in relying upon the judge\u2019s order, and in leaving tactical decisions regarding relevancy to Floyd\u2019s counsel\u2014who had called Dr. Tweed solely for his own client\u2019s case. Finally, since Milton\u2019s counsel cannot be deemed to have waived the <em>Aranda </em>claim by failing to object at all, a fortiori no waiver can follow from his failure to object on non <em>-Aranda </em>grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The majority\u2019s citation is to the first of the following two concluding paragraphs of <em>Bruton: </em>\u201cFinally, the reason advanced by the majority in <em>Delli Paoli </em>was to tie the result to maintenance of the jury system. \u2018Unless we proceed on the basis that the jury will follow the court\u2019s instructions where those instructions are clear and the circumstances are such that the jury can reasonably be expected to follow them, the jury system makes little sense.\u2019 352 U.S. at 242 [1 L.Ed.2d at 285]. We agree that there are many circumstances in which this reliance is justified. Not every admission of inadmissible hearsay or other evidence can be considered to be reversible error unavoidable through limiting instructions; instances occur in almost every trial where inadmissible evidence creeps in, usually inadvertently. \u2018A defendant is entitled to a fair trial but not a perfect one.\u2019 ... It is not unreasonable to conclude that in many such cases the jury can and will follow the trial judge\u2019s instructions to disregard such information. Nevertheless, as was recognized in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Denno, supra, there are some contexts in which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, that the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored. . . . Such a context is presented here, where the powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant, who stands accused side-by-side with the defendant, are deliberately spread before the jury in a joint trial. </em>Not only are the incriminations devastating to the defendant but their credibility is inevitably suspect, a fact recognized when accomplices do take the stand and the jury is instructed to weigh their testimony carefully given the recognized motivation to shift blame onto others. <em>The unreliability of such evidence is intolerably compounded when the alleged accomplice, as here, does not testify and cannot be tested by cross-examination. It was against such threats to a fair trial that the Confrontation Clause was directed. Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">\u201cWe, of course, acknowledge the impossibility of determining whether in fact the jury did or did not ignore Evans\u2019 statement inculpating petitioner in determining petitioner\u2019s guilt. But that was also true in the analogous situation in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>and was not regarded as militating against striking down the New York procedure there involved. It was enough that that procedure posed \u2018substantial threats to a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to have an involuntary confession entirely disregarded and to have the coercion issue fairly and reliably determined. These hazards we cannot ignore.\u2019 378 U.S. at 389 [12 L.Ed.2d at 922, 1 A.L.R.3d 1205]. Here the introduction of Evans\u2019 confession posed a substantial threat to petitioner\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him, and this is a hazard we cannot ignore. <em>Despite the concededly clear instructions to the jury to disregard Evans\u2019 inadmissible hearsay evidence inculpating petitioner, in the context of a joint trial we cannot accept limiting instructions as an adequate substitute for petitioner\u2019s constitutional right of cross-examination. The effect is the same as if there had been no instruction at all. . . . (Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>391 U.S. 123, 135-137 [20 L.Ed.2d 476, 484-485, 88 S.Ct. 1620]; italics added, footnotes omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b843-6\">It is noteworthy that we have held that in a penalty trial, \u201c[a] warning of probable consequences of failure to convict, and of the unfavorable reactions of neighbors is improper . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Purvis, </em>60 Cal.2d 323, 342 [33 Cal.Rptr. 104, 384 P.2d 424].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b844-8\">The whole of the prosecutor\u2019s conclusion was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">\u201cIs life imprisonment the proper penalty for these two defendants? I think it is common knowledge that our society is becoming more and more permissive. Whether for good or bad, certainly I don\u2019t know. I am not a sociologist and don\u2019t purport to be. But I don\u2019t think we have reached the point yet where equal punishment for our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>crimes can only take place in the second life and not in this life. I don\u2019t think they have gotten that permissive yet.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">\u201cSo I think you should ask yourselves this question. These defendants snuffed the life of a precious human being, or the precious life of a fellow human being, a 71-year-old bus driver. You recall Mrs. Hartzel testified, I believe, he had been a bus driver for 48 years. I think it is a fair inference he was probably a hard worker, probably was about to retire, spend the few remaining years of his life, the twilight of his life, enjoying a few warm, pleasant years with his family. These guys killed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">\u201cThe question is what would be equal punishment for that act. We are not only talking about avenging Mr. Hartzel\u2019s death, but Mrs. Hartzel. A great, great, an enormous loss. Sometimes it is too easy to forget about the victim and his loved ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">\u201cCounsel, by innuendo, have told you how- horrible it is\u2014they don\u2019t come out and say it, but the gas chamber and stuff like that. Well, there is another side of that coin. Maybe life imprisonment isn\u2019t that bad, either.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">\u201cI know they are fed. I imagine three meals a day. I imagine their living conditions are sanitary. I know, at least in the State Prisons in California, they have a' library. They have a movie. The inmates participate in sports. Oh, it is not a country club. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I am not saying that at all. It is not that bad, either.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">\u201cShould these defendants be permitted to live like that, we should say that Mr. Hartzel would never eat another meal, never see his wife again, never listen to music again, never see another sunrise. That is the problem you are going to have to deal with.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-12\">\u201cDo they deserve to be given a break? I don\u2019t know. Did they give Mr. Hartzel a break? Do they deserve to be given another chance? Did they give Mr. Hartzel a chance? Do they deserve any mercy? Did they show any mercy for Mr. Hartzel?</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">\u201cI would say that it is an easy way out for you folks, the easiest thing for you to do would be to go back in the jury room and come back with a verdict for life imprisonment. That would be very easy, but the question is, is it the right way? Is it the way of 12 responsible human beings?</p>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">\u201cYou all told me that you would have the courage in the proper case to come back with a verdict of death. Now, all the chips are on the line, and I say that if this is not a proper case for the death penalty, what would be a proper case? How aggravated does a killing have to be? If the death penalty is to mean anything in the State of California other than two empty words, this is a proper case.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-15\">\u201cIn any event, you are 12 reasonable men and women. I know you are very conscientious. All of you were taking notes throughout the entire trial, I am confident whatever verdict you reach will be a proper and a fair verdict under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-16\">\u201cI want to thank you very much for your attention throughout the entire trial.
