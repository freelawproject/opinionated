It was stipulated that the court might read the preliminary hearing transcript for the purpose of approving the plea and determining the degree. After reading the transcript the court approved the plea and stated that it determined the murder to be in the first degree. At the proceeding to determine the penalty a jury fixed the penalty at death. Motions for a new trial and for reduction of the sentence were denied, and defendant\u2019s automatic appeal is now before us (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1239, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Defendant contends that the court erred in denying his motion to allow him, over the prosecutor\u2019s objection, to waive a jury trial on the issue of penalty; that error was committed in selecting the jury; and that it was improper for the prosecutor to make certain remarks to the jury panel. We have concluded that none of the contentions can be upheld and that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">On the evening of August 13, 1966, defendant entered Al\u2019s Liquor Store in Bellflower to commit a robbery, while his companion, Kenneth Watson, waited in a car outside.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Two customers were in the store, and, after they left, defendant shot and killed the clerk, Dennis Sponseller, with a shotgun. The victim was unarmed. Evidence indicated that the muzzle of the shotgun was six to eight feet from the victim, when the gun was fired. The autopsy surgeon testified that death occurred within minutes and was caused by a shotgun wound, which perforated the heart.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">Defendant\u2019s fingerprints were found on the cash register, the drawer of which remained closed although several keys were depressed, and only a penny was found in the victim\u2019s pockets. The owner of the store testified that $160 was missing and that it was the practice of the store for the clerk to keep money in his pocket or a drawer for cashing checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">Defendant, testifying in his own behalf, admitted shooting the decedent during an attempt to perpetrate a robbery. He stated that at the time in question he was living with the Kenneth Watsons, that they were \u201cbroke,\u201d and that Watson suggested committing the robbery. He testified that he did not deliberately fire the gun, that it \u201cjust went off,\u201d and that he was scared and left without obtaining any money. He denied telling Mrs. Watson on the night of the murder that he shot the victim on seeing him reach under a counter thinking he was going for a gun or alarm button. In rebuttal Mrs. Watson stated that defendant had made such a statement that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>Defendant also testified that he had never previously been involved in a crime of violence. On cross-examination he admitted having been convicted of two prior felonies\u2014each of which related to \u201cbad checks.\u201d He stated that he was currently in a federal prison as a result of one of the convictions. Two officers at the prison, called as defense witnesses, testified that defendant had been cooperative and polite during the past six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">After entering his guilty plea, defendant indicated that he wished to waive a jury trial on the issue of penalty. The prosecutor refused to join in the waiver, and defendant moved that he nevertheless be permitted to waive a jury trial. The motion was denied, and defendant contends that the court thereby erred. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Article I, section 7, of the California Constitution provides: \u201cThe right of trial by jury shall be secured to all, and remain inviolate. ... A trial by jury may be waived in all criminal cases, by the consent of <em>both parties, </em>expressed in open court by the defendant and his counsel. ...\u201d (Italics added.)  This section does not guarantee the right to trial by jury to determine the issue of penalty, and under former practice a defendant did not have a right to a jury trial on that issue after a guilty plea. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hough, </em>26 Cal.2d 618, 620-621 [160 P.2d 549] [cert. dismd. 326 U.S. 691 [90 L.Ed. 407, 66 S.Ct. 232]].) However, Penal Code section 190.1, enacted in 1957, provides \u201cIf the defendant was convicted by a plea of guilty, the trier of fact shall be a jury unless a jury is waived,\u201d and by its terms the provision in the quoted constitutional section regarding the method of waiver is applicable in a proceeding to determine the penalty. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Washington, 7</em>1 Cal.2d 1061, 1086-1087 [80 Cal.Rptr. 567, 458 P.2d 479], wherein a jury found the defendant guilty of various crimes including murder and fixed his penalty at death, the defendant claimed on appeal that the rejection by the prosecution of his offer to waive a jury trial was a denial of his \u201cconstitutional right to waive a trial by jury,\u201d and this court, relying on our constitutional provision and authority such as <em>Singer </em>v. <em>United States, </em>380 U.S. 24 [13 L.Ed.2d 630, 85 S.Ct. 783], concluded that the claim lacked merit. (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>170 Cal.App.2d 145, 149 [338 P.2d 484] [cert. den. 361 U.S. 949 [4 L.Ed.2d 382, 80 S.Ct. 405]].)</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">In <em>Singer </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>380 U.S. 24, 36 [13 L.Ed.2d 630, 638, 85 S.Ct. 783], wherein the defendant challenged a federal rule that conditioned a defendant\u2019s waiver of a jury trial on consent of the court and the prosecutor, the court stated, \u201cA defendant\u2019s only constitutional right concerning the method of trial is to an impartial trial by jury. We find no constitutional impediment to conditioning a waiver of this right on the consent of the prosecuting attorney and the trial judge when, if either refuses to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>consent, the result is simply that the defendant is subject to an impartial trial by jury\u2014the very thing that the Constitution guarantees him.\u201d <em>Singer </em>also stated (at p. 37 [13 L.Ed.2d at p. 639]), \u201cWe need not determine in this case whether there might be some circumstances where a defendant\u2019s reasons for wanting to be tried by a judge alone are so compelling that the Government\u2019s insistence on trial by jury would result in the denial to a defendant of an impartial trial.\u201d Here no claim is made, nor does it appear, that such circumstances were present.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">In arguing that it was error not to accept his waiver of a jury at the penalty trial, defendant cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>52 Cal.2d 636 [343 P.2d 577], wherein it was recited that defense counsel and defendants waived a jury trial on the issue of penalty and that the trial court determined the penalty, and <em>Jones </em>stated that the procedure was correct. Although <em>Jones </em>did not recite that the prosecutor joined in the waiver, nothing therein shows that he did not do so, and the matter was not discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Eight veniremen were excused for cause on the basis of their attitude toward the death penalty. Defendant contends that under <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510 [20 L.Ed.2d 776, 88 S.Ct. 1770], it was error to excuse them.  Although <em>Witherspoon </em>was decided after defendant\u2019s trial, it is applicable herein. <em>(Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>391 U.S. 510, 523, fn. 22 [20 L.Ed.2d 776, 785, 88 S.Ct. 1770].)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\"><em>Witherspoon </em>holds that \u201ca sentence of death cannot be carried out if the jury that imposed or recommended it was chosen by excluding veniremen for cause simply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 522 [20 L.Ed.2d at pp. 784-785].) The court excepted from this ruling veniremen who \u201cmade unmistakably clear ... that they would <em>automatically </em>vote against the imposition of capital punishment without regard to any evidence that might be developed at the trial of the case before them. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 522, fn. 21 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 785].)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">In determining whether a venireman comes within this excepted group we must \u201cassess the responses of the venireman in the full context of that portion of the court and counsels\u2019 <em>voir dire </em>examination of the entire panel conducted during the time said venireman was present in the courtroom and until the time he or she was excused for cause. To ascertain what the juror meant by what he said, we must consider not merely the words of his answers but also the words of the questions he was asked and additionally all of the circumstances in which the colloquy took place.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Varnum, </em>70 Cal.2d 480, 492 [75 Cal.Rptr. 161, 450 P.2d 553].)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>Here the phrase \u201cin a proper case\u201d was repeatedly employed in questioning the veniremen concerning their attitude toward the death penalty, and that phrase, if considered by itself, is ambiguous. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. Nye, 71 Cal.2d 356, 365-366 [78 Cal.Rptr. 467, 455 P.2d 395]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Varnum, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 480, 494; <em>People </em>v. <em>Teale, </em>70 Cal.2d 497, 514-515 [75 Cal.Rptr. 172, 450 P.2d 564]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>70 Cal.2d 711, 741 [76 Cal.Rptr. 391, 452 P.2d 607].) As pointed out in <em>Teale </em>(at p. 515) \u201cin the absence of additional language which might explain its content or nullify its effect, the phrase might easily suggest to a venireman that the law classes certain kinds of cases as \u2018proper\u2019 for the infliction of the death penalty and that, if the defendant is found guilty of a crime of this class, the jury will be <em>required </em>to impose the death penalty.\u201d However, as we shall see, in the instant case as in <em>People </em>v. <em>Varnum, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d at pages 494-496, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Nye, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at pages 365-367, it was made clear to the veniremen that what was a proper case was within the determination of each individual-juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">On the first day of the jury selection proceedings before any venireman was excused for cause the court addressed the jury panel as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-6\">\u201cThe law provides that every person guilty of murder in the first degree shall suffer death or confinement in the State Prison for life. The determination of the penalty of life imprisonment or death shall be in the discretion of the jury, which is now to be selected. . . . <em>The law imposes neither death nor life imprisonment, but presents the two alternatives to the absolute discretion of the jury. The legislature has formulated no rules to control the exercise of the jury\u2019s discretion. . . .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-7\">\n<em>\u201cBoth the People and the defendant are entitled to the individual opinion of each juror. That means that each of you for yourself must determine the penalty of life imprisonment or death. . . .</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-8\">\u201cWhere the offense charged is punishable by death, the Court is required to ascertain if any prospective juror entertains such a conscientious opinion that he would, under no circumstances, vote for the death penalty in a proper case. If you entertain such conscientious opinion, the law provides that you will not be permitted or compelled to serve as a juror.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>It is manifest that the quoted remarks made it clear that what was a proper case was for the individual juror to decide, even though the remarks did not include an express statement to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Immediately after the court\u2019s remarks the first three veniremen in question (Mrs. Foster, Mrs. Brough, and Mr. Kirschner) were examined and excused for cause, and on the second day of the jury selection proceedings the next four veniremen in question (Mrs. Tharp, Mrs. Ackerman, Mrs. Shadburn, and Mrs. Bair) were excused for cause following their examination. The relevant <em>voir dire </em>of the seven is set forth below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>inferred that all seven heard the court\u2019s remarks and that the veniremen excused on the second day also heard statements by defense counsel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>the prosecutor during questioning of numerous veniremen, which likewise made it apparent that what was \u201ca proper case\u201d was for each individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>juror to decide.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The answers of each of the seven, in the light of the context, made it unmistakably clear that he or she would vote against the death penalty automatically and regardless of the evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The eighth venireman in question (Mr. Baugh) was excused for cause on the third day of the jury selection proceedings. His entire <em>voir dire </em>examination is set forth in the footnote.* *3<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The record is unclear whether he was present when the court made its remarks on the first day of the jury selection proceedings. It appears that on the afternoon of the second day of such proceedings the court stated it would address its remarks \u201cto the members of the jury panel who have just entered into the courtroom.\u201d The court at that time repeated many of its previous comments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It informed the venire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>men that the determination of the penalty of death or life imprisonment was within the absolute discretion of the jury and further stated that \u201cThe legislature has formulated no rules to control the exercise of <em>the juror\u2019s discretion.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Although the court did not repeat its earlier comments to the effect that each juror individually must decide between the two penalties, that fact was suggested by the italicized words, and subsequent questioning by defense counsel and the prosecutor of various veniremen before Mr. Baugh was excused made it clear that the decision as to penalty was not only the collective decision of the jury as a whole but was necessarily an individual decision for each juror.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the light of their context, the answers of Mr. Baugh made it unmistakably clear that he would vote against the death penalty automatically and regardless of the evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">The present case differs from <em>People </em>v. <em>Teale, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 497, 512-518, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Morse, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 711, 739-742, wherein we concluded that it had not been made clear to the veniremen that what was a proper case was within the determination of each individual juror and that it was therefore error under <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>391 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>510 to excuse for cause veniremen who, after manifesting opposition to capital punishment in general language, responded in the affirmative to the court\u2019s inquiry whether such opposition would prevent them from rendering the verdict of death \u201cin a proper case\u201d or who responded in the affirmative to similar questions. In neither <em>Teale </em>nor <em>Morse </em>does it appear that the veniremen were informed, as they were here, that the jury has absolute discretion in determining whether the penalty should be death or life imprisonment, that the Legislature has formulated no rules to control the exercise of the jury\u2019s discretion, and that each juror for himself must determine the penalty of death or life imprisonment. Furthermore in <em>Teale, </em>unlike the instant case, the <em>voir dire </em>examination of veniremen was fraught with statements that could only have produced confusion as to the meaning of the term \u201cproper case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The instant case also differs from <em>People </em>v. <em>Ketchel, </em>71 Cal.2d 635 [79 Cal.Rptr. 92, 456 P.2d 660], wherein the majority concluded that the meaning of the phrase \u201cproper case\u201d had not been properly explained and that it was therefore error to exclude for cause a venireman who replied in the negative to the crucial question \u201cAnd if you felt from the evidence that this was a proper case for the imposition of the death penalty, could you vote for the imposition of the death penalty if you believed that it was a proper case?\u201d In <em>Ketchel </em>the court\u2019s introductory remarks informed the veniremen that the \u201cjury\u201d has \u201ca wide discretion\u201d in determining between life imprisonment and death and thereafter referred to the \u201cabsolute discretion of the jury\u201d on the issue. The majority stated that \u201cthe discrepancy\u201d was not explained to the veniremen, that \u201cthe designation of the jury collectively does not establish that the juror must reach an individual decision on the issue,\u201d and that the record showed that the questions as to \u201cproper case\u201d left the jurors in a state of confusion. Here, however, the court\u2019s remarks correctly informed the veniremen of the \u201cabsolute discretion\u201d of the jury in selecting between the two penalties and did not mention \u201cwide discretion,\u201d and it does not appear that veniremen were confused by the questions relating to \u201cproper case.\u201d Rather the responses of venireman after venireman indicated that no misunderstanding resulted from the use of the quoted phrase.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>Three of the veniremen excused for implied bias indicated that their inability to return a death penalty under any circumstances was based in whole or in part on their religious beliefs. (See <em>voir dire </em>examination of Mrs. Foster, Mrs. Brough, and Mrs. Bair in fn. 2.) Defendant contends that their exclusion was forbidden by section <em>4 </em>of article I of the California Constitution, which provides \u201cThe free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be guaranteed in this State; and no person shall be rendered <em>incompetent </em>to be a . . . juror on account of his opinions on matters of religious belief....\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The contention cannot be upheld. <em>People </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>179 Cal. 793, 796-797 [179 P. 209], in rejecting a claim that Penal Code section 1074, subdivision 8,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> violated section 4 of article I of our state Constitution, stated in part, \u201cSection 1074 of the Penal Code has nothing whatever to do with any question of \u2018competency\u2019 of jurors, a matter covered by sections 198 and 199 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and section 1046 of the Penal Code. That section prescribes grounds of challenge for implied bias, matters going to the ability of the juror, regardless of his competency to act as a juror generally, to fairly and impartially try the particular case in accord with the law applicable thereto.\u201d Arguments by defendant that <em>Rollins </em>is no longer applicable are devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Defendant next appears to complain of the court\u2019s failure to excuse for bias numerous veniremen who assertedly showed \u201ca predisposition toward the death penalty.\u201d  However, defendant did not challenge these veniremen for cause, and the general rule is that any challenge for cause must be seasonably made or is waived. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Young, </em>21 Cal.App.2d 423, 428 [69 P.2d 203]; cf. <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>57 Cal.App. 477, 484 [207 P. 699]; see Witkin, Cal. Criminal Procedure (1963) p. 397.)  Furthermore the answers of some of the veniremen pointed to by defendant were merely statements such as that they favored retention of the death penalty, and such statements manifestly do not show either implied bias under Penal Code section 1074 or actual bias under Penal Code section 1073. Other of the veniremen in question were excused on peremptory challenge by the prosecutor, and hence defendant could not have been harmed by the fact that they were not excused for cause. The remaining venireman made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>statements that might be regarded as conflicting relating to whether he believed that the death penalty should be imposed in all robbery-murder cases. This venireman was thereafter excused on a peremptory challenge by defendant.  Even if it were assumed that a challenge for cause should have been made and would have been allowed, it does not appear that defendant was harmed by the fact that he removed the venireman instead by a peremptory challenge. Although defendant thereafter exhausted his peremptory challenges, the record does not show that he desired to exercise any additional peremptory challenges or had any objection to any of the 12 jurors who were sworn to try the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">There is no merit to defendant\u2019s contention that it was improper for the prosecutor, in addressing the jury panel, to make specified statements to the effect that the state was seeking the death penalty. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>60 Cal.2d 64, 76 [31 Cal.Rptr. 782, 383 P.2d 134] [cert. den. 377 U.S. 1007 [12 L.Ed.2d 1055, 84 S.Ct. 1924]].)</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Traynor, C.

Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">\u201cQ. All right. The question, as I comprehend it, that the Court has addressed to you, is not do you favor the abolishment of capital punishment, but could you in a proper case vote that one person should suffer the death penalty, or do you feel that this is\u2014that you are utterly capable [.sic] of that under any condition?</p>\n<p id=\"b890-15\">\u201cA.

Mr. Kirschner, I\u2019m sure you understand from the questions that I asked of Mrs. Foster and Mrs. Brough the nature and extent of our concern here. And to be absolutely certain that we\u2019ve \u2014we all understand each other, do you understand what we are putting to you? The question that we are asking you is not whether you approve philosophically or disapprove of the death penalty itself, but whether, in a proper case, whatever that may be, you could vote to impose such a sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b891-17\">\u201cA. I understand this.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-18\">\u201cQ. Let me put it this way: You know nothing of the facts in this case so far, I take it?</p>\n<p id=\"b891-19\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-20\">\u201cQ. Can you conceive of a crime that you might regard as so terrible that you could impose the death penalty?</p>\n<p id=\"b891-21\">\u201cA. No, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-22\">The court then granted the prosecutor\u2019s challenge for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-23\">\n<em>Venireman Tharp</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b891-24\">\u201cThe Court: : . .

I suppose that\u2019s what I mean. I have to admit that\u2014the propriety of it as long as it is the law, but\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b891-35\">\u201cThe Court: No, the law is this: If you entertain conscientious opinions, the law provides that you will not be permitted, or compelled, to serve as a juror.

Mis. Ackerman, it would seem to be quite clear that if it is up to you you would vote to abolish the death penalty; is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b892-13\">\u201cA. That\u2019s right.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-14\">\u201cQ. But, of course, as things stand now, this law of our state does permit the death penalty to be disposed in the discretion of the jury. It doesn\u2019t say that if you believe someone to be guilty that you\u2019re compelled to vote for the death penalty; it says only that you may.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-15\">\u201cParticularly, what we\u2019re concerned about here is whether you, under any circumstances\u2014can you conceive, for example, of a crime so terrible, or a person so deprived, that you could bring yourself to vote to put him to death? That\u2019s what we are talking about.;</p>\n<p id=\"b892-16\">\u201cA. I .understand that, sir. That\u2019s what I mean; that I personally could not even though I\u2014I suppose I said the other.
