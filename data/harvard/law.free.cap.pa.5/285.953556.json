The action was brought in 1845. The plaintiff then offered a written agreement, dated in 1832, signed by defendant\u2019s testator, which, reciting the sales, witnessed that he thereby agreed that the statute of limitations should not be a bar against McCulloch\u2019s recovering the amount of the sales, and having the sales settled as though there were no statute of limitations to interfere ; and he did thereby make the same agreement as to all other cases where the said McCulloch held deeds for property sold, by him as sheriff, to the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>The court (Hepburn, J.) said that there being no offer to follow this by proof, taking the case out of the statute, and this being without consideration, they rejected it as insufficient to entitle the plaintiff to a verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b286-4\"><em>Hale </em>and <em>Hale, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_\">This written agreement should have gone to the jury; Hicks <em>v. </em>Burhans, 10 Johns. 243; 14 Johns. 188, 378, for the statute is a right which may be waived by the party entitled to its benefit, as much so as costs on appeal, inquisition of condemnation, &amp;e.

The question will be a difficult one when it will have to be met: at present, we are not compelled to decide it. To avail himself of the agreement, it was necessary for the plaintiff to state it specially in his replication. The defendant pleaded that his testator had not assumed within the six years, and the plaintiff, instead of confessing the matter of the plea and avoiding it, went directly to issue on it; and as the actual assumption within the alleged period was the point before the jury, it is not strange that he failed in his proof. As the court did not, however, rule the cause on the nature of the issue presented by the pleadings, it has been suggested that the judgment might be reversed on the actual ground of the decision, because, to have put it on the true ground, would have warned the plaintiff of his slip, and enabled him to amend his replication so as to give him the benefit of the agreement. But it is the business of the parties to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>look <em>to the </em>pleadings, and not of tbe <em>court to </em>point out defects. Besides, we are here to decide as tbe pleadings are: not as they might have been. The assignment of error, therefore, is very plainly groundless. ' Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
