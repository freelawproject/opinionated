A <em>scire facias </em>having issued thereon, the defendant filed air affidavit of defence, stating, \u00abIn the original suit, wherein deponent became surety, the plaintiff issued execution, to wit: a writ of <em>fieri facias, </em>June Term, 1845, No. 155, whereupon a levy was made, and enough money collected by the sheriff to pay the debt, interest, and costs in that case; a copy of the sheriff\u2019s return to said writ is hereto annexed, but for greater certainty the deponent refers to the record of said original suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-8\"><em>Copy of the return. </em>\u2014 \u201c Levied upon the personal property of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>defendant, June 4th, 1845, and sold the same at public sale, June 21st, 1845, for four hundred and eighty-two dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-4\">Judgment was thereupon entered, for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AUO\"><em>March </em>9.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b39-5\"><em>Dunlap, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AP\">The affidavit presented a <em>primafacie </em>case of satisfaction of .the debt.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b39-6\"><em>McCall, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"At\">The affidavit does not aver satisfaction. The fact was, the landlord obtained the whole amount of the levy for arrearages of rent. [G-ibson, C. J. \u2014 That is matter of replication; the surety is not bound to set out more than the principal; the levy is <em>prima facie </em>satisfaction.] The proceedings against the principal and his bail are concurrent, and certainly there should be some averment of satisfaction.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Az6\">Burnside, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Apb\">We are all of opinion, that the affidavit of defence was sufficient. The amount of the judgment in the original action having been made on the <em>fi. fa., </em>by a sale of the defendant\u2019s goods, and in the hands of the sheriff was a substantial satisfaction of the recognisance of bail for stay of execution. Milliken <em>v. </em>Brown, 10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 188; 1 Rawle, 392. Where the sheriff returns that he has sold goods to the amount of' a certain sum, by virtue of an execution, he is liable for the same. The utmost the defendant below was liable for, if his.affidavit was true, was the costs of the <em>scire facias.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Judgment reversed, and <em>procedendo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
