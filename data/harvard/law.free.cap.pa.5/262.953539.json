Rep. 373; Siter\u2019s Case, 4 Rawle, 468; and there is no evidence of an intention to exercise that power, but the contrary; for the omission of the wife to join in the deed leaves her right of dower unaffected, and the only general words, \u201c all his personal property in possession or action,\u201d are controlled by the recital under the <em>videlicet; </em>Bouv.

The description is limited throughout to his property; and has he any property in Ms wife\u2019s legacy ? If he had even a qualified property, it would pass subject to the wife\u2019s right of survivorship in case it were not recovered in her lifetime. But it was held in Dennison <em>v. </em>Nigh, 2 Watts, 90; and Robinson <em>v. </em>Woelpper, 1 Whart. 179, that he has not; and that her legacy is not liable to attachment for Ms debt. The same principle was held in Siter\u2019s Case, 4 Rawle, 373, and some others. In Richwine <em>v. </em>Heim, 1 Penna. Rep. 373, the assignment expressly included the wife\u2019s legacy, which differs that case from the present. The point that the husband has barely a naked power over his wife\u2019s choses in action, and one which he is not bound to execute in favour of Ms creditors, must therefore be taken to be at rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
