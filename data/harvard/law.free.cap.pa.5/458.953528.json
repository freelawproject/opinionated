It was agreed, that no exception should be taken to tbe form of action, or joinder of parties, as tbe only object of the proceeding was to raise tbe question to be decided; and that either party was at liberty to take a writ of error. Tbe following are tbe material facts as appeared by tbe case stated. Abraham Witmer, of Chapman township, Union county, having made bis last will and testament, died on tbe 21st of February, 1826, leaving a widow, Mary, but no issue. By bis will, tbe testator, after devising to bis wife a tract of land for <em>her own use, </em>and making further provisions for her, and giving to various persons specific legacies to a considerable amount, of which, $2400 were bequeathed to bis relatives, directed as follows: \u201c Further, it is my will and desire, if tbe above heirs have <em>drawn </em>their portion, and of tbe overplus, if any, it is my will <em>that all my heirs, and my wife\u2019s heirs, not herein aforesaid mentioned, are to share equal share alike.\u2019\u2019 </em>After tbe payment of all the specific legacies, a balance of $5300 remained in tbe hands of the executor of tbe testator for distribution, under tbe residuary clause above stated. In February, 1844, Mary Witmer, tbe widow of Abraham Witmer, the testator, died, having first made her last will and testament, in and by which she disposed of her estate. At the time of the death of Abraham Witmer, in February, 1826, the following named persons were his heirs, and next of kin under his said will: Herman Witmer, a brother, Ann Eberly, a sister, and Jacob Knop, an only child of Mary Knop, a sister, who died in 1799.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-7\">Herman Witmer died in January, 1829, leaving three children, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>to wit: Dr. John Witmer, Jacob S.

Schenck, Sally Schwartz, Susanna Schwartz, Henry Schwartz, Catherine Ann Schwartz, Leah Schwartz, Samuel Schwartz.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-10\">.Joseph Snively, one of the plaintiffs, was the administrator of John Schwartz, deceased. The plaintiffs contended that they were entitled to one-half of the money remaining in the hands of the defendant for distribution. The next of kin of the testator, who defended, contend that the plaintiffs were entitled only to the one-fourth part of the said money, and that they, themselves, were entitled to the remaining three-fourths. The only question submitted was, to what amount of the said money were the plaintiffs entitled ? Judgment to be entered for the sum to 'which the plaintiffs were entitled, under the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-11\">By the court, (Lewis, P. J.) the testator directs a residuary portion of his estate to be distributed among \u00ab all his heirs and his wife\u2019s heirs equally.\u201d His words are that they are to \u00abshare equal share alike.\u201d At the time of his decease, the persons entitled to distribution of <em>Ms estate </em>under the statute, if he had died intestate, were Herman Witmer, a brother, Ann Eberly, a sister, and Jacob Knop, the only child of a deceased sister ; and the persons entitled to distribution of <em>Ms wife\u2019s estate </em>under the same rule, were John Schwartz, the son, and Barbara and Nancy the daughters of a. brother who died in 1799. If the legatees take <em>per stirpes </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>the plaintiffs will only be entitled to one-fourth of the residue bequeathed. If they take <em>per capita, </em>they will be entitled to one-half of the sum for distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-4\">It has -been determined that in cases of this description, the statute of distribution furnishes the rule for ascertaining the persons who are to take under the will; but the will itself determines the amount or proportion which each is to take; 1 P. Wins. 327; Green <em>v. </em>Howard, 1 Brown\u2019s Ch. Rep. 33; 8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 43. In conformity with the directions of the testator, the persons who would have been entitled as next of kin to himself and the next of kin to his wife are to take equally; that is <em>per capita </em>and not by representation. The persons entitled being three in number on each side, it is the opinion of the court that the three plaintiffs claiming as next of kin of the wife, are entitled to one-half of the sum of $5300, in the hands of the defendant for distribution. Judgment for the plaintiffs for the sum of $2650, with costs of suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-5\">The defendant thereupon sued out this writ, and assigned the following errors in this court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-6\">1. The court erred in giving judgment for plaintiffs for the sum of $2650.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-7\">2. The judgment should have been only for the sum of $1325, or one-fourth of the money in hands of executor for distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-8\">3. If the claimants take <em>per capita, </em>the judgment for plaintiffs should have been for the sum of $1445 45, or <em>three-elevenths </em>of the money for distribution.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b460-9\"><em>Ellmaker </em>and <em>J.

The descendants of one of them dead in the testator\u2019s lifetime, would have taken by representation through their parent, and, consequently, no more than their parent\u2019s share; but the objects of the bequest in this instance are entitled in their own right. Were they claiming a bequest to the testator\u2019s wife, they would have to claim through their parent, and consequently, as representatives collectively entitled to no more than their parent could have claimed; but claiming as immediate legatees who answer to the testator\u2019s description of them as his wife\u2019s heirs, they claim paramount to her, and consequently not by representation at all. Being of equal degree in the scale of descent, they all take portions.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
