It is a well-settled rule of law, that where a contract is immoral, or in violation of the general laws of public policy, it is void; and where a party pays money, or delivers goods, &amp;c., under it, he shall have no action either to enforce the contract or recover back the money; 11 Mass. Rep. 376. Where the consideration of an agreement is in violation of a statute, no action can be maintained upon it; 17 Mass. Rep. 258; 5 Mass. Rep. 395; 4 New Hamp. Rep. 285; and the same principle applies where it is against public policy; Clippinger <em>v. </em>Hepbaugh, 5 Watts &amp; Serg. 315. And it is also equally well settled, that where the contract is to do an immoral act, it is invalid and will not be enforced in courts of justice; Forsyth <em>v. </em>State, 6 Hamm. 21.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-7\">The contract in this ease is an entire one, and the incorporation of the prohibited consideration, as parcel, renders the whole void; 9 Wend. 178; 2 Wilson, 341; 5 New Hamp. Rep. 196; 6 New Hamp. Rep. 225; Loomis <em>v. </em>Newhall, 15 Pick. 159. The parties being, therefore, <em>in pari delicto, </em>and the object, which formed part of the consideration of the entire agreement, being as well illegal as immoral and against public policy and public decency, the epurt below rightly held that the plaintiff could not recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-8\">So far, indeed, have the courts gone in England, that in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>case of Clugas <em>v. </em>Penaluna, 4 Durn. &amp; East, 466, it was held that the plaintiff could not recover even on certain hills of exchange, when the consideration of the bills was for brandy bought in Guernsey, and which was afterwards smuggled into England, to all of which the plaintiff was privy. And to the same effect is the case of Waymell <em>v. </em>Reed and Another, 5 Durn. &amp; East, 599.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A9n\"><em>Dec. </em>7.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AA9\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALx\">If any part of an <em>indivisible </em>promise, or any part of an <em>indivisible consideration </em>for a promise, is illegal, the whole is void. Such is the principle extracted from the cases by Mr. Chitty in the second section of his chapter on illegal contracts ; and the old notion of the difference between a prohibitory statute as a tyrant, and the common law as a nursing mother, he thinks has been exploded. In the first place, then, is not the procurement of an appointment to office by private influence, illegal on the ground of public policy ? In England, a public office is yet so much a subject of private property, that the sale of it was not prohibited before the 5 and 6 Ed. 6, c. 16, which interdicted it in respect to offices which concern the administration of justice, or the public revenue, and the 49 Geo. 8, c. 126, which interdicted it in respect to offices in the gift of the crown, and in certain specific cases. Had all traffic of the sort been deemed, from the first, illegal at the common law, these statutes would have been unnecessary ; and hence it is, perhaps, that the English judges handle transactions like the present with the utmost tenderness. Rut notwithstanding what was said by Mr. Justice Burrough, in Richardson <em>v. </em>Mellish, 2 Bingham, 252, that public policy is an unruly horse that carries you, when you bestride it, you know not whither, the settled law of this day is, that this same public policy <em>may </em>render the sale of an office illegal even in England; and Chief Justice Best, arguing in restraint of its influence, conceded in the same case, that wherever the proof clearly puts the contract on the contravention of public policy, the principle must prevail. And there are many English cases in which the plaintiff broke down precisely on that ground. But were the English common law otherwise, such contracts could not be tolerated by the courts of a country whose government is founded theoretically on the most pure and exalted public virtue. We accordingly held, on the very same principle, in Clippinger <em>v. </em>Hepbaugh, 5 Watts &amp; Serg. 315, that a contract to procure the enactment of even a private statute, is inconsistent with public policy; and in Hatzfield <em>v. </em>Gulden, 7 Watts, 152, that a promise, in consideration of procuring signatures to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>petition for a pardon, is so. There are many American decisions direct to the point that the sale of an office is illegal; and what else is the sale of personal influence to procure it ? It is in some sort a sale of the office procured by it, inasmuch as the influence is paid for, of which the office is the fruit. In Hanington <em>v. </em>DuChatel, 1 Bro. C. C. 124, S. C. 2 Dick, 581, a recommendation for the office of groom of the stole, in the king\u2019s household, though of a private nature, and not within either of the statutes, was held to be an illegal consideration, and it is not to be doubted that a recommendation for office is so here. The inquiry in this case, therefore, will be whether the procurement of the post-office can be severed from the rest of the consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">The' covenant to pay a gross sum is certainly entire; and the consideration for it is so far so as not to be. divisible with any degree of certainty. It is stated in the contract to be a transfer of a lease for a storehouse, a stock of goods at cost, the scales and weights of a store, subject to a deduction of five per cent..on the original bills; and a guarantee that the post-office should be removed from a neighbouring village \u2019to the defendant\u2019s place of business, and that he should be appointed to it as postmaster. Who can say from this how far the office entered into the defendant\u2019s computation of what he was to get for his $500 ? The value of the goods could be ascertained from the bills, but the value of the lease could not be reduced to certainty by any process, and even if it could.; no one could say how much the want of the post-office, to say nothing of the direct income of it, might take from the defendant\u2019s business. Had a price been put on the illegal part of the consideration, it might have been deducted, and the contract apportioned ; as it was in Frazier <em>v. </em>Thompson, 2 Watts &amp; Serg. 235, in which the consideration was goods purchased at several times, including spurious bills; and in Yundt <em>v. </em>Roberts, 5 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 139, in which it was goods sold and a prohibited tavern bill. But in those cases distinct bargains were put in the same note: i'n this the bargain is one, the consideration is one, and the covenant is one, and all is void. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
