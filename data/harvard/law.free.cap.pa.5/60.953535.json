Therefore, an indictment was held to be insufficient, which charged a conspiracy to defraud A. &amp; Oo. and divers others, creditors of defendants, by removing and secreting divers-goods, &amp;c., of defendants, the quantities and qualities of which were unknown, of the value of $5000, with intent to defraud said A. &amp; Co. and the other creditors; and also a like intent, by the same means, to prevent the said goods being levied on, and also a like removal and secreting, with like intent; and a conspiracy to cheat the same parties generally.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b60-4\">A conspiracy to do an act, punishable by statute, cannot be more severely punished than would be the suctessful perpetration of the offence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b60-5\">The obtaining of a false credit otherwise than by false tokens, and the removal and secreting of goods with intent to defraud creditors, are not indictable at common law.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-6\">In error from the Quarter Sessions of Philadelphia county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AXq\"><em>March </em>5 <em>and </em>8. \u2014 The indictment in this case contained five counts, the first and fourth of which were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-7\">1. The grand inquest, &amp;c., do present, that John H. Hartmann, late of said county, yeoman, Granville Hartmann, late of said county, yeoman, William C.

It is defective in not stating whose goods and merchandise defendants conspired to cheat and defraud the parties out of. Reg. <em>v. </em>Parker, 3 Ad. &amp; Ell., N. S. 292; Reg. <em>v. </em>Martin, 8 Ad. &amp; Ell. 481. In the former case it is said that this generality would allow a prosecutor to lie in wait for any evidence, while the defendant would have no notice of the charge he was to meet. So in Rex <em>v. </em>Fowle, 4 Car. &amp; Pay. 592, sustained in Reg. <em>v. </em>Kenrick, 5 Ad. &amp; Ell., N. S. 62, it is decided that a count charging a conspiracy to cheat and defraud generally, is too loose. The particularity which is required, is shown in Reg. v. Peck, 9 Ad. &amp; Ell. 686, (36 E. C. L. R.;) and again in 1 P. &amp; Dav. 508, where the means were a false and fraudulent deed, and the indictment was held bad for not stating how it was fraudulent. The same principles are found in King <em>v. </em>Biers, 1 Ad. &amp; Ell. 327; Rex <em>v. </em>Richardson, 1 Moo. &amp; Rob. 402. This count, as Well as the whole indictment, is also bad for omitting to name the persons defrauded. Reg. <em>v. </em>Steel, 1 Car. &amp; Marsh. 337. There, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>here, it was laid \u201c to defraud A., B., and <em>others </em>unknown. In The King <em>v. </em>Gill, 2 Barn. &amp; Ald. 204, the court say, That indictment is as-far' as they will go. It stated the persons who were defrauded; that it was of money, and whose the money was. This, it is said, is the most general kind that has been held sufficient; that \u201cthe extreme of laxity was allowed;\u201d 2 Russ. on Crimes, 691, Am. ed. 1845, n. e.; Regina <em>v. </em>Parker, 11 Law Jour., N. S. 102; Lamberti <em>v. </em>The People, 9 Cow. 592. In Updegraff <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 6 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 5, the erection of <em>divers </em>fish dams was held to be too general. It is an argument of no little weight, that such a form cannot be found in any book of precedents; which is confidently asserted. We also contend, on the authority of O\u2019Connell <em>v. </em>Reg., 11 Cl. &amp; Fin. 15, cited Whart. Am. Cr. Law, 619, or rather of the reasoning in that case, that if one count in this indictment be held bad, the whole must be\u2018 bad. [Burnside and Bell, Js. \u2014 The law of Pennsylvania is settled, that if one count be good, it is sufficient.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-4\">The other three counts are founded on the act of 1842; they are defective in not properly pursuing the words of the statute; nor in describing the goods, &amp;c.; (Rex <em>v. </em>Horne, 2 Cowp. 682;) nor specifying the nature and amounts of the debts; nor the names of the creditors; (Regina <em>v. </em>Steel, already cited;) nor alleging the insolvency of the debtor, without which the intention was nugatory; for it cannot be pretended that if the creditors might have levied on other goods, the defendants could have been convicted. Chambers <em>v. </em>Spencer, 5 Watts, 407; Lush <em>v. </em>Wilkinson, 5 Ves. 384.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-5\">Moreover, the statute (p. 339) itself prescribes the form to be adopted in this case. The words of the act must be pursued. Resp. <em>v. </em>Tryer, 3 Yeates, 451. A hearing before a judge, and a binding over, are there directed, and must.be averred as necessary preliminaries.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-6\">This act of 1842 was a repeal (p. 349) of all previous laws on this subject, and the act of 1806 is a legislative rule of construction in such cases. In accordance with this are Hellings <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 5 Rawle, 64; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Evans, 13 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 426.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-7\">The indictment lays no offence at common law, as is apparent from the statutes on the subject; 50 Ed. 3, c. 6; 2 R. 2, c. 3; 3 H. 7, c. 4; 13 Eliz. c. 5; 1 Chit. Stat. 384. Certainly no higher punishment could be awarded for the commission of the crime than is directed in these statutes. But if this is not under the act of 1842, the consequence is that a greater punishment is yisited upon an unexecuted intention than upon a successful act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>which is said to be absurd in Rogers <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 5 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 464; 9 Cow. 578, 593. Here too the defendants are convicted of the unlawful act, which is a merger of the conspiracy; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Kingsbury, 5 Mass. 106. As to the sentence. The act prescribes one year as the limit. When that is so, it must be in the county jail; act 1831, March 28, sec. 3; 14 April, 1835, sec. 13. \u25a0 Under the 13 Eliz. it is limited to a half year. Where the sentence is erroneous the judgment must be reversed. 5 Binn. 70; 3 Binn. 577, 581; 2 Binn. 79; 5 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 463; 6 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 554; 8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 262.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b64-3\"><em>Hood </em>and <em>H. M. </em>Phillips, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayg\">The argument supposes this proceeding is under the statute, whereas but one count, only, refers to any statute, and that is for the purpose of showing that the acts were prohibited by the statute. The indictment is for'a conspiracy; the secreting and removing are mere overt acts, in pursuance of that design, and are so laid; but the criminal intent and combination is the <em>offence </em>which was charged. In this case the same certainty is not required as where the offence has been consummated. The objections to the fourth count are unsound; it is not essential that the parties should have been defrauded; Collins <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 3 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 220; nor need the overt act be laid; McKisson <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 420; 3 Chit. Crim. Law, 1186; Whart. Am. Crim. Law, 486, 498. The laying the intention to defraud \u201c others unknown \u201d is almost surplusage. Whart. Am. Crim. Law, 498. The same certainty as would be sufficient in a declaration will do here. Sherban <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 8 Watts, 212. It is said that the act of 1842 has superseded all previous laws on this subject; if so, the offence must be consummated, for a conspiracy is not mentioned there; the consequence is, that this most dangerous offence can never be reached unless it prove successful. But this is not so; the common law still rules in cases of conspiracy.' Nor is there any merger of the offences as contended for. Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Gillespie, 7 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 469; Whart. Am. Crim. Law, 489; People <em>v. </em>Mather, 4 Wend. 265; that rule is confined to felonies. [Bell, J. \u2014 The forms of indictments sufficiently prove that.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-4\">As to the punishment. It is like any other misdemeanor. [Burnside, J. \u2014 Where the legislature has affixed a specific punishment to a crime, can a higher penalty be imposed for an intention to do the unlawful act?] A conspiracy is an aggravation. It is not then within either of the acts cited, but the length of the imprisonment is within the discretion of the judge, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>exceeding seven years; in which case the place of confinement must be the penitentiary. \u25a0 It cannot be a sound rule that would alter the place .and mode of punishment merely because the discretion of the judge reduced the term below two years. If, however, it is erroneous, this court has the power to re-sentence the defendants; this power to reverse, alter, and modify, is expressly given by the act of 1886, and it is so laid down in Drew <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 1 Whart. 281; Smith <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 14 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 69.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AQc\"><em>March </em>20.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-4\">\n<em>Reply.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1k\">The rule that a punishment for a conspiracy may exceed that imposed for the perpetration of the offence, must be confined to cases where the conspiracy alone is the subject of an indictment. Where the successful act has a penalty annexed, no combination to do the act can be more worthy of punishment; but where the act, if done by one man, cannot be so punished, there a combination may very properly be severely punished; far beyond the desert of the act itself.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AjQ\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap8\">There is one vice in this indictment, which runs through every part of it. The conspiracy, as charged, is not to do an act illegal in itself, or by combination of numbers and means in the execution of it, biit to do an act thought to be specifically prohibited by statute. It is certainly not criminal, the common law, to obtain a false credit by any other means than the use of a false token, or to secrete a debtor\u2019s property with a design to keep it from his creditors. But such acts are penal by the statute to abolish imprisonment for debt. Now, to constitute a conspiracy, the purpose to be effected by it must be unlawful either in respect of its nature or in respect of the means to be employed for its accomplishment; and the intended act, where it has not a common-law name to import its nature, must, in order to show its illegality, be set forth in an indictment of conspiracy, with as much certainty as would be necessary in an indictment for the perpetration of it; otherwise it would not be shown to be criminal, nor would the confederates b.e shown to be guilty. The English courts are beginning to regret the laxity of description that has been tolerated in these indictments of conspiracy; and policy requires that the judges, here as well as there, should begin to retrace their steps. The counts before us are so uncertain and bald in circumstances as to have shed scarce a ray of light on the charge which the defendants were required to meet. Take the first of them as a sample of all the- rest. It charges that they conspired to1 defraud their creditors, (the prosecutors \u201c and divers other persons,\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>by removing and secreting divers goods and merchandises of the value of $5000, \u201c the description, quantity and quality of the said merchandises being yet unknown.\u201d Neither time, place nor circumstance is given; and the goods are not attempted to be described by the place where they were kept or by the person who had them in custody. They may even not have been in the State; and a conspiracy to secrete them abroad, having for its object no infraction of our laws, would not be criminal at home. It is not averred even that the defendants had any merchandise at all, here or elsewhere; and unless they had it, a conspiracy to conceal it would have been a conspiracy to do what was impossible. It might be inferred, from the motive imputed, that they had it; but Hawkins says, (b. 2, c. 25, s. 60,) that \u201cin an indictment, nothing material shall be taken by intendment or implication.\u201d Nor are all the creditors named whom the defendants are charged with having conspired to defraud. The prosecutors are named \u201cwith divers other persons \u201d not named; but, unless the additional clause were rejected as surplusage at the trial, the accused would be called upon to defend themselves in the dark. But the mere discretion of a judge, in rejecting evidence in support of an allegation so vague, would be an insecure ground of reliance. An indictment, not for conspiracy, but for the perpetration of the criminal act, would certainly be too general, if the offence were laid as it is described in these counts; for it is said by Hawkins, (b. 2, c. 25, s. Ill,) that it is not always sufficient to pursue the very words of the statute, unless, by doing so, you expressly allege the fact in the doing or. not doing of which the offence consists; and he gives instances to show that it is necessary to bring, the offence within the very words of the enactment, by clothing it with a particular description of the circumstances attending it. Now, though it may not be necessary in an indictment for conspiracy, so minutely to describe the unlawful act when it has a specific name which indicates its criminality, yet, where the conspiracy has been to do an act prohibited by statute, the object which makes it unlawful can be described only by its particular features; and without doing so, it cannot be shown that the confederates had an unlawful purpose. It may.be said that the form of a criminal purpose, meditated but not put in act, can seldom be described; but it can be as readily laid as proved. Precision in the description of the offence is of the last importance to the innocent; for it is that which marks the limits of the accusation and fixes the proof of it. It is the only hold he has on the jurors, judges as they are of the fact and the law, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>on an insubordinate judge, who, confiding in Ms superior wisdom, refuses to conform to any general standard of decision, when his judgment cannot be- reached by a writ of error, and whose example, if followed, would introduce into the subordinate courts as many systems of criminal jurisprudence as there ar\u00e9 judicial districts in the State; so that an act might be criminal or innocent, according to the law of the place where it was done. The evils of such a state of uncertainty, anarchy, and confusion, must be obvious to every one.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">But the sentence is palpably erroneous. The principle of Scott <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 6 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 224, in which it was held that an assault with intent to Mil cannot be more severely punished than would have been the offence attempted, rules the point. In that case, my late brother Duncan said, with the entire approbation of the chief justice and myself, that an attempt to commit an of-fence shall never be punished more severely than the perpetration of it. A conspiracy is even less than an attempt; and it was an error to impose on it a greater pumshment than the statute has annexed to the offence itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
