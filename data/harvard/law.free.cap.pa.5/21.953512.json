Schneck, Maria E. Hoover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-11\">It appeared on the evidence that William Bradshaw, named in the deed of settlement as the son of Mrs. Hoover, died, without issue in her lifetime; and that the children named in this tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>tamentary paper were those of her husband by a former marriage, but that she was in the habit of calling them her children. To this the present defendant, a brother of Mrs. Hoover, and one of her heirs at law, objected that this was not her last will, but that 'the same was obtained by Wm. Hoover under duress, and further \u25a0that she was not of sound mind at the execution thereof. On the trial of an issue <em>devisavit vel non, </em>on the l7tK of April, 1848, a verdict was found for defendant, Asay,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-4\">, \u25a0 In June and September Terms, 1843, ,a <em>sci.fa. </em>and' <em>al. sci. fa. </em>issued on the mortgage,' judgm\u00e9nt was had, the property sold, and-the surplus paid into court \u2014 Asay and others, heirs at law of Mrs. Hoover, claiming th\u00f3 fund. Against the plaintiff, as\u2019 devisee, this issue was directed, and Asay made defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-5\">After reading the deed of trust, mortgage, and proceedings thereon, plaintiff called Schneck, the subscribing witness of the \u25a0testamentary paper mentioned above. His testimony was objected to, because \u00abthe will was tried and verdict against it, which is of record, and the paper should be properly with the register. And -no person, other than the person having it in charge, can speak of \u25a0a record.\u201d Which objection was overruled and noted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-6\">This witness stated, (so far -as his evidence r'elat\u00e9d to \u2018 the point in 'this court, the -competency of the testatrix having been found .by the jury:) \u00ab This is my signature. I saw the will executed by the testatrix, at the time it bears date. It occurred at Hoover\u2019s house, in the presence of Mrs. Howell and Miss Maria Hoover. It was about dusk in the evening; candles were lighted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-7\">Upon cross-examination, the witness proceeded: \u201c I first saw that paper when I read it to her. Mrs. Howell handed it to me to read, to the best of my recollection. It was deemed necessary to know what her wish was respecting her property. This was my only reason for reading it to her. I don!t recollect any one requesting mo to read it. It was deemed necessary by those interested in the will. Hoover was not present. I was acquainted with Mrs. Hoover; I married her half sister. I <em>do not know whether Mrs. Hoover could write her own name. </em>Maria Hoover is my wife\u2019s sister, and half sister to, Mr. Hoover. I cannot tell how the mark was made. The pen was handed to her. She took hold of it. Mrs. Howell handed her the pen; don\u2019t recollect whether Mrs. Howell held it or not. Mrs.; Hoover was in a very weak state of mind \u2014 body, I mean to say.- She was not able to sit up. I read the paper. She was asked if she agreed to the statement of the will. She said that she did, and that it was her wish that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Mr. Hoover should have all her property.. These were probably the very words she said. The question might have been put, \u2018Do you wish Mr, Hoover to have all your property?\u2019. She replied that it was, or yes. I inserted William Hoover\u2019s name as executor by Mrs. Hoover\u2019s authority. I don\u2019t recollect whether I asked her or not. The name was written after the will was read to her, and after <em>she had signed it. </em>She made very few if any remarks, except what Ivjhave stated. When I went in, she recognised me and spoke. Sire said nothing about the paper until I read it to her. She wag reclining in bed when' she signed it; don\u2019t recollect where it was laid when she signed it; it was either on the coverlet, or Mrs. Howell held it. All she said, after she signed the paper,, was, that it was her wish that Mr. Hoover should have all the property. She said, after her name was put to it, that it had always been her wish that Mr, Hoover should have all her property. She was sick six or eight weeks before her death.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-3\">Plaintiff then called Maria E. Hoover, the other subscribing witness, who testified as follows: \u00ab That is my handwriting, (looking at the said paper.) I was present when the paper was executed by Mrs. Hoover. She signed the paper in her bed-room.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-4\"><em>Cross-examined. </em>\u2014 \u201c We went into the room. Mr. Schneck read the will to her. Schneck said, Do you perfectly understand what you are doing ? She said, Yes. Mrs. Howell also asked her, after she took the paper in her hand, and the pen, and commenced making the mark; and while making the mark, after having made the first, (the crooked one,) she was taken with a fit of coughing; she stopped making the mark; we gave her some water in a tea-spoon; she had nearly finished; then Elizabeth Howell guided her hand. One of us asked her if she understood what she was doing. She said, Perfectly; yes, I do: I wish Mr. Hoover to have every thing. That was all she said. I don\u2019t recollect whether she said \u2018 perfectly.\u2019 After this, Mr. Schneck asked if he should pray. She said, Yes. She said \u2018Amen\u2019 while he was praying, appeared very much engaged in prayer, and afterwards thanked him. It was in the room where she lay that I signed it as a witness. Slie took the paper in her hand when she made the mark. I saw her make the mark, and cannot tell which mark she made first; I think it was the crooked one. \u2019Mrs. Howell merely steadied her wrist while coughing. This was after she had made <em>one mark. </em>We gave her a teaspoonful of water twice while making the mark. She also asked it to be read to her. She was lying down. When she- sat up, she .'threw up. There was nothing said when Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Howell guided her hand. Mrs. Howell nursed her; she is Mr. Hoover\u2019s-daughter. She had been sick several days before .the will was made; she lived a week or ten days after. She had her senses perfectly all the time she was sick* \u25a0 except when under the influence of morphine. She spoke of her family affairs to me every day. She was wide awake when Mr.' .Schneck came, and said, Good evening, Mr. Schneck. It- was after tea.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-4\">The alleged will was then read, -under objections:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-5\">1. That there is no evidence of the legal execution of the same.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-6\">2. Because the question has been settled against the will, in the feigned issue of <em>devisavit vel </em>non, in the Common Pleas of Philadelphia county* No: 646, June Term, 1842, which is conclusive and binding on the parties. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-7\">3. Because Barbara Hoover had exercised all her power, limited in the deed of trust, when she executed the mortgage, and could not make a will; and that- by that mortgage <em>(proiit </em>the \u2019same) she parted with all her interest in the \u25a0 land,' leaving nothing but the equity of redemption in her \u2014 the rights which were settled in the <em>\u2022devisavit vel non: </em>which were overruled by the court, and exception noted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-8\">The defendant then gave in evidence the record pf the feigned \u2022issue on this will, directed by the register\u2019s court, and .tried in the Common Pleas; which has already been mentioned. He then called a number of witnesses, who gave evidence of the incapacity of Mrs. Hoover to make a will, by reason of mental infirmity, through sickness, &amp;c.; and proved the drafting of the will by counsel, under instructions received from plaintiff.. He -also gave evidence that plaintiff and Mrs. Hoover were not on- .good terms with each other. He then offered to read the deposition of one of the heirs at law of Mrs. Hoover, and to examine, another \u2014 - having first shown a deed from them, with others, (heirs at law,) to the defendant, dated December 9, 1842, (subsequent to the offer of the will for probate, but prior to the making up of this \u2018 issue.) By this deed, reciting the deed of trust, the death of William Bradshaw, and the vesting of the estate in the grantors therein, they conveyed their interest to defendant, in consideration of natural love, &amp;e., services rendered, and one dollar. On objection made, the witnesses were rejected. A witness of the defendant also stated that the funds for the prosecution of this suit were supplied by defendant exclusively. The plaintiff then gave rebutting evidence, showing Mrs. Hoover\u2019s capacity, and that she and plaintiff lived on good terms, and also her declarations of an intention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>to give all her property to the plaintiff. The defendant\u2019s points-were:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-3\">1. That a married woman in Pennsylvania eannot make a will, unless it be in pursuance of a power given to- her by deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-4\">2. That if the jury find from the evidence that Barbara Hoover executed to Isaac Barton the mortgage under which the real estate specified in the deed of trust (giving her the power to make a will), was sold, the same was in law a fulfilment of the power, and that thereafter she could make no will of the land, so long as the mortgage was in force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-5\">3. That by such mortgage she conveyed her whole estate, leaving but the equity of redemption in her, which is a chattel interest, and the former decision against the validity of the will was conclusive as to that, and that the plaintiff cannot recover..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-6\">4. That by the deed of trust the trustee is seised of the legal estate, and holds it for the use of the parties named in such instrument, and that the plaintiff has no legal claim to this fund, even If the will be good.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-7\">5. That the verdict and judgment in the former trial, No. 646, June Term, 1842, in the Common Pleas of Philadelphia county, against the validity of the will, until reversed or set aside, is binding, final and conclusive between the parties, and those claiming under them, and settles the question of the execution of the will, under the power given in the deed of trust, and also the right of the plaintiff to this fund in court, and that the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-8\">6. That there is no legal evidence of the legal execution of the will, nor that the paper offered in evidence is the will of the said Barbara Hoover, one of the subscribing witnesses called by plaintiff proving that testatrix said <em>\u201c </em>she Avanted Mr. Hoover to have all her estate,\u201d the paper only giving him a life-estate, Ayith remainder over.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-9\">7. That if the jury find from the evidence of the defendant that she was labouring under great imbecility of body, and a general derangement and imbecility of mind, prior to the time of placing her mark to the paper, it is not enough for the plaintiff to show that she could answer <em>commonplace questions, </em>but that she was perfectly restored to her mind, and capable of recollecting the objects of her bounty, the property she intended to bequeath, and the manner of distribution, and soundly to judge of the same at the time the paper was signed or mark made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-10\">8. That the insertion of William Hoover\u2019s name, as executor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>in the will, after it was signed, vitiates the will, if it was otherwise good.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-4\">9. The finding of the jury in the <em>devisavit vel non </em>is <em>prima facie </em>evidence against the will, and it will require clear proof to the minds of the jury to destroy the operation of that presumption.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-5\">10. If the jury believe that Barbara Hoover intended the whole estate to be given to her husband, then the paper offered is not her will, and the verdict must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-6\">Whereupon his Honour answered the foregoing points, and charged the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-7\">\u201c The first is answered in the affirmative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-8\">\u00ab Second. After the mortgage was foreclosed by the sheriff\u2019s sal\u00e9 'of the premises, Mrs. Hoover had no power of appointment of the estate of the sheriff\u2019s vendee. As against him, the mortgage and the sale under it were a fulfilment and complete execution of the power reserved to her in the deed of trust. But the execution of the mortgage did not render her incapable of making an appointment of the equity of redemption, which would remain in the persons to whom she legally appointed the estate, or who were entitled to it in default of her appointment. As to them, the mortgage was but a revocation and appointment of their uses <em>pro tanto.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-9\"><em>u </em>Third. By the mortgage she conveyed a defeasible estate not subject to the power of appointment reserved to her in the deed of trust, but leaving in herself the equity of redemption which <em>was </em>subject to the power. An equity of redemption is not a chattel interest, and the former decision in the issue of <em>devisavit vel non </em>against the validity of the will is not conclusive as to that interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-10\">\u201c Fourth. If the will be good, the plaintiff has a legal claim to the fund in court as the appointee of a will executed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-11\">\u201c Fifth. Answered in the negative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-12\">\u00ab Sixth. There is sufficient evidence of the execution of the will. As to the last clause of the point, viz.: \u00a3 nor that the pap\u00e9r offered in evidence is the will of Barbara Hoover,\u2019 there is sufficient evidence it is the will of Barbara Hoover, provided the testatrix was of sound mind, and its execution was not procured by fraud, undue influence, or other means, which would avoid it, and these are questions for the decision of the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-13\">\u201c Seventh. Answered in the affirmative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-14\">\u201c Eighth. Answered in the negative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-15\">\u201c Ninth. The verdict of the jury in the issue of <em>devisavit vel non </em>is <em>prima facie </em>evidence that Barbara Hoover died intestate. It re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>quires the plaintiff to make probate of the will in this issue, which would have been dispensed with had the verdict in the issue of <em>devisavit vel non </em>been in his favour.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-3\">\u00ab Tenth. If the will of Barbara Hoover is free from every objection, it is not avoided by showing she made prior verbal declarations inconsistent with the terms. In such case, the will itself is the only evidence of the testatrix\u2019s testamentary intentions. It having been shown that the will was prepared at the instance of parties benefited by it, the jury should be satisfied she was aware of' its dispositions, assented to them, and intended to sanction them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-4\">To which answers and charge the defendant\u2019s counsel did then and there except.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-5\">The errors assigned were :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-6\">1 and 2.

After that trial this paper was in the custody of the register, and Schneck could not testify in relation to a paper which had become a record, and of which the proper public officer had the custody. Purd. Dig. 1001; act of 15th March, 1832, sect. 13 and 41. No one can give evidence in regard to a public paper, (Devlingt). Williamson, 9 Watts, 311,j but the officer who has the keeping of it, and here the plaintiff ought to have produced the whole record of the issue, and not this paper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>alone. It is against the policy of the law to allow a married woman to make a will, and every presumption is against it. The act of 8th April, 1833, (Purd. Dig. 168,) is a remedial <em>statute; </em>the provision is, (sect. 6), that the will shall \u201c be signed by the testator, at the end thereof,\u201d &amp;c. Now this testatrix was lifeless, and the witnesses do not say <em>how </em>she executed it. 8 Watts &amp; Serg. 21; Stricker <em>v. </em>Groves, 5 Whart. 392; 10 Watts, 153. The verdict would be conclusive as to personal property; and if, upon such a finding, the court were to decree a partition, and the heirs did not take, and a sale wore to be ordered, the purchaser would hold the land. [Bell, J. \u2014 Would not the whole proceeding be <em>notice </em>to him ?] He would have a right to consider the verdict as conclusive. 2 Burr, 1009; 3 East, 357.

J. \u2014 This will has a <em>mark </em>to it. Is that sufficient under the act of 1883 ?] No doubt, so late as 1839, appears to have been entertained by the profession on the subject; and the opinion of this court, (Stricker <em>v. </em>Groves, 5 Whart. 397,) instances a <em>mark </em>as the mode of \u00a3\u00a3 authenticating\u201d a will by a testator who <em>could </em>write, but whose hands were disabled, and so does Cavett\u2019s Appeal, decided in 1844, (8 Watts &amp; Serg. 21,) the defect of proof was the question there; here the testatrix could not write, as well from ignorance as physical inability. [Gibson, C. J. \u2014 I think Grobell\u2019s case, at Lancaster, last summer, went the length of deciding that a mark could not bo used in any case.] The case is not in point, and will create great confusion if that be the doctrine. The statute does not require, that to authenticate a will, it shall be \u00a3\u00a3 signed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>testator\u2019s <em>writing </em>bis name at the end of it, or by expressly requesting some one to do so for him, if incapacitated by extremity of sickness ;\u201d the requisition Is that the \u201c will shall be in writing, and <em>signed </em>at the end by the testator, or some one for himthat is, that he shall put, or cause to be put, <em>something visible </em>at the end of his will, to authenticate it, which two witnesses can prove. It may be his signature, or a mark; both are <em>signs </em>of his intention and act. The statute neither selects nor prescribes any thing but the <em>place </em>where it is to be put; and hence any character or substance may be used. To \u201c subscribe\u201d does not mean to <em>write the name. </em>Harrison <em>v. </em>Harrison; Addy v. Grix, 8 Ves. jun. 185, 504.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-3\">Is there any thing in the statute that requires proof that if the party authenticating chooses to stamp his name, or use a mark, that he cannot <em>write </em>it ? or cannot write ? or, in other words, that something <em>more </em>must be proved than the legal execution of the will ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-4\">Has it ever been required by any decision, that, in addition to the mark, recognition of, &amp;c., the' party claiming under a will shall, in the first instance, as part of the execution, prove that the testator could not write, either from ignorance or sickness ? Baker v. Dening, 8 Adolph. &amp; Ellis, 94, (35 E. C. L. R.,) is exactly in point. There the will, to which the testator has signed his name, was revoked by a codicil \u201c signed\u201d with a mark, and the judge would not allow a doubt to be raised about it, upon a statute the same as ours. Fisher\u2019s act, 1 Vict. c. 26, p. 49; Jackson <em>v. </em>Van Dusen, 5 Johns.

Considered independently of the possibility which seems to be contemplated by the sixth section of the act of 8th April* 1833, of a party being prevented by the extremity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>of his last sickness, from either signing his last will, or procuring another to do it for him, \u2014 a contingency the present case does not offer for consideration, \u2014 the clear result of all the cases decided by this court, within the provision of that section, and particularly of Cavett\u2019s Appeal, 8 Watts <em>&amp; </em>Serg. 21; and Barr <em>v. </em>Strobill, not yet reported, is, that the proposed testator must sign the testamentary instrument by his own proper signature, if he be able to do so, but if prevented from doing this by sickness, infirmity, or other incapacity, recourse is to be had to the alternative mode of authentication pointed out fey the statute, to wit, signing the testator\u2019s name to the instrument, at the end thereof, by some person in his presence, and by his express direction. To validate the latter mode of execution, two things must concur, and both must be expressly .established by the oaths of two witnesses, at least. 1st.' That the party was incompetent to the task of affixing his own proper signature ; and 2d. An express request emanating from him to some third person as his substitute and amanuensis, complied with ip his presence. A \u201c mark\u201d made by the party proposing a testamentary disposition, is insufficient in any case, and so is the name of such party, written by another person, unless so written in accordance with the directions of the statute. It is true that in Stricker <em>v. </em>Groves, 5 Whart. 397, where the alleged will was not signed or attested in any way, Mr. Justice Rogers, who delivered the opinion of the court, observed, \u201c there was nothing to prevent him (the alleged testator) from authenticating the paper by his mark,\u201d and hence an argument is deduced, that, according to the then opinion of the court, authentication by a \u201c mark,\u201d would, in some cases, be sufficient. But it is to be observed, that this remark is but a <em>dictum, </em>which fell from the learned judge incidentally, not being called for by the point of the case. It was made, too, before this portion of our statute of wills was so fully considered as it has been since that case was determined. It may be proper to say, in order that the ques-. tion may be considered as definitively settled, that we all concur in the opinion now expressed on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">The reasons for a rigid adherence to the directions of the statute, in this particular, are so fully and ably set. forth in the cases alluded to, as to render any repetition of them here unnecessary. The evils that have been experienced from admitting a latitudinarian construction of analogous laws, have been too severely felt to leave us at liberty to disregard the emphatic warning they address to every well-informed legal mind against the indulgence of a similar spirit of judicial interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>In the present case, it does not distinctly appear, from the evidence spread on our paper books, whether Barbara Hoover was sufficiently educated to write her name, or whether she was prevented from doing so by bodily disease, and the debility consequent upon it. But if either of these propositions had been .established by the requisite proof, it is nowhere shown that her name was. written to the paper set up as her'will, in her presence, and in pursuance of an express request preferred by her, to that effect. If she were of sufficient mental capacity to exercise the <em>jus' </em>disponendi, and possessed enough of bodily vigour to affix her mark to the paper in question, it cannot be averred that she was incompetent to the effort of a request to some person to write her name for her, and in her presence. The <em>onus </em>of showing <em>both </em>the inability to write, from whatever cause, and the consequent request to another, lies upon him who avers a -testamentary disposition. But as neither the one nor the other was shown -by the plaintiffs below, it follows, upon the principles indicated, the paper in dispute should not have been given to the jury as a last will duly executed, according to the statute. For this reason the judgment must be reversed. But as the parties litigant are to be sent to .another trial, -it becomes necessary to consider and determine the other errors assigned in this court. Before leaving this j&gt;art of the case, however, it is proper to say that the answer of the court below to that part of the defendant\u2019s sixth point which assumes the paper not to be the will of Mrs. Hoover, because before .or about the time when she placed her <em>\u201c </em>mark\u201d upon it, she said \u201c she wanted Mr. Hoover to have all her estate,\u201d is perfectly correct. If it were executed, according to the forms prescribed by law, by a person of sane mind, not circumvented by fraud, -or undue influence, it is, in itself, the only legal evidence of 'the intended disposition of her property by the testatrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\">The question- of evidence, and the points submitted, based upon the supposed conclusiveness of the verdict and judgment rendered upon the trial of the feigned issue, proved in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia county, in pursuance of the directions of the register of wills of that county, may be disposed of in a few words. -Indeed, the errors assigned in these particulars of the case were but.faintly urged on the argument. From a very early period of the history of our law, it has been uniformly held that the decision of a register repudiating a will, and the verdict of a jury condemning it, is absolute only as to personal estate, but is not conclusive on the title of real estate. Spangler <em>v. </em>Rambler, 4 Serg. &amp; Rawle, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>192; Smith <em>v. </em>Bonsall, 5 Rawle, 86; and cases there cited. This is the universal understanding of the profession in this state, and has grown to be a settled rule of property, not to be disturbed by judicial interference, without danger of disastrous results. If it be desirable to have it changed, it can only be safely done by legislative interposition, looking to a prospective alteration, without meddling with vested interests acquired and held under a well-ascertained principle of the law of estates. As to the third point of the defendant below, which proceeds upon the supposition, that the equity of redemption, remaining in Mrs. Hoover after the execution and delivery of the mortgage to Isaac Barton, was but a chattel interest; it is sufficient to say that it is based upon an entire misapprehension. An equity of redemption is everywhere considered as an interest in the land mortgaged, which will descend upon the heir of the mortgagor, who, in legal contemplation, continues to be the owner of the land for every beneficial purpose. Indeed, the doctrine now is, that a mortgage, although in form a conveyance of land, is, in substance, but a security for the payment of money. Rickert <em>v. </em>Madeira, 1 Rawle, 328, 329. So far has this been carried, that a devise of a man\u2019s personal estate carries with it all his mortgages, and it is the result of the cases in Pennsylvania, and several of the other states, that though the land mortgaged maybe taken in execution for the debt of the mortgagor, it is not so liable upon process against the mortgagee, before foreclosure of the equity of redemption. Rickert v. Madeira, <em>supra </em>; Blanchard <em>v. </em>Colburn and wife, 16 Mass. Rep. 346; Jackson ex dem. Norton et al. <em>v. </em>Willard, 4 Johns. 41. Emphatically, in this state, a, mortgage, like a judgment, confers upon the mortgagee nothing more than a lien on the land, which may be defeated by payment of the money loaned, at any time before sale made by the sheriff, in pursuance of our acts of Assembly, giving a remedy to the creditor. Notwithstanding the mortgage^, therefore, an inheritable estate in the land remained in Mrs. Hoover, and, consequently, if this were even necessary to prevent the conclusiveness of the judgment in the feigned issue \u2014 which is by no means to be admitted \u2014 her devisees are not precluded from setting up the alleged will.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">This brings us to the consideration of the second and fourth propositions of the defendant below, to the effect that the conveyance by mortgage to Isaac Barton operated as a full execution of the powers of appointment and revocation vested in Mrs. Hoover by the deed of trust from Philip Justus and wife to Samuel Asay, and these being exhausted, the plaintiff below can take nothing by vir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>tue of a will inoperative for lack of power to make it. But hwe, again, the defendant is mistaken. By the deed of trust, plenary powers of appointment by deed or will are conferred upon the <em>cestui que trust. </em>She was, also, authorized to make the trusts created by the deed, or any other she might thereafter appoint, and convey the premises to any person or persons, either in fee-simple or by way of mortgage. Accordingly, by the deed of mortgage, she did alter and change the uses and estates created by the deed of trust, and appointed that the trustee should hold- the premises for the use of Isaac Barton, by way of mortgage. But, as 'will presently be shown, this was but a partial execution of the power of appointment and revocation, affecting the general powers given, only <em>pro tanto, </em>for though the words of revocation used in the mortgage deed are general and unrestrained, they are to be accepted and construed in subordination of the principal intent of the parties to it, and this, doubtless, was to interfere no further with the estates, powers, and interests, vested in and conferred on Mrs. Hoover, than was necessary to give effect to the mortgage- The question, then is, how far does this necessity extend? It is a-settled rule in equity that powers appendant, as in the present instance, may be exercised at different times, over different portions of the land made subject to them, and also over different portions of the estate, the only consequence of a partial execution, as to the estate, as, for instance, where one having the freehold, with power of appointment, makes a lease for years, being to postpone the right of possession under a future exercise of the power over the residue of the estate, until the termination of the estate cr\u00e9ated in the first instance ; but this does not suspend the right to execute the residue of the power and perfect the title to the estate granted. Wilson v. Troup, 2 Cow. 237 ; Johnson <em>v. </em>Yeats, 9 Dana, 497. On the same principle, a power may be executed in part at one time, and in part at another; as in the case of a tenant for life, with a full power to jointure, he may execute it in part, and afterward execute it for the rest, in the same wife. Zouch <em>v. </em>Woolston, 2 Burr, 1136; Hervey <em>v. </em>Hervey, 1 Atk. 561; and see Doe <em>v. </em>Milborne, 2 Term Rep. 721; 2 Crabb on Real Property, 704. To lead the application of this principle to the case in hand, it is only necessary to show that where one has a full power of appointment of the fee-simple, with power of revocation, as here, the creation of a mortgage is considered in equity as but a partial execution of the power. And fortunately, this is settled to our hand by authority beyond the reach of controversy. In Perkins <em>v. </em>Walker, 1 Ver. 97, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Thorne <em>v. </em>Thorne, 1 Ver. 141, cited with approbation by Mr. Sugden, in his Treatise 'on Powers, it is ruled, that if a man have a general power of appointment and of revocation; and he appoint to one in fee by way of mortgage, the power is considered as wholly executed at law; but as equity considers a mortgage merely as a security for the debt, the appointment, in equity, operates as a partial execution only, and it is a revocation of the prior uses and estates only <em>pro tanto. </em>It is, therefore, clear, that after the execution of the mortgage in question, there remained in Mrs. Hoover\u2019s trustee, not only the equity of redemption, but also, in her, a further power of appointment, according to the terms of the deed creating it, which has or might have been duly exercised by means of a last will, subject only to the claim of the mortgagee for the amount of his debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">The eighth and ninth points submitted by the defendant below were properly answered by the court. The \u00e9rror assigned in respect to them was not insisted on in the argument, and I do not deem it necessary to elaborate an argument to prove it unfounded. N\u00f3r do I perceive any well-founded objection to the answer returned to the tenth point. \u2022 There was such evidence of the testatrix\u2019s knowledge of' the contents of the paper -alleged to be her will, as justified the court in leaving it to the jury as matter of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">It only remains to consider such of the bills of exception to evidence, assigned for error here, as have not been touched on. And first, the exception that the court erred in admitting the testimony of Daniel Schneck. We see no error in this. Even if the reason assigned on the record would, if shown, have constituted a valid objection, which is by no means clear, it suffices that, at the time the witness was offered to testify, it could not appear to the court that proceedings had been had before another tribunal, to test the validity of the paper offered as a will. Had the defendant proffered to show this, as the foundation of his objection, the court; would not have been justified in arresting the plaintiff\u2019s case, to let in such countervailing proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Nor do we perceive any error in the rejection of the proffered testimony of Ann Hoffman and Susan Telley. Both these individuals, at the commencement of this litigation, were heirs at law of Mrs. Hoover, the deceased, and, as such, interested in the controversy. They come, therefore, clearly within the principle of Post <em>v. </em>Avery, 5 Watts &amp; Serg. 509, and the subsequent cases of the same class, overruling Steele <em>v. </em>The Phoenix Insurance Co., and, consequently, their deed conveying their interest in the land, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>the subject of the dispute, will not operate to confer upon them the character.of competent witnesses. It is no answer to say they are not parties to the feigned issue, directed by the District Court, to try the rival claims of the heirs at law and devisees of Mrs. Hoover. Though not so in form, they are so in effect, and the rule is broad enough to embrace all who are actual parties to the \u2019 litigation, though the form adopted to try conflicting rights may not bring the names of all upon the record, as parties. This is especially so in feigned issues directed to inform the .conscience of the court, when it is discretionary with the tribunal ordering the issue, to select the ostensible parties to it. The witnesses offered were within the mischief intended to be prevented by the later cases, and, therefore, within the prohibition of those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\">What has been said, it is believed, embraces all the errors assigned, and it will be perceived we find no objection to the action of the court below, except in ruling that the legal execution of the paper set up as the last will of Barbara Hoover, had been duly proved. On this ground, alone, the judgment is reversed. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
