Laussat, shown to the witness,) is in Mr. Lestapies\u2019 handwriting ; in the year 1802 or 1803, the Spanish government used to supply the French government with a great deal of money; he was the confidential clerk of Hope &amp; Co., and was sent to Vera Cruz to receive the money from the Spanish government; there was a Spanish law that would not allow a foreigner to go to those countries to settle; he was obliged to take a Spanish name; he took that of Villanueva; he spoke the language like a Spaniard; he was from Bearn, on the Pyrenees. I knew all about the interest of 1 Villanueva, in the Squirrel and Fox; Lestapies took his interest back from the Squirrel when she returned; it was talked of at the time between them. I had conversation with Levis; he said he had received the money, and would not let it go out again. My impression is that he, Lestapies, was'naturalized; I believe he was naturalized here.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-8\">The plaintiff also produced .Peter Bousquet, a witness, who being sworn, testified as follows: \u2014 \u201c I knew Mr. Peter Lestapies, and well, by the name of Villanueva, as agent of the house of Hope &amp; Co., when he went to Vera Cruz to receive a large sum of money.

That the claim for the proceeds of the said one hundred and thirty bags of coffee, belonging to the said plaintiff, and the amount of indemnity awarded for the same by the commissioners, under the treaty with France of 4th July, 1831, did not pass under the assignment of Anthony Laussat, of 8th June, 1819, but remained the property of said Lestapies, and that he was entitled to recover, from the assignee of said Laussat\u2019s estate, such proportion of the amount received, as indemnity for said Laussat\u2019s claim for the Fox\u2019s cargo, as would have been awarded to him, said Lestapies, by the commissioners upon a claim by himself for indemnity for the said one hundred and thirty bags of coffee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-4\">2. That there is nothing in the provisions of the treaty or convention between the United States and France of the 4th July, 1831, or in those of the act of Congress, to carry the same into effect, passed July 13th, 1832, to prevent a recovery by the plaintiff in this action; which instruction so prayed for, the court refused to give, and charged the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-5\">\u201c All the facts'in this case are admitted, and the questions raised for \u00f3ur decision are questions of law which necessarily arise from the facts thus conceded in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-6\">\u201c The fund of money for distribution was awarded to the assignee \u2022of Anthony Laussat, for the loss of the brig Fox, in pursuance of a treaty between this government and France, of the 4th of July, 1831.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-7\">\u201c It is manifest that Laussat was not the owner of all the property on board the ship, and particularly the one hundred and thirty bags of coffee, and if there was .nothing in the case but the facts briefly stated in the plaintiff\u2019s first point, I should be disposed to instruct the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to recover. But it is admitted by the counsel for the plaintiff, that when the property was shipped the plaintiff was a citizen of France, and not an American citizen, nor is there any evidence that he ever was a citizen of the United States ; hence it is contended by the counsel for the defendant that he is not entitled to recover \u2014 upon the ground that the treaty with France, by our government, ratified in 1831, embraced only American citizens, and that France, by that treaty, never stipulated to give money for the loss of property suffered by the subjects of her own government.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>\u201c The question is one of considerable importance, and I am satisfied the counsel on both sides desire it settled by the court of last resort. I shall therefore give that opinion on the law which appears to me to be the correct one, and raise the question broadly for the ultimate determination of the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-4\">\u00ab Hence the court instruct you, that should the jury believe the whole evidence in the case, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, upon the grounds that the' indemnity given by the treaty for the loss of property by American citizens, does not embrace the citizens of France for any loss they may have sustained. The plaintiff being a citizen of France when his property was lost, is not entitled to the benefits of that treaty nor to the funds now in the hands of the assignee for distribution. We therefore say, that under the law, the defendant is entitled to your verdict.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-5\">The counsel for the plaintiff excepted to the charge of the court, and requested that the same may be reduced to writing and filed of record, which was done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-6\">The plaintiff in error assigns,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-7\">1.

The following specific error: Because the court instructed the jury, that should the jury believe the whole evidence in the cause, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, upon the ground that the indemnity given by the treaty of 4th July, 1881, between the United States and France, for the loss of property by American citizens, does not embrace the citizens of France for any loss they may have sustained. The plaintiff being a citizen of France when his property was lost, is not entitled to the benefit of that treaty, nor to the fund now in the hands of the assignee for distribution.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-9\"><em>Ingraham, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAP\">Lestapies was a <em>citizen, </em>within the meaning of the convention with France of July 4,1836.

Pamph. Laws U. S. 1832, appendix, p. 34. A treaty, after its ratification, is a general public law, and as such receives the interpretation of the courts. The true meaning-is drawn from the words, parties, circumstances, object, and whole subject-matter. It is matter of notoriety, that numbers of Dutch, Germans, Spaniards, Italians, and Frenchmen, inhabited this country, before and -^fter 1810 \u2014 - some of whom di\u00e9d here, after many years\u2019 residence;, during which they carried on extensive commercial operations, of great adyan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>tage to the republic, without actual naturalization, though some had declared their \u201cintentions.\u201d The rights of such persons would be protected, and their losses indemnified, under this treaty, the object of which was to take care of our <em>commerce, </em>without regard to the birth of those who carried it on, provided they were <em>domiciled, </em>or, in the words of the treaty, \u201c pitizens \u201d of the United States' by residence. Nor doeS:-any expression occur in the English or French version of the treaty to show that any other meaning was attached by its framers to the word \u201ccitizen\u201d than that of \u201cdomiciled inhabitant.\u201d The common idea that the <em>privilege of voting, </em>which is political purely, makes the citizen, has led to the error in this case; for no decision has taken <em>naturalization </em>as its ground. <em>Domicil, </em>and in many instances <em>domicil for commerce, </em>is the leading principle; The Ann Green, 1 Gall.

Since the United States became a nation, in 1776, they have made many treaties with different powers. They were nearly involved in a war with France, in support of the rights of their citizens; and they are at war with Mexico for the same purpose. But it will hardly be contended that they ever meant to go to war to support the claims of an alien arising out of the act of his own government. The word \u00ab citizen \u201d has always been used in one sense since the treaty with France of 1778, and is found in that of 1788, of 1803, for the cession of Louisiana, and the various treaties with Spain, and Denmark, and Mexico, with the same meaning. It has always been understood to mean those whose political rights here were perfect. The messages of President Jackson, during his administration, and. the executive documents always used the word in that sense; 1 Laws U. S. (Rush\u2019s ed.) 262; Pamph. Laws, 1819, 64; lb. 1831, 31; lb. 1840, 11; Pres. Mess., Dec. 2, 1834; lb. Jan. 15, 1836. It is true that mere birth in all cases does not constitute citizenship, as in Duane\u2019s case, (Wall. Rep. 51;) but Duane was born a British subject, and removed dui'ing a civil war to the jurisdiction of Britain, before the Declaration of Independence, and was strictly an alien. Judge Cooper was a naturalized citizen, or he would have sued as an alien. The eases cited on the other side are cases of prize and war \u2014 peculiar questions, \u2014 and settle, that persons may become \u00abcitizens\u201d by domicil of other countries for <em>war, </em>but not for <em>redress </em>and <em>indemnity. </em>Besides, the award of the commissioners is conclusive; Comegys <em>v. </em>Vasse, 1 Peters, 193; 5 Peters, 710; Lee <em>v. </em>Thorndyke, 2 Metc. ; 7 Paige, 750; Cramond <em>v. </em>Yard, 5 Rawle, 18; Aycinena <em>v. </em>Peries, 6 Watts &amp; Serg. 243,</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-5\">Can the assignee and creditors of Laussat set up this defence ? They certainly may, because, first, the transaction was unrighteous, and, second, if there be any <em>delictum, </em>the defendant is in the better condition: that is the general principle of law. The plaintiff would make out his claim through a fraud upon this treaty. Montefiore <em>v. </em>Montefiore, 1 W. Black. Rep. 363, is on all fours with this case. 1 Story\u2019s Equity, 298, 316, (last ed.,) where the cases between parties to agreements against public policy are collected. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>De Melton <em>v. </em>De Mello, 2 Campb. 420; 12 East. 234; 4 Hill, 424. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A4I\"><em>March </em>22.</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b80-4\"> The question whether a writ of error was proper in this case was withdrawn by Mr. Bead, as the parties were desirous of having the opinion of the court on the point raised, without further delay. On this point see Ingraham <em>v. </em>Caricabura, <em>post.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AUNr\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOq\">It appears, that in the year 1809, Mr. Laussat, a citizen of the United States, shipped, in his own name, for the port of St. Sebastian, certain sugars and bags of coffee, a part of which belonged.io the plaintiff, a citizen of France; and that the property was seized and confiscated at that place by the authority of the French government. This action is brought to recover the plaintiff\u2019s share of the compensation received for the spoliation, under the treaty of 1881, by the defendant\u2019s predecessor in the trust created by Mr. Laussat for the benefit of his creditors. The treaty gave the right of reclamation to citizens of the United States; and we would find it a question not free from difficulty, were we bound to decide it, whether a foreign merchant, domiciliated here for purposes of trade, is such a citizen. It is^ well settled, that a subject or citizen of one country may become a subject or citizen of another, by a change of his domicil, in time of peace, and acquire the commercial character and rights of a native. But is the title to extra-territorial protection a commercial or a political right ? He is doubtless entitled to the <em>civil </em>right of protection within the country of his domicil; but there is no dictum of a judge or a text-writer for the position that the government is bound to follow and watch over his property, whithersoever he may choose to send it. It may be legitimately captured in time of war, even by the cruisers of his own nation, because it adds to the wealth of its enemy; and hence an argument, that as it is exposed to the perils incident to its national, character, it is entitled to the correlative right of protection. But that conclusion seems not to follow where, as was the case here, the act of aggression has been done by the government to which\" the owner of the property owed his political allegiance; for a government would scarce be bound to retaliate for the execution of a captured deserter to its ranks, though it had lawfully enlisted him. It might, perhaps, be bound to protect the merchandise qf a resident from an aggression, on the high seas, of a third power; but it would assume a doubtful position, did it place itself between him and his legitimate sovereign. \u25a0 Now, at the time of this shipment, the plaintiff was, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>perhaps still is, a citizen of France, by whose authority the property was seized; and it will scarce be thought the United States would have been hound to declare war in order to compel France to release it. If that be so, it settles the question; for .a government is not at liberty to demand any thing for its subjects which it is not bound, to the extent of its power, to enforce. Like any other instrument, the treaty is to be interpreted according to the actual intent of the parties to it; and we can scarce suppose that a government would stoop to the indignity of redressing a wrong to one of its own citizens at the demand of a foreign power, or that the government of the United States felt itself bound to make such a demand. But, as a decision of the point is not at present indispensable, these suggestions are thrown out as first impressions, destitute of all pretence to judicial authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\">But take it, for the sake of the argument, that the plaintiff was not entitled to compensation for his part of the invoice by the treaty; yet the assignee of Mr. Laussat, who had shipped the property in his own name, received compensation for -it; and why should the creditors or their trustee be allowed to retain it ? The award of the commissioners is conclusive that it was properly allowed to some one; and though it may not be conclusive between the present parties, the creditors of Mr. Laussat would have the benefit of an entire fund, to a part of which they have no other title ihan the wrongful receipt of it by his assignee. The objection to a recovery is, not that the plaintiff assisted in committing a fraud on the French government or the British cruisers, in covering the property as neutral, but that he committed a fraud on the American claimants by throwing himself on their fund and reducing the rate of their compensation. He certainly does not appear to have been a party to the proceeding, at least in the first instance; for the application was made by the assignee of Mr. Laussat, as the owner of the invoice, and there is no evidence that it was made with the plaintiff\u2019s privity and approbation. If he took no part in it, there is no illegality in his way to preclude him from following the gratuitous compensation of hi\u00a3 loss into the hands of one who had received it for his use. But suppose he connived at the application to the commissioners, yet the transaction would not be so corrupt that no valid contract would grow out of it. True it is, that an illegal contract will not be executed; but when it has been executed by the parties themselves, and the - illegal object of it has been accomplished, the money or thing which was the price of it may be a legal consideration between the parties, for a pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>mise, express or implied; and the court will not unravel the transaction to discover its origin. In Ex parte Bulmer, 13 Ves. 316, Lord Erskine denied that if a plaintiff cannot open his case without showing that he had broken the law, the court will not assist him, whatever the justice of his claim may be; or that Ms case may be so intimately connected with illegal transactions as to be inseparable from them; and he said that if the illegality be only <em>malum prohibitum, </em>(a distinction that has since been abolished,) the plaintiff may recover, <em>unless the action be expressly on the contract precluded. </em>Faikney <em>v. </em>Reynous, 4 Burr. 2069, on which he relied, though doubted by high authority, was justly said by him to have stood its ground. The action in that case was on a bond given by a partner to his co-partner for differences paid in a stock-jobbing transaction prohibited by act of parliament; and the plaintiff was allowed to recover because the bond was evidence, not of legal consideration, but of the defendant\u2019s assent to the voluntary payment of a debt which could not have been recovered from the firm. In what does that case differ from this ? Merely in the circumstance that a subsequent security was given, but which was allowed to show no more than that the defendant had become a party to a payment which could not have been enforced against him. The solemnity of the security would not have precluded an inquiry into the consideration of it, had it been illegal; for as to that, a specialty stands in equity on a level with a parol contract at law. In the case before us, the assumpsit is implied from the receipt of the money, and if the consideration of it will not support a promise, it would not support a bond. Faikney <em>v. </em>Reynous, therefore, is in point; and it is sustained by Petrie <em>v. </em>Hannay, 3 Term Rep. 419, the circumstances of which were the same, except that the partner plaintiff had paid the differences by a bill on which there was a recovery against him; and his action against his co-partner was held to be maintainable by all the judges except Lord Kenyon, who vainly attempted to distinguish the case from Faikney <em>v. </em>Reynous, for the alleged conclusiveness of the bond at law; for it was shown by Ms brethren that the stock-jobbing act had been pleaded. In the last case, too, it is to be noticed that the action was, as here, on an implied assumpsit, and not on a subsequent security. Notwithstanding, therefore, that the plaintiff may have assented to the application to the commissioners, these cases have established a principle which entitles him to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
