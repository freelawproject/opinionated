In 1844, a petition was presented to the court, signed by citizens residing within the bounds of the 22d election district of the county of Lancaster, composed of parts of Rapho, Mount .Toy, and East Donegal townships, in said county, stating the inconvenience, \u2019trouble, and expense, by reason of distance, to which the petitioners were subjected in attending their respective township elections, and praying for the erection of a new township, out of those parts of the said townships as were comprised within the limits of the election district aforesaid.- Upon this petition the court appointed Christopher Brenner, Henry M. Reigart, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Thomas Lloyd, as viewers. Two of the viewers, Reigart and Lloyd, met pursuant to their appointment, and the order of the court,' and made, signed, and returned a report erecting a new township, as prayed for by the petitioners, and attached to the said report a plot or draft, with the courses and distances of the said new township, which was designated by the letter A., and also their names written thereon. This report, on exceptions filed thereto, was set aside by the court, on the ground that only two of the viewers were convened. Another view was thereupon granted on the original petition, and other viewers, in place of the former, were appointed by the court. The order directed the viewers so appointed \u201c <em>to view, and if they see cause, or any two of them see muse, </em>to erect a new township out of the said townships of Rapho, Mountjoy, and East Donegal, agreeably to the prayer of the petitioners, and make report thereof, <em>with </em>a <em>plot or draft of such division, </em>and the courses and distances of the same,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-4\">Pursuant to this order, the viewers met and reported as follows : \u201c That we severally met, and having first been duly affirmed according to law, to perform the duties of our appointment impartially, and according to the best of our judgment, we viewed and laid out a new township out of the said townships of Rapho, Mount-joy and East Donegal, which we name Harrison, and which embraces the twenty-second election district of the county of Lancaster. A plot or map of said township, together with a list of the courses and distances of the same, known and designated by the letter B., is hereto annexed.\u201d This report was signed by two of the viewers. The only plot or draft which accompanied this report, was the plot or draft made by Reigart and Lloyd, \u00edavo of the first viewers, and appended to their report, which, as already stated, was set aside by the court. It appeared, therefore, by the paper-book, that the accompanying plot or draft had been detached from the record of the first proceedings and attached to this report by the viewers, who signed the same, and who adopted or designated it by Avriting thereon the letter B., with their names, respectively. To this report a number of exceptions were filed, which, as they were substantially the same as those assigned in this court, are omitted. The report was confirmed by the court, whereupon this writ was sued out, and the folloAving exceptions assigned here:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-5\">1.

If the proceedings be defective in either particular, it is an error for which the whole must be seti aside. This point was ruled under the act of the 24th of March, 1803, (4 Sm. 80,) of which this act, in this particular', is a transcript, in the case of the division of Macungie township, in the county of Lehigh, 14 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 67. In that case, it did not appear that the men appointed by the court made any inquiry into the expediency of granting the prayer of the petitioners, nor was there any thing in the order directing them to do so. Chief Justice Tilghman says: \u201cWhether it was expedient to make any decision, no opinion was given.\u201d This was an omission of great importance, for making a decision is one thing, and forming a judgment on making such decision is another. If the order of the court had been to inquire, in the first place, whether any division was expedient, we know not what would have been the result. In this order there is no direction to the commissioners to inquire into the propriety of erecting a new township,, except inferentially from the words, \u201c if they saw cause to erect a new township;\u201d but this we deem insufficient, as the.order is defective, except it contains an explicit and express direction to inquire. It may well be that the commissioners supposed that it was their duty to erect a new township, without any inquiry as to its expediency or the truth of the allegations in the petition; that in consequence of the extent of the township proposed to be divided, the citizens were subjected to very great inconvenience, trouble, and expense in attending their respective township elections, and whether the question of the new township was the only and proper remedy for the same. That this may have been the case is highly probable, be-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>cause, by the report, it does not appear that any inquiry was made as to tlie propriety of erecting the new township. \u201c We, the undersigned,\u201d says the report, \u201c appointed by the within order of court to view, and if we should see cause to erect a new township out of the townships of Rapho, Mountjoy and East Donegal, as therein mentioned, do report: that in pursuance of said order, having been respectively sworn or affirmed according to law, we have viewed and .laid out of the said townships of Rapho, Mountjoy and East Done-gal, a new township, which new township we name <em>\u2018 </em>Harrison the courses and distances of said new township called \u00abHarrison \u2019 accompany and are attached to this report, as also a plot or draft of said township, known and designated by the letter A., as also our names written therein, reference thereunto being had will fully appear. Said new township embraces the boundaries of the election district, No. 22.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">Although the case cited does not rule the point, yet we incline to think that an omission to direct the inquiry is not cured by a report that the inquiry was made, for we suppose it to be essential to the validity of the proceedings that it should be contained in the order. The commissioners are sworn or affirmed to perform their duties according to law, and as they are sworn in the terms of the order, the requisition of the act is not complied with, unless the order contains such direction. This is doubtless the safe, practice, and one which best carries out the intention of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">It is also contended the report is bad because the viewers did not make a plot or draft of the townships proposed to be divided, and the division lines proposed to be made therein, nor did they make a plot or draft of the township proposed to be laid off. The only plot or draft which accompanies the proceedings, is a plot or draft made by Henry M. Reigart and Thomas Lloyd, two of the viewers, who made report to the Court of Quarter Sessions, to August Sessions, 1844, Avhich, on the 3d of February, 1845, was set aside by that court, and the said draft is on the record of that proceeding, as also the courses and distances referred to. Whether the draft was part of the original, or detached from it, as seems to have been the case, matters not, as it was referred to and adopted by the present commissioners. There was no necessity to make a new draft if they were satisfied, and adopted, and referred to the one already made. It would be causing an additional expense for no valuable purpose whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">But the next point is attended with more difficulty. Is it sufficient to return a draft or plot of the new township, or must you at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>tbe game time return a draft of tbe townships from which it is taken off? That this would be more satisfactory there can be no doubt, as it would furnish on the record of the Quarter Sessions not only the boundaries of the new township, but of the others also; and it would be a considerable aid to the court in determining whether it was just and reasonable that a new township should be created. And this is the view taken in Henderson and West Townships, 2 Watts, 270. It is necessary, as is there ruled, to the validity of a report of commissioners appointed to erect a new township or divide an old one, that it should be accompanied by a draft of the old lines of the township, as well as the proposed new lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">When it is proposed simply to divide a township, a return should be made of the lines of the old township, with the division lines marked on the draft. That is sufficient for all useful or practical purposes. But where it is intended to divide two or more townships, and to erect a new township, the commissioners should not only return a draft of the new township, but a draft of the townships as they remain after the new township is stricken off.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The proceedings quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
