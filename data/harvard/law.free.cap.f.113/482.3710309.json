C. Nichols, taken on a former trial, because the stenographer\u2019s report was fully and sufficiently verified.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The refusal of the trial judge to give the special instructions requested before the court\u2019s charge was given did not constitute reversible error, because all the propositions and definitions involved were embraced in the charge as given, to which charge there was no objection except as to the rule of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">An examination of the pleadings in connection with the proceedings as set forth in the bill of exceptions will show that the rule of damages given in the general charge, and to which exception was taken, was correct generally and in detail, and, in our opinion, was proper to guide the jury in assessing damages, and in no wise tended to mislead them into giving double damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Finding no reversible error in the record, the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
