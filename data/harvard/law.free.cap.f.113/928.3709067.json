It is not disputed that they are pile fabrics, and dutiable under the first part of this paragraph, if they are not dutiable under the proviso, as corduroys. They are invoiced as \u201cblack cotton velvet cords,\u201d are made of cotton, with a fine rib, and are chiefly used for women\u2019s skirts, sometimes for making women\u2019s jackets, and also for boys\u2019 wearing apparel. They have been imported for the past ten years, and have been sold variously under the names of \u201cvelvet cords,\u201d \u201cribbed velvets,\u201d or \u201ccorded velvets.\u201d The board found the evidence conflicting, and held that it would seem to be better capable of being harmonized on the theory that a \u201cvelvet cord\u201d is a species of corduroy, and the circuit court concurred with them. We are unable to reach the same conclusion. If the evidence of the retail salesmen be disregarded, \u2014 and certainly it is unpersuasive, since their transactions are not with the trade, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>only with the consumer, who is ignorant of trade names and trade classification, \u2014 the evidence will not be found to be so conflicting. Morrison v. Miller (C. C.) 37 Fed. 82; Hills Bros. Co. v. U. S., 39 C. C. A. 500, 99 Fed. 264. These goods are never bought or sold as corduroys, though that circumstance would be immaterial if they were in fact corduroys. They are not within the definition of \u201ccorduroy\u201d given in the Century Dictionary, which describes a thick stuff especially used for the outer garments of men engaged in rough labor, field sports, and the like. These goods are never so used, and are not fit for such use. It seems to have been assumed below that the word \u201ccords\u201d is an abbreviation of \u201ccorduroy,\u201d the latter word being a generic term covering a group of several species. Reference to these words in the New English Dictionary of the Philological Society, however, shows that \u201ccords\u201d came first into use, and \u201ccorduroy\u201d or \u201ccorde du roy\u201d was a term of subsequent invention. The specifications of Woostenholm\u2019s patent, No. 1,123, of 1776 (cited in this dictionary), speaks of \u201cvelveteen cords,\u201d and of nearly everything of the fustian kind, but does not mention corduroy. The first use of the latter word seems to be more than 10 years later. Evidently the broader word of the two is \u201ccords.\u201d The most significant fact in proof--and it is not disputed \u2014 is that the goods imported (Exhibit 1) differ from what all concede to be a corduroy (Exhibit A), not only in the kind of yarn and thread used, the width of the goods, and the quality of the cotton, but also in the method of manufacture. They are made on different looms. The corduroy is cut by machinery; the velvet cord, by hand. Velvet cord is made on a velvet loom. A loom used to make corduroys could not be used to make ribbed velvets \u201cwithout considerable alteration, which would be very costly, and would not be worth while doing. It is not done.\u201d Exhibit I is made on an ordinary velvet or velveteen loom. Exhibit A is made on a corduroy loom, \u2014 a much heavier loom. Corduroys, in fact, are not made by the manufacturers who make velvet cords, nor velvet cords by the manufacturers who make corduroy. The evidence shows them to be different articles, the dictionaries do not indicate that the same word covers both, and we do not find the evidence persuasive to the conclusion that commercial usage knows the velvet cord as a variety of corduroy.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\">The decision of the circuit court is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
