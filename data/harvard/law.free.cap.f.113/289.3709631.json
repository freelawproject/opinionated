It is enough now to say that appellants have failed to show that the provisional order was improvidently entered; and, inasmuch as the case will probably be before us again on its final hearing, no further reasons for our judgment need be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
