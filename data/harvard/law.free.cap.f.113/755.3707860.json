Her master was informed that the mast of the tow was about 134 feet high. Assuming that he had a right to suppose that the bridge was 135 feet above the water at mean high tide, the margin of safety was too narrow in the condition of the tide at the time. He ought to have been aware, upon observation of the piers and slips, that it had receded but a little. In taking the chances when this was apparent or should have been, he disregarded reasonable prudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-16\">Decree affirmed, with interest and costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
