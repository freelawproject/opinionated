The importers contended that they should be assessed under paragraph 454, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-17\">\u201c454. Paintings in oil or water colors, pastels, pen and ink drawings, and statuary, not specially provided for in this act, twenty per centum ad valorem; but the term \u2018statuary\u2019 as used in this act shall be understood to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Include only such statuary as Is cut, carved or otherwise wrought by hand, from a solid block or mass of marble, stone or alabaster, or from metal, and as is the professional production of a statuary or sculptor only.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">There was a great deal of evidence presented to the circuit court which was not before the board of general appraisers, and which materially differentiated the. case from the one it passed upon. The judge who heard the cause below discussed the questions presented in a careful opinion, in the reasoning and conclusions of which we fully concur. The appellant calls attention to the fact that in paraphrasing paragraph 454 that opinion states the concluding clause as requiring the statuary to be the \u201cproduction of a professional sculptor,\u201d when the phrase used in the act is \u201cthe professional production of a sculptor.\u201d The change of phraseology is immaterial. It is a familiar rule of construction of tariff statutes that congress must be assumed to use words and phrases in the sense in which they have been applied by the treasury department and executive and administrative officers of <em>the </em>government under earlier statutes which contained the same words and phrases. Robertson v. Downing, 127 U. S. 612, 8 Sup. Ct. 1328, 32 L. Ed. 269. The phrase \u201cprofessional production of a sculptor\u201d is found in successive tariff acts for some years past. Under date of February 6, 1880 (Treasury Synopsis, 4416), the secretary of the treasury, in a letter to the secretary of state, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">\u201cThe terms \u2018professional productions of a sculptor\u2019 and \u2018productions of a professional sculptor\u2019 arc considered as having the same signification, and the articles must be a production of a professional sculptor or statuary in the true definition of that term, in order to be admissible at a duty of,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">And the instructions as to consular certificates evidently regard the one phrase as a synonym of the other. It must be assumed that congress used the phrase it chose with a like understanding of its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The decision of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
