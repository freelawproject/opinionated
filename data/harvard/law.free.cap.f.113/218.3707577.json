Such purchaser, while claiming a failure to complete the contract in the time limited, and after his inspector had complained of defects in the construction and refused to aecept the motor, accepted it in its condition, in order to get possession. The manufacturer subsequently sued for the contract price, and for extra work outside the contract. <em>Held, </em>that it was proper to exclude evidence as to the character of the tests made at the factory, for the purpose of showing their incompleteness, and, as to tests made after delivery, to show that alleged defects were such as not to be discernible until the motor was used, since the purchaser, by acceptance, waived the right to insist on a further test.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b230-13\">8.

The defendant set up by counterclaim charges for materials furnished, and for expenses and damages by reason of imperfect work and failure to complete the contract within the time specified. The proposal contained in the following letter was accepted by defendant, and states the contract between the parties;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\">\u201cNew York, Feb. loth, 1803.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">\u201cArthur P.

The correspondence between the parties shows that he was a representative of defendant, such as was provided for in said contract. During this time he made frequent complaints to plaintiff, alleging unreasonable delays in the progress of the work, and imperfect materials and defective workmanship. After the working parts of the machine had been put together, it was connected with steam power and tested in the presence of Hodges and another representative of defendant. Plaintiff then presented to Hodges a paper stating that he (Hodges) accepted the work and approved the bill, and plaintiff refused to ship the machine until Hodges should sign said paper. Hodges declined to sign it, stating that the work was poor, and the bills were not in a condition to be approved. Plaintiff then wrote defendant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\">\u201cNew York, May 31st, 1898.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">\u201cArthur P.

There is nothing in our contract that requires the approval of your bills before you deliver to us the result of your work and material. All that we are required to do is to accept the work and material when ready to be delivered to me.

But defendant has failed to note the exceptions that, where a known and described article is thus ordered for a particular pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>pose, there is no warranty that it shall answer the particular purposes intended by the buyer, where the manufacturer actually supplies the thing ordered (De Witt v. Berry, 134 U. S. 306, 313, 10 Sup. Ct. 536, 33 L. Ed. 896; Seitz v. Machine Co., 141 U. S. 510, 12 Sup. Ct. 46, 35 L. Ed. 837), nor where the buyer relies on his own skill or judgment. The foundation of the doctrine of warranty is the responsibility of a vendor for deception. Hoe v. Sanborn, 21 N. Y. 559, 78 Am. Dec. 163. Hence, where a vendor is a manufacturer, and the vendee has ordered an article for a particular purpose, ,and has not had an opportunity of inspecting it during the manufacture, the vendor is presumed to have had knowledge of latent defects produced by the process of manufacture, and must be held liable therefor. Bridge Co. v. Hamilton, 110 U. S. 108, 114, 3 Sup. Ct. 537, 28 L. Ed. 86; Bierman v. Mills Co., 151 N. Y. 482, 490, 45 N. E. 856, 37 L. R. A. 799, 56 Am. St. Rep. 635. But where the vendee has an opportunity of inspection, and relies on his own judgment, there is no presumption of deceit, and no warranty is implied. Cunningham v. Hall, 4 Allen, 273, 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The defendant contended that under the written contract, Exhibit A, it was entitled to demand a final test of the completed motor at plaintiff\u2019s works, in order to determine its fitness for the purpose desired, and that inasmuch as it was incomplete when it was shipped to Wilmington, Del., the defendant had the right to make said final test at Wilmington; that the acceptance of the motor at plaintiff\u2019s works was only an acceptance of such material and workmanship as was there capable of determination, but that there was an implied warranty against latent defects which survived such acceptance; and that the question of compliance with said warranty could only be determined by such final test at Wilmington. In support of this contention, the defendant, upon the trial, offered evidence of the character of the tests made at Scranton, for the purpose of showing that such tests were necessarily preliminary and incomplete, because, inter alia, the parts necessary to a complete motor car had not been assembled; and of the character of the tests made at Wilmington, in order to show that the alleged defects were such as not to be discoverable until the bodjr of the car was mounted upon and connected with said machinery. The court excluded this evidence on the ground that defendant, by its letter of June 1st, had expressly accepted the motor in its then condition at Scranton, and had thereby waived its right to insist on a further test. On May 10th the defendant had written to the plaintiff as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">\u201cX believe that, by the terms of our contract, we were to inspect and accept at your 'works in Scranton the work you are constructing for us, when you say it is ready therefor, if found correct. By reason of the great delays, and for other reasons, it seems to be desirable that we go to the additional expense of shipping such work, namely, the trucks, boilers, condensers, etc., from Scranton to the Jackson &amp; Sharp Co., at Wilmington, Delaware, for erection. I wish to ask if you will be willing to so modify our contract as to permit of such testing and acceptance by us after they shall reach the shop? of Messrs. Jackson &amp; Sharp, instead of at your own works, as previously arranged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Plaintiff did not consent to this modification. Its only reply was contained in said letter of May 31st, where, after stating the refusal of the inspector to approve and accept, it says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-4\">\u201cOf course, as it is a part of our agreement that we have such acceptance and approval before shipment of car from our works, we are holding it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Under the original agreement, defendant was to furnish his special inspector to pass upon all material and workmanship, with power to reject such as should not conform to said agreement; to build the car body and furnishings, and deliver the same to plaintiff at its factory, the plaintiff doing there whatsoever work might be necessary for the completion of the motor car; to pay after acceptance of the motor thus completed, such acceptance to be based on his approval of materials, workmanship, etc., according to the drawings, etc., furnished by defendant, and to be signified before the motor should be removed from plaintiff\u2019s works. Even if \u2019defendant, under his original agreement, might have claimed a further test, such right was waived by the subsequent acts and correspondence. Three months and a half after the making of the agreement, defendant, while claiming that plaintiff had failed to complete the contract within the time limited, and after his inspector had complained that there were serious visible defects in the construction of the motor, and after having learned from plaintiff that said inspector had refused to accept said motor, and after having failed to furnish the car body as agreed, the presence of which defendant admits was necessary to finally test the fitness of the motor, writes to plaintiff in response to its refusal to ship before acceptance as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">\u201cAll that we are required to do is to accept the work and material when ready to be delivered to me. Hence I hereby accept and approve of all the material and work as placed upon the car ready for shipment to Wilmington.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">It cannot be said that plaintiff impliedly consented to a further test at some other factory, or that the alleged implied guaranty survived and was imported into the new contract. On the contrary, the correspondence shows that both parties understood the limitations of the original contract, and the effect of such modification. The defendant had the right to refuse to accept and approve said motor, provided it was not completed within the time limited, or because of defective workmanship and material. He might have had the right, if he had furnished the car body, to insist upon a final test of the com - pleted motor car. He did none of these things, but elected to waive his rights, under conditions known to him, and to accept and approve what his inspector had refused to accept and approve, in order that he (the defendant) might obtain possession of the motor. There was no error in the exclusion of said evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">The defendant further contends that the court \u201cerred in holding that there was sufficient proof of the value in the theory of the account stated.\u201d The facts in regard to this exception are as follows: The agreement provided that the total amount of payment for the motor should not exceed $4,000. The plaintiff claimed that the cost of the motor to it, pins the agreed manufacturer\u2019s profit, exceeded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>$4,000. Instead of showing the cost of labor and materials, it proved that, shortly after the motor was shipped to Wilmington, it sent to defendant bills for the motor aggregating more than $4,000, and for extra work aggregating $936.59, and that defendant, having received and retained them, made no response until August 12th, when he wrote plaintiff, inclosing a statement of independent counter charges made by him, which statement and letter credited and admitted the $4,000 item for car \u201cas per contract,\u201d and $388.68 of plaintiff\u2019s bill for extras. Thereupon the court charged the jury that in these, circumstances, and upon defendant\u2019s admission that the $4,000 limit had been exceeded by said bills, and the concession of the $388.68, the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case for $4,388.68. The defendant contends that \u201cthe whole statement or admission must be submitted, \u2014 both the favorable and unfavorable parts.\u201d The whole of said statement was admitted in evidence and submitted to the jury, except certain items for additional work to put the car in working condition, which were excluded on account of the acceptance by defendant already considered. The different parts of said account have no such connection that the admission of the amount due by defendant should entitle him to an allowance of the .counter charges. .The claim by defendant that he was entitled to the items therein in no way affects the admission of the correctness of plaintiff\u2019s charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
