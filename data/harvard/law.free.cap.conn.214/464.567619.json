(3) Does service made in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 52-593a<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \"commence\u201d an action as specified in \u00a7 52-592? We answer all of these questions in the affirmative and, consequently, conclude that the trial court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">In the first case the plaintiffs, Frances and Marshall Lacasse, brought an action against the defendant, the commissioner of transportation (commissioner), pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> alleging personal injuries caused by a defective portion of highway in the town of Granby. The plaintiff in the second case, Zbigniew Kilian, also brought an action against the commissioner pursuant to \u00a7 13a-144, alleging personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>injuries caused by a defective portion of highway in the town of Berlin. Both actions were dismissed pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 251, on June 19,1987. The present writ, summons and complaint in each case was delivered to a sheriff for the purpose of service upon the commissioner on June 17,1988, in the second case and on June 18, 1988, in the first case. The commissioner filed a motion to dismiss in each action, alleging that: (1) the doctrine of sovereign immunity precluded the bringing of any action against the state under the authority of \u00a7 52-592; (2) the dismissal of an action pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 251 did not constitute an accidental failure of suit, as defined in \u00a7 52-592; and (3) neither action was \u201ccommenced\u201d within one year of the prior dismissals, as mandated by \u00a7 52-592.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The trial court, in identical memoranda of decision, disagreed with the commissioner\u2019s second and third contentions, but agreed with the first and, therefore, granted the commissioner\u2019s motions to dismiss. The court reasoned that because \u00a7 52-592 contained neither an express nor an implied waiver of the state\u2019s sovereign immunity, the plaintiffs were strictly limited to the remedy provided them in \u00a7 13a-144. The court concluded that since there had been \u201cno consent [by the state] to maintain the \u2018new action\u2019 described in . . . \u00a7 52-592,\u201d the plaintiffs were foreclosed from bringing any action because more than two years had passed since the time of the injuries complained of. General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144. We disagree with this reasoning and conclude that the plaintiffs were not precluded from maintaining their actions pursuant to \u00a7 52-592.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The issue presented by the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of error is whether the legislature, by waiving the state\u2019s sovereign immunity in \u00a7 13a-144, intended that procedural statutes and rules of court be applied to the state, just as they would be applied to any other litigant. We conclude that the legislature so intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\u201cThat a sovereign state is immune from suit, unless it consents to be sued, is the settled law of Connecticut.\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>151 Conn. 259, 262, 196 A.2d 596 (1963); <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 307, 312, 567 A.2d 1195 (1990); <em>Duguay </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>191 Conn. 222, 227, 464 A.2d 290 (1983). \u201cThe General Assembly, by appropriate legislation, can waive the state\u2019s sovereign immunity from suit and authorize suits against the state.\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>supra. \u201cIndeed this is what the legislature did in the area of highway defects when it enacted the state and municipal highway liability statutes. The state, which ordinarily would not be liable, permitted itself, as a matter of grace, to be sued under the express conditions of the statute.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra. \u201cBut the state\u2019s sovereign right not to be sued without its consent is \u2018not to be diminished by statute, unless a clear intention to that effect on the part of the legislature is disclosed, by the use of express terms or by force of a necessary implication.\u2019 \u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>supra, 262-63, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Kilburn, </em>81 Conn. 9, 11, 69 A. 1028 (1908). Thus, where the state has \u201cpermitted itself to be sued in certain circumstances, this court has recognized the well established principle that statutes in derogation of sovereign immunity should be strictly construed.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">In applying these principles, our decisions have consistently treated the state with respect to procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>matters,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> once its immunity has been waived, in a manner identical to any other litigant, except for the taxation of costs; <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>176 Conn. 362, 366, 407 A.2d 987 (1978); <em>State ex rel. Foote </em>v. <em>Bartholomew, </em>111 Conn. 427, 432, 150 A. 308 (1930); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>82 Conn. 392, 394, 73 A. 751 (1909); or the award of prejudgment interest when a defendant has failed to accept an offer of judgment equal to or less than the amount recovered. <em>Struckman </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>205 Conn. 542, 556, 534 A.2d 888 (1987). Those cases were based upon the understanding that \u201c[wjhen a generalized statute allows plaintiffs to collect certain varieties of damages in particular types of civil actions ... it does not waive a state\u2019s sovereign immunity in that area unless there is an express waiver.\u201d Id., 559. This principle is inapplicable, however, since the question in these cases is not whether the state\u2019s monetary liability can be expanded beyond that provided by a statute permitting the state to be sued, but, rather, whether the state, having consented to being sued, is subject to procedural statutes applicable to all other litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">We have long held that, once involved in an action, the state enjoys the same status as any other litigant. Thus, for example, the state, when it brings an equitable action, opens \u201cthe door to any defense or cross-complaint germane to the matter in controversy . . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>A sovereign who asks for equity must do equity.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kilburn, </em>supra, 12. \u201c[B]y bringing an action, the State subjects itself to the procedure established for its final and complete disposition in the courts, by way of appeal or otherwise.\u201d <em>Reilly </em>v. <em>State, </em>119 Conn. 217, 220, 175 A. 582 (1934); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>136 Conn. 157, 160 n.1, 70 A.2d 109 (1949); <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>129 Conn. 106, 113, 26 A.2d 592 (1942). We see no reason to depart from this principle when, as in these cases, the state has specifically waived its sovereign immunity and the procedural statute in question affects only the time during which the suit may be brought rather than the potential amount of the state's liability. Cf. <em>Korb </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Gas Light Co., </em>91 Conn. 395, 402, 99 A. 1048 (1917) (accidental failure of suit statute applicable regardless of whether the statute of limitations is one which concerns the remedy only, or the right as well as the remedy); see <em>Isaac </em>v. <em>Mount Sinai Hospital, </em>210 Conn. 721, 726-29, 557 A.2d 116 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Our conclusion that the state is to be treated as any other litigant after being summoned to defend itself pursuant to \u00a7 13a-144 is bolstered by the very language of \u00a7 52-592, our accidental failure of suit statute. A plaintiff, by the terms of the statute, may \u201ccommence a new action . . . for <em>the some came </em>at any time within one year,\u201d when <em>\u201cany action, </em>commenced within the time limited by law, has failed\u201d for any one or more of the enumerated reasons. (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 52-592 (a). \u201cThis language certainly is general and comprehensive. It neither embodies exceptions or reservations, nor suggests any.\u201d <em>Korb </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Gas Light Co., </em>supra, 401. Further, we have consistently held that \u00a7 52-592 is remedial in nature and thus, should be broadly and liberally construed. <em>Isaac </em>v. <em>Mount Sinai Hospital, </em>supra, 728, and cases cited therein. We conclude, on the basis of the language and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>evident purpose of \u00a7 52-592, that the trial court erred in concluding that the doctrine of sovereign immunity was applicable to the plaintiffs\u2019 actions, since the statute is procedural in nature and is to be applied, absent further guidance from the legislature, to the state in the same manner as it would be applied to any other litigant.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The commissioner argues that the decision of the trial court may be affirmed on the alternate ground that a plaintiff who has suffered a judgment of dismissal pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 251 is precluded from taking advantage of the accidental failure of suit statute, \u00a7 52-592. The trial court, on the basis of a statement made by this court in <em>Gionfrido </em>v. <em>Wharf Realty, Inc., </em>193 Conn. 28, 34 n.6, 474 A.2d 787 (1984), concluded that a dismissal entered pursuant to \u00a7 251 would not bar a subsequent action brought under the authority of \u00a7 52-592. In these cases, we agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">The commissioner argues initially that \u201cin applying Section 52-592 to this case, it must be strictly construed so as not to expand the waiver of sovereignty.\u201d This contention, however, is inconsistent with our conclusion in the first portion of this opinion that, once validly summoned into court, the state is to be treated procedurally just like any other litigant. Accordingly, it would make little sense to construe procedural rules and statutes strictly in favor of the state. This is especially true when dealing with a remedial statute such as \u00a7 52-592, which is to be \u201cliberally interpreted.\u201d <em>Ross Realty Corporation </em>v. <em>Surkis, </em>163 Conn. 388, 393, 311 A.2d 74 (1972). Taken to its logical conclusion, the commissioner\u2019s argument would require that we adopt two bodies of procedural law, one applicable to ordinary liti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>gants and another to be applied only to the state. We decline to engage in any such development.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The commissioner next argues that a dismissal under Practice Book \u00a7 251 does not constitute a failure for a \u201cmatter of form,\u201d because: (1) that term does not include all actions not tried on their merits; <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Bemer, </em>206 Conn. 491, 494-95, 538 A.2d 703 (1988); (2) the dismissal is disciplinary in nature and results from irresponsibility rather than mere omission; (3) \u201c[t]he judiciary must have an effective system of case-flow management to prevent cases from clogging dockets because of lack of diligent prosecution\u201d; (4) the order is not necessarily permanent; see General Statutes \u00a7 52-212; Practice Book \u00a7 326; and (5) it is probable that the judges of the Superior Court chose to utilize the word \u201cdismissal\u201d rather than \u201cnonsuit\u201d in \u00a7 251, in order to preclude the application of \u00a7 52-592.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While we do not necessarily disagree with all of these contentions, we conclude, nevertheless, that in these cases the dismissals pursuant to \u00a7 251 constituted failures for a \u201cmatter of form,\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 52-592.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">While it has been said, in relation to a predecessor of \u00a7 52-592, that \u201c[t]he phrase, \u2018any matter of form,\u2019 was used in contra-distinction to matter of substance, as embracing the real merits of the controversy between the parties\u201d; <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Sikes, </em>56 Conn. 589, 592 (Conn. Super. 1888) (decision by Justice Loomis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>sitting in the Superior Court); we have never expressly adopted such a distinction to control the application of the accidental failure of suit statute. Thus, we stated in <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Bemer, </em>supra, 494-95, that \u00a7 52-592 \u201cdoes not authorize the reinitiation of all actions not \u2018tried on . . . [their] merits,\u2019only those that have failed for, among other reasons, \u2018any matter of form.\u2019 \u201d We have held, however, that a dismissal entered pursuant to \u00a7 251 \u201cis not an adjudication on the merits that can be treated as res judicata. <em>Gionfrido </em>v. <em>Wharf Realty, Inc., </em>[supra 34 n.6]; <em>Greenwich </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>191 Conn. 528, 544, 469 A.2d 382 (1983); <em>Pacelli Bros. Transportation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pacelli, </em>189 Conn. 401, 411-12, 456 A.2d 325 (1983).\u201d <em>Milgrim </em>v. <em>Deluca, </em>195 Conn. 191, 195, 487 A.2d 522 (1985). On the basis of these holdings, we have also stated, albeit in dicta, that \u00a7 52-592 is available to plaintiffs who have suffered a dismissal, pursuant to \u00a7 251, for lack of reasonable diligence in the prosecution of their actions. <em>Gionfrido </em>v. <em>Wharf Realty, Inc., </em>supra; see <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Bemer, </em>supra, 494 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">In cases where we have either stated or intimated that the \u201cany matter of form\u201d portion of \u00a7 52-592 would not be applicable to a subsequent action brought by a plaintiff, we have concluded that the failure of the case to be tried on its merits had not resulted from accident or even simple negligence. <em>See Hughes </em>v. <em>Bemer, </em>supra, 495 (failure to file a required memorandum of law operates as a consent to judgment on the merits resulting from granting a motion to strike); <em>Pavlinko </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, </em>192 Conn. 138, 144, 470 A.2d 246 (1984) (dismissal pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 231 for deliberate refusal to answer questions at a deposition); <em>Parrott </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>161 Conn. 573, 575, 290 A.2d 335 (1971) (voluntary withdrawal of prior suit); <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Baningoso, </em>134 Conn. 382, 387, 58 A.2d 5 (1948) (voluntary withdrawal of prior suit). Unlike these cases, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>records in the present appeals reveal nothing about the reasons for dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 actions, other than that the orders were entered pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 251. Given the state of the records in these cases, as well as the wide range of circumstances that could logically result in a dismissal under this rule, we conclude that it would be inappropriate to preclude the plaintiffs from taking advantage of \u00a7 52-592 and bringing their actions once again.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">As we have previously observed, \u201c[i]t cannot be said that a disciplinary dismissal that does not preclude a litigant from commencing another action on the same claim is wholly ineffective as a sanction, since additional legal fees and expenses must be incurred in doing so and the new suit must normally await the disposition of earlier cases.\u201d <em>Milgrim </em>v. <em>Deluca, </em>supra, 195. Further, \u201cdismissals for failure to prosecute are often entered routinely at annual docket clearing proceedings conducted by the court suo motu when the only notice sent prior to entry of such a judgment is a list of numerous cases assigned because certain time frames have been exceeded.\u201d Id., 198. \u201cUnder \u00a7 251, the trial court is confronted with endless gradations of diligence, and in its sound discretion, the court must determine whether the party\u2019s diligence falls within the \u2018reasonable\u2019 section of the diligence spectrum.\u201d <em>Jaconski </em>v. <em>AMF, Inc., </em>208 Conn. 230, 234, 543 A.2d 728 (1988). In the cases before us, the plaintiffs\u2019 diligence presumably did not fall within the \u201creasonable\u201d section of the spectrum contemplated by \u00a7 251. We conclude that that fact alone, however, is not sufficient to overcome the broad, remedial provisions of the accidental failure of suit statute. We hold, therefore, that the trial court correctly determined that in these cases, the prior dismissals of the plaintiffs\u2019 actions, entered pursuant to \u00a7 251, constituted failures \u201cfor any matter of form.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The commissioner also claims that the decision of the trial court may also be affirmed on the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 actions were not \u201ccommenced\u201d within the one year time frame specified in \u00a7 52-592. The commissioner acknowledges that in both cases the plaintiffs\u2019 writ, summons and complaint were delivered to a sheriff and subsequently served upon him within the time period authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 52-593a, \u201cwithin fifteen days of the delivery\u201d of the writ to a proper officer. The commissioner argues, nevertheless, that because in Connecticut an action is not \u201ccommenced\u201d until process is actually served upon the defendant; <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Jackman, </em>167 Conn. 96, 99, 355 A.2d 234 (1974); <em>Spalding </em>v. <em>Butts, </em>6 Conn. 28, 30 (1825); and because \u00a7 52-592 utilizes the term \u201ccommence\u201d rather than the term \u201cbrought,\u201d which is found in \u00a7 52-593a, the plaintiffs\u2019 actions were barred, service not having been made until one year and one day after the June 19,1987 dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 prior actions. When this claim was presented to the trial court, it concluded merely that the \u201caction[s] [were] begun within the statutory time. Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 52-593a; 52-592.\u201d We agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Initially, the commissioner\u2019s reliance upon <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Jackman, </em>supra, and <em>Spalding </em>v. <em>Butts, </em>supra, is misplaced. This court, in <em>Broderick, </em>cited <em>Consolidated Motor Lines, Inc. v. M &amp; M Transportation Co., </em>128 Conn. 107, 109, 20 A.2d 621 (1941), which interpreted <em>Spalding </em>to have held that \u201cthe time when the action is regarded as having been <em>brought </em>is the date of service of the writ upon the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Consolidated Motor Lines, Inc. v. M &amp; M Transportation Co., </em>supra; <em>see also Seaboard Burner Corporation </em>v. <em>DeLong, </em>145 Conn. 300, 303, 141 A.2d 642 (1958). Thus, for almost one half century this court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>seen no distinction between \u201ccommencing\u201d and \u201cbringing\u201d an action. We see no reason to make one now. Additionally, the commissioner has presented us with no logical reason why the legislature would choose to preclude the application of \u00a7 52-593a by resorting to whatever grammatical distinction might exist between the terms \u201ccommence\u201d and \u201cbrought,\u201d when those terms have been used interchangeably to describe the initiation of an action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">There is error on each appeal, the judgments are set aside and the cases are remanded with direction to deny the motions to dismiss and for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-592 (a) provides in part: \u201cIf any action, commenced within the time limited by law, has failed one or more times to be tried on its merits because of insufficient service or return of the writ due to unavoidable accident or the default or neglect of the officer to whom it was committed, or because the action has been dismissed for want of jurisdiction, or the action has been otherwise avoided or defeated by the death of a party or for any matter of form; or if, in any such action after a verdict for the plaintiff, the judgment has been set aside, or if a judgment of nonsuit has been rendered or a judgment for the plaintiff reversed, the plaintiff, or, if the plaintiff is dead and the action by law survives, his executor or administrator, may commence a new action, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, for the same cause at any time within one year after the determination of the original action or after the reversal of the judgment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b483-12\"> Practice Book \u00a7 251 provides in part: \u201cIf a party shall fail to prosecute an action with reasonable diligence, the court may, after hearing, on motion by any party to the action pursuant to Sec. 196, or on its own motion, ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>der a judgment dismissing the action with costs.

See Practice Book \u00a7 4013 (a) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b487-7\"> In <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Angliker, </em>211 Conn. 370, 559 A.2d 701 (1989), this court held that the state\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity in a suit pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-51q for a wrongful discharge claimed to have been motivated by the plaintiff\u2019s exercise of his constitutional right of free speech did not entitle the plaintiff to a jury trial, whether or not actions for wrongful discharge may have been triable to a jury in this state prior to the adoption of our state constitution in 1818. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-215. The court in <em>Skinner </em>treated the state differently from other litigants with respect to actions triable to a jury not simply because of its sovereign status but because \u201c[n]o principle of common law, prior to 1818, <em>allowed actions against the state </em>for wrongful discharge or related claims.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 377. The plaintiff's action did not, therefore, fall within the class of actions triable to a jury prior to 1818.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b490-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-592 (a) specifically provides that its provisions are available when the prior action was \u201cavoided or defeated ... for any matter of form\u201d or when \u201ca judgment of nonsuit has been rendered\u201d in the prior action. Thus, while all judgments of nonsuit are included within the scope of \u00a7 52-592, the proper inquiry is not whether the use of the term \u201cdismissal\u201d rather than \u201cnonsuit\u201d in Practice Book \u00a7 251 is particularly significant, but, rather, whether a \u201cdismissal\u201d entered pursuant to \u00a7 251 results in the prior action having been \u201cavoided or defeated . . . for any matter of form.\u201d We note also that \u00a7 52-592 (a), is expressly made available to a plaintiff whose prior action was <em>\u201cdismissed </em>for want of jurisdiction.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b494-13\"> Compare General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-575 (\u201ccommenced\u201d and \u201cbring\u201d), 52-575a (\u201cbrought\u201d and \u201ccommenced\u201d), 52-576 (\u201cbrought\u201d), 52-577 (\u201cbrought\u201d), 52-577a (\u201cbrought\u201d), 52-577b (\u201ccommenced\u201d), 52-577c (\u201cbrought\u201d), 52-577d (\u201cbrought\u201d), 52-578 (\u201cbrought\u201d), 52-579 (\u201cbrought\u201d), 52-581 (\u201cbrought\u201d), 52-582 (\u201cbrought\u201d), 52-583 (\u201cbrought\u201d), 52-584 (\u201cbrought\u201d), 52-584a (\u201cbrought\u201d), 52-584b (\u201cbrought\u201d), 52-585 (\u201cbrought\u201d), 52-586 (\u201cbrought\u201d), 52-587 (\u201cbrought\u201d), 52-588 (\u201cbrought\u201d), 52-589 (\u201cbrought\u201d), 52-591 (\u201cbringing\u201d and \u201ccommence\u201d), 52-592 (\u201cbringing,\u201d \u201cbrought\u201d and \u201ccommence\u201d), 52r593 (\u201cbring\u201d), 52-593a (\u201cbrought\u201d), 52-594 (\u201cinstitute\u201d), 52-596 (\u201cbrought\u201d), and 52-597 (\u201cbrought\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
