J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACu\">In order to finance the expenses of the department of public utility control and the office of consumer counsel, General Statutes \u00a7 16-49 (b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> autho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>rizes an assessment of cable television companies based on their taxable gross revenues. The plaintiff, Eastern Connecticut Cable Television, Inc., initiated administrative proceedings objecting to the manner in which the named defendant calculated the gross revenues on which its assessments were based. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant issued a decision refusing to rule on the merits of the plaintiffs objection. The plaintiffs subsequent administrative appeal to the trial court was dismissed on the ground that the defendant\u2019s decision was not a final judgment. The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal here pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The following facts underlie the defendant\u2019s administrative ruling. The plaintiff, as a community antenna television company within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 16-1 (14),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is subject to assessments pursuant to \u00a7 16-49 (b). In calculating the gross revenues that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>the basis for the plaintiff\u2019s assessments, the defendant has included the revenues generated by a separate corporation, Home Theater, T.V., Inc. (Home Theater), as well as those generated by the plaintiff itself. The plaintiff provides basic cable services for its customers, while Home Theater leases cable channels from the plaintiff in order to provide premium services for cable viewers. Like the defendant, the department of revenue services has calculated the plaintiff\u2019s gross revenues by treating the plaintiff and Home Theater as a single entity. The plaintiff filed a tax appeal challenging the department of revenue services\u2019 assessment, and subsequently initiated the present administrative proceeding for review of the propriety of the assessments imposed by the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 16-49 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In its challenge to the assessments under \u00a7 16-49 (b), the plaintiff claimed that inclusion of the gross revenues of Home Theater made its assessments excessive, erroneous and unlawful. It asked the defendant to find that Home Theater is an independent entity, separate and distinct from the plaintiff, and that it is not a \u201cpublic service company\u201d under \u00a7 16-1 (4). The plaintiff further requested the defendant, as the agency responsible for the administration of \u00a7 16-49 (b), to rule that the plaintiff\u2019s relationship with Home Theater did not warrant assessing these two corporations as a single entity, despite the fact that the relationship was also an issue in the as yet unresolved tax appeal. At no time was Home Theater notified of, represented in, or made a party to, these proceedings. Subsequent to the hearing concerning the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s assessment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>in accordance with a stipulation to which it had agreed at the hearing, the plaintiff paid the contested charges in full, under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In its decision, the defendant declined to rule on the merits of the plaintiffs claims. First, the defendant declared that it would not rule \u201cat this time\u201d on the proper definition of \u201cgross revenues\u201d because the department of revenue services \u201cis the primary agency responsible for the assessment and collection of the tax on the gross revenues of a CATV system . . . [and] has not yet issued a ruling on the tax appeal filed by [the plaintiff].\u201d Second, the defendant held that Home Theater was a necessary party in whose absence the defendant was \u201cincapable of addressing the rulings sought [by the plaintiff.\u201d The defendant\u2019denominated these conclusions as its \u201cdecision\u201d in Docket No. 87-09-21 and terminated the proceedings without retaining jurisdiction or ordering any form of remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The plaintiff filed a timely administrative appeal from this decision. It maintained that it was entitled to a ruling on the merits from the defendant and that Home Theater was not a necessary party to such a ruling. The trial court, however, dismissed the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction after concluding that the decision rendered by the defendant was not a final decision. The plaintiff has appealed the dismissal of its administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The question of whether an administrative decision is a final judgment has never been an easy one to resolve. Most of our cases have arisen in the context of administrative rulings that, while resolving some issues, have left other matters as yet undetermined. In these cases, the dispositive question is whether the interlocutory order \u201cso concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number><em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control, </em>202 Conn. 405, 409-10, 521 A.2d 566 (1987). Sometimes the administrative agency has itself retained jurisdiction pending the outcome of a remand; <em>Szudora </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>214 Conn. 552, 555, 573 A.2d 1 (1990); <em>Matey </em>v. <em>Estate of Dember, </em>210 Conn. 626, 629-30, 556 A.2d 599 (1989); <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>202 Conn. 150, 156-57, 520 A.2d 186 (1987); while at other times the trial court has issued an interlocutory ruling remanding the case for further administrative action. <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control, </em>supra, 410; <em>Burdick </em>v. <em>United States Finishing Co., </em>128 Conn. 284, 288-89, 22 A.2d 629 (1941). These cases stand for the proposition that there is no final judgment if the administrative record is incomplete because a remand requires further evidentiary determinations that are not merely ministerial. See C. Tait, Connecticut Appellate Practice and Procedure (1989) \u00a7 2.23 (a), pp. 89-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">This case is different because the defendant has reached an administrative decision, without retaining jurisdiction for further administrative proceedings, that puts the plaintiff \u201cout of court\u201d without any substantive disposition of any aspect of the merits of its challenge to the \u00a7 16-49 (b) assessments. Although the plaintiff presumably may reinitiate an administrative proceeding at some time in the future when its disagreement with the department of revenue services is resolved, it may continue to be confronted with the defendant\u2019s conclusion that Home Theater is a necessary party.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the plaintiff is presently at risk of paying overassessments; at oral argument, the defendant did not Contest the plaintiff\u2019s assertion that any future return of overpayments would not allow recoupment of interest for the interim.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>These legal and economic factors demonstrate that the plaintiff is aggrieved because it faces the risk of irreparable harm from the indefinite deferral of its administrative grievance. Cf. <em>Abney </em>v. <em>United States, </em>431 U.S. 651, 658-59, 97 S. Ct. 2034, 52 L. Ed. 2d 651 (1977); <em>Zoning Board of Appeals </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>198 Conn. 498, 501, 503 A.2d 1161 (1986). In form and in reality, the defendant\u2019s decision falls within the alternate branch of <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 31, which permits the immediate appeal of an interlocutory ruling \u201cwhere the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding . . . . \u201d See, e.g., <em>Wardell </em>v. <em>Kittingly, </em>96 Conn. 718, 722, 115 A. 539 (1921) (denial of mandamus is a final judgment). As we held in <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>New Haven Police Union Local 530, </em>210 Conn. 597, 606, 557 A.2d 506 (1989), \u201c[s]o long as the agency intends to render a final decision and the person taking the appeal is aggrieved by the decision rendered, the fact that other related issues are reserved for later adjudication does not necessarily detract from its finality.\u201d We conclude, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s decision not to afford the plaintiff any administrative relief at this time is a final judgment. See <em>Port of Boston Marine Terminal Assn. </em>v. <em>Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, </em>400 U.S. 62, 71, 91 S. Ct. 203, 27 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1970); <em>Sierra Club </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>828 F.2d 783, 793 (D.C. Cir. 1987); <em>Laborer\u2019s International Union of North America, Local 1280 </em>v. <em>State Labor Relations Board, </em>154 Ill. App. 3d 1045, 1053-54, 507 N.E.2d 1200 (1987); <em>Human Rights Party </em>v. <em>Michigan Corrections Commission, </em>76 Mich. App. 204, 209-10, 256 N.W.2d 439 (1977); <em>State Board of Medical Examiners </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>67 N.J. Super. 199, 204-205, 170 A.2d 467 (1961); <em>Bock </em>v. <em>State Board of Pilotage Commissioners, </em>91 Wash. 2d 94, 97-99, 586 P.2d 1173 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Our conclusion that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff\u2019s appeal requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>a remand for a judicial inquiry into the merits of the appeal. The plaintiff is entitled to a plenary administrative review, at the trial level, of the various grounds upon which the defendant refused its request for recalculation of its \u00a7 16-49 (b) assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for farther proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 16-49 (b) currently provides in relevant part: \u201cFor each fiscal year, each public service company . . . shall pay the department of public utility control its share of all expenses of the department and the office of consumer counsel for the same fiscal year.
