Bergin, Jr. Bergin was the mayor of Waterbury from January, 1976, until December 31,1985. After his arrest on a warrant, the defendant requested an evidentiary hearing pursuant to <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S. Ct. 2674, 57 L. Ed. 2d 667 (1978). The trial court determined, on the basis of affidavits and an oral offer of proof, that the defendant was entitled to a full <em>Franks </em>hearing. After the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>hearing, the court ruled that the defendant had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the \u201caffiant deliberately omitted evidence and testimony from the warrant affidavit that is material to the finding of probable cause.\u201d It then found that had the omitted facts been included in the arrest warrant affidavit, probable cause to arrest the defendant would not have existed. The court thereupon granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss concluding that the affiant\u2019s omission of material information from the warrant affidavit constituted \u201cdefects inherent in the initiation of the prosecution\u201d that, if left unremedied, threatened the \u201cintegrity of the judicial system.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See Practice Book \u00a7 815 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The state promptly requested permission to appeal the dismissal, which request the trial court denied. Subsequently, the Appellate Court granted the state\u2019s motion for review of the trial court\u2019s denial and thereafter granted the state permission to appeal the dismissal. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, we transferred this appeal to ourselves. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">On appeal the state claims that the trial court erred when it: (1) granted the defendant a <em>Franks </em>hearing; (2) ruled that if the omitted facts were included in the arrest warrant affidavit, there was no probable cause for the defendant\u2019s arrest; (3) limited the dates on which the state could attempt to prove the defendant received the money he allegedly obtained as a bribe and, subsequently, struck the state\u2019s information amending the date of the alleged offense; and (4) dismissed the charge against the defendant. The defendant argues that this court lacks jurisdiction. We must, therefore, address that question before we reach the merits of the state\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The defendant contends that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the state\u2019s appeal and therefore urges us to reverse the Appellate Court\u2019s decision granting the state permission to appeal. The defendant asserts two bases for his claim. First, he argues that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the state permission to appeal because (1) both parties submitted briefs to the trial court addressing the issue, and (2) the trial court issued a four page memorandum of decision articulating its \u201cconsidered reasons\u201d for denying the state\u2019s motion. See <em>State v. S &amp; R Sanitation Services, Inc., </em>202 Conn. 300, 311, 521 A.2d 1017 (1987). Second, he asserts that the state is now raising issues that were not raised in its memorandum seeking permission to appeal. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">As a general proposition General Statutes \u00a7 54-96 authorizes the state to appeal questions of law in a criminal case only if the trial court grants permission to appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 54-96, however, does not preclude an appeal by the state when the \u201cdenial was so arbitrary as to constitute an extreme abuse of discretion rendering the denial ineffective. In such cases the statute\u2019s condition requiring the court\u2019s permission to appeal cannot serve to insulate a trial court from review by this court; rather, the statute as a whole remains operative to allow appeal by the state.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>174 Conn. 100, 110, 384 A.2d 315 (1977). Although we accord great deference to the trial court\u2019s discretionary rulings on these matters, that does not mean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>that its decision is shielded from our scrutiny. <em>State </em>v. <em>S &amp; R Sanitation Services, Inc., </em>supra, 312. Section 54-96 does not deprive this court of jurisdiction simply because the trial court gave \u201cconsidered reasons\u201d when it denied the state permission to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">In its memorandum of decision, the court set forth its reasons for refusing to grant the state permission to appeal. Its rationale, the trial court stated, was that the state was seeking to appeal questions of fact rather than questions of law. Since the state can appeal only questions of law, the court reasoned that it could not appeal the issues raised. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-96. The issues which the trial court, in its memorandum of decision, deemed factual were: (1) whether the date of the alleged bribe is a material element of the crime charged; (2) whether the alleged omissions from the arrest warrant affidavit were material to the crime of bribe receiving; and (3) whether probable cause existed if these omissions were included in the arrest warrant affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The underlying premise of the trial court\u2019s reasoning is unsound. The issues raised by the state are not purely factual but also involve questions of law that we have frequently reviewed on appeal. Our opinions provide abundant authority that all of the issues that the trial court deemed precluded from review present questions that we can and will consider. We have held that a judgment of dismissal with prejudice is an appealable issue within the provisions of \u00a7 54-96. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>189 Conn. 42, 51, 454 A.2d 266 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Audet, </em>170 Conn. 337, 341, 365 A.2d 1082 (1976). We also have often reviewed a trial court\u2019s probable cause determination; <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>213 Conn. 708, 717, 570 A.2d 174 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>McPhail, </em>213 Conn. 161, 168, 567 A.2d 812 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>204 Conn. 187, 205, 527 A.2d 1168, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 927, 108 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>293, 98 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1987); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>214 Conn. 132, 143, 570 A.2d 1125 (1990), <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting), and cases cited therein; <em>State </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>20 Conn. App. 321, 331, 566 A.2d 1363 (1989); and determined on appeal, whether the date of an alleged offense is a material element of the crime charged. <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>205 Conn. 528, 535, 534 A.2d 1159 (1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 988, 108 S. Ct. 1292, 99 L. Ed. 2d 502 (1988). Furthermore, whether an alleged omission in an arrest warrant affidavit is \u201cmaterial\u201d to the crime charged involves a mixed question of law and fact and is reviewable on appeal. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Condo, </em>782 F.2d 1502, 1506 (9th Cir. 1986); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ippolito, </em>774 F.2d 1482, 1484 (9th Cir. 1985).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In short, what the trial court labeled factual determinations are, under the governing precedents, appeal-able legal issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Those issues, moreover, are important both from a legal and public policy standpoint. Pretrial dismissal of criminal charges in any type of case is such a drastic remedy that it should not be resorted to lightly. Further, the appropriateness of the dismissal of bribery charges, a crime that involves a violation of the public\u2019s trust in our elected officials, would seem to be particularly deserving of a full review by an appellate court. We are not persuaded that the facts of this case warrant a different conclusion. Confidence in our judicial system would be severely eroded if the trial court had the authority to dismiss charges against this defendant before trial on an unsound premise, and could then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>insulate its decision from appellate review. This is especially true when the legislature has expressed its intent to prosecute such conduct; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>197 Conn. 436, 476, 497 A.2d 974 (1985); and when the issues raised by the state on appeal can be addressed without subjecting the defendant to a repeated determination of guilt or innocence. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>420 U.S. 332, 345, 95 S. Ct. 1013, 43 L. Ed. 2d 232 (1975), overruled on other grounds, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 98 S. Ct. 2187, 57 L. Ed. 2d 65 (1978) (\u201c[a] defendant has no legitimate claim to benefit from an error of law when that error could be corrected without subjecting him to a second trial before a second trier of fact\u201d). These considerations should not evaporate through the erroneous classification of appealable issues as factual rather than legal. We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the state permission to appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>supra, 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The defendant\u2019s second jurisdictional claim is wholly without merit. While the defendant correctly asserts that the state may appeal only those issues it has requested permission to raise; <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>194 Conn. 416, 419 n.5, 481 A.2d 56 (1984); the state fully set forth all of the issues in the current appeal in its memorandum of law in support of its motion for permission to appeal. In its memorandum, the state specifically raised the issue of whether a dismissal, based in large part upon an alleged <em>Franks </em>violation, was appropriate. We conclude that we have jurisdiction to decide the issues presented in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">On appeal, the state principally argues that the trial court erred when it dismissed the charge against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>defendant. Before we can fully consider this argument, however, we need to address the state\u2019s subordinate claims of error. The state asserts that the underlying error in this case, which led to the eventual dismissal of the bribery charge against the defendant, occurred when the trial court granted the defendant an evidentiary hearing pursuant to <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>supra, on the basis of its conclusion that time was a material element of the offense of bribe receiving. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The following facts are pertinent to this claim. The arrest warrant affidavit alleges that, during the defendant\u2019s tenure as the mayor of Waterbury, he had the ultimate authority to determine who would be granted the right to tow for the city. In 1985, Christopher Hill, while working at a family-owned business, Executive Auto Towing and Sales (Executive Auto Towing), was contacted by Thomas Gahan, an aide to the mayor. As a result of a conversation with Gahan, Christopher Hill believed that if Executive Auto Towing wished to continue to tow for the city, the Hills would be required to make a \u201ccontribution.\u201d On June 14,1985, Thomas A. Hill, Jr., president of Executive Auto Towing, cashed a check for $3000. He placed the cash in an envelope and gave it to Gahan that day. Thomas Hill believed that the money was a donation to the Democratic Party that was required if his company wanted to tow for the city. Gahan confirmed that the defendant sent him to Executive Auto Towing sometime in June, 1985, to pick up a \u201cdonation.\u201d Gahan stated that Hill gave him the envelope and \u201che then turned over the envelope\u201d to the mayor on a date not specified, and \u201ctold the Mayor, T picked this up from the Hills.\u2019 \u201d The cash \u201ccontribution\u201d never appeared on the financial records of either the Waterbury Democratic Town Committee or the Committee to Re-elect Mayor Bergin. The warrant affidavit did not allege a date when the defendant actually received the envelope.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>The defendant filed a motion for a bill of particulars on April 25,1988. In response, the state filed a bill of particulars in which it alleged that the defendant, through Gahan, had received a bribe in consideration for his decision to grant Executive Auto Towing the towing contract for the city of Waterbury. The state further alleged that \u201cthe defendant committed such crime on or about June 14,1985.\u201d Unsatisfied with this response, the defendant sought a court ruling to limit the date of the alleged offense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The state objected, arguing that the bill of particulars was sufficient and that the state was not required to be more specific about the date. Despite the state\u2019s objection, the defendant renewed his request for a specific date. On the third such occasion, the trial court ruled that \u201con or about June 14,1985,\u201d meant that the defendant received the money on \u201cJune 14,15,16 or 17,1985.\u201d Immediately thereafter the defendant disclosed that he had been in Anchorage, Alaska, from June 13 to June 19,1985, and that the state knew this, but nevertheless had failed to disclose it in the arrest warrant affidavit. On the basis of this alleged omission from the arrest warrant affidavit, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a full <em>Franks </em>hearing because it concluded that the defendant had made a \u201csubstantial preliminary showing of a material omission by the fact that the defendant was in Anchorage, Alaska from June 13, 1985 to June 19, 1985.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On appeal, the state challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling: (1) that the date of the offense was a material element of the charge of bribe receiving; and (2) that the defendant was therefore entitled to a hearing pursuant to <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>When reviewing whether a <em>Franks </em>hearing is warranted, we recognize that there is a \u201clongstanding rule that there is an underlying presumption of validity with respect to the affidavit supporting a warrant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>195 Conn. 444, 457, 488 A.2d 812, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 833, 106 S. Ct. 103, 88 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1985). In order for a defendant to challenge the truthfulness of an affidavit underlying a warrant<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> at a <em>Franks </em>hearing, he must: (1) make a \u201csubstantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit\u201d; and (2) show that the allegedly false statement is necessary to a finding of probable cause. <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>supra, 155-56. If the allegedly false statement is set aside, however, and there remains sufficient evidence to establish probable cause, a <em>Franks </em>hearing is not necessary. Id., 171-72. Although the <em>Franks </em>decision referred only to false statements in the affidavit, we have held that \u201cmaterial omissions from such an affidavit also fall within the rule . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 238, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Not all omissions, however, even if intentional, will invalidate an affidavit. <em>People </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>105 Ill. 2d 22, 43, 473 N.E.2d 840 (1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1131, 105 S. Ct. 2666, 86 L. Ed. 2d 283 (1985). In fact, an affiant may omit facts that he believes to be either immaterial or unsubstantiated. Id. Thus, before a defendant is entitled to a <em>Franks </em>hearing for an alleged omission, he must make a substantial preliminary show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>ing that the information was (1) omitted with the intent to make, or in reckless disregard of whether it made, the affidavit misleading to the issuing judge, and (2) material to the determination of probable cause. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reivich, </em>793 F.2d 957, 961 (8th Cir. 1986); <em>People </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>supra, 44. Even if the affiant \u201cpicks and chooses\u201d the information that he includes in the affidavit, there is no <em>Franks </em>violation if, had the magistrate been so advised, he still would have been justified in issuing the warrant. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mankani, </em>738 F.2d 538, 546 (2d Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">We note initially that the arrest warrant affidavit did not specify the date the defendant received the envelope from Gahan. The affidavit alleges that Thomas A. Hill, Jr., \u201cput $3,000 cash into an envelope, and gave the envelope to Thomas Gahan at Executive Auto Sales on June 14,1985.\u201d It further alleges that Gahan \u201cthen turned over the envelope he received from the Hills to the Mayor (Edward D. Bergin) and told the Mayor, T picked this up from the Hills.\u2019 \u201d The fact that the trial court ruled, six months <em>after </em>the affiant completed the affidavit, that \u201con or about June 14,1985,\u201d meant that the defendant received the money from Gahan on \u201cJune 14, 15, 16 or 17, 1985,\u201d is totally irrelevant to our determination of whether, at the time the affiant completed the affidavit, he intentionally or recklessly omitted material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The trial court nonetheless concluded that the defendant was entitled to a <em>Franks </em>hearing because the affiant had not mentioned the d\u00e9fendant\u2019s Alaska trip in the affidavit. This omission would be material to the finding of probable cause only if the date the defendant received the money from Gahan is a material element of the crime of bribe receiving. \u201c \u2018[W]here time is not of the essence or gist of the offense, the precise time at which it is charged to have been committed is not material.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Hauck, </em>172 Conn. 140, 150, 374 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>A.2d 150 (1976).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Laracuente, </em>205 Conn. 515, 519, 534 A.2d 882 (1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1036, 108 S. Ct. 1598, 99 L. Ed. 2d 913 (1988). A public servant can be convicted of bribe receiving if \u201che <em>solicits, </em>accepts or <em>agrees to accept </em>from another any benefit for, because of, or as consideration for his decision, opinion, recommendation or vote.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-148. The clear language of the statute supports a conclusion that the date the defendant received the cash is not a material element. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tunnell, </em>667 F.2d 1182, 1186 (5th Cir. 1982); <em>People </em>v. <em>Lyon, </em>135 Cal. App. 2d 558, 577, 288 P.2d 57 (1955) (\u201c[t]he fact that there was a delay in payment, or that payment was to be made in the future, is not necessarily material to the issues\u201d). Indeed, the defendant might be convicted under the statute without ever having received the money. It is sufficient for the state to prove that the defendant \u201csolicits\u201d or \u201cagrees to accept\u201d any benefit in consideration for his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Since the affidavit did not attempt to specify the exact date Gahan gave the money to the defendant, and the date the defendant received the money is not a material element of the crime of bribe receiving, the fact that the affiant omitted the information that the defendant had been in Alaska from June 13 to 19,1985, is immaterial to the probable cause determination. Because the information is immaterial, it is of no moment that the affiant failed to include it in the arrest warrant affidavit. Consequently, the defendant failed to make a \u201csubstantial preliminary showing\u201d that: (1) the affiant omitted the information that the defendant was in Alaska from the affidavit with the intent to mislead the judge who signed the warrant; or (2) the information omitted was material to the probable cause determination, and when included, would have defeated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>probable cause to arrest. The trial court, therefore, was not required to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for a full evidentiary hearing pursuant to <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Although the trial court was not obligated to conduct <em>a Franks </em>hearing, we will review its findings on appeal because of their impact on the trial court\u2019s ultimate decision to dismiss the information. In its memorandum of decision dismissing the information, the trial court found that the affiant had deliberately omitted certain material facts from the arrest warrant affidavit. It opined that the affiant had intentionally failed to include, but should have included, the following information: \u201c(1) That the defendant was in Alaska from June 13,1985, to June 20,1985. (2) That Gahan, in the statement he gave on January 5, 1988, when he was asked whether he had any knowledge of any of the Hills making cash contributions in order to obtain city towing between 1981 and 1985 inclusive, answered \u2018No.\u2019 (3) That Gahan, also in his statement of January 5, 1988, indicated that he and the defendant had prior conversations which characterized the award of towing contracts as patronage to loyal party workers or contributors and not the reverse (i.e., that the contributions were made for the purpose of obtaining a contract). (4) Gahan, in his February 17, 1985 statement, when asked whether he was aware if the defendant was receiving any envelopes, monies or contributions from the Hills in exchange for the City towing in Waterbury, answered, \u2018Not personally, no.\u2019 (5) None of the Hills implicate the defendant in the alleged bribe. (6) None of the Hills claim either that they met with the defendant or had contact with him in any way. (7) Several members of the Hill family indicated that they are loyal party workers; that any money paid by them was strictly campaign contributions and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>intended as an exchange for towing rights or for any other decision or consideration.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">On appeal we are obligated to accept the validity of the trial court\u2019s factual finding that the affiant intentionally omitted the above cited information. General Statutes \u00a7 54-96. We may, however, review whether the omissions, accepted as true, are material to probable cause.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dozier, </em>844 F.2d 701, 705 (9th Cir. 1988); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Page, </em>808 F.2d 723, 729 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 482 U.S. 918, 107 S. Ct. 3195, 96 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">We have examined the record and the transcripts of the testimony and conclude that the \u201comissions\u201d cited by the trial court are not material and, even if they had been included in the affidavit, would not defeat probable cause. First and foremost, time is not a material element of the charge of bribe receiving. In addition, the second and fourth omissions, taken in the context in which they were made, do not alter the substance of Gahan\u2019s statements as recited in the affidavit. As to the fifth and sixth omissions, an examination of the affidavit reveals that the affiant never attempted to imply that the Hills were in contact with the defendant. The facts set forth in the affidavit properly suggest only that Gahan was acting as an agent of the defendant. As to the last omission, a defendant can properly be convicted of bribe receiving \u201ceven though the result sought by the bribe-giver was in fact lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>and proper . . . .\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>629 F. Sup. 283, 294 (E.D.N.Y.), aff\u2019d, 798 F.2d 581 (2d Cir. 1986); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Traitz, </em>871 F.2d 368, 386 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, U.S. , 110 S. Ct. 78,107 L. Ed. 2d 44 (1989). As to the third omission, how the defendant and Gahan characterized the award of towing contracts is not significant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Foord, </em>142 Conn. 285, 289, 113 A.2d 591 (1955). The underlying facts might support an inference that the defendant received a bribe regardless of whether the parties themselves characterized the payments as \u201cpolitical contributions.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barna, </em>442 F. Sup. 1232, 1236 (M.D. Pa. 1978), aff\u2019d without opinion, 578 F.2d 1376 (3d Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 862, 99 S. Ct. 184, 58 L. Ed. 2d 172 (1978). Whether the defendant received a bribe or whether the monies were collected for a lawful purpose is a question of fact that should be left to the factfinder at a trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schwartz, </em>178 Pa. Super. 434, 439, 115 A.2d 826 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">In summary, there can be no <em>Franks </em>violation when the omissions, if included in the arrest warrant affidavit, would not defeat probable cause. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reivich, </em>supra, 962; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Condo, </em>supra, 1506-1507; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>549 F.2d 557, 561 (8th Cir. 1977). With these underlying issues resolved, we may now address the state\u2019s claim that the trial court erred when it dismissed the charge against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">In its memorandum of decision granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the trial court was offended by what it characterized as the affiant\u2019s attempt to subvert the neutrality and impartiality of the issuing magistrate by providing him with \u201ca less than complete rendition of the material facts.\u201d Because of the affiant\u2019s \u201cintentional and deliberate omissions which bypassed the neutral and independent role of the issu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>ing judge,\u201d the trial court believed that the integrity of the judicial system was threatened. Consequently, it dismissed the information pursuant to \u201cthe inherent supervisory power of [the trial] court, and under Practice Book Section 815 (1).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Dismissal of an information is a drastic action that is appropriate in cases where \u201cthere was a need either to eliminate prejudice to a defendant in a criminal prosecution, where it was impossible to do so by imposition of lesser sanctions, or to deter a pattern of demonstrated and longstanding widespread or continuous official misconduct.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Broward, </em>594 F.2d 345, 351 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 941, 99 S. Ct. 2882, 61 L. Ed. 2d 310 (1979); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fields, </em>592 F.2d 638, 647 (2d Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 917, 99 S. Ct. 2838, 61 L. Ed. 2d 284 (1979). The defendant relies upon his perception of governmental misconduct in this case to justify his position that the trial court\u2019s dismissal was correct. In contrast, the state simply contends, inter alia, that there was no governmental misconduct for the trial court to supervise.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In light of our holding that (1) the <em>Franks </em>hearing was improvidently granted, and (2) that this record does not support a conclusion of <em>a Franks </em>violation, we find no basis for the trial court to have dismissed the charges against the defendant. If the omissions do not amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>to a <em>Franks </em>violation, it is hard to conceive how their omission from the affidavit can be considered such egregious conduct by the affiant as to warrant the extreme sanction of dismissal. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the defendant suffered any prejudice because of misconduct by government officials. We therefore conclude that the trial court abused its discretion and erred when it determined that the bribe receiving charge pending against the defendant be dismissed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>213 Conn. 708, 723, 570 A.2d 174 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>204 Conn. 187, 205-206, 527 A.2d 1168 (1987). The trial court\u2019s action in dismissing the charge is reversed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The state\u2019s final claim concerns the appropriateness of the trial court\u2019s ruling to strike the state\u2019s amended information. Most of the facts relating to this claim have been set forth in Part II of this opinion. In addition, the following facts are relevant. On November 14, 1988, after the trial court had limited the dates on which the state could prove that the defendant received the money, the state filed an amended information and bill of particulars alleging that \u201cthe defendant committed such crime on or about the month of June, 1985, or sometime thereafter, but before January 1,1986.\u201d The trial court struck the amended information and bill of particulars. On appeal, the state argues that the trial court erred when it (1) ruled that the state must prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>the defendant received the proceeds of the bribe on June 14, 15, 16 or 17 exclusively, and (2) struck the state\u2019s amended information. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">A criminal defendant has a constitutional right to be informed of the \u201cnature and cause of the charges against him with sufficient precision to enable him to meet them at trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Laracuente, supra, 518; U.S. Const., amend. VI; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8. This requirement, however, does not obligate the state to provide the defendant with a specific date of the alleged offense, when time is not a material element of the crime charged or when a precise date is unavailable. \u201cWhere the [information] alleges that an offense allegedly occurred \u2018on or about\u2019 a certain date, the defendant is deemed to be on notice that the charge is not limited to a specific date. . . . The courts agree that when the [information] uses the \u2018on or about\u2019 designation, proof of a date reasonably near to the specified date is sufficient. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Champion, </em>813 F.2d 1154, 1168 (11th Cir. 1987); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grapp, </em>653 F.2d 189, 195 (5th Cir. 1981).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leibowitz, </em>857 F.2d 373, 379 (7th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1088, 109 S. Ct. 1552, 103 L. Ed. 2d 855 (1989); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Cates, </em>202 Conn. 615, 626, 522 A.2d 788 (1987) (state need not prove that the crime charged occurred on the precise date alleged in the information). This is true even when the defendant asserts an alibi for the date of the alleged offense designated \u201con or about\u201d in the information. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leibowitz, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe purpose of the bill of particulars is to inform the defendant of the nature of the charges brought against him to adequately prepare his defense, to avoid surprise during the trial and to protect him against a second prosecution for an inadequately described offense.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>262 F. Sup. 305, 308 (S.D.N.Y. 1966). A bill of particulars should fulfill this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>function \u201cwhen the indictment itself is too vague and indefinite for such purposes.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>345 F.2d 111, 114 (6th Cir. 1965) . . . .\u2019 <em>[United States </em>v. <em>Addonizio, </em>451 F.2d 49, 63-64 (3d Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 936, 92 S. Ct. 949, 30 L. Ed. 2d 812 (1972)].\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Weingartner, </em>485 F. Sup. 1167, 1183-84 (D.N.J. 1979), appeal dismissed, 642 F.2d 445 (3d Cir. 1981). The state must inform the defendant, within reasonable limits, when the crime charged occurred. <em>State </em>v. <em>Laracuente, </em>supra, 519. The state is not obligated, however, to provide the defendant with a precise date when none is available. Id. We are mindful that the nature of the crime of bribery is such that it may be difficult for the state to respond to a motion for a bill of particulars with an exact date because the offense may occur subtly over a period of time. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Iacovelli, </em>9 Mass. App. 694, 698, 403 N.E.2d 1204 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The bill of particulars, in this case, alleging that the offense occurred on or about June 14, 1985, satisfied the requisite standards because it gave the defendant enough information to enable him to prepare his defense. Practice Book \u00a7 832; <em>Bruffet </em>v. <em>State, </em>205 Kan. 863, 864, 472 P.2d 206 (1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 1010, 91 S. Ct. 571, 27 L. Ed. 2d 624 (1971). The state was not required to specify a more precise date either of the commission of the offense or of the defendant\u2019s receipt of the money from Gahan. Because the bill of particulars limits the state to proving that the defendant committed the offense in substantially the manner described, we do not require the state to limit the date in the information more narrowly than the evidence available warrants, even if the defendant attempts to assert an alibi defense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasius, </em>211 Conn. 455, 461, 559 A.2d 1116 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Laracuente, </em>supra, 520. An alibi claim is a factual question that should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>left to the jury once all of the evidence has been presented. <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>205 Conn. 528, 535, 534 A.2d 1159 (1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 988,108 S. Ct. 1292, 99 L. Ed. 2d 502 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The defendant argues that he was prejudiced by the amended information, because the state did not object to the trial court\u2019s ruling restricting the dates that it could attempt to prove the defendant received the money, and in reliance upon the court\u2019s ruling, the defendant disclosed that he had been in Alaska in June, 1985. While the defendant is correct when he asserts that the state agreed that the court could reasonably have concluded that \u201con or about June 14, 1985,\u201d meant June 14,15,16 or 17, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the state agreed that the defendant actually received the money on those dates.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Faced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>with this ambiguity, we will not bind the state to an agreement it did not make. We hold that the trial court abused its discretion when it ordered the state to prove at trial that the defendant received the bribe proceeds on the dates specified by the defendant and the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>We turn therefore to the issue of whether the trial court erred when it struck the amended information alleging that the date the offense occurred was \u201con or about the month of June, 1985, or sometime thereafter, but before January 1,1986.\u201d This court has repeatedly recognized that the state may amend an information to correct the alleged time of the commission of the offense when time is not a material element of the crime charged. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>176 Conn. 275, 277, 407 A.2d 952 (1978). Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 623, it is within the trial court\u2019s discretion to strike an amended information <em>if </em>the substantive rights of the defendant would be prejudiced.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Here, the defendant has failed to show how he would be prejudiced by an amendment to the information at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>this stage of the proceedings. Since time is not a material element of the crime of bribe receiving, see Part II of this opinion, it is of no consequence when the defendant received the money. The trial court\u2019s sanction of the defendant\u2019s attempt to limit the date on which the defendant received the money cannot transform time into a material element of the crime charged. The facts alleged in the affidavit are sufficient to establish that Gahan, either wittingly or unwittingly, acted on behalf of the defendant. Thus, the defendant\u2019s absence from Connecticut in June is immaterial and his disclosure of that information is irrelevant. In this case the state has filed its amended information so far in advance of trial that it is impossible to discern how the defendant would be prejudiced at trial by the change. Absent some further showing that the substantive rights of the defendant would be prejudiced, the state was entitled to amend the information.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to reinstate the amended information containing the bribe receiving count against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">In this opinion Peters, C.

The state immediately attempted to rectify any misunderstanding that may have occurred by filing an amended information and bill of particulars. The defendant is not prejudiced when the state proves that the alleged offense occurred on a date other than that specified in the original information. <em>STate </em>v. <em>Cates, </em>202 Conn. 615, 626, 522 A.2d 788 (1987).

Any potential prejudice would be mitigated by the state\u2019s amended information, filed well in advance of trial, clarifying its position as to the date of the offense.

I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s disposition of the defendant\u2019s claim that this court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over this appeal. It is my opinion that this issue must be resolved in favor of the defendant because the trial court\u2019s order denying with prejudice the state\u2019s request to appeal is governed by the majority decision in <em>State v. S &amp; R Sanitation Services, Inc., </em>202 Conn. 300, 521 A.2d 1017 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The record before us clearly requires that we examine the threshold question of our jurisdiction to entertain this appeal and to dismiss it if we lack subject matter jurisdiction. Id., 301-302 n.2; <em>State </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>166 Conn. 642, 644, 353 A.2d 706 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-96 provides that the state \u201cmay\u201d appeal \u201call questions of law\u201d in a criminal case \u201cwith the permission of the presiding judge.\u201d It bears repeating that \u201c[t]he statutory language unmistakably confers upon the trial court the choice of granting or withholding the appeal privilege depending upon the circumstances of each case. It is apparent from the permissive language of the statute that the legislature did not intend that permission to appeal be granted in every case in which it is sought.\u201d <em>State v. S &amp; R Sanitation Services, Inc., </em>supra, 308. \u201c[A]s the dominant intention of the legislature [in enacting \u00a7 54-96] was to extend the right of appeal to the state, the limitation [of requiring permission of the presiding judge] placed upon that right is one which must be so exercised as to avoid abuse and unreasonable consequences.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>174 Conn. 100, 110, 384 A.2d 315 (1977). This is so because, without the granting of the requisite permission by the presiding judge, there is no viable appeal unless the court\u2019s denial of permission is \u201c \u2018so unreasonable as to constitute an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d Id.; see <em>State v. S &amp; R Sanitation Services, Inc., </em>supra. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>There can be no question but that this court has the general supervisory power to protect its jurisdiction to hear appeals and that this power cannot be defeated by the arbitrary action of a trial court. <em>State v. S &amp; R Sanitation Services, Inc., </em>supra, 309-10. As in <em>S &amp; R Sanitation Services, Inc., </em>the jurisdictional predicate for this appeal under \u00a7 54-96 exists only if the trial court abused its discretion in denying the state\u2019s motion for permission to appeal. Id., 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">In setting out its version of the trial court\u2019s \u201crationale\u201d for denying the state permission to appeal, the majority states that that \u201crationale\u201d was \u201cthat the state was seeking to appeal questions of fact rather than questions of law.\u201d The majority maintains that \u201c[t]he underlying premise of the trial court\u2019s reasoning is unsound\u201d because \u201c[t]he issues raised by the state are not purely factual but also involve questions of law.\u201d The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision in which it denied the state\u2019s request for permission to appeal acknowledged that the provisions of \u00a7 54-96 allowed the state to appeal \u201cupon all questions of law\u201d with permission. The trial court pointed out that in the \u201cextensive memorandum\u201d filed by the state in support of that request, \u201cthe State has based the substance of its attack on <em>the factual </em>findings made by this Court.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.) It then observed that the state contested the following: \u201c(1) This court\u2019s determination, in view of the facts surrounding the preparation of the affidavit and the procedural history, that the date of the alleged bribe is a material element under the facts of this case; (2) The finding by this court that omissions concerning the defendant\u2019s absence and omissions concerning the admissions of intent of certain interested persons were material to the question of bribe receiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>ing; (3) This court\u2019s finding that when the affidavit is reviewed with the omitted material inserted, that probable cause to believe the defendant received a bribe on or about June 14, 1985 is defeated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">It should not be overlooked that in its earlier twelve page memorandum granting the dismissal with prejudice the trial court found the \u201cdeliberate misrepresentations and reckless omissions on the part of the affiant to be the defects inherent in the initiation of the prosecution for which [Practice Book \u00a7] 815 (1) was designed.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court, invoking not only Practice Book \u00a7 815 (1) but also the inherent supervisory power of the court, found that the institution of the prosecution was defective and proceeded to enter the dismissal with prejudice. I do not read the majority opinion (1) as suggesting that \u00a7 815 (1) proscribes the dismissal of a prosecution \u201cprior to trial\u201d even where <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S. Ct. 2674, 57 L. Ed. 2d 667 (1978), is involved, or (2) that a trial court lacks, in a proper case, inherent supervisory power to dismiss a prosecution. I do want to be clear and point out that I fully agree that pretrial dismissal of charges is not a matter to be done lightly. By the same token, our practice does provide for such dismissals prior to trial in a proper case. See Practice Book \u00a7 815 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">The majority concludes that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the state permission to appeal. I do not agree. We have said that \u201c[discretion . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>imports something more than leeway in decision-making. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Battle, </em>170 Conn. 469, 365 A.2d 1100 [1976]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilligan, </em>92 Conn. 526, 103 A. 649 [1918]; McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7 190. \u2018 \u201cDiscretion means \u2018a legal discretion, to be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice. . . .\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Onofrio, </em>179 Conn. 23, 29, 425 A.2d 560 (1979). In <em>S &amp; R Sanitation Services, Inc., </em>we observed that \u201c[i]nherent in the concept of judicial discretion is the idea of choice and a determination between competing considerations. Discretion could generically be said to apply to issues which do not yield a fundamentally empirical yes or no answer. The very core consideration of choice in discretion logically means that neither party is absolutely entitled to have that discretion exercised in its favor.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>S &amp; R Sanitation Services, Inc., </em>supra, 311. Because discretion obviously involves some independence of judgment, there can be no hard and fast rule or absolute criterion governing it in all cases, because such a rule would be the end of discretion. See <em>Bringhurst </em>v. <em>Harkins, </em>32 Del. 324, 331, 122 A. 783 (1923). Discretion is, \u201cin a legal sense, abused when the court exceeds the bounds of reason, all the circumstances before it being considered. An exercise of discretion may be erroneous but still be legal and free from abuse.\u201d Id. In exercising discretion, however, the \u201cright to be wrong without incurring reversal\u201d is not absolute. M. Rosenberg, \u201cJudicial Discretion of the Trial Court, Viewed from Above,\u201d 22 Syracuse L. Rev. 635, 637 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">It is because of this leeway in deciding or this \u201csome independence of judgment\u201d in making decisions that permeates the exercise of discretion which has given rise to the presumption that \u201cthe unquestioned rule is that great weight is due to the action of the trial court and every reasonable presumption should be given in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>favor of its correctness; the ultimate issue is whether the court could reasonably conclude as it did . . . .\u201d <em>Jacobsen </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>177 Conn. 259, 263, 413 A.2d 854 (1979); <em>Rokus </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>191 Conn. 62, 72, 463 A.2d 252 (1983); W. Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 59. This \u201cgreat weight\u201d and \u201cevery reasonable presumption ... in favor of its correctness\u201d should be more than bland rhetoric. Moreover, an appellate court determination of whether a trial court has abused its discretion does not, and should not, depend upon whether it would have reached the same conclusion. <em>State </em>v. <em>S &amp; R Sanitation Services, Inc., </em>supra, 311-12, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">In categorically denouncing as \u201cunsound\u201d the underlying premises of the trial court\u2019s reasoning, the majority is careful to say that \u201c[t]he issues <em>raised </em>by the state are not <em>purely factual </em>but also <em>involve questions of law. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) It goes on to say that our case law provides abundant authority that all of the issues that the trial court deemed were precluded from review present questions \u201cthat we can and will consider.\u201d This \u201cnot purely factual\u201d label, I view as a subliminal concession that perhaps the majority\u2019s broad brush in sweeping away the trial court\u2019s \u201cconsidered reasons\u201d for denying the right to appeal is not as unquestionable as one might first think. I understand that there is no litmus test that totally distinguishes those matters that are \u201cfactual\u201d from those that are \u201clegal\u201d or those that are of \u201cmixed law and fact.\u201d While at opposite ends of the spectrum, it is perhaps quite easy to separate issues of fact and law; the more difficult area is where facts and the application of a legal rule to facts tend to blend. This is where judging facts in terms of their legal consequences and applying law to facts approach a process of fusion where what is a question of law and what is a question of fact is provoca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>tively puzzling. This can be especially true here where fact-sensitive issues tend to predominate.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">No one can argue that there are cases when facts may assume infinite variety, yet applicable legal rules are stated in a fashion calling for the application of judgment. The abstract denomination of disputed issues as \u201cfactual,\u201d \u201clegal\u201d or \u201cmixed law and fact\u201d is not fairly dispositive of their amenability to appellate review where the type of issue it is may turn upon the application of legal criteria in determining whether a fact is material. Even if it were dispositive on an issue of abuse of discretion, the concept of choice inherent in discretion, the great weight deference, the every reasonable presumption of correctness and the like cannot be eliminated in arriving at a conclusion on the exercise of discretion. This is especially so when the issues are designated as issues of mixed law and fact. Judicial characterization of what constitutes issues of mixed law and fact has produced a source of disagreement even among members of the United States Supreme Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court has said: \u201cNor do we yet know of any other rule or principle that will unerringly distinguish a factual finding from a legal conclusion.\u201d <em>Pullman-Standard </em>v. <em>Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 288, 102 S. Ct. 1781, 72 L. Ed. 2d 66 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>It is because discretion is not governed by an absolute standard that the application upon review of all of the factors referred to above in evaluating its exercise leads me to disagree with the majority\u2019s resolution of the subject matter jurisdiction issue. The trial court in this case gave \u201cconsidered reasons\u201d for its denial of permission to appeal. In <em>S &amp; R Sanitation Services, Inc., </em>\u201cwe weigh[ed] heavily\u201d the fact that the trial court, unlike that in <em>Avcollie, </em>did give \u201cconsidered reasons.\u201d Each considered reason given here should likewise be weighed heavily. The first such reason given by the trial court and attacked by the state was its \u201cdetermination, in view of the facts surrounding the preparation of the affidavit . . . that the date of the alleged bribe is a material element under the facts of this case.\u201d The majority states this reason as \u201cwhether the date of the alleged bribe is a material element of the crime charged.\u201d I do not read this as stating what the trial court really meant. I agree that time is not an essential element of the crime charged. That is clearly not what the trial court meant; rather, it said that, in view of the facts it found, the date was \u201ca material element under the facts of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum granting the motion to dismiss clearly uses the word \u201cmaterial\u201d and uses that term in the evidentiary sense that facts found are \u201cmaterial\u201d where offered to prove a matter in issue and it thus relates to the crime charged by having a legitimate influence or bearing on the decision to be made. See 22A C.J.S., Criminal Law \u00a7 749. Stated another way, to be \u201cmaterial,\u201d the fact offered, if found or proven, must be significant under the substantive law applicable to the case and be properly at issue. This is no quibble or technicality and even if it might be so argued, the United States Supreme Court has said that \u201clawyers know, if others do not, that what may seem technical may embody a great tradition of justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>. . . <em>.\u2019\u2019Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 761, 66 S. Ct. 1239, 90 L. Ed. 1557 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The trial court, after reviewing documentary evidence, including depositions and affidavits, encompassing matters that went to the defendant\u2019s claim of alibi (the Alaska trip), made certain findings of fact upon which it determined that the time of the charged offense was \u201cmaterial.\u201d I submit that to do so represents an informed choice by the trial court between options open to it that was based on reasonable factual foundation and supported in law. We have indicated that the date of an offense may become \u201cmaterial\u201d where a defense of alibi is made. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>132 Conn. 276, 277, 43 A.2d 744 (1945). I perceive no reason for rejecting this legitimate \u201cconsidered reason\u201d after applying all the legal components referred to above in determining whether an abuse of discretion occurred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This reason alone legitimately serves as a basis to uphold the denial of permission to appeal as no abuse of discretion should be found on this ground. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>supra, 111 (\u201cno considered reason\u201d given).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The next reason attacked by the state that is upheld by the majority is the trial court\u2019s finding \u201cthat omissions concerning the defendant\u2019s absence and omissions concerning the admissions of intent of certain interested persons were material to the question of bribe receiving.\u201d In its memorandum dismissing the information, the trial court found that the affiant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>\u201cdeliberately omitted evidence and testimony from the warrant affidavit that [was] material to the finding of probable cause.\u201d It then made seven specific findings of fact which it concluded were \u201cintentionally\u201d omitted from the affidavit when presented to the issuing judge and which it also said should have been included. Finally, it said that had the \u201comitted facts\u201d been inserted in the affidavit, \u201cprobable cause could not have been found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">We have said that, although <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>supra, mentioned only \u201c \u2018false statements . . . included . . . in the warrant affidavit,\u2019 material omissions from such an affidavit also fall within the rule if the defendant proves that the omissions were knowingly and intentionally made, or were made with reckless disregard for the accuracy of the affidavit.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 238, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1984). The trial court made the necessary findings indicated in Stepney.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The question of whether an affiant intentionally misrepresents facts in an affidavit is a question of fact for the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chaisson, </em>123 N.H. 17, 458 A.2d 95 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The majority, without any discussion of several of these facts that were found material, however, does discuss the defendant\u2019s Alaskan trip. Referring to it, they say that this \u201comission would be material. . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>only if the date the defendant received the money from Gahan is a material element<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the crime ...\u201d and then conducts its analysis from there. Again, I repeat that I agree that the date of the crime charged is not <em>an element </em>of that crime; we are, however, concerned here with omissions of material facts, not a material element of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">\u201cAn affidavit may be as inaccurate when it omits facts as when it misstates them. The crucial, inference-drawing powers of the magistrate may be equally hindered in either case, with identical consequences [to the defendant].\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Kurland, </em>28 Cal. 3d 376, 384, 618 P.2d 213, 168 Cal. Rptr. 667 (1980). Under <em>Kurland, </em>if a fact is recklessly omitted or omitted with an intent to mislead, the warrant should be quashed, regardless of whether the omission is material. Id., 390. The findings by the trial court in this case as to the nature of the omissions when the affidavit was presented to the magistrate raise the issue of whether those omissions significantly distorted the magistrate\u2019s probable cause analysis. This was a call within the trial court\u2019s discretion for which it gave a \u201cconsidered reason,\u201d as well as law upon which to base the choice it made. Where the trial court made findings of fact that it found were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>\u201cdeliberately\u201d or \u201cintentionally\u201d omitted, such findings are not at all inconsistent with being treated as questions of fact, not of law, and not of mixed law and fact. See, e.g., <em>DeLuca </em>v. <em>C. W. Blakeslee &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>174 Conn. 535, 546, 391 A.2d 170 (1978); <em>International Brotherhood </em>v. <em>Commission on Civil Rights, </em>140 Conn. 537, 543, 102 A.2d 366 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">In distinguishing questions of fact from questions of law, it has been said that \u201cclearly, an issue does not lose its factual character merely because its resolution is dispositive of the ultimate constitutional question. See <em>Dayton Board of Education </em>v. <em>Brinkman, </em>443 U. S. 526, 534, [99 S. Ct. 2971, 61 L. Ed. 2d 720] (1979).\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>474 U.S. 104, 113, 106 S. Ct. 445, 88 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1985). In this issue on this case, the \u201cultimate\u201d constitutional question is the fourth amendment question involving the warrant affidavit. It is certainly not unreasonable, again applying all the components that go into deciding whether discretion was or was not abused, for the trial court to consider not only that the crucial, inference-drawing power of the magistrate could have been hindered but that probable cause was defeated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If there is no absolute standard in judging the exercise of discretion, I have difficulty understanding how an appellate court, with the choice open here to the trial court, which it exercised on the basis of cognizable legal authority, can conclude that its discretion was abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>The last reason given by the trial court was that \u201cwhen the affidavit is reviewed with the omitted material inserted, that probable cause to believe that the defendant received a bribe on or about June 14,1985, is defeated.\u201d I believe that this, too, constitutes a \u201cconsidered reason\u201d for the trial court\u2019s action when the principles guiding the trial court\u2019s discretion are applied; here again, its action was within the range of the choices open to it. In so concluding, I must assume, of course, the inclusion of those facts the trial court deemed material. In my view, it is suggestive of prescient reasoning for the majority to conclude that once the omitted facts deemed material by the trial court are included, that it was an abuse of discretion by the trial court to declare that a detached magistrate would not find probable cause. The trial court\u2019s determination denying the state\u2019s motion to appeal is not terse, it is not untenable; it is spelled out in its memorandum and is a reasonable conclusion reached between the choices that were open to it. This does not constitute being \u201cunreasonable\u201d in the sense it is \u201cirrational,\u201d nor is it \u201carbitrary\u201d in the sense of being \u201cwithout adequate determining principle.\u201d See <em>State v. S &amp; R Sanitation Services, Inc., </em>supra, 312. As one court said: \u201cWhere there is room for two opinions . . . action taken after due consideration is not arbitrary or capricious even though a reviewing court may believe it to be erroneous.\u201d <em>Abbenhaus v. Yakima, </em>89 Wash. 2d 855, 858-59, 576 P.2d 888 (1978), quoted in <em>State v. S &amp; R Sanitation Services, Inc., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">In sum, I would note the following. The majority does not contend that the trial court lacked the inherent supervisory authority that the trial court claimed it possessed. I must assume, however, that the majority, sub silentio, has found it improperly invoked because of its finding of abuse of discretion. Even if, however, it could be said arguendo that there were some error in the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>sion denying the state\u2019s request to appeal, the very concept of discretion which may fairly countenance some imperfection does not then cause the action of the trial court to be the \u201cclear and extreme abuse of discretion\u201d that we found in <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>supra, 111, or a case \u201cwhere injustice appears to have been done\u201d as we said in <em>Avcollie. </em>Id.; see <em>State v. S &amp; R Sanitation Services, Inc., </em>supra. We are in the area of discretion, not discretion arbitrarily appropriated by the trial court to itself, but discretion granted to every trial judge by the legislature when it enacted General Statutes \u00a7 54-96. The nature of the exercise of discretion is such that there is just no one right answer when reviewing its exercise. Otherwise, what is the basis for according discretion to trial judges? \u201cDiscretion without a criterion for its exercise is [the] authorization of arbitrariness.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>344 U.S. 443, 496, 73 S. Ct. 397, 97 L. Ed. 469, reh. denied, 395 U.S. 946, 73 S. Ct. 827, 97 L. Ed. 1370 (1953). We have such criteria, which, when appropriately applied, lead to the conclusion that there was no abuse of discretion. Accordingly, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s granting of dismissal with prejudice and conclude that we do not have subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b699-7\"> A fair reading of this extensive memorandum makes apparent the state\u2019s very extensive attack on the factual findings of the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b700-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 815 (1), entitled \u201c[Motion to Dismiss] \u2014 Matters to be Raised,\u201d provides: \u201cThe following defenses or objections, if capable of determination without a trial of the general issue, shall, if made prior to trial, be raised by a motion to dismiss the indictment or information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-9\">\u2018 \u2018(1) Defects in the institution of the prosecution including any grand jury proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">It appears, therefore, that a \u201cprosecution\u201d may be amenable to dismissal under this section even where a trial has not been started. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>209 Conn. 133, 139, 547 A.2d 543 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b703-7\"> For example, in <em>Maggio </em>v. <em>Fulford, </em>462 U.S. 111, 117, 103 S. Ct. 2261, 76 L. Ed. 2d 794, reh. denied, 463 U.S. 1236, 104 S. Ct. 29, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1451 (1983), the majority concluded that the question of an accused\u2019s competence to stand trial in a state court was a factual question to be resolved by a court whose findings could only be overturned in a federal habeas corpus proceeding if they were not \u201c \u2018fairly supported by the record.\u2019 \u201d Justice White concurring, Justices Brennan and Marshall concurring in part with Justice White, and Justice Stevens in dissent, asserted that the question was one of mixed law and fact. Id., 118-21. Again, in <em>Patton </em>v. <em>Yount, </em>467 U.S. 1025, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847 (1984), decided the following term, there was a similar dispute as to the status of a state trial court\u2019s ruling on whether a prospective juror had a preconceived opinion that disqualified him from serving on the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\"> Because of my view on this ground, it follows that I do not agree with the majority that the trial court abused its discretion \u201cwhen it ordered the state to prove at trial that the defendant received the bribe proceeds on the dates specified by the defendant and the trial court.\u201d This has to do with the amended information and bill of particulars that the transcript file shows was fully argued after which the trial court ordered the state limited to certain dates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b706-8\"> I agree with the majority that \u201c[n]ot all omissions, even if intentional, will invalidate an affidavit,\u201d for which they cite <em>People </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>105 Ill. 2d 22, 43, 473 N.E.2d 840 (1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1131, 105 S. Ct. 2666, 86 L. Ed. 2d 283 (1985). An examination of that case, however, discloses that the statements the defendant claimed in a <em>Franks </em>hearing should have been included in the affidavit \u201cwere so fraught with inconsistencies that it was not unreasonable for the police to conclude that the information was unreliable.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>supra, 45. There is no suggestion that this is so concerning the facts found material by the trial court in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\"> The terms \u201cmaterial element\u201d and \u201cmaterial\u201d have apparently been the source of confusion here. No authority is cited for what constitutes a \u201cmaterial element\u201d of a crime as opposed to an \u201celement.\u201d The point is that the trial court did not say time was a \u201cmaterial element\u201d of the crime involved, but that time may become \u201cmaterial under the facts of this case\u201d where the defense of alibi is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">I would add the following portions of the affidavit to those set out in the majority opinion: <em>\u201cOn or about June 14, 1985, </em>$3,000 in cash was paid to Thomas Gahan. . . . Mr. Gahan stated that the older Hill give him an envelope . . . that he <em>then </em>turned over ... to the Mayor . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Reasonably viewed, this lends support to the trial court\u2019s ruling that \u201con or about June 14,1985,\u201d in the bill of particulars, meant that the defendant received the money on \u201cJune 14,15,16 or 17,1985,\u201d thus justifying the characterization by the trial court of the omission of the period of the defendant\u2019s Alaskan trip from the affidavit as a \u201cmaterial\u201d omission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b708-7\"> In its citation of authority, the majority notes that \u201ceven if the affiant \u2018picks and chooses\u2019 the information that he includes in the affidavit, there is no <em>Franks </em>violation if, had the magistrate been so advised, he still would have been justified in issuing the warrant.\u201d It is clear from the seven material facts found by the trial court touching on this issue that none was included in the affidavit. I do not understand the majority to suggest that the issuing magistrate was told anything except that which he learned from examining the documents presented to him and including specifically the affidavit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
