The sole issue is whether the commissioner gave adequate public notice of his intention to adopt new Medicaid regulations. We agree with the trial court that the notice was adequate and therefore find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">The plaintiffs husband receives Title XIX (Medicaid) assistance. On June 27, 1988, DIM notified the plaintiff of a reduction in her husband\u2019s benefits. This in turn resulted in a reduction in the amount of her husband\u2019s income that was diverted to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">On July 6, 1988, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-2a, the plaintiff requested a fair hearing to contest DIM\u2019s action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 1,1988, a hearing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>held at the plaintiffs home. On September 8,1988, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-2b, the fair hearing officer issued a decision that concluded, inter alia, that as of October 1, 1988, the plaintiffs benefits would be reduced. On September 30,1988, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-2b and 4-183, the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claiming, inter alia, that the defendant\u2019s action \u201cwas made upon unlawful procedure, and is clearly erroneous.\u201d Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that public notice of the commissioner\u2019s intention to adopt a new public assistance policy manual was inadequate and not in compliance with the applicable provision of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, General Statutes \u00a7 4-168 (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">On June 8, 1989, the trial court concluded that the commissioner\u2019s notice to the public complied with \u00a7 4-168 (a), that the new public assistance policy manual that reduced the plaintiff\u2019s benefits was therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>validly promulgated, and rendered judgment dismissing the appeal. On July 2,1989, the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court. We thereafter transferred the matter to ourselves in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 4028.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff asks us to focus solely on her claim that the notice furnished by the commissioner did not comply with \u00a7 4-168 (a) and, therefore, that DIM\u2019s new public assistance policy manual was not promulgated in accordance with the legislature\u2019s mandate; General Statutes \u00a7 17-3f (c); and that the new manual be adopted in accordance with the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Examination of the record discloses that on January 6,1987, DIM published a notice of intent to adopt regulations in the Connecticut Law Journal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>The notice stated, inter alia: \u201cThese new regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>lations are designed to set forth in clear and concise language the policies and procedures used by the department in implementing and enforcing federal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>state law. In particular, the regulations (Manual) restate and/or revise the policies and procedures of the Department as they relate to the eligibility requirements for such programs as Aid to Families with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Dependent Children, Medicaid, State Supplement, and Food Stamps and Refugee Assistance. The new manual contains all department policy regulations and substantive procedure which affect the rights or procedures available to the public pertaining to program eligibility. . . . Copies of the full text of the new manual are available at no cost upon request from the Policy Unit, Department of Income Maintenance, Hartford, Connecticut 06106. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Section 4-168 (a) sets forth the required content of a notice of intent to adopt regulations. On January 6, 1987, the date the notice was published in the Connecticut Law Journal,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> subsection (a) (1) (A) specified in part: \u201cThe notice shall include (A) either a statement of the terms or of the substance of the proposed regulation or a description sufficiently detailed so as to apprise persons likely to be affected of the issues and subjects involved in the proposed regulation, (B) a statement of the purposes for which the regulation is proposed, (C) a reference to the statutory authority for the proposed regulation and (D) the time when, the place where and the manner in which interested persons may present their views thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The plaintiff first argues that the notice did not comply with subsection (a) (1) (A) in that it was not sufficiently specific so as fairly to advise those affected of the terms and substance of the proposed manual and the issues and subjects involved. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Subsection (a) (1) (A) requires either \u201ca statement of the terms\u201d or \u201cof the substance\u201d or a \u201cdescription sufficiently detailed\u201d all to the end that \u201cpersons likely to be affected\u201d are apprised \u201cof the issues and subjects involved . . . .\u201d In this connection, the notice first states that the commissioner \u201cproposes to adopt regulations replacing its State Social Services Policy Manual with a new manual.\u201d It specifically recites that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Manual \u201crestate[s] and/or revise[s] the policies and procedures of [DIM] as they relate to the eligibility requirements for such programs as Aid to Families with Dependent Children, <em>Medicaid, </em>State Supplement, and Food Stamps and Refugee Assistance.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">\u201cSubstance\u201d defines the essential nature, essence or quality of a document or thing. Webster, Third New International Dictionary. Even the most casual reader of this notice has to be aware that: (1) the Social Services Policy Manual is being replaced; (2) policies and procedures concerning eligibility requirements are being restated or revised; and (3) the programs implicated include Medicaid. We conclude that this constitutes the fair \u201cstatement of the . . . substance\u201d of the proposed revisions that \u00a7 4-168 (a) (1) (A) requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">The DIM notice went on to list specifically, in their entirety, the manual\u2019s sixteen chapter or section headings. These included, inter alia, \u201cTreatment of Income,\u201d \u201cStandards of Assistance,\u201d and \u201cCalculation of Benefits.\u201d The reader is thus specially notified \u201cof the issues and subjects involved in the proposed regulation,\u201d again, exactly as \u00a7 4-168 (a) (1) (A) directs.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">The plaintiff next argues that the DIM notice did not comply with \u00a7 4-168 (a) (1) (B) in that it contained an inadequate \u201cstatement of the purposes for which the regulation is proposed.\u201d In this connection, the DIM notice stated: \u201cStatement of purpose: To implement the provisions of Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 17-3f, as amended by Public Acts No. 85-564 and [No.] 86-415, directing the Commissioner of the Department of Income Maintenance to develop a new eligibility policy manual in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 54, and authorizing the operation under said manual pending formal adoption.\u201d Although this was a complete and accurate statement,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the plaintiff argues that. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>there was no statement of the purpose of any of the <em>rule changes </em>embodied in the manual. This was not required. Section 17-3f (c) did not mandate the promulgation of a new regulation but rather directed DIM to replace its policy manual, which was to be \u201cadopted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 [Uniform Administrative Procedure Act].\u201d Thus, in articulating a \u201cstatement of the purposes\u201d as required by \u00a7 4-168 (a) (1) (B), DIM was charged with describing the reasons for the adoption of the entire manual, not the reason for the adoption of each of its parts as the plaintiff claims. We conclude that the statement of purpose contained in the notice complied with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17-2a provides in part: \u201cAn aggrieved person authorized by law to request a fair hearing on a decision of the commissioner of income maintenance . . . may make application for such hearing . . . and shall state in such application in simple language the reasons why he claims to be aggrieved.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17-2b provides in part: \u201c(a) Not later than sixty days after such hearing . . . the commissioner or his designated hearing officer shall render a final decision ....</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">\u201c(b) The applicant ... if aggrieved, may appeal therefrom in accordance with section 4-183. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">When this appeal was commenced, General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 provided in part: \u201c(a) A person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal under this chapter</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">\u201c(b) Proceedings for such appeal shall be instituted by filing a petition in superior court . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-10\">An amendment to this section became effective July 1, 1989.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b621-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-168 (a) provides in part: \u201c[A]n agency, prior to adopting a proposed regulation, shall: (1) Give . . . notice by publication in the Connecticut Law Journal of its intended action.
