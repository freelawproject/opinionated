We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The facts stipulated by the parties may be summarized as follows. Curtis is a California corporation engaged in the business of producing, selling, leasing and distributing industrial films and videotapes (films) for personnel training purposes. In late 1985, the commissioner, acting through his representative, conducted a review of the books and records of Curtis for the period of January 1, 1982, through May 31, 1985. As a result of the review, the commissioner, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-411,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> assessed a Connecticut use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>tax liability against Curtis in the amount of $5020.40 plus interest and penalty with respect to certain rentals and sales of films by Curtis to customers in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>During the review period, Curtis was engaged in the sale and rental of its films to customers in Connecticut. None of the rentals exceeded three days. Some of the sales and rentals resulted from preview transactions in which customers were allowed to examine films for three days before deciding whether to purchase or rent them for training purposes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During the review period, the gross receipts for sales, rentals for training purposes and previews to customers in Connecticut were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>For the review period, Curtis marketed its sales and rentals in Connecticut only through: (a) trade shows held in states other than Connecticut, at which catalogs were distributed to patrons; (b) mailing lists; and (c) referrals. Catalogs were mailed to Connecticut customers identified on mailing lists or by referrals. Curtis did not utilize the services of any (a) salesmen, personnel or independent representatives in or visiting Connecticut, (b) own or rent offices or warehouses, or any inventory, in Connecticut, or (c) advertise by newspaper, radio or television in Connecticut. A Connecticut customer who wished to order a film from Curtis would have had to complete a purchase or rental order for the film and have sent it to Curtis at its California offices for acceptance in California. In addition, all deliveries and returns of films to and from customers in Connecticut, by sale or rental, were made by common carrier or the United States mail. Curtis had no telephone in Connecticut, nor any property in Connecticut other than the films previewed or rented, and Curtis did not visit its customers in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">By way of letters dated December 21, 1985, and January 29,1986, Curtis duly protested and appealed the assessment with the department of revenue services. On May 27,1986, the commissioner issued a final determination letter in which he ruled that the assessment was proper and, therefore, denied Curtis\u2019 appeal. Curtis then appealed the commissioner\u2019s final determination to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-422. Before the trial court, Curtis claimed that the commissioner \u201cwrongfully assessed sales or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>use tax against [it] because it [did] not have the level of contacts or nexus with Connecticut necessary to tax a foreign corporation; and it contends that without such contacts or nexus, the tax assessed against it by the commissioner violates the Due Process and Commerce Clauses.\u201d Conversely, the commissioner contended that \u201cpersonal property within a taxing state is a sufficient nexus between the taxing state and the entity being taxed to satisfy due process; [and] that Curtis is leasing and thus maintaining films and videotapes, which are personal property, within Connecticut.\u201d The trial court sustained Curtis\u2019 appeal, stating that \u201cthe presence in Connecticut of Curtis\u2019 films which are then being leased to its customers in Connecticut is not the kind of\u2018property within [the taxing] State . . .\u2019which constitutes a nexus sufficient to satisfy Constitutional requirements.\u201d The commissioner then appealed the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court and we thereafter transferred the case to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">On appeal, the commissioner argues that the trial court erred in ruling that there was an insufficient nexus between Curtis and the state of Connecticut to subject Curtis to the Connecticut use tax. We disagree. Not every out-of-state seller can be held liable for obtaining payment for use tax without a constitutional violation occurring. Such a collection burden when placed upon an out-of-state seller triggers due process concerns as well as imposes a restraint upon interstate commerce. See <em>National Bellas Hess, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>386 U.S. 753, 756, 87 S. Ct. 1389, 18 L. Ed. 2d 505 (1967); <em>L.L. Bean, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>516 A.2d 820, 824 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1986). In determining whether a state tax comports with constitutional due process requirements, the United States Supreme Court has stated that the \u201c \u2018simple but controlling question is whether the state has given any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>thing for which it can ask return.\u2019 \u201d <em>National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue, </em>supra, quoting <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>J. C. Penney Co., </em>311 U.S. 435, 444, 61 S. Ct. 246, 85 L. Ed. 267 (1940). In regard to the question of restraint on interstate commerce, the United States Supreme Court has held that \u201c \u2018[sjtate taxation falling on interstate commerce . . . can only be justified as designed to make such commerce bear a fair share of the cost of the local government whose protection it enjoys.\u2019 \u201d <em>National Bellas Hess, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>supra, quoting <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Hewit, </em>329 U.S. 249, 253, 67 S. Ct. 274, 91 L. Ed. 265 (1946). Accordingly, when examining the constitutionality of imposing the duty of collection of a use tax upon an out-of-state seller, the relevant legal inquiry is whether there exists \u201c \u2018some definite link, some minimum connection, between a state and the person, property or transaction it seeks to tax.\u2019 \u201d <em>National Bellas Hess, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>supra, quoting <em>Miller Brothers Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>347 U.S. 340, 344-45, 74 S. Ct. 535, 98 L. Ed. 744 (1954); see <em>L.L. Bean, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>supra. The existence of such a link or nexus will thus turn upon the individual facts of each case. See <em>L.L. Bean, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u201cCase law has established that a sufficient nexus is found to exist where local agents of the seller are present in the taxing state. <em>Felt &amp; Tarrant Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>306 U.S. 62, 59 S. Ct. 376, 83 L. Ed. 488 (1939); <em>General Trading Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commission of the State of Iowa, </em>322 U.S. 335, 64 S. Ct. 1028, 88 L. Ed. 1309 (1944). A similar result has been reached where the seller has local retail stores which are present in the taxing state. <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>312 U.S. 359, 61 S. Ct. 586, 85 L. Ed. 888 (1941) .... And in <em>National Geographic Society </em>[v. <em>California Equalization Board, </em>430 U.S. 551, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>97 S. Ct. 1386, 51 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1977)], the presence in the taxing state of two offices which solicited advertisements and received the benefit of municipal protection (fire, police, etc.) was held a sufficient nexus.\u201d <em>L.L. Bean, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>supra, 824-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In <em>Miller Brothers Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, however, the United States Supreme Court held that Maryland \u201ccould not constitutionally impose upon a Delaware seller an obligation to collect use taxes where the Delaware firm had no retail outlets or sales solicitors in Maryland, despite the presence of advertising in Maryland which resulted in substantial sales and the delivery of goods into Maryland by the seller using its own trucks and drivers.\u201d <em>L.L. Bean, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>supra, 825. Furthermore, in <em>National Bellas Hess, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>supra, the United States Supreme Court found an insufficient nexus where the only contacts between the seller and the taxing state were through the United States mail or common carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">In <em>National Geographic Society </em>v. <em>California Board of Equalization, </em>supra, 559, the United States Supreme Court stated the following regarding <em>National Bellas Hess, Inc.: </em>\u201cIllinois subjected appellant Bellas Hess, a national mail-order house centered in Missouri, to use tax liability based upon mail-order sales to customers in that State. Bellas Hess owned no tangible property in Illinois, had no sales outlets, representatives, telephone listings, or solicitors in that State, and did not advertise there by radio, television, billboards, or newspapers. It communicated with potential customers by mailing catalogues throughout the United States, including Illinois, twice a year and occasionally supplemented this effort by mailing out \u2018flyers. \u2019 All orders for merchandise were mailed to Bellas Hess\u2019 Missouri plant, and the goods were sent to customers by mail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>or common carrier. <em>Bellas Hess </em>held that, constitutionally, the basis for the requisite nexus was not to be found solely in Bellas Hess\u2019 mail-order activities in the State. The Court\u2019s opinion carefully underscored, however, the \u2018sharp distinction . . . between mail order sellers with retail outlets, solicitors, or property within [the taxing] State, and those [like Bellas Hess] who do no more than communicate with customers in the State by mail or common carrier as part of a general interstate business.\u2019 <em>[National Bellas Hess, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>supra, 758.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">In the present case, the facts are remarkably similar to those of <em>National Bellas Hess, Inc. </em>Just as all of Bellas Hess\u2019 contacts with Illinois were via the United States mail or common carrier, all of Curtis\u2019 contacts with Connecticut were via the United States mail or common carrier. The commissioner argues, however, that <em>National Bellas Hess, Inc., </em>is distinguishable from the instant case by virtue of the fact that, unlike Bellas Hess, Curtis did not merely sell, but rather, also <em>leased </em>property (films) in Connecticut. Therefore, the commissioner contends that, since Curtis retained title to the films while they were previewed or leased in Connecticut, Curtis had property in the state, which in turn, constituted a sufficient nexus to the state to subject Curtis to the state\u2019s use tax. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">As to the question of \u201cwhether the state has given anything for which it can ask return,\u201d under the facts of this case, we discern no significant difference between a sale and a three day preview or lease of the films. See <em>National Bellas Hess, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>supra; <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Hewit, </em>supra; <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>J. C. Penny Co., </em>supra. The commissioner relies on <em>Union Oil Co. of California </em>v. <em>Board of Equalization, </em>60 Cal. 2d 441, 386 P.2d 496, 34 Cal. Rptr. 872 (1963), appeal dismissed, 377 U.S. 404, 84 S. Ct. 1629, 12 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1964), to support his assertion that a suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>ficient nexus existed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find the facts of <em>Union Oil Co. of California, </em>however, to be inapposite. In <em>Union Oil Co. of California, </em>the California Supreme Court held that an out-of-state lessor of two oil tankers to a California lessee was liable for California\u2019s use tax because the tankers were physically used within the state. This fact pattern is distinguishable from the present case, however, because, unlike Curtis\u2019 films, the out-of-state lessor\u2019s property clearly enjoyed benefits bestowed upon it by the local government such as use of harbors, and fire and police protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">In short, just because Curtis leased instead of sold the films in Connecticut, does not mean that Curtis \u201c \u2018received] benefits from [Connecticut] for which [Connecticut] has the power to exact a price.\u2019 \u201d <em>National Bellas Hess, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>supra, quoting <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>supra, 365. Although Curtis did have property (films) within Connecticut, such contact with Connecticut, like the contact of the appellant\u2019s delivery trucks with Maryland in <em>Miller Brothers Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, was de minimus, as the films were only in the state for three day periods, and did not benefit from the services of local government.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">In conclusion, we hold that the trial court properly ruled that there was an insufficient nexus between Cur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>tis and the state of Connecticut to subject Curtis to the Connecticut use tax pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-411.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In this opinion Peters, C. J., Healey, Callahan, Covello and Hull, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 12-411. the use tax. (1) imposition and rate.

If a customer wished to preview a film before deciding whether to purchase or rent it for training purposes, Curtis would provide the cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>tomer with a film to preview for a charge. In this transaction, Curtis would send the film to the customer, who would then be permitted to use the film for three days for evaluation purposes, not for training, and the film must then be returned to Curtis. At all times, Curtis remained the owner of the film. If a customer decided to rent or purchase the same film within sixty days, Curtis then deducted the preview charge from the rental or purchase price.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b319-7\"> Furthermore, the commissioner relies upon <em>In re Heftel Broadcasting Honolulu, Inc., </em>57 Haw. 175, 554 P.2d 242 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1073, 97 S. Ct. 811, 50 L. Ed. 2d 791 (1977), to support his assertion that a sufficient nexus existed. This case, too, is inapposite. In <em>Heftel, </em>the Supreme Court of Hawaii upheld an assessment of a privilege tax by the state of Hawaii against taxpayers located out-of-state who licensed films to be shown on television in Hawaii. Specifically, CBS Enterprises, Inc., entered into license agreements under which Hawaii television stations were granted the right to show certain CBS films. In finding an adequate nexus to override the constitutional prohibitions, however, the court held that \u201cphysical presence of CBS\u2019 films was not the only contact with Hawaii,\u201d and also relied on the licensing arrangement for the films as constituting a continuing activity in the state of Hawaii.

I disagree with the conclusion reached by the majority that there is an insufficient \u201cnexus\u201d between the plaintiff and this state to justify, under the due process clause, the imposition of the duty to collect use taxes on transactions with customers in Connecticut. The fact that the plaintiff owns property in the form of training films in this state from which it receives rental fees of substantial sums is a sufficient relationship, as the commissioner contends. The protection of these films, like all property in this state, through the services of policemen and firemen is a benefit provided to the plaintiff by the state \u201cfor which it can ask return.\u201d <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>J. C. Penney Co., </em>311 U.S. 435, 444, 61 S. Ct. 246, 85 L. Ed. 267 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The reliance of the majority opinion on <em>National Bellas Hess, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>386 U.S. 753, 87 S. Ct. 1389, 18 L. Ed. 2d 505 (1967), is misplaced, because the court in that case expressly recognized the \u201csharp distinction . . . drawn between mail order sellers with retail outlets, solicitors, or <em>property </em>within a State, and those who do no more than communicate with customers in the State by mail or common carrier as part of a general interstate business.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 758. This plaintiff does more than communicate with Connecticut customers, because it owns property of substantial value in this state from which it receives rental payments on a continuing basis. This business activity of the plaintiff is plainly distinguishable from the mail order sales con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>sidered in <em>National Bellas Hess, Inc., </em>in which the seller\u2019s interest in the item sold terminates on passage of title to the buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
