The defendant Richard T. Carpenter was convicted by a jury of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequently, he filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal, which was denied, and he was sentenced by the trial court to a prison term of fifty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The defendant\u2019s appeal raises two issues, a substantive challenge of evidentiary insufficiency and a procedural challenge of voir dire irregularity. We find error as to the former but not as to the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">\u201cWhen an appeal challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to justify a verdict of guilty, we have a twofold task. We first review the evidence presented at the trial, construing it in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cimino, </em>194 Conn. 210, 211, 478 A.2d 1005 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrell, </em>191 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>37, 46, 463 A.2d 573 (1983). We then determine whether \u2018 \u201cthe jury could have reasonably concluded, upon the facts established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 255, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772, reh. denied, 466 U.S. 954, 104 S. Ct. 2163, 80 L.

The victim in this case, Cassandra Demming, an eighteen month old baby, had been in the custody of the defendant and his wife since September 15, 1987, because the baby\u2019s mother was incarcerated. On December 31,1987, the baby was suffering from a cold and diarrhea. Around noon of that day, the defendant left the baby in the care of a teenage relative and went out for the evening. The babysitter spent the night at the Carpenters\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The next morning, when the babysitter awoke, he heard the baby crying. He immediately went to her room and noticed that she had vomited in her crib. The baby was sick all that day, suffering from congestion and diarrhea. The babysitter stayed with the baby until some members of the Carpenter family returned to the house at approximately 4:15 p.m., January 1, 1988, New Year\u2019s Day. The defendant did not return until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>around 5 p.m. Shortly thereafter, the babysitter and some other family members left. When the baby\u2019s grandfather, Norman Demming, left at approximately 6:30 p.m. the defendant was alone with the baby who was lying in her crib. At 6:42 p.m., the defendant called the fire department and reported that the baby was having difficulty breathing. When the firefighters arrived, the defendant was outside waiting for them. He directed them to the bathroom where they found the baby unconscious and covered with vomit in the bathtub. James Kenny, a Wallingford firefighter, quickly checked the baby, picked her up and started mouth to mouth resuscitation. As the firefighters were leaving, the defendant told them that the baby had fallen out of her crib.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The defendant accompanied the baby as she was transported by ambulance to Memorial Hospital in Meriden. Later, after the doctors diagnosed that the baby had a parietal skull fracture, she was transported by helicopter to Yale-New Haven Hospital and placed on a life support system. The next morning, the baby was pronounced brain dead and thereafter removed from life support. William Hellenbrand, the examining physician at Yale-New Haven Hospital, found bruises over the baby\u2019s back and her face swollen. He also testified that the skull fracture that killed the baby was caused by her being thrown physically, rather than just falling or being dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The autopsy conducted by Harold Carver, deputy chief medical examiner, revealed bruised and swollen tissue around the lips and eyes, a fractured skull and five fractured ribs. Carver testified that the lethal injury to the skull was caused by a single blow of \u201cfairly great force.\u201d The doctor opined that the injuries could have occurred when someone threw the baby onto a hard, smooth surface. He also testified that the baby\u2019s ribs were broken by a \u201cfairly significant force\u201d which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>occurred around the same time as the skull fracture. In Carver\u2019s opinion, the ribs could have been broken either by being struck with a fist or by being shaken violently. Carver, in the course of his examination, also discovered another head injury, not related to the cause of death, that was at least six weeks old.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">What transpired during the short period of time in which the defendant was left alone with the baby is unclear. The only evidence presented by the state was the varying accounts of the incident given by the defendant to the police. The defendant first told authorities that the baby had fallen from her crib and that, in taking her to the bathroom to revive her, he had accidentally hit her head against a door. Later, the defendant voluntarily went to the police station to discuss the incident. While there, he repudiated the story of striking the baby\u2019s head against a door and stated instead that he had slipped and had fallen on the baby while carrying her to the bathroom and that he had also banged her head several times while attempting to place her into the bathtub to administer first aid. After being confronted with the results of the autopsy report, the defendant ventured that he might have dropped the baby as he was attempting to place her in the tub and that he had also banged her head several times in an attempt to resuscitate her. Carver rejected these explanations given by the defendant. He testified that he could not conceive of how the injuries could have been caused accidentally in those ways.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant did at one point in his conversations with the police, however, admit that he had thrown the baby into the bathtub out of sheer frustration. When questioned as to what may have caused the rib injuries, the defendant indicated that he might have grabbed the victim too firmly in an attempt to revive her.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>The defendant argues that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had the specific intent to cause death. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a. While the the defendant does not challenge the state\u2019s contention that the evidence established a homicide, he asserts that it established only his culpability of the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">It is, of course, the state\u2019s burden to prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>212 Conn. 31, 36, 561 A.2d 897 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>DelVecchio, </em>191 Conn. 412, 419, 464 A.2d 813 (1983). In order to be convicted under our murder statute, the defendant must possess the specific \u201cintent to cause the death\u201d of the victim. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a. To act intentionally, the defendant must have had the conscious objective to cause the death of the victim. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (11); <em>State </em>v. <em>McClary, </em>207 Conn. 233, 240, 541 A.2d 96 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>178 Conn. 450, 466, 423 A.2d 118 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1015, 100 S. Ct. 667, 62 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1980), aff\u2019d, 188 Conn. 626, 453 A.2d 418 (1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 928, 103 S. Ct. 2088, 77 L. Ed. 2d 299 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u201c \u2018Generally, intent can be proved only by circumstantial evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>178 Conn. 689, 695, 425 A.2d 111 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bzdyra, </em>165 Conn. 400, 403, 334 A.2d 917 (1973). \u201c \u2018Intent may be, and usually is, inferred from conduct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofone, </em>164 Conn. 162, 164, 319 A.2d 381 [1972]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>157 Conn. 351, 354, 254 A.2d 447 [1969]. . . . \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Bzdyra, </em>[supra].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sober, </em>166 Conn. 81, 92-93, 347 A.2d 61 (1974).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>[193 Conn. 602, 609, 478 A.2d 994 (1984)]. \u2018 \u201c \u2018An intent to cause death may be inferred from circumstantial evidence such as the type of weapon used, the manner in which it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>used, the type of wound inflicted and the events leading to and immediately following the death.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Zdanis, </em>182 Conn. 388, 396, 438 A.2d 696 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1003, 101 S. Ct. 1715, 68 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). . . . The use of inferences based on circumstantial evidence is necessary because direct evidence of the accused\u2019s state of mind is rarely available. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382, 404, 429 A.2d 919 (1980).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>195 Conn. 166, 170, 487 A.2d 177 (1985).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Chace, </em>[199 Conn. 102, 105, 505 A.2d 712 (1986)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>213 Conn. 708, 721-22, 570 A.2d 174 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Although ordinarily the intent of the actor is a question for the trier of fact; <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>supra, 466; when an element of a crime set forth in a statute is unsupported by the evidence, \u201c \u2018it is error to submit it to the jury as if the evidence justified the determination of the presence of that element.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>177 Conn. 379, 382, 418 A.2d 50 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>169 Conn. 683, 687, 363 A.2d 1077 (1975).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>supra, 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Construing the available evidence in the light most favorable to the state, a jury could reasonably have found that the defendant killed the baby by throwing her into the bathtub. This conclusion, standing alone, however, is insufficient to establish that the defendant had the requisite intent to cause death. The state presented no evidence of any weapon, plan or motive, nor was there any evidence connecting the defendant to a pattern of abusive behavior. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>181 Conn. 406, 415, 435 A.2d 986 (1980). No evidence was presented to suggest that the defendant had caused the six week old head injury noted earlier. Further, the defendant did not attempt to fl.ee but rather, when he realized the gravity of the situation, immediately sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>moned medical aid for the baby. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 173; <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Antuono, </em>186 Conn. 414, 425, 441 A.2d 846 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The state argues, however, that the jury could reasonably have inferred an intent to cause death based upon the relative strength of the defendant as compared to the victim, the degree of force used, and the nature of the injuries inflicted. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">It is axiomatic \u201cthat any conclusion, reasonably to be drawn from the evidence, which is consistent with the innocence of the accused must prevail. <em>State </em>v. <em>Guilfoyle, </em>109 Conn. 124, 139, 145 A. 761 [1929].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Foord, </em>142 Conn. 285, 294, 113 A.2d 591 (1955); <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>supra, 610. \u201cThe trier may not reach a conclusion of guilt where the facts, established by the evidence, including those reasonably and logically inferred from other proven facts, are rationally consistent with the innocence of an accused. A conclusion of guilt requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and proof to that extent is proof which precludes every reasonable hypothesis except that which it tends to support, and is consistent with the defendant\u2019s guilt and inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>138 Conn. 196, 200, 82 A.2d 816 [1951].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Foord, </em>supra, 295; <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 173; <em>State v. Morrill, </em>supra, 610-11. \u201cMoreover, inferences which do not have a basis in facts established by the evidence cannot be drawn or relied upon to sustain a verdict.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>176 Conn. 257, 264, 407 A.2d 948 (1978). The jury may not resort to speculation and conjecture. <em>State </em>v. <em>Saracino, </em>178 Conn. 416, 419, 423 A.2d 102 (1979). If the evidence is insufficient to sustain the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the verdict must be set aside. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">We conclude that the evidence presented by the state was simply insufficient to preclude the reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>hypothesis that the defendant, out of frustration, engaged in reckless conduct that caused the death of the victim. The evidence was therefore insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the specific intent to cause the victim\u2019s death. Accordingly, the trial court should have granted the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the murder charge. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Neary, </em>733 F.2d 210, 217 (2d Cir. 1984); Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 883<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Our conclusion, however, does not require a remand for a new trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>McGann, </em>199 Conn. 163, 178, 506 A.2d 109 (1986). The trial court instructed the jury, inter alia, regarding the elements of the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 405-407; see <em>Government of Virgin Islands </em>v. <em>Soto, </em>718 F.2d 72, 76-77 (3d Cir. 1983). Because the jury\u2019s verdict necessarily includes a determination that, absent a specific intent, all the elements of \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3) have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant would not be prejudiced by a modification of the judgment to reflect a conviction of that charge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Saracino, </em>supra, 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The defendant\u2019s second claim on appeal is that the trial court erred when it conducted a voir dire of a juror, excused him, and replaced him with an alternate juror. These proceedings occurred in the presence of defense counsel but in the absence of the defendant. The defendant claims, consequently, a violation of both the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The defendant did not raise this claim below and therefore seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). We recently restated the <em>Evans </em>guidelines for dealing with constitutional violations that are raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). In <em>Golding, </em>we held that \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">It is the appellant\u2019s responsibility to provide this court with a record adequate to review his claim of error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>209 Conn. 622, 633, 553 A.2d 589 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Crumpton, </em>202 Conn. 224, 231, 520 A.2d 226 (1987). This the defendant has failed to do. On the basis of the undeveloped record in this case, it is impos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>sible to determine whether the defendant was ignorant or informed of the discussions concerning the excused juror, whether he waived his right to be present at the discussions or whether, at the time, he agreed with the decision to excuse the juror and consented to his replacement. Because of the inadequate record we will not review the defendant\u2019s claim on appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">There is error, and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to modify the judgment to reflect a conviction of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3) and to resentence the defendant in accordance with that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In this opinion Peters, C.
