Udolf, Inc., was entitled to coverage under certain employee dishonesty insurance policies issued by the defendants, Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (Aetna) and Fire and Casualty Insurance Company of Connecticut (Fire and Casualty), for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>misappropriation of monies by an employee of the plaintiff. The plaintiff notified the defendants of losses it had incurred as a result of an employee\u2019s dishonesty and sought from the defendants indemnification, plus interest, for those losses. Upon the defendants\u2019 refusals to pay its claim, the plaintiff instituted the present action. The matter was thereafter tried to the court and judgment was rendered in favor of the defendants. From this judgment the plaintiff appeals. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The underlying facts as found by the trial court are as follows. The plaintiff is a small corporation that operates a retail men\u2019s clothing store in the city of Hartford. During the relevant period, 1980 through 1983, the plaintiff employed between eight and ten employees. The only officer, director and shareholder of the plaintiff was Leonard Udolf, who was present in the store approximately 10 to 20 percent of the time. In his absence the store was run by Kenneth Auer, the store manager. Auer was the overseer of the store and was principally in charge of its operations in the absence of Leonard Udolf. He was expected, however, to report all relevant activities to Leonard Udolf.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">During the years 1980 and 1981, Lynn Bjork, an employee of the plaintiff, misappropriated $6000 from the plaintiff. To effect the misappropriations, she substituted her personal checks for money generated by the plaintiff\u2019s sales, and then simply put these checks in her desk rather than depositing them into the plaintiff\u2019s account. In the spring of 1981, during one of Leonard Udolf\u2019s frequent absences from the store, Anna Shukis, the plaintiff\u2019s bookkeeper, discovered the misappropriations and immediately informed Auer of them. Auer and Shukis were expected to inform Leonard Udolf of activities such as Bjork\u2019s misappropriations. They, however, did not consult with Leonard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Udolf, but rather agreed with one another to allow Bjork to repay the $6000 and remain employed by the plaintiff. Thereafter, Bjork repaid the $6000.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Beginning in late 1981, and continuing until February, 1983, Bjork again misappropriated monies from the plaintiff, totaling $48,715.08. These misappropriations were discovered in February, 1983, and Bjork was immediately fired by Auer on the direct order of Leonard Udolf.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Pursuant to employee dishonesty insurance policies that the plaintiff had purchased from Aetna and from Fire and Casualty,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the plaintiff notified the two companies of the losses incurred as a result of Bjork\u2019s misappropriations. Both Aetna and Fire and Casualty refused to indemnify the plaintiff for those losses, claiming that the language of the policies excluded coverage for Bjork\u2019s actions. Aetna\u2019s refusal to pay was based on the following provision contained in section 7 of its policy: \u201cThe coverage of Insuring Agreement I shall not apply to any Employee from and after the time that the Insured or any partner or officer thereof not in collusion with such Employee shall have knowledge or information that such Employee has committed any fraudulent or dishonest act in the service of the Insured or otherwise, whether such act be committed before or after the date of employment by the Insured.\u201d Fire and Casualty\u2019s refusal was based on similar language contained in section 1 (3) of its policy: \u201cInsurance hereunder shall be deemed cancelled as to any Employee immediately upon discovery by the Insured, or any partner or officer, of any fraudulent or dishonest act of such Employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>The trial court concluded that, under the terms of the policies, the plaintiff was not entitled to recovery of the losses it had incurred as a result of Bjork\u2019s actions. The basis of the court\u2019s conclusion was its determination that the knowledge of Auer and Shukis concerning misappropriations committed by the plaintiff\u2019s employees was imputed to the plaintiff. The court thus reasoned that because the 1980-81 misappropriations by Bjork constituted \u201cfraudulent or dishonest act[s]\u201d within the scope of section 7 of Aetna\u2019s policy, and section 1 (3) of Fire and Casualty\u2019s policy, and because the plaintiff, by imputation of Auer\u2019s and Shukis\u2019 knowledge, became aware of those misappropriations no later than the summer of 1981, any subsequent losses caused by a \u201cfraudulent or dishonest act\u201d on the part of Bjork were excluded from coverage under the policies. In so concluding, the court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s claim that, because Auer and Shukis did not inform Leonard Udolf of Bjork\u2019s 1980-81 misappropriations, they were in collusion with Bjork. The court stated that while the failure of Auer and Shukis to notify Leonard Udolf may have been an act of poor judgment, it was not a fraudulent act and therefore was not collusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in: (1) imputing to the plaintiff the knowledge of Auer and Shukis concerning Bjork\u2019s prior misappropriations of the plaintiff\u2019s monies; (2) finding that Bjork\u2019s prior misappropriations were \u201cfraudulent or dishonest\u201d under the terms of the policies; and (3) finding that Auer and Shukis were not in collusion with Bjork.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">We first consider whether the trial court erred in imputing to the plaintiff the knowledge of Auer and Shukis concerning Bjork\u2019s prior misappropriations of the plaintiff\u2019s monies. The plaintiff concedes that gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>erally, \u201c \u2018 \u201cnotice to, or knowledge of, an agent while acting within the scope of his authority and in reference to a matter over which his authority extends, is notice to, or knowledge of, the principal.\u201d 2 Mechem on Agency (2d Ed.) \u00a7 1803.\u2019 <em>Lane </em>v. <em>United Electric Light &amp; Water Co., </em>88 Conn. 670, 674, 92 A. 430 (1914); <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>138 Conn. 510, 516, 86 A.2d 570 (1952).\u201d <em>West Haven </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>174 Conn. 392, 395, 389 A.2d 741 (1978). As stated in the Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 272, \u201ca principal is affected by the knowledge of an agent concerning a matter as to which he acts within his power to bind the principal or upon which it is his duty to give the principal information.\u201d The plaintiff argues, however, that this agency principle should not apply in the context of employee dishonesty insurance, citing as authority for its position <em>American Employers\u2019 Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Cable, </em>108 F.2d 225 (5th Cir. 1939), <em>Miami National Bank </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Ins. Co., </em>314 F. Sup. 858 (S.D. Fla. 1970), <em>Phoenix Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Union Finance Co., </em>54 So. 2d 188 (Fla. 1951), and <em>Peurifoy </em>v. <em>Loyal, </em>154 S.C. 267, 151 S.E. 579 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">The trial court was unpersuaded by the plaintiff\u2019s argument and the cases on which it was based, and relied instead primarily on <em>Ritchie Grocer Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>426 F.2d 499 (8th Cir. 1970), in concluding that the knowledge of Auer and Shukis concerning Bjork\u2019s 1980-81 activities should be imputed to the plaintiff. The similarities between <em>Ritchie Grocer Co. </em>and the instant case are striking. At issue in <em>Ritchie Grocer Co. </em>was the same policy exclusion as in the present case: \u201c \u2018The coverage of this Policy shall not apply to any Employee from and after the time that the Insured or any partner or officer thereof not in collusion with such Employee shall have knowledge or information that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>such Employees (sic) has committed any fraudulent or dishonest act in the service of the Insured or otherwise ....\u2019\u201d Id., 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The underlying facts involved in <em>Ritchie Grocer Co. </em>were as follows. Joseph Polk, the manager of a branch office of the plaintiffs wholesale grocery business, received an application for employment from Wayne Kemp. Prior to hiring Kemp, Polk inquired into Kemp\u2019s reputation for trustworthiness and discovered that several months earlier Kemp and two other boys had broken into a gas station and had stolen some tires and money. Notwithstanding that information, Polk hired Kemp as a truck driver for the plaintiff. Id., 501-502. During the eighteen months that Kemp was employed by the plaintiff, he misappropriated $17,486.20, for which the plaintiff made a claim under its fidelity policy. Id., 503. The insurance company defended on the grounds that Polk\u2019s knowledge of Kemp\u2019s prior \u201cfraudulent or dishonest\u201d act made him a known risk and excluded him from coverage under the policy\u2019s terms. Id., 501. The District Court held in favor of the insurance company on this ground and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, reciting the general agency principle that knowledge of an agent acquired in the ordinary discharge of his duties for the corporation is generally to be imputed to the principal. Id., 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The trial court in the present case also relied on <em>Alfalfa Electric Cooperative, Inc. </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>376 F. Sup. 901 (W.D. Okla. 1973), as support for its decision to impute to the plaintiff the knowledge of Auer and Shukis. In <em>Alfalfa Electric Cooperative, Inc., </em>the court imputed to an employer the knowledge of an office manager concerning prior fraudulent or dishonest acts of an employee. Id., 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">The cases relied upon by the trial court and the cases cited by both the plaintiff and the defendants lack any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>meaningful analysis of the reasons that imputation was either appropriate or inappropriate under the facts of the particular cases. We conclude, however, that a proper analysis flows logically from the tension between the conflicting views presented by the plaintiff and the defendants. The plaintiff argues that the general rule imputing knowledge of an agent to a principal presumes the agent\u2019s loyalty in the performance of his duties. The corporation purchases fidelity insurance to protect itself from the risk that the employee will be disloyal. The plaintiff claims that it, therefore, would be \u201cabsurd\u201d to hold that each employee so insured was an agent of the plaintiff whose duty it was to discover and report acts of dishonesty by other employees. Moreover, the plaintiff argues, if the neglect or reluctance of the insured\u2019s employees to report on one another relieved the insurance carrier of its liability, the corporation would be denied a remedy. The defendants\u2019 counterpoint is that, taken to its extreme, the plaintiff\u2019s contention would render \u201cprior employee dishonesty\u201d exclusions useless. Without employee imputation, the defendants argue, it would be impossible to charge an insured corporation with knowledge of an employee\u2019s prior wrongful actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The answer to this conundrum can be found in the cases relied upon by the trial court, although not explicitly articulated therein. We conclude that the knowledge of an employee may be imputed to an employer under an employee dishonesty insurance policy if the employee holds a position of management or control in the exercise of which a duty to report known dishonesty of a fellow employee can be found to exist either explicitly or by fair inference from a course of conduct. \u201c \u2018The knowledge of individual officers and employees at a certain level of responsibility will be deemed the knowledge of the corporation; where the level of responsibility begins must be discerned from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>the circumstances of each case. . . \u201d <em>Gordon Selway, Inc. </em>v. <em>Spence Bros, Inc., </em>177 Mich. App. 116, 124, 440 N.W.2d 907 (1989), quoting 18B Am. Jur. 2d, Corporations \u00a7 1673, pp. 524-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the evidence presented at trial indicated various limitations on the responsibilities of Auer and Shukis that made imputation inappropriate. The trial court, however, concluded that Auer was principally in charge of operations during Leonard Udolf s absences from the store and that one of his responsibilities in that capacity was to report matters such as misappropriations to Leonard Udolf. The court further determined that Anna Shukis, the plaintiffs bookkeeper, was responsible for running the bookkeeping operation and that she likewise had a responsibility to report to Leonard Udolf any misappropriations that occurred in that department. The nature and extent of an agent\u2019s authority is a question of fact for the trier. <em>E. Paul Kovacs &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Alpert, </em>180 Conn. 120, 126, 429 A.2d 829 (1980). \u201c[Wjhere the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Bjork testified at trial that in 1980-81, Auer\u2019s position was that of \u201cstore manager.\u201d Although Auer testified at trial that he was only the \u201csales manager,\u201d this testimony was inconsistent with his prior deposition testimony in which Auer had claimed that he was in fact the \u201cstore manager.\u201d Further, while Auer stated that he did not have the authority to hire and fire employees in 1980-81, he did arrange with Bjork, without first consulting with Leonard Udolf, for repayment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>of the $6000 and then fired Bjork upon learning of the 1983 misappropriations. Auer\u2019s testimony also revealed that he was expected to report to Leonard Udolf everything that happened in the store. Finally, Leonard Udolf was present in the store only 10 to 20 percent of the time. Although Leonard Udolf claimed at trial that he was always in charge of the store, even while absent, this claim conflicted with his deposition testimony in which, in response to the question of \u201cwho was in charge of the operations in your absence,\u201d he answered: \u201cWell I felt I had them in capable hands with Ken Auer ... on the floor . . . and in the office with Ann Shukis and the other girls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s factual findings concerning the responsibilities and consequent duties of Auer and Shukis were supported by the evidence. See <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>supra. Therefore, since the court found that the positions held by Auer and Shukis gave rise to a duty to report misappropriations to Leonard Udolf, the court\u2019s imputation to the plaintiff of Auer\u2019s and Shukis\u2019 knowledge concerning Bjork\u2019s 1980-81 actions was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court erred in concluding that Bjork\u2019s 1980-81 misappropriations of the plaintiff\u2019s $6000 were \u201cdishonest or fraudulent\u201d under the terms of the policies. The gravamen of this claim is that Bjork had deposit slips and personal checks that accounted for all the money she had taken from the plaintiff and that she eventually paid back that money. The plaintiff states in its brief that \u201c[i]n 1980 and 1981 [Bjork] merely withheld cash deposits, carefully accounting for the amounts so withheld.\u201d According to the plaintiff, while Bjork\u2019s acts may have been unauthorized, they were not dishonest within the context of the policies. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>Justice Cardozo wrote the following in <em>World Exchange Bank </em>v. <em>Commercial Casualty Ins. Co., </em>255 N.Y. 1, 5, 173 N.E. 902 (1930): \u201cDishonesty, unlike embezzlement or larceny, is not a term of art. Even so, the measure of its meaning is not a standard of perfection, but an infirmity of purpose so opprobrious or furtive as to be fairly characterized as dishonest in the common speech of men.\u201d To claim that Bjork\u2019s program of self-service with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s money was not fraudulent or dishonest defies common sense and \u201cthe common speech of men.\u201d Moreover, we refuse to hold that it is a defense to a claim of dishonesty that a person so accused was dishonest in a very efficient manner. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in concluding that Bjork\u2019s 1980-81 actions were \u201cdishonest or fraudulent\u201d under the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">We turn now to the plaintiff\u2019s final claim of error. Section 7 of the Aetna policy excluded from coverage \u201cany Employee from and after the time that the Insured or any partner or officer thereof <em>not in collusion with such Employee </em>shall have knowledge or information that such employee has committed any fraudulent or dishonest act . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiff argues that the court erroneously found that Auer and Shukis were not in collusion with Bjork. In finding that no collusion had occurred, the trial court relied upon the definition of \u201ccollusion\u201d contained in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979) p. 240: \u201cAn agreement between two or more persons to defraud a person of his rights by the forms of law, or to obtain an object forbidden by law.\u201d The plaintiff contends that this definition is too narrow and that the court erred in not applying a broader definition of \u201ccollusion\u201d such as that contained in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (Unabridged Ed. 1966) in which \u201ccollude\u201d is defined as \u201cto connive with another: CONSPIRE, PLOT.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>Initially, we note that the plaintiff does not argue that the facts found by the trial court fail to support a finding of collusion under the definition given in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary; nor does the plaintiff assign as clearly erroneous the court\u2019s factual findings on this issue. Rather, the plaintiff argues solely for a broader definition of collusion than that relied upon by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The simple answer to this claim is that the plaintiff cited to the trial court, in its amended trial memorandum dated December 15, 1988, the very definition of collusion that the court applied. Unhappy with the result, however, the plaintiff now asks that we apply to the facts of this case a different definition of the word \u201ccollusion.\u201d We refuse to do so. A party may not secure a reversal on the basis of any invited error. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>212 Conn. 593, 611, 563 A.2d 671 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brokaw, </em>183 Conn. 29, 33, 438 A.2d 815 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\"> The Aetna policy covered the period 1969 through November 22,1982, and the Fire and Casualty policy covered the period November 1, 1982, through October 31, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
