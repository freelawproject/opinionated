Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AK7\">The plaintiff, Seymour Hammer, brought an action against the defendant, Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casualty Company, for its alleged failure to continue to provide lifetime disability payments in accordance with the terms of the group disability insurance policy issued to the plaintiff by the defendant. The defendant moved for summary judgment on the basis of an exclusion in the policy that limits benefits to two years if the total disability was caused by or resulted from \u201cmedical or surgical treatment.\u201d In granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court held, inter alia, that the plaintiff\u2019s disability resulted from medical or surgical treatment; thus, it denied the plaintiff lifetime disability benefits under the policy. From this judgment, the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, and, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, we transferred the case to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">The pleadings, affidavit and other documentary information presented to the trial court on the motion for summary judgment reveal the following undisputed facts. On August 18,1981, the plaintiff entered Mount Sinai Hospital for treatment of a stomach ulcer condition. As part of his treatment, the plaintiff\u2019s physician ordered a total parenteral nutrition (TPN) line to be installed. On August 28,1981, the plaintiff was found in the bathroom area of his hospital room in a semi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>conscious state with his TPN line disconnected. As a result of this incident, complications arose that led ultimately to the plaintiff\u2019s total disability. The plaintiff brought suit against Mount Sinai Hospital and several physicians alleging, inter alia, that their negligence and carelessness in the course of treating the plaintiff for his ulcer condition caused his injuries and disability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">At the time of the plaintiff\u2019s total disability, the plaintiff was insured by a group disability insurance policy issued to him by the defendant on July 1,1980. Shortly after August 28,1981, the date the plaintiff was found in a semiconscious condition, the defendant commenced paying monthly disability benefits in accordance with this policy in the amount of $1500 per month and continued to pay disability benefits until October 4,1983. In his amended complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had failed to continue to pay monthly disability payments in accordance with the terms of the insurance policy. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant had an obligation under the policy to continue to make disability payments so long as the plaintiff remained disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">On December 30, 1988, the defendant moved for summary judgment. In its motion, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff\u2019s total disability was caused by or resulted from \u201cmedical or surgical treatment,\u201d and therefore his benefits, under the terms of the policy, are limited to those provided for under the \u201csickness\u201d provision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In support of its motion, the defendant attached a copy of the insurance policy, the plaintiff\u2019s responses to the defendant\u2019s requests to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>admit, a copy of the plaintiffs complaint filed <em>in Hammer </em>v. <em>Mount Sinai Hospital, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. CV 830286323 S (August 23, 1989), and a memorandum of law. In opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion, the plaintiff filed an affidavit from David Bronster, a physician, and a memorandum of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">On June 8,1989, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion. In granting the motion, the court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s claim that, based on the affidavit of Bronster, the event that occurred on August 28,1981, \u201cwas of a complicated nature and was a highly unusual and unforeseen result of the installation of the [TPN line] and that such result must therefore be termed \u2018accidental\u2019 giving rise to an issue of material fact which can only be resolved at the time of trial.\u201d The court stated that \u201c[t]he plaintiff ha[d] not produced any documents to contest the defendant\u2019s contention that the plaintiff\u2019s disability resulted] from the installation of the TPN line which in turn was part of his treatment for his ulcer condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The court further stated that the language in the insurance policy, \u201cmedical or surgical treatment,\u201d was unambiguous. In so doing, it cited J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 415, which provides: \u201c \u2018The expression \u201cmedical and surgical treatment\u201d when used in the contract, includes all acts done by a physician in the preliminary care, general treatment or later care in order to effect a cure. . . . \u2019 \u201d Moreover, the court, in recognizing that our courts had not had occasion to pass upon this question, noted that other jurisdictions had applied similar exclusionary provisions to various mishaps which had occurred during the course of medical treatment, citing <em>Whetsell </em>v. <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York, </em>669 F.2d 955 (4th Cir. 1982), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>In conclusion, the court held that the \u201calleged negligent installation of the TPN line in connection with the plaintiffs treatment for a stomach ulcer constituted \u2018medical or surgical treatment\u2019 and thus the disability resulting therefrom is covered by the \u2018sickness\u2019 provisions of the policy.\u201d In addition, the court stated that \u201c[s]ince the defendant has paid the plaintiff for that period called for by such provision of the policy, i.e., two years, it has satisfied its obligation to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in (1) granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment because there existed a genuine issue of fact, and (2) concluding that the exclusionary provision, medical or surgical treatment, applies to improper medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The plaintiff first contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because there existed a genuine issue of fact, i.e., whether the plaintiff\u2019s total disability was caused by or resulted from \u201cmedical or surgical treatment.\u201d He maintains that Bronster\u2019s affidavit, filed by him in opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, presented evidence that his injury was \u201caccidental in nature.\u201d He asserts that it was a material question of fact whether his injury was the result of medical or surgical treatment or was the unforeseen result of his reaction to the insertion of the TPN line. The defendant contends, however, that the court properly granted its motion for summary judgment for two reasons: (1) the plaintiff failed to present any evidence to the trial court to contest the defendant\u2019s claim that the plaintiff\u2019s disability resulted from the installation of the TPN line which in turn was part of his treatment for his ulcer condition; and (2) the plaintiff is estopped from relitigating the cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>his disability because he is bound by the favorable judgment he received in the medical malpractice suit filed against Mount Sinai Hospital, which, we note, is presently on appeal. We conclude that the trial court did not err in granting the defendant\u2019s motion because the plaintiff failed to present evidence in opposition to the defendant\u2019s contention that the plaintiff\u2019s disability was caused by medical or surgical treatment. Because we agree with the defendant\u2019s first claim, we do not address the defendant\u2019s second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">\u201cOur standard of review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment is well established.\u201d <em>Zichichi </em>v. <em>Middlesex Memorial Hospital, </em>204 Conn. 399, 402, 528 A.2d 805 (1987). Practice Book \u00a7 384 provides that summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d See also <em>Zichichi </em>v. <em>Middlesex Memorial Hospital, </em>supra; <em>Catz </em>v. <em>Rubenstein, </em>201 Conn. 39, 48, 513 A.2d 98 (1986); <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>200 Conn. 562, 568, 512 A.2d 893 (1986). \u201c <em>\u2018A </em>\u201cmaterial\u201d fact has been defined adequately and simply as a fact which will make a difference in the result of the case.\u2019 <em>United Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Urban Redevelopment Commission, </em>[158 Conn. 364, 379, 260 A.2d 596 (1969)].\u201d <em>Catz </em>v. <em>Rubenstein, </em>supra. \u201cThe test is whether a party would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Goggin, </em>208 Conn. 606, 616, 546 A.2d 250 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">\u201cOnce the moving party has presented evidence in support of the motion for summary judgment, the opposing party must present evidence that demonstrates the existence of some disputed factual issue .... It is not enough, however, for the opposing party merely to assert the existence of such a disputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>issue. \u2018Mere assertions of fact . . . are insufficient to establish the existence of a material fact and, therefore, cannot refute evidence properly presented to the court under Practice Book \u00a7 380.\u2019 <em>Bartha </em>v. <em>Waterbury House Wrecking Co., </em>[190 Conn. 8, 12, 459 A.2d 115 (1983)]. \u2018The movant has the burden of showing the nonexistence of such issues but the evidence thus presented, if otherwise sufficient, is not rebutted by the bald statement that an issue of fact does exist.\u2019 <em>Kasowitz </em>v. <em>Mutual Construction Co., </em>154 Conn. 607, 613, 228 A.2d 149 (1967), quoting <em>Boyce </em>v. <em>Merchants Fire Ins. Co., </em>204 F. Sup. 311, 314 (D. Conn. 1962) . . . .\u201d <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Hartford Hospital, </em>192 Conn. 451, 455, 472 A.2d 1257 (1984); <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>supra, 568-69. \u201cTo oppose a motion for summary judgment successfully, the nonmovant must recite specific facts . . . which contradict those stated in the movant\u2019s affidavits and documents.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Goggin, </em>supra, 616-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">In support of its motion for summary judgment, the defendant filed a copy of the insurance policy, the plaintiff\u2019s responses to the defendant\u2019s requests to admit, a copy of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint filed in <em>Hammer </em>v. <em>Mount Sinai Hospital, </em>supra, and a memorandum of law. These documents alleged that the plaintiff\u2019s total disability was caused by the negligent installation and maintenance of the TPN line which was installed as part of the plaintiff\u2019s treatment for his ulcer condition. Among the plaintiff\u2019s answers to the defendant\u2019s requests to admit, the plaintiff admitted that \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s physicians at Mt. Sinai Hospital ordered, <em>as part of the treatment for plaintiff\u2019s ulcer condition, </em>that a Total Parenteral Nutrition Line be installed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We also note that, in the plaintiff\u2019s answers to the defendant\u2019s requests to admit, the plaintiff admitted that he had alleged \u201cthat the cause of [his] prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>lem was emboli which occurred as a result of the improper installation of said [TPN] Line or the maintenance of that device . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">In opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff presented Bronster\u2019s affidavit and a memorandum of law. In the affidavit, Bronster stated, inter alia, that while the plaintiff was in the hospital for his ulcer condition, <em>\u201ca </em>resident physician at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Hartford, Connecticut administered an intravenous device called a Total Parenteral Nutrition Line to [the plaintiff\u2019s] right chest and shoulder area with reported considerable difficulty causing substantial pain and anxiety to the [plaintiff]. As a result of this incident, [the plaintiff] suffered an incident wherein the distribution of certain blood vessels in his brain became infarcted thereby causing him to sustain diverse neurologic signs and symptoms .... As a result of this injury, the Plaintiff remains totally disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The plaintiff, in arguing and presenting documentary evidence that his total disability was caused by an accident, did not raise a material issue of fact that would have made a difference in the result of the case and consequently would have defeated the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The factor that was dis-positive on the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment was whether the plaintiff\u2019s total disability was caused by or resulted from \u201cmedical or surgical treatment.\u201d As will be discussed later in this opinion, the exclusion of medical or surgical treatment applies only if the insured\u2019s total disability was caused by an accident. In arguing that the exclusion applies to the plaintiff, the defendant, in effect, conceded that the plaintiff\u2019s total disability was caused by an accident. It was not enough for the plaintiff, in order to defeat the defendant\u2019s motion, merely to show that his total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>disability was caused by an accident. To have raised an issue of material fact to the trial court, some evidence showing the existence of an issue of material fact must have been presented in the counteraffidavit. As the trial court found, the plaintiff failed to present such evidence, which was necessary to overcome the defendant\u2019s contention that his total disability was caused by or resulted from \u201cmedical or surgical treatment.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>We conclude that there was no issue of material fact presented to the trial court and, thus, the court properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. \u201cWhere the character of a death or injury sustained in connection with medical treatment is determinable from evidence permitting only one conclusion, no submissible case exists.\u201d 10 G. Couch, Insurance (Rhodes 2d Ed.) \u00a7 41:127.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The plaintiff next contends that the trial court erred in concluding that the exclusionary provision applies to improper medical treatment. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in (1) finding the exclusionary provision, medical or surgical treatment, unambiguous, and (2) relying on <em>Whetsell </em>v. <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York, </em>supra, to support its decision. We are not persuaded by the plaintiff\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The plaintiff maintains that the term \u201cmedical or surgical treatment\u201d is ambiguous because it allows for two reasonable constructions. The plaintiff asserts in his brief that \u201c[o]ne construction is that all medical or surgical treatment, no matter how skillfully or unskillfully performed, is covered by that phrase.\u201d Thus, the plaintiff continues, \u201cpatently negligent treatment, such as amputating the wrong leg, would be included within the ambit of this term.\u201d The second construction, which the plaintiff\u2019s brief states is \u201cequally reasonable,\u201d \u201cis that improper treatment, or malpractice, which is an accident, is not included within the meaning of that phrase.\u201d The plaintiff contends, therefore, that because there are two reasonable constructions of the phrase \u201cmedical or surgical treatment,\u201d the phrase is ambiguous and, thus, in accordance with familiar principles, should be construed in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The defendant, on the other hand, contends that the language in the policy is clear and unambiguous. The defendant asserts that there are no words in the policy that require a distinction between \u201cproper and improper\u201d medical treatment. It maintains that the phrase \u201cmedical or surgical treatment\u201d applies to any and all treatment. The defendant claims that the policy does not differentiate between the \u201cquality of treatment or whether disability results from negligent medical treatment or from unforeseen consequences of \u2018proper\u2019 treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">\u201cIt is the function of the court to construe the provisions of the contract of insurance.\u201d <em>Gottesman </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>177 Conn. 631, 634, 418 A.2d 944 (1979). We recently noted in <em>Schultz </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 696, 702, 569 A.2d 1131 (1990): \u201cAn insurance policy is to be interpreted by the same general rules that govern the construction of any written contract and enforced in accordance with the real intent of the parties as expressed in the language employed in the policy. <em>Izzo </em>v. <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co., </em>203 Conn. 305, 309, 524 A.2d 641 (1987); <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Union Labor Life Ins. Co., </em>186 Conn. 507, 512-13, 442 A.2d 920 (1982); <em>Gottesman </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>[supra].\u201d \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe determinative question is the intent of the parties, that is, what coverage the . . . [plaintiff] expected to receive and what the defendant was to provide, as disclosed by the provisions of the policy.\u201d <em>Marcolini </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>160 Conn. 280, 283, 278 A.2d 796 [1971]. <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Union Labor Life Ins. Co., </em>supra. If the words in the policy \u201care plain and unambiguous the established rules for the construction of contracts apply, the language, from which the intention of the parties is to be deduced, must be accorded its natural and ordinary meaning, and courts cannot indulge in a forced construction ignoring provisions or so distorting them as to accord a meaning other than that evidently intended by the parties.\u201d <em>Plainville </em>v. <em>Travelers Indem</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number><em>nity Co., </em>178 Conn. 664, 675, 425 A.2d 131 (1979). \u201cIf the \u2018insurance coverage is defined in terms that are ambiguous, such ambiguity is . . . resolved against the insurance company. \u201cWhere the terms of the policy are of doubtful meaning, the construction most favorable to the insured will be adopted.\u201d <em>LaBonte </em>v. <em>Federal Mutual Ins. Co., </em>159 Conn. 252, 256, 268 A.2d 663 (1970); see also <em>Griswold v. Union Labor Life Ins. Co., </em>[supra]; <em>Simses </em>v. <em>North America Co. for Life &amp; Health Ins., </em>175 Conn. 77, 84-85, 394 A.2d 710 (1978).\u2019 <em>Beach </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>205 Conn. 246, 250, 532 A.2d 1297 (1987).\u201d <em>Schultz </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>supra. However, \u201c \u2018[a] court will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity, and words do not become ambiguous simply because lawyers or laymen contend for different meanings.\u2019 <em>Downs </em>v. <em>National Casualty Co., </em>146 Conn. 490, 494-95, 152 A.2d 316 (1959).\u201d Id., 703. We conclude that the exclusion \u201cmedical or surgical treatment\u201d is unambiguous. \u201cGiven [the] natural and ordinary meaning, [it] expresses] the intent of the parties.\u201d <em>Marcolini </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 284; see <em>A. M. Larson Co. </em>v. <em>Lawlor Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>153 Conn. 618, 622, 220 A.2d 32 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">A disability insurance policy insures \u201cagainst the inability to pursue a livelihood arising either from accident or illness.\u201d 1 J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 23. The disability insurance policy<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>appeal insures against total disability resulting from or caused by accident and sickness. Part I of the \u201cBene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>fits\u201d section of the policy is entitled, \u201cMonthly Accident Indemnity.\u201d Part I provides a lifetime indemnity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>period for \u201cTotal Disability . . . due to injury.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Injury is defined in the definition section of the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>as \u201cbodily injury caused by an <em>accident </em>occurring while the Policy is in force as to the Insured.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Part I further provides: \u201cFor the purposes of this Part I any period of Total Disability caused by or resulting from (1) disease or <em>medical or surgical treatment </em>therefor, (2) infection other than pus-forming infection sustained through an accidental cut or wound, or (3) hernia of any kind, however caused, shall be considered as disability from Sickness, subject to the provisions in Part II.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Part II of the \u201cBenefits\u201d section in the policy is entitled \u201cMonthly Sickness Indemnity.\u201d This provision provides benefits for two years for total disability resulting from sickness. Sickness is defined in the policy as \u201csickness or disease which causes a period of disability, such disability commencing while the Policy is in force as to the Insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The focus of the plaintiffs claim of error is on the exclusionary provision in Part I of the \u201cBenefits\u201d section, specifically, that part of the provision that excludes from lifetime disability benefits total disability \u201ccaused by or resulting from . . . medical or surgical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">\u201cProvisions in insurance policies excepting particular losses from the coverage thereof are ordinarily valid, for the parties to a contract of insurance have the right to limit or qualify the extent of the insurer\u2019s liability in any manner not inconsistent with statutory forms or provisions or contrary to public policy. And an insurance company may exclude from coverage death [or disability] caused by any particular accident . . . . \u201d 10 G. Couch, supra, \u00a7 41:378. \u201cThe reason for or purpose of an exclusion clause in a policy is to eliminate from coverage specified losses . . . which except for the exclusion clause would remain under the coverage.\u201d Id., \u00a7 41:380. \u201cIn an insurance policy, an exclusion is a provision which eliminates coverage where, were it not for the exclusion, coverage would have existed.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number><em>Kansas-Nebraska Natural Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Hawkeye-Security Ins. Co., </em>195 Neb. 658, 664, 240 N.W.2d 28 (1976); <em>Modern Sounds &amp; Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Federated Mutual Ins. Co., </em>200 Neb. 46, 50, 262 N.W.2d 183 (1978); <em>Bortz </em>v. <em>Merrimac Mutual Ins. Co., </em>92 Wis. 2d 865, 871, 286 N.W.2d 16 (1979); see also 3 R. Long, Law of Liability Insurance \u00a7 17.15. \u201c[T]he word \u2018exclusion\u2019 signifies subject matter or circumstances in which the insurance company will not assume liability for a specific risk or hazard that otherwise would be included within the general scope of the policy. See Keeton, Basic Text of Insurance Law 307 (1971).\u201d <em>Ideal Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>593 F. Sup. 466, 468 (N.D. Ga. 1983). \u201cIt is apparent, then, that before the need for an exclusion arises, there must first be coverage within the defined scope of the policy.\u201d <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>Boston Old Colony Ins. Co., </em>67 App. Div. 2d 757, 758, 412 N.Y.S.2d 465 (1979). Thus, before the exclusion, \u201cmedical or surgical treatment\u201d in Part I can be applied, there must first be coverage under Part I of the policy. As previously noted, Part I provides lifetime disability benefits for total disability caused by an accident. Therefore, the exclusionary provision, \u201cmedical or surgical treatment,\u201d eliminates from lifetime disability benefits \u201caccidents\u201d caused by or resulting from \u201cmedical or surgical treatment.\u201d See <em>Whetsell </em>v. <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York, </em>supra, 957.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">This interpretation of the exclusion does not include \u201call medical or surgical treatment, no matter how skillfully or unskillfully performed\u201d as the plaintiff has suggested. In order for the exclusion to apply, there must first be an \u201caccident.\u201d If the \u201caccident\u201d was caused by or resulted from \u201cmedical or surgical treatment,\u201d then the insured is limited to disability benefits provided for in the \u201csickness\u201d provision, i.e., two years. According to the language of the policy, if medical treatment was properly performed or \u201cskillfully\u201d performed, without unforeseen consequences, there would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>not be an \u201caccident\u201d caused by \u201cmedical or surgical treatment,\u201d and thus the exclusion would not apply. One court has said: \u201c[Total Disability] must be caused by an accident before the [lifetime disability] benefits of the policy come into play. An accident is an unintended occurrence. If such happens during medical treatment, it is still an accident, but it is not a risk assumed by the insurance company under the terms of the policy.\u201d <em>Whetsell v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York, </em>supra; see also <em>Pickard </em>v. <em>Transamerica Occidental Life Ins. Co., </em>663 F. Sup. 126, 127 (E.D. Mich 1987); <em>Reid v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>440 F. Sup. 1182, 1183 (S.D.Ill. 1977), aff'd, 588 F.2d 835 (7th Cir. 1978); <em>Bracey </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>54 Misc. 2d 175, 180, 282 N.Y.S.2d 121 (1967). The only reasonable interpretation of the exclusionary provision is that it specifically excludes from lifetime disability benefits accidents caused by or resulting from \u201cmedical or surgical treatment\u201d causing total disability. Thus, the trial court did not err in finding the exclusionary provision, \u201cmedical or surgical treatment,\u201d unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The plaintiff contends, however, that this interpretation is inconsistent with the reasonable expectations of an insured. He asserts that an insured would not expect the exclusion to encompass improper \u201cmedical or surgical treatment\u201d but rather only complications arising from proper treatment. He maintains that the risks attendant with proper treatment, not improper treatment, are the risks a reasonable person would import to those terms. There is no question raised in this case as to whether the plaintiffs total disability was caused by an accident, i.e., improper or negligent medical treatment. The insurance policy does not, however, provide lifetime disability benefits for all accidents causing total disability. The exclusionary provision excludes not only accidents resulting from or caused by \u201cdisease or medical or surgical treatment therefor,\u201d but also \u201cinfection other than pus-forming infection sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>tained through an accidental cut or wound\u201d and \u201chernia of any kind, however caused.\u201d \u201cThese were obviously inserted for the purpose of withdrawing from the coverage certain specific risks.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>143 Conn. 25, 28, 119 A.2d 329 (1955). Moreover, although the policy excludes these risks from lifetime disability benefits, it provides benefits for such risks for two years under the \u201csickness\u201d provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">\u201cThe average policyholder could not reasonably reach a conclusion of coverage in the particular circumstances here \u2018in the light of and having in mind the language of the . . . [exclusionary provision].\u2019 <em>Harris </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., </em>[41 N.J. 565, 568, 197 A.2d 863 (1964)]. Adoption of the plaintiff\u2019s contention in the light of the . . . language of the [exclusionary provision] here would \u2018render meaningless the words by which the parties expressed their bargain\u2019 and read into the contract something which is not there.\u201d <em>Dinkowitz </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>90 N.J. Super. 181, 189, 216 A.2d 613 (1966). When the language of the policy is clear and unambiguous, the court is bound to apply the natural and ordinary meaning of the words employed. See <em>Schultz </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>supra. A court cannot rewrite the policy of insurance or read into the insurance contract that which is not there. See <em>Fidelity Trust Co. </em>v. <em>BVD Associates, </em>196 Conn. 270, 282, 492 A.2d 180 (1985). \u201c[T]he liability of the insurer is not to be extended beyond the express terms of the contract.\u201d <em>Plainville </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>supra, 675. Therefore, given the natural and ordinary meaning, the policy expresses the reasonable expectations of the parties. <em>General Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>151 Conn. 684, 686, 202 A.2d 146 (1964). We, therefore, cannot accept the plaintiffs claims concerning reasonable expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The plaintiff next contends that the trial court erred in relying on <em>Whetsell </em>v. <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number><em>York, </em>supra. He maintains that <em>Whetsell </em>is \u201cpoor logic.\u201d He asserts that a \u201cserious flaw in the <em>Whetsell </em>decision is its rationale that the exclusionary provision would be rendered meaningless if it did not apply to medical malpractice.\u201d He contends that this rationale is based on the following incorrect assumption: \u201cSince all deaths caused by medical treatment necessarily involve mistreatment, to say that mistreatment is not covered by the exclusion is to say that the provision excludes nothing.\u201d Id., 957. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">In <em>Whetsell </em>v. <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York, </em>supra, 956, the plaintiff brought an action against the defendant, claiming that she was entitled to double indemnity for accidental death under the life insurance policies issued by the defendant on the life of her husband. The plaintiffs husband, while in the hospital recovering from cataract surgery, was intravenously given a saline solution. Id. An infected intravenous needle was used, however, causing the decedent to contract bacterial endocarditis from which he died. The insurance policy under which the decedent was insured provided for accidental death benefits if the death occurred \u201c(a) directly and independently of all other causes, as a result of accidental bodily injuries . . . (c) from a cause not mentioned under \u2018Risks Not Assumed.\u2019 \u201d Id. The policy provided under \u201cRisks not Assumed\u201d that the company is not liable for <em>\u201cdeath caused or contributed to, directly or indirectly, by disease, by bodily or mental infirmity, or by treatment or operation for disease or bodily or mental </em>infirmity.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Prior to deciding whether the above provision excluded from coverage death caused by medical mistreatment, the <em>Whetsell </em>court noted that \u201cevery court that has considered similar exclusionary clauses has held such provisions to exclude from coverage death caused by various mishaps occurring during the course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>of medical treatment.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id. In particular, the court stated that the case most similar to the facts presented to it was <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>supra. In <em>Reid, </em>the court held that death caused by a poison that was inadvertently substituted for a saline solution fell within the exclusionary provision excluding accidental death benefits coverage for death \u201c \u2018caused or contributed to by, or as a consequence of . . . medical or surgical treatment.\u2019 \u201d Id., 957. In <em>Whetsell, </em>the court noted that \u201cto come to a conclusion different from that of the <em>Reid </em>court would render the exclusionary provision meaningless. Death is never caused by medical treatment absent some misdiagnosis or mistake. Though death may result where proper medical treatment is unsuccessful, death in those cases is caused by the preexisting infirmity, not medical treatment. Since all deaths caused by medical treatment necessarily involve mistreatment, to say that mistreatment is not covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>by the exclusion is to say that the provision excludes nothing.\u201d Id. The court further noted that: \u201cDeath must be caused by an accident before the accidental death benefits of the policy come into play. An accident is an unintended occurrence. If such happens during medical treatment, it is still an accident, but it is not a risk assumed by the insurance company under the terms of the policy. The use of an infected I.V. needle was not intended, therefore, it was an accident. However, this occurred as a part of medical treatment, so it is excluded by the clear language of the policy.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">It is clear that the plaintiff has isolated a part of the court\u2019s rationale in arguing that <em>Whetsell </em>is \u201cpoor logic.\u201d The court\u2019s reasoning that the exclusionary provision would be rendered meaningless if it did not apply to \u201cmistreatment\u201d is based on the clear language of the policy. Id. The insurance policy involved in <em>Whetsell </em>provided double recovery in the event of accidental death. The policy specifically excluded, however, accidental \u201cdeath caused ... by treatment.\u201d The court reasoned that if the exclusion did not apply to an accident that occurred during medical treatment resulting in the death of the insured, it would exclude nothing. If there was no accident during treatment, then there would not be coverage for accidental death and, thus, the exclusion would not be triggered. The court then, applying the facts to the exclusion, found the insured\u2019s death to have been an accident that occurred during medical treatment, on the basis of the \u201cclear language of the policy,\u201d denied the plaintiff double recovery for accidental death. Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s contention, we conclude that the decision in <em>Whetsell </em>is based on sound logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Moreover, in accordance with the reasoning in <em>Whetsell, </em>if the exclusion in the present case, \u201cmedical or surgical treatment,\u201d did not apply to improper treatment resulting in an \u201caccident,\u201d we conclude that it would \u201cexclude nothing.\u201d The exclusionary provision in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>present case, as already noted, is encompassed within Part I of the \u201cBenefits\u201d section of the policy. The exclusion specifically excludes accidents caused by medical or surgical treatment. As one court noted: \u201c[A] construction of an exclusion clause which merely exclude[s] losses that . . . [are] not the proximate result of an insured risk would be meaningless because there could be no liability for such losses in the absence of an exclusion.\u201d <em>Commercial Standard Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gilmore, Gardner &amp; Kirk Oil Co., </em>157 F.2d 929, 931-32, (10th Cir. 1946). In other words, if the exclusion does not exclude a risk that is covered in the policy, it is meaningless. Therefore, if the exclusion does not apply to total disability caused by an <em>accident </em>that occurred during medical or surgical treatment, it would be rendered meaningless. \u201c \u2018Every provision is to be given effect, if possible, and no word or clause eliminated as meaningless, or disregarded as inoperative, if any reasonable meaning consistent with the other parts of the policy can be given to it.\u2019 <em>Downs </em>v. <em>National Casualty Co., </em>[146 Conn. 490, 495, 152 A.2d 316 (1959)].\u201d <em>Schultz </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins.

Co., </em>585 S.W.2d 163 (Mo. App. 1979), for support of his contention that the trial court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment because an issue of material fact existed. We find <em>Mayfield </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>supra, inapposite. In that case, the plaintiff appealed to the Missouri Court of Appeals from a jury verdict in favor of the defendant. Id., 164. The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for the \u201cdouble indemnity benefit\u201d contained in an insurance policy issued by the defendant on the life of Loomis Mayfield, the plaintiff\u2019s husband. Loomis Mayfield underwent surgery for an exploratory laparotomy and colostomy. Id., 165. During the course of the surgery, Loomis was anesthetized and an endotracheal tube was inserted. After surgery, Loomis was transferred to the intensive care unit with the tube still intact. Soon after Loomis was in that unit, the tube became dislodged. Immediately following the tube dislodgement, Loomis became comatose and remained in that condition until his death. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The trial court, in instructing the jury, stated that \u201c[y]our verdict must be for the Defendant if you believe . . . That Loomis F. Mayfield\u2019s death was the <em>direct result </em>of any one or more of the conditions referred to in Paragraph First.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 165 n.2. Paragraph First referred to medical or surgical treatment. The Court of Appeals held that this instruction was \u201cprejudicially erroneous in that there was no evidentiary support for the proposition set forth in it that the death of Loomis directly resulted from medical or surgical treatment.\u201d Id., 168. The policy at issue in <em>May-field </em>eliminated coverage if the death resulted \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d from medical or surgical treatment. Id., 166. The court, in referring to several cases that have applied a similar exclusion, stated: \u201cIn each of the foregoing cases the <em>administration </em>of treatment played the fatal role. In the case at bar the evidence, if believed by the jury, supported a finding that the <em>cessation </em>of treatment, occasioned by the dislodgement, was the death-producing factor. There is no evidence to show that the dislodgement of the tube inflicted a physical injury. It was merely a matter of the tube, upon dislodgement, no longer performing its beneficial function.\u201d Id., 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">This case is inapposite to the present case. The court in <em>Mayfield </em>noted that there was no evidence to support the trial court\u2019s instruction that Loomis\u2019 death directly resulted from medical or surgical treatment.

He maintains that only two of the cases deal with improper treatment. The rest of the cases, he contends, deal with unusual reactions or complications arising during the course of proper treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">We are unpersuaded by the plaintiff\u2019s analysis of the cases cited in the footnote of the <em>Whetsell </em>decision. We will not, however, embark on the task of presenting and analyzing each of the twelve cases cited in the footnote as the plaintiff and the defendant have attempted to do in their briefs. We do note, however, that several of those cases cited indicate that before the courts applied the exclusion of \u201cmedical or surgical treatment,\u201d they first found that the decedent\u2019s death was caused by an accident, although the courts did not engage in much discussion or analysis as to the cause of the accident. See <em>Barkerding </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>82 F.2d 358 (5th Cir. 1936); <em>McKay </em>v. <em>Banker\u2019s Life Co., </em>187 N.W.2d 736 (Iowa 1971); <em>Pitman </em>v. <em>Commercial Travellers Eastern Accident Assn., </em>284 Mass. 467, 188 N.E. 241 (1930); <em>Century Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>126 Tex. 214, 86 S.W.2d 1083 (1935). One case cited in footnote 1 of <em>Whetsell </em>applied the exclusion of medical or surgical treatment without a finding that the injury was caused by an accident because the exclusionary provision did not require the initial finding of an accident unlike the policy presented in the present case. See <em>Order of United Commercial Travelers </em>v. <em>Shane, </em>64 F.2d 55 (8th Cir. 1933).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b613-5\"> In addition, the plaintiff contends that <em>Whetsell </em>v. <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York, </em>669 F.2d 955 (4th Cir. 1982), is poor history. He asserts that \u201c[ejarlier in the century, it appears to have been common for accident policies to exclude coverage unless the injuries were caused by \u2018accidental means.\u2019 \u201d He then cites several cases that discuss the difference between \u201caccidental means\u201d and \u201caccidental results.\u201d He declares that \u201c[ijnsurance companies apparently became concerned that the phrase \u2018accidental means\u2019 was spawning too much conflict among the courts, for beginning in the 1960\u2019s the language found in the present policy starts appearing in litigation in lieu of the phrase \u2018accidental means.\u2019 \u201d Thus, the plaintiff asserts, \u201ca sensible historical interpretation of the present language is that its purpose was to insure to the extent possible\u201d that accident coverage would be denied for injuries that were unusual or unexpected. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">We note that the plaintiff has failed to cite authority for this \u201chistorical interpretation\u201d and \u201cpurpose\u201d of the exclusionary provision involved in this case. In addition, we point out that the words \u201cmedical and surgical treatment\u201d have been cited in cases as part of an exclusion in an insurance policy since at least the 1980s, contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>that this language began to appear in insurance policies in the 1960s. See <em>Barkerding </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>82 F.2d 358 (5th Cir. 1936); <em>Order of United Commercial Travelers </em>v. <em>Shane, </em>64 F.2d 55 (8th Cir. 1933); <em>Pitman </em>v. <em>Commercial Traveller\u2019s Eastern Accident Assn., </em>284 Mass. 467, 188 N.E. 241 (1930); <em>New Amsterdam Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Perryman, </em>162 Miss. 864, 140 So. 342 (1932); <em>Century Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>126 Tex. 214, 86 S.W.2d 1083 (1935). Thus, it does not appear that the purpose of the exclusion, medical or surgical treatment, was, as the plaintiff contends, in response to the conflict concerning accidental means and accidental results.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
