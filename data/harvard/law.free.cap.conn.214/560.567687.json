Wheaton, the commissioner of the department of children and youth services (DCYS), acting through the attorney general, had issued a letter, on February 7,1989, ordering it to cease its activities in the placement and adoption of Connecticut children. The defendants moved to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, claiming that the appeal had not been taken from a final decision of the agency in a \u201ccontested case\u201d and that administrative remedies had not been exhausted,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> both as required by General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>court granted the motion to dismiss for lack of a decision in a \u201ccontested case\u201d and the plaintiff has appealed from that judgment. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">There is no controversy about the subordinate facts, which may be ascertained from the complaint, from affidavits supporting and opposing the motion to dismiss filed by the parties and from testimony presented at a combined hearing on both the motion to dismiss and a motion of the plaintiff for a stay of the DCYS order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff, a child placement agency licensed by the state of Illinois, has been arranging for out-of-state children to be adopted in Connecticut since 1979. It has no license from this state, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 17-49a<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for any agency seeking to \u201cplace out in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>any . . . adoption home . . . any child either on a temporary or permanent basis,\u201d nor has it ever applied for such a license. The plaintiff cannot obtain a license as a child placement agency in this state because it is not a tax exempt organization, as General Statutes \u00a7 17-49b (a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">The inability of the plaintiff to obtain a license pursuant to \u00a7 17-49a has not been regarded by DCYS as any reason for withholding permission for the placement of out-of-state children for adoption by Connecticut families pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-51.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Since 1979, DCYS has regularly granted such permission and does not object to continuation of this activity by the plaintiff. The plaintiff does not claim to have received DCYS approval for placement of a Connecticut child, except in one instance that occurred after the letter directing the plaintiff to cease this activity had been issued.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After DCYS discovered that the plaintiff had been placing Connecticut children with families in both this state and other states, it issued the letter dated February 7, 1989, ordering it to cease doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">In dismissing the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the trial court concluded that the complaint failed to allege that the plaintiff had been licensed as a child-placing agency in this state or that it had been approved by DCYS to place a Connecticut child for adoption, except in the instance previously mentioned. The complaint, however, does allege that the plaintiff \u201cwas approved as an out-of-state child-placing agency to conduct child-placing activities in the State of Connecticut by DCYS.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (3), at the time of the appeal, defined \u201clicense\u201d to include \u201cthe whole or any part of any agency permit, certificate, <em>approval, </em>registration, charter, or similar form of per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>mission required by law . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The ambiguity as to whether these \u201capproved\u201d child-placing activities included the placement of Connecticut children was resolved by the testimony at the hearing on the motion to dismiss. This testimony indicated that the DCYS approvals alleged in the complaint related solely to the placement of out-of-state children in Connecticut pursuant to \u00a7 17-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Whether the DCYS letter directing the plaintiff to cease engaging in the placement and adoption of Connecticut children constitutes a final decision in a \u201ccontested case\u201d depends upon whether the plaintiff had obtained a license to conduct those activities in this state that the letter has effectively revoked. Section 4-182 (c) of our Uniform Administrative Procedure Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (UAPA) provides that \u201c[n]o revocation ... of any license is lawful unless, prior to the institution of agency proceedings, the agency gave notice by mail to the licensee of facts or conduct which warrant the intended action, and the licensee was given an opportunity to show compliance with all lawful requirements for the retention of the license.\u201d DCYS concedes that no such notice or opportunity to be heard was given to the plaintiff prior to issuance of the letter. A \u201ccontested case,\u201d as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (2),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is \u201ca proceeding, including but not restricted to . . . licens<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>ing, in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of a party are required by statute to be determined by an gency after an opportunity for hearing . . . . \u201d If the plaintiff had a license to conduct the activities that the DCYS letter prohibited it from engaging in, therefore, \u00a7 4-182 (c) entitled the plaintiff to notice and an opportunity for a hearing prior to such a license revocation. The issuance of the letter, as the plaintiff argues, would then have been \u201ca proceeding . . . in which the legal rights ... of a party are required by statute [\u00a7 4-182 (c)] to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for hearing\u201d and thus would have satisfied the definition of a \u201ccontested case\u201d in \u00a7 4-166 (2) so that the present appeal would be authorized by \u00a7 4-183 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">The jurisdictional issue, therefore, turns upon whether the plaintiff in fact had a license or an equivalent approval to engage in the placement and adoption of Connecticut children. Section 17-49a of our child welfare laws provides that \u201c[n]o person, agency ... or other organization . . . shall place out in any free, working or adoption home . . . any child either on a temporary or permanent basis without a license obtained from [DCYS]\u201d and that \u201c[application for such a license shall be in a form furnished by the commissioner . . . .\u201d The plaintiff concedes that it has never held or even applied for a license as prescribed by \u00a7 17-49a. It maintains, however, that, because DCYS had approved its placement of out-of-state children in Connecticut homes for approximately ten years, these approvals constituted a license to place Connecticut children in homes in this state or in other states. The plaintiff relies upon \u00a7 4-166 of the UAPA, which defines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>\u201clicense\u201d to include \u201cthe whole or part of any agency . . . <em>approval </em>... or similar form of permission required by law . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) It contends that there is no statutory distinction between placing out-of-state children in Connecticut homes, which it has been doing for ten years with DCYS approval, and its more recent activity of placing Connecticut children, which DCYS seeks to prohibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">DCYS maintains, however, that there is such a distinction and that any approval that it may have granted of the plaintiffs activities in this state related exclusively to the placement of out-of-state children in Connecticut homes pursuant to \u00a7 17-51, which does not require a license for such a child placement activity. Section 17-51 requires that \u201c[a]ny person or . . . agency . . . before bringing or sending any child into the state for the purpose of placing or caring for him in any home or institution . . . shall make application to [DCYS], giving the name, the age and a personal description of such child, the name and address of the <em>person, home or institution </em>with whom the child is to be placed, and such other information as may be required by said commissioner. <em>Such person or institution </em>shall be licensed by said commissioner under the provisions of sections 17-48 and 17-50.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The possible ambiguity in the italicized reference to \u201c[s]uch person or institution\u201d in this statute is clarified by the reference to General Statutes \u00a7 17-48,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which applies to the licensing of child care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>facilities rather than child placement agencies. DCYS has consistently construed \u00a7 17-51 not to require a license for an out-of-state agency to place a child in Connecticut but to require only that the child be placed with a child care facility licensed pursuant to \u00a7 17-48 and General Statutes \u00a7 17-50. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The application that \u00a7 17-51 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>requires the out-of-state agency to file is for the purpose of obtaining \u201cpermission\u201d from DCYS for the placement of a particular child. The grant of such permission does not imply approval of other child placement activities by the agency or authorize such activities in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Section 17-49a, unlike \u00a7 17-51, is not restricted to the placement of out-of-state children, since it refers to the placement of \u201cany child\u201d and requires a child-placing agency to obtain a license before engaging in that activity. The fact that DCYS has construed \u00a7 17-51 to create an exception to the licensing requirement of \u00a7 17-49a for agencies seeking to place out-of-state children in Connecticut does not affect the application of the statute to all agencies engaged in the placement of Connecticut children. The permission DCYS has granted pursuant to \u00a7 17-51 for particular child placements sought by the plaintiff for out-of-state children, therefore, cannot reasonably be deemed approval of its activities in the placement of Connecticut children, as the plaintiff claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>The plaintiff also argues that a provision of General Statutes \u00a7 45-61c (a)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> allowing a petition for termination of parental rights to be filed by \u201c(4) a duly authorized officer of any child care agency or child-placing agency or organization . . . approved by [DCYS],\u201d implies that \u201capproved\u201d in-state and out-of-state child placing agencies are on \u201cequal footing\u201d with respect to conducting child placement activities in Connecticut. It contends that, consequently, no distinction can be made between an agency licensed under \u00a7 17-49a and one that has been approved for placement of an out-of-state child in Connecticut pursuant to \u00a7 17-51. General Statutes \u00a7 45-61b (c),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> however, defines a \u201cchild-placing agency\u201d as \u201cany agency within or without the state of Connecticut licensed or approved by [DCYS] <em>in accordance with sections 17-U0 a and 17-50, </em>and in accordance with standards established by regulations of [DCYS].\u201d (Emphasis added.) Since the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>tiff has never been licensed pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 17-49a and 17-50, it does not satisfy this definition of a \u201cchild-placing agency\u201d and, therefore, its officers are not qualified to petition for termination of parental rights under \u00a7 45-61c (a) (4).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We agree with the plaintiff that \u00a7 45-61b (c) in defining a \u201cchild-placing agency\u201d makes no distinction between in-state and out-of-state agencies that have been \u201clicensed or approved\u201d by DCYS pursuant to \u00a7 \u00a7 17-49a and 17-50, but this even handed statutory treatment is of no benefit to the plaintiff, which has not been licensed or approved in accordance with those statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">Finally, the plaintiff relies upon \u00a7 17-49b-47<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which provides for the approval by DCYS of \u201cout-of-state private child-placing agencies seeking to place children in Connecticut for the purpose of foster care or adoption\u201d and specifies the information to be furnished in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>applying for such approval. DCYS concedes that the plaintiff has been approved pursuant to this regulation in relation to its activities in placing out-of-state children in Connecticut and in conjunction with granting the \u201cpermission of [the] commissioner ... for the placement of [an out-of-state] child,\u201d as required by \u00a7 17-51. DCYS maintains that the applicability of this regulation only to \u201cout-of-state private child-placing agencies seeking to place children in Connecticut\u201d as well as the reference in subsection (e) of the regulation to \u201cbringing or sending the child to Connecticut\u201d make it clear that a grant of approval pursuant to the regulation authorizes agency activities in the placement of only out-of-state children in this state. We agree with this interpretation of the regulation. Thus, the approval the plaintiff has obtained from DCYS as an out-of-state child placement agency pursuant to this regulation cannot be expanded to include the placement of Connecticut children, for which \u00a7 17-49a plainly requires a license issued in accordance with specified procedures that the plaintiff has not followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">We conclude that the plaintiff has never obtained DCYS approval of its activities in the placement of Connecticut children and, therefore, that \u00a7 4-182 (c), requiring notice and opportunity for a hearing before a revocation of a \u201clicense,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 4-166 is inapplicable. Since there is no prior notice and hearing requirement absent a license, the issuance of the DCYS letter prohibiting such activities was not illegal and did not constitute a \u201ccontested case\u201d within \u00a7 4-166. Accordingly, the plaintiffs appeal was not taken from a decision in a contested case, as required by \u00a7 4-183 (a), and the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal, which was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-6\"> The trial court decided that the appeal had not been taken from a final decision of the agency and did not address the claim of failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The plaintiff claims that no such administrative remedy is available because it cannot satisfy one of the statutory licensing requirements. Because we conclude that the appeal has not been taken from a decision in a \u201ccontested case\u201d and thus should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, we do not consider the exhaustion issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b579-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a), when this appeal was brought to the Superior Court, provided: \u201cA person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal under this chapter, provided, in case of conflict between this chapter and federal statutes or regulations relating to limitations of periods of time, procedures for filing appeals or jurisdiction or venue of any court or tribunal, such federal provisions shall prevail. A preliminary, procedural or intermediate agency action or ruling is immediately reviewable if review of the final agency decision would not provide an adequate remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">An amendment to this statute became effective on July 1, 1989, after the appeal had been commenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b580-5\"> The motion for a stay was denied by the trial court. The plaintiff has raised this ruling as an issue on appeal in this court, but we do not address it in view of our conclusion that jurisdiction is lacking.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b580-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 17-49a. licensing of child-placing agencies.
