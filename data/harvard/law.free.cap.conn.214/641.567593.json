O\u2019Sullivan, brought this action against the defendant, William S. Bergenty, in two counts, the first seeking specific performance of a contract to convey real estate, and the second seeking money damages. The trial court rendered judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>of specific performance in favor of the plaintiff, but denied money damages. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The facts found by the trial court, as reflected in the record, are essentially as follows. The real estate involved in this action is commercial property that is owned by Bergenty, and located at 433 Farmington Avenue in Plainville. O\u2019Sullivan had leased the property from Bergenty for approximately eight years, and during that time O\u2019Sullivan had owned and operated several automobile sales businesses on the property. The rental payments for the property ranged from $1000 to $1300 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Throughout the course of the eight year landlord-tenant relationship, .there had been continuous negotiations between the parties for the purchase of the property by O\u2019Sullivan. In the spring or summer of 1984, the negotiations resulted in a proposed draft agreement which, on December 20,1984, became a signed and witnessed buy-sell agreement. Neither O\u2019Sullivan nor Bergenty, nor any witness to the agreement, denied the execution of the written agreement. The written agreement consisted of two parts, a written contract <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>a promissory note.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The written contract provided, in part, that payment was to be made: \u201cBy tendering seller at time of closing a properly executed purchase money mortgage in the principal amount of $175,000.00, payable over of (sic) 180 consecutive months commencing 30 days after closing in equal monthly installments of $2,100.30 each until said mortgage note is fully paid. Said prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>cipal amount shall bear interest at the rate of 12% per annum. The A.P.R. may vary at option of Buyer.\u201d The promissory note, which was for $25,000, was executed by O\u2019Sullivan on December 20, 1984, and was made payable to Bergenty. It was tied to the agreement by providing that it \u201cshall be paid in full on or before the date of closing for property described in the Buy-Sell Agreement dated December 20, 1984 between said KEVIN C. O\u2019SULLIVAN and WILLIAM [BERGENTY].\u201d The date set in the contract for the closing or transfer of title was January 10, 1986, which was approximately thirteen months after the date of execution of the agreement. The reason for the delay was to accommodate Bergenty for income tax purposes. O\u2019Sullivan and Bergenty further testified that the two documents taken together comprised the entire agreement, that the agreement had been understood by them, that it had been properly executed, and that it was fair when made. Bergenty also testified that it was his understanding that a condition precedent to the completion of the transaction was for O\u2019Sullivan to continue to pay monthly rent up to the date of the closing. The trial court found that, in reliance on the agreement, O\u2019Sullivan continued his tenancy on the property, made monthly rental payments, and main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>tained and improved the property with renovations, including a roof repair and a change in the door opening to the garage. In further reliance on the agreement, on June 10, 1985, O\u2019Sullivan entered into a five year sublease of the premises in connection with a buy-sell agreement for a portion of the property with a sublessee. Bergenty was aware of the sublease, and at the time of the trial, the sublessee continued to occupy a substantial portion of the premises. In sum, the trial court found that \u201c[a]fter the execution of the contract and his signing of the $25,000.00 promissory note, [plaintiff] \u2014 O\u2019Sullivan was clearly acting in reliance upon the expectation that the agreement would be consummated in January of 1986.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The trial court found further that, at trial, Bergenty confirmed his belief that he had been obligated to proceed with the conveyance at all times up to and including January 10,1986. O\u2019Sullivan testified that several times prior to January 10, 1986, and twice between January 10 and January 20,1986, he called Bergenty to request a closing on the property. At trial, however, Bergenty did not recall these telephone calls. Specifically, Bergenty and his attorney testified that neither one had done anything in furtherance of any closing prior to February, 1986. O\u2019Sullivan additionally testified that he had engaged in conversations with Bergenty \u201chalf a dozen times\u201d during December, 1985, and at no time did Bergenty lead him to believe that he would not sell him the property. Both O\u2019Sullivan and Bergenty testified, however, that on January 20,1986, O\u2019Sullivan called Bergenty requesting a closing of the transaction. Bergenty, in confirming the call, admitted at trial, that he renounced the contract at that time, stating: \u201cWe have no deal.\u201d Bergenty testified that the reason for his election not to close at that time was that O\u2019Sullivan had missed the January 10, 1986 closing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>At trial, Bergenty asserted that O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s claims for specific performance of the contract and for money damages were unfounded because: (1) the contract was not enforceable because it was not in accordance with the requirements of the statute of frauds; (2) the contract term \u201cA.P.R.\u201d was not defined with reasonable certainty and therefore there was no enforceable agreement; (3) O\u2019Sullivan was never ready, willing and able to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract; and (4) O\u2019Sullivan had failed to establish the applicability of the doctrine of part performance. The trial court found, however, that Bergenty\u2019s conduct made it impossible for O\u2019Sullivan to establish a closing date, and on the basis of the facts found, the trial court concluded \u201cthat the plaintiff-0\u2019Sullivan ha[d] established the applicability of the doctrines of equitable estoppel and of detrimental reliance.\u201d As a result, the trial court held that Bergenty was estopped from asserting his statute of frauds defense. In addition, the trial court held that O\u2019Sullivan had met his burden of proving that he was ready, willing and able at all times to purchase the property, and thus was entitled to specific performance. In view of these conclusions, the trial court held that it was unnecessary for it to consider Bergenty\u2019s arguments concerning the \u201cA.P.R.\u201d clause and part performance. Consequently, a judgment was rendered in favor of O\u2019Sullivan and specific performance of the contract was ordered. This appeal then followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">On appeal, Bergenty claims that the trial court erred in concluding: (1) that O\u2019Sullivan had established the applicability of the doctrines of equitable estoppel and detrimental reliance; (2) that an enforceable agreement existed between the parties; and (3) that O\u2019Sullivan was ready, willing and able to close, and thus had established his right to specific performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The primary issue in this case is the claim of Bergenty that the trial court erred in its determination that O\u2019Sullivan had established the applicability of the doctrines of equitable estoppel and detrimental reliance. In considering the law of estoppel in Connecticut, we have stated: \u201c \u2018Under our well-established law, any claim of estoppel is predicated on proof of two essential elements: the party against whom estoppel is claimed must do or say something calculated or intended to induce another party to believe that certain facts exist and to act on that belief; and the other party must change its position in reliance on those facts, thereby incurring some injury. <em>Bozzi </em>v. <em>Bozzi, </em>177 Conn. 232, 242, 413 A.2d 834 (1979); <em>Dupuis </em>v. <em>Submarine Base Credit Union, Inc., </em>[170 Conn. 344, 353, 365 A.2d 1093 (1976)]; <em>Pet Car Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>150 Conn. 42, 53-54, 184 A.2d 797 (1962).\u2019 <em>Zoning Commission </em>v. <em>Lescynski, </em>[188 Conn. 724, 731, 453 A.2d 1144 (1982)].\u201d <em>Kimberly-Clark Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>204 Conn. 137, 148, 527 A.2d 679 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Bergenty argues that the trial court failed to apply the two-prong test stated in <em>Kimberly-Clark Corporation </em>in determining the application of estoppel and detrimental reliance. The determination of the trial court, however, was based on its finding of fact, and we have stated: \u201c[W]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision; where the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous. That is the standard and scope of this court\u2019s judicial review of decisions of the trial court.\u201d <em>Pan</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number><em>dolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Applying these principles to the present case, we note that the trial court found that \u201cBergenty at trial testified that on December 20, 1984, he knew that he had made the deal for the 2 pieces of property at 433 Farmington Avenue for $175,000.00 and $25,000.00 with performance on or before January 10,1986. The additional sum of $25,000.00 to be paid at closing had been structured to help Bergenty tax-wise, and with his knowledge. He testified that he had known the deal and had signed it without coercion.\u201d Relying on the \u201cdeal,\u201d Bergenty testified that it was his understanding that O\u2019Sullivan was to continue to lease the property until the title to the property was transferred, and the trial court found that O\u2019Sullivan, in reliance on the agreement or \u201cdeal\u201d referred to by Bergenty, did continue to lease the property and pay the monthly rental payments. In addition, O\u2019Sullivan maintained and improved the property with renovations, including a roof repair and a change in the door opening to the garage. He also entered into a sublease of a portion of the premises for a period of five years with the knowledge of Bergenty.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">On the basis of the foregoing findings, it is reasonable, both legally and logically, for this court to conclude, as did the trial court, that \u201c[e]ach such act of proven reliance upon the agreement was in addition to the execution and delivery of a valid promissory note in the amount of $25,000.00, which amount was to be paid by O\u2019Sullivan to Bergenty at closing. After the execution of the contract and his signing of the $25,000.00 promissory note, [plaintiff]-0\u2019Sullivan was clearly acting in reliance upon the expectation that the agreement would be consummated in January of 1986.\u201d Prior to the January 20, 1986 telephone conversation when Bergenty told O\u2019Sullivan, \u201cWe have no deal,\u201d there is no evidence that Bergenty did anything to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>induce O\u2019Sullivan to believe that their agreement would not be honored. The trial court recognized Bergenty\u2019s commitment, stating: \u201cBergenty, at trial, clearly confirmed his belief that he had been obligated to proceed with the conveyance at all times up to and including January 10, 1986.\u201d The trial court\u2019s findings indicate that not only did Bergenty believe that he had a \u201cdeal\u201d and was obligated to convey the property, but that his action as well as his inaction induced O\u2019Sullivan to rely and to act as if the parties\u2019 contract would be performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">In addition, Bergenty argues that the trial court failed to apply the proper burden of proof standard regarding equitable estoppel. In <em>Kimberly-Clark Corporation v. Dubno, </em>supra, 148, we stated: \u201c \u2018 \u201c[I]t is the burden of the person claiming the estoppel to show that he exercised due diligence to ascertain the truth and that he not only lacked knowledge of the true state of things but had no convenient means of acquiring that knowledge.\u201d <em>Pet Car Products, Inc. v. Barnett, </em>[supra, 54]; <em>Linahan v. Linahan, </em>131 Conn. 307, 327, 39 A.2d 895 [1944].\u2019 <em>Reinke v. Greenwich Hospital Assn., </em>175 Conn. 24, 28-29, 392 A.2d 966 (1978).\u201d Although the trial court did not make a specific finding of diligence, the record fully supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the doctrine of equitable estoppel had been established by O\u2019Sullivan. In particular, the trial court found that O\u2019Sullivan testified that several times prior to January 10, 1986, and twice between January 10 and January 20, 1986, he had called Bergenty to request a closing. Although Bergenty, at trial, testified that he did not recall such conversations, he did confirm the January 20,1986 call when he renounced the contract and told O\u2019Sullivan: \u201cWe have no deal.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan also testified that during December, 1985, he had had \u201chalf a dozen\u201d conversations with Bergenty and that Bergenty had never led him to believe that he would not perform the contract. Since O\u2019Sullivan, prior to Janu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>ary 20,1986, had not been led to believe that Bergenty would not perform the contract, we can discern no reason for O\u2019Sullivan to be any more diligent in his contacts with Bergenty than the record reflects.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">In summary, the conclusions of the trial court are supported by its findings of fact stated in its memorandum of decision, and the record indicates that the findings of fact stated in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence. See <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>supra. Thus, given the facts found by the trial court, we are unable to conclude that the trial court was clearly erroneous in its conclusion that O\u2019Sullivan had established the applicability of the doctrines of equitable estoppel and detrimental reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Because the trial court determined the equitable estoppel and detrimental reliance issues adversely to Bergenty, it concluded that it was \u201cunnecessary to consider [Bergenty\u2019s] arguments concerning the 'APR\u2019 clause and part performance.\u201d Bergenty argues, however, that \u201csince the term A.P.R. is not defined in the contract and since the parties cannot determine what it means the unescapable conclusion must be drawn that an essential term is not defined with reasonable certainty and there is no enforceable agreement.\u201d Bergenty states further that \u201c[w]hat the parties intended by this part of the agreement is the crux of the issue in finding that an enforceable contract existed between the parties. Although the trial court felt that it need not deal with the A.P.R. issue because of its finding of equitable estoppel, the effect of its ruling was to put the A.P.R. right back into the controversy because it is a part of the contract that the trial court found enforceable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">This is a meritless issue. \u201cAn agreement need not spell out all details of the bargain in order to be enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>able. Even if the parties have left some terms of their agreement indefinite, a court may enforce the agreement ... if those terms are not material to the bargain, see, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>131 F.2d 909, 915 (2d Cir. 1942), cert. denied, 318 U.S. 781, 63 S. Ct. 858, 87 L. Ed. 1149 (1943).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bedford Associates, </em>657 F.2d 1300, 1310 (2d Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 914, 102 S. Ct. 1767, 72 L. Ed. 2d 173 (1982). In addition, the maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereat<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> mandates that writings should be interpreted and applied so that they have effect rather than be destroyed. See <em>Purvis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>344 F.2d 867, 870 (9th Cir. 1965); <em>Mozzochi </em>v. <em>Luchs, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 19, 23, 391 A.2d 738 (1977). In the present case, the \u201cA.P.R.\u201d clause reads: \u201cThe A.P.R. may vary at <em>option of Buyer.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, what the A.P.R. is or may be, may or may not be a defense if O\u2019Sullivan ever elects to try to take advantage of it. The record is devoid of any evidence of O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s exercising or attempting to exercise his option. Thus, if there is any uncertainty about \u201cA.P.R.,\u201d the uncertainty is immaterial. In sum, just as the trial court concluded that it was unnecessary to decide the A.P.R. issue, we also decline to speculate about its meaning or its consequences since there is no evidence that O\u2019Sullivan has elected to exercise his option in conjunction with this action for specific performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Finally, Bergenty argues that the trial court erred in ruling that O\u2019Sullivan was ready, willing and able to purchase the property, and thus entitled to specific performance. We are not persuaded. In particular, Bergenty asserts that the trial court\u2019s ruling was contrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Frumento </em>v. <em>Mezzanotte, </em>192 Conn. 606, 473 A.2d 1193 (1984). In <em>Frumento, </em>we noted: \u201cIt has been stated that when a purchaser of land is left to depend upon a purchase price loan from a third party who is in no way bound to furnish such funds, the purchaser cannot be considered to be able to perform so as to be entitled to specific performance.\u201d Id., 617. As a result, we held in <em>Frumento </em>that the purchaser\u2019s testimony, that he could have borrowed money from his parents to purchase the property in question, was not sufficient to establish that he was ready, willing and able, in light of the fact that no evidence was offered concerning his parents\u2019 ability to make such a loan to him. Id., 615 n.13, 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">In the present case, however, evidence was offered concerning O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s ability to access sufficient money to effectuate the purchase. Specifically, O\u2019Sullivan needed to show that he was capable of furnishing the funds to pay the $25,000 promissory note that was then due to Bergenty. The contract did not require O\u2019Sullivan to tender any other payments at the time of the closing. At trial, O\u2019Sullivan presented the testimony of his commercial banker, John S. Driscoll, who was a vice-president of the Bristol Savings Bank. Driscoll testified that, in December, 1985, O\u2019Sullivan had a $150,000 open line of credit with his bank, and that if O\u2019Sullivan had asked for a loan of $25,000, his request would have been approved the next day. In addition, when asked on cross-examination if O\u2019Sullivan would have had any problem getting a loan for $25,000, even if his $150,000 open line of credit were used up, Driscoll responded: \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Thus, given that the present case is distinguishable from <em>Frumento, </em>and given that \u201c[t]he granting of specific performance of a contract to sell land is a remedy which rests in the broad discretion of the trial court depending on all the facts and circumstances when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>viewed in light of the settled principles of equity,\u201d we hold that the trial court properly found O\u2019Sullivan to be ready, willing and able to purchase the property in question, and, therefore, entitled to specific performance. <em>Frumento </em>v. <em>Mezzanotte, </em>supra, 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">In this opinion Covello and Santaniello, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-8\"> The written contract is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">\u201cBUY-SELL AGREEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">THIS AGREEMENT, made and concluded in duplicate this 20th day of -August Dec. 1984, by and between KEVIN O\u2019SULLIVAN, of the Town of Southington, County of Hartford and State of Connecticut (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018buyer\u2019), and WILLIAM S.

I disagree with the conclusion reached in Part II of the majority opinion that we may affirm the judgment without resolving the significance of the provision of the land sale agreement, which follows the stipulation for interest of 12 percent per annum on the purchase money mortgage, declaring: \u201cThe A.P.R. may vary at option of Buyer.\u201d At trial the plaintiff testified that, when the defendant had requested a change in the closing date from January 10,1985, as originally proposed, to January 10,1986, he had also agreed that the mortgage interest rate \u201cmay not be twelve percent; it may be eleven percent or ten percent, whatever the bank going rates are at that time.\u201d He also testified that both he and the defendant had made \u201can oral agreement that we had to keep [the interest rate] at one or one and a half above prime\u201d and that \u201c[i]f interest rates went down, then my interest, fixed rate, would go down also.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">The provision concerning the option to vary the A.P.R. was added to the clause relating to the purchase money mortgage at the time the contract of sale was executed. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney, who prepared the contract of sale but was not present when the parties, without counsel, inserted the A.P.R. provision and signed it, testified that he did not know \u201cwhat A.P.R. was\u201d and that \u201cit could be subject to a variety of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>interpretations, <em>annual percentage rate.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The trial court made no finding as to the meaning of this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The majority regards the ambiguity in the agreement created by the A.P.R. provision as a \u201cmeritless issue,\u201d relying upon the principle that indefiniteness in some terms of an agreement is not fatal \u201c \u2018if those terms are not material to the bargain,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bedford Associates, </em>657 F.2d 1300, 1310 (2d Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 914, 102 S. Ct. 1767, 72 L. Ed. 2d 173 (1982). This court for many years has held, however, that the terms of a purchase money mortgage in a land sale contract are essential to its validity when specific performance is sought, as in this case. <em>Montanaro </em>v. <em>Pandolfini, </em>148 Conn. 153, 157-58, 168 A.2d 550 (1961) (purchase money mortgage provision specifying amount, duration and rate of interest, but failing to indicate amount of monthly payment held too \u201cambiguous, indefinite and uncertain\u201d to satisfy statute of frauds); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Ladden, </em>101 Conn. 166, 168, 125 A. 250 (1924) (\u201cWe have uniformly held that where a written agreement for the sale of land provides that a portion of the purchase price shall be secured by a mortgage, the agreement must fix the time the mortgage is to run, in order to satisfy the requirements of the statute of frauds.\u201d); <em>Gendelman </em>v. <em>Mongillo, </em>96 Conn. 541, 546, 114 A.2d 914 (1921) (\u201c \u2018[I]f the memorandum shows that the sale was upon credit, the terms of such credit must be stated.\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Ebert v. Cullen, </em>165 Mich. 75, 130 N.W. 185 [1911]). The requirement that the financial terms of a purchase money mortgage be fully set forth in a land sale agreement is generally regarded as a prerequisite for compliance with the statute of frauds. 1 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 131, comment g, illustration 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The majority also maintains that it is unnecessary to resolve the significance of the A.P.R. provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>because it merely gives the plaintiff an option that he may never elect to exercise. The issue of whether a written contract is too indefinite to satisfy the statute of frauds, however, must be decided on the basis of its provisions at the time of execution. If the A.P.R. provision rendered the agreement of the parties too indefinite for the purpose of fashioning a decree of specific performance on December 20, 1984, when they signed it, nothing either of them later could do unilaterally would remedy that defect. The plaintiff cannot retrospectively restore enforceability to this contract, if it was not there originally, by electing not to exercise the right not to be bound to the 12 percent interest stipulation simply because it may now be advantageous to do so. If the effect of exercising his option for a lower interest rate pursuant to the A.P.R. provision would render the contract unenforceable for indefiniteness, the plaintiff would have under this contract a right to perform or not to perform as he chooses. His promise to purchase the property would then have been illusory and could not have constituted consideration for the defendant\u2019s promise to sell. \u201cWords of promise do not constitute a promise if they make performance entirely optional with the purported promisor.\u201d 1 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 76, comment d. \u201cWhere the apparent assurance of performance is illusory, it is not consideration for a return promise.\u201d Id., \u00a7 77, comment a.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Without a finding as to the significance of the A.P.R. provision, particularly whether there is some limitation on the broad option it appears to give the plaintiff to select the interest rate on the purchase money mortgage, this essential term of the contract is too vague for enforcement. I would remand the case for further proceedings to resolve this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
