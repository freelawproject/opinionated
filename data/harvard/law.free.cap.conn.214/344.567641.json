Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Apk6\">The petitioner Michael J. Dodson has brought a writ of error to this court seeking a reversal of the Superior Court judgment finding him in contempt of court and imposing a fine of $100. The writ raises the issue of whether the petitioner\u2019s adjudication and punishment of summary criminal contempt comported with due process under the fourteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>amendment to the United States constitution,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u00a7\u00a7 985 and 988 of the Practice Book.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u201cThe present case, which involves a review of a summary criminal contempt proceeding, comes before us on a writ of error which is the sole method of review of such proceedings. <em>Whiteside </em>v. <em>State, </em>148 Conn. 77, 78-79, 167 A.2d 450 (1961); <em>Goodhart </em>v. <em>State, </em>84 Conn. 60, 63, 78 A. 853 (1911). The scope of our review reaches only those matters appearing as of record. <em>State </em>v. <em>Assuntino, </em>180 Conn. 345, 347,429 A.2d 900 (1980); <em>Reilly </em>v. <em>State, </em>119 Conn. 217, 223, 175 A. 582 (1934). In a review of summary criminal contempt, the inquiry is limited to a determination of the jurisdiction of the court below. <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Hammersley, </em>44 Conn. 393, 413 (1877). Subsumed in this inquiry are three questions, namely, (1) whether the designated conduct is legally susceptible of constituting a contempt; <em>Goodhart </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra; (2) whether the punishment imposed was authorized by law; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>147 Conn. 167, 169, 158 A.2d 166 (1960); and (3) whether the judicial authority was qualified to conduct the hearing. <em>Mayberry </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>400 U.S. 455, 465-66, 91 S. Ct. 499, 27 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>L. Ed. 2d 532 (1971).\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>186 Conn. 256, 257, 440 A.2d 969 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The record discloses, inter alia, the following. On November 10,1988, the petitioner, an attorney admitted to the practice of law in Connecticut, was representing Michael Walker<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at a sentencing hearing before Judge James Higgins in the Superior Court. During the course of that hearing, and immediately following the imposition of sentence, the following took place between the court and the petitioner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">\u201cMr. Dodson: I think it is most unusual. I think that is totally outrageous. The court can do\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">\u201cThe Court: You may notify the defendant\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">\u201cMr. Dodson: Thirty years more on the same set of facts, I think . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">\u201cThe Court: Notify the defendant of his rights to appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-10\">\u201cMr. Dodson: There is no basis\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-11\">\u201cThe Court: You\u2019re out of order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-12\">\u201cMr. Dodson: I know I am, but there is no basis for that sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-13\">\u201cThe Court: He is held in contempt of this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>\u201cMr. Dodson: I apologize for my remarks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">\u201cThe Court: Notify the defendant of his rights to appeal on the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The court thereupon took a recess. The petitioner was asked to remain in the courtroom and was allowed access to a telephone to obtain counsel. Shortly thereafter, Attorney Gerald Klein arrived at Judge Higgins\u2019 chambers to indicate that he represented the petitioner. At that time, Klein was shown a copy of the transcript of the prior proceedings that had already been prepared. The court was prepared to continue and finish the summary contempt proceedings at that time. A request for a continuance, made by Klein, was granted to Tuesday, November 15,1988. (November 11,1988, a Friday, was a holiday and there was no court on November 14,1988, the following Monday, due to the Connecticut State Bar Association meeting.)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">On Tuesday, November 15, 1988, the court held a hearing at which the petitioner appeared with Klein. After the court inquired whether, the petitioner wished to be heard, both Klein and the petitioner addressed the court. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court imposed a fine of $100. This writ of error by the petitioner followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">The petitioner maintains that his conduct in open court on November 10,1988, did not constitute a contempt within the meaning of Practice Book \u00a7 985. This rule states that \u201ccriminal contempt is conduct that is directed against the dignity and authority of the court.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra. In denying the applicability of \u00a7 985, the petitioner points to Practice Book \u00a7 986<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which provides who may be punished for crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>nal contempt. He contends that his conduct does not place him within any portion of \u00a7 986, which, he says, must involve not only an act that \u201cdisturbs\u201d the dignity and authority of the court, but must also be directed against it. His conduct, he asserts, does not reflect an intent to disobey the rules or orders of the court but rather \u201cthe record clearly depicts [him] in the role of an advocate, engaged in the representation of a client.\u201d His \u201cstatement\u201d did not, he maintains, \u201cinterrupt the Court in its pronouncement of sentence, but rather occurred after the court had recited all penalties and imposed costs.\u201d Moreover, the petitioner claims that \u201chis forbearance clearly belies any claim that his intention was to disrupt the proceedings at hand.\u201d In addition, he claims that it cannot be \u201calleged\u201d that he violated any procedural rule restricting an attorney\u2019s opportunity to address the court subsequent to the imposition of sentence. In a word, his conduct, from his perspective, was confined to his legal responsibility of providing effective representation. We hold nonetheless that the petitioner\u2019s conduct constituted a contempt under \u00a7 985..</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">'ll) Any person who in the court\u2019s presence behaves in a contemptuous or disorderly manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">\u201c(2) Any person who violates the dignity and authority of any court, or any judicial authority, in its presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">\u201c(3) Any officer of the court who misbehaves in the conduct of his official court duties; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-10\">\u201c(4) Any person disobeying in the course of a civil or criminal proceeding any order of a judicial authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Since we speak of criminal contempt as conduct against the dignity and authority of the court, it is useful briefly to articulate the concepts of dignity and authority encompassed in this context. The expression \u201cdignity of the court\u201d proclaims a demand, to all deal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>ing with the court, for proper respect and obedience in its function of interpreting, administering and enforcing the law within its authority to do so. See generally <em>Brannon </em>v. <em>State, </em>202 Miss. 571, 582, 29 So. 2d 916 (1947). \u201cAuthority\u201d can be and has been said to mean the \u201c[r]ight to exercise powers; to implement and enforce laws; to exact obedience; to command; to judge. ... [It is] [o]ften synonymous with power.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.) In a free society, the courtroom \u201cis a forum for the courteous and reasoned pursuit of truth and justice.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>418 U.S. 488, 503, 94 S. Ct. 2697, 41 L. Ed. 2d 897 (1974). These concepts meaningfully embody that view of dignity and authority that should attend the proper, independent and fair discharge by the court of its duties under the rule of law. That view is hardly to be implemented platitudinally here, but in the warp and the woof of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">It is also useful to note at this point that where summary contempt is involved, the United States Supreme Court has indicated that it is wary of the power and cognizant of its potential for abuse. It, therefore, became established early in American jurisprudence that contempt limits a court in such cases to \u201cthe least possible power adequate to the end proposed.\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 204, 231, 5 L. Ed. 242 (1821),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> quoted, inter alia, <em>in In re Michael, </em>326 U.S. 224, 227, 66 S. Ct. 78, 90 L. Ed. 30 (1945); <em>In re Oliver, </em>333 U.S. 257, 274, 68 S. Ct. 499, 92 L. Ed. 682 (1948); <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>382 U.S. 162, 165, 86 S. Ct. 352, 15 L. Ed. 2d 240 (1965); <em>Shillitani </em>v. <em>United States, </em>384 U.S. 364, 371, 86 S. Ct. 1531, 16 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>2d 622 (1966). The purposes, nevertheless, of a criminal contempt order are to punish willful disregard of the authority of the court and to deter the occurrence of similar derelictions. <em>United States </em>v. <em>United Mine Workers, </em>330 U.S. 258, 302-303, 67 S. Ct. 677, 91 L. Ed. 884 (1947); <em>In re Irving, </em>600 F.2d 1027, 1037 (2d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 866, 100 S. Ct. 137, 62 L. Ed. 2d 89 (1979). Only recently, the United States Supreme Court has observed that \u201c[t]he underlying concern that gave rise to the contempt power was not, however, merely the disruption of court proceedings. Rather, it was disobedience to the orders of the judiciary, regardless of whether such disobedience interfered with the conduct of trial.\u201d <em>Young </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S.A., </em>481 U.S. 787, 798, 107 S. Ct. 2124, 95 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1987).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">There can be little doubt that an attorney may be, and should be, zealous in his representation of a client and \u201c[f]ull enjoyment of that right, with due allowance for the heat of controversy, will be protected by appellate courts when infringed by trial courts.\u201d <em>Sacher </em>v. <em>United States, </em>343 U.S. 1, 9, 72 S. Ct. 451, 96 L. Ed. 717 (1952); see <em>People </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>42 N.Y.2d 519, 369 N.E.2d 752, 399 N.Y.S.2d 196 (1977). \u201cThe arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>of a lawyer in presenting his client\u2019s case strenuously and persistently cannot amount to a contempt of court so long as the lawyer does not in some way create an obstruction which blocks the judge in the performance of his judicial duty.\u201d <em>In re McConnell, </em>370 U.S. 230, 236, 82 S. Ct. 1288, 8 L. Ed. 2d 434 (1962); <em>In re Meizlish, </em>72 Mich. App. 732, 736, 250 N.W.2d 525 (1977). The attorney\u2019s right to be zealous, vigorous, persistent and complete in the representation of a client is not, however, unlimited. That representation must be within the bounds of the law. \u201c[A]n attorney as an officer of the court should be held to a higher standard of courtroom conduct than a layman.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>482 Pa. 76, 90, 393 A.2d 386 (1978). As an officer of the court, he must \u201cpreserve and promote the efficient operation of our system of justice.\u201d <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>613 F.2d 193, 197 (9th Cir. 1979); <em>see Maness </em>v. <em>Meyers, </em>419 U.S. 449, 95 S. Ct. 584, 42 L. Ed. 2d 574 (1975); <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>197 Conn. 141, 148, 496 A.2d 476 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">On the matter of \u201ccourtroom decorum,\u201d an attorney \u201c[a]s an officer of the court . . . should support the authority of the court and the dignity of the trial court by strict adherence to the rules of decorum and by manifesting an attitude of professional respect toward the judge, opposing counsel, witnesses, jurors, and others in the courtroom.\u201d American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice (2d Ed. Sup. 1982), The Defense Function, Standard 4-7.1. The Code of Professional Conduct provides, inter alia, that a \u201clawyer shall not . . . (c) [ejngage in conduct intended to disrupt a tribunal.\u201d Code of Professional Conduct Rule 3.5 (c). It also provides that \u201c[i]t is professional misconduct for a lawyer to . . . (d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d Code of Professional Conduct Rule 8.4 (d). It is appropriate to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>and apply ethical benchmarks, as well as case law, when determining whether an attorney\u2019s conduct is inappropriate to his role and thus constitutes contumacious behavior \u2014 all within the rule of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">As to the court, \u201c \u2018[t]he role of the Trial Judge is neither that of automaton nor advocate\u2019 . . . nor is a judge merely an \u2018umpire in a forensic encounter\u2019 but \u2018[h]e is a minister of justice\u2019 and in \u2018whatever he does . . . the trial judge should be cautious and circumspect in his language and conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>198 Conn. 1, 10, 501 A.2d 1195 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>201 Conn. 605, 622, 518 A.2d 1377 (1986). \u201c \u2018A judge . . . should conduct himself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.\u2019 . . . The trial judge should be the exemplar of dignity and impartiality.\u201d <em>Swenson </em>v. <em>Dittner, </em>183 Conn. 289, 297, 439 A.2d 334 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Echols, </em>170 Conn. 11, 13-14, 364 A.2d 225 (1975). The trial judge has the obligation to use his or her power to prevent distractions from and disruptions of the trial. Where the judge decides to impose sanctions for misconduct, \u201cordinarily [the judge should] impose the least severe sanction appropriate to correct the abuse and to deter repetition . . . . \u201d American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice (2d Ed. Sup. 1982), Special Functions of the Trial Judge, Standard 6-3.3;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>478 Pa. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>356, 366, 386 A.2d 971 (1978); <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Towne, </em>13 Wash. App. 954, 960, 538 P.2d 559 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In addition, it is proper to note that \u201c[t]he law of contempt is not made for the protection of judges who maybe sensitive to the winds of public opinion. Judges are supposed to be men of fortitude, able to thrive in a hardy climate.\u201d <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Harney, </em>331 U.S. 367, 376, 67 S. Ct. 1249, 91 L. Ed. 1546 (1947). They must be on guard against confusing offenses to their sensitivities with the obstruction of justice. <em>In re Little, </em>404 U.S. 553, 555, 92 S. Ct. 659, 30 L. Ed. 2d 706 (1972). Indeed, \u201c[a] court of law is not the personal fiefdom of the individual who happens to be sitting at the bench.\u201d <em>Edmunds </em>v. <em>Chang, </em>365 F. Sup. 941, 948 (D. Haw. 1973), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 509 F.2d 39 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 825, 96 S. Ct. 39, 46 L. Ed. 2d 41 (1975). The trial judge, nevertheless, has the duty to deter and correct misconduct of attorneys with respect to- their obligations as officers of the court to support the authority of the court and enable the trial to proceed with dignity. American Bar Association Standards of Criminal Justice (2d Ed. Sup. 1982), Special Functions of the Trial Judge, Standard 6-3.5.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number><em>Sacher </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 13, while recognizing the duty of the trial judge to protect fully an attorney\u2019s right to represent his client vigorously, the court also acknowledged the duality of the role of an attorney, as an officer of the court as well as an advocate. In dealing with circumstances involving a potential contempt of an attorney, trial judges should remain aware that an attorney is a vital component of our legal system unlike that of a criminal defendant or a party to a civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The remarks of the trial court and the petitioner, as well as the action of the court on November 10, 1988, have already been referred to. To these must be added that during the petitioner\u2019s \u201coutburst\u201d the trial court later said that the petitioner\u2019s voice was \u201celevated\u201d and that he \u201cthrew\u201d his pencil on the counsel table.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>conduct can technically be said not to have taken place during the \u201ctrial.\u201d A criminal \u201ctrial\u201d may be said to be those proceedings to determine the guilt or innocence of an accused and ordinarily ends with the verdict or other decision of the trier of fact. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, 4 </em>Cal. App. 3d 403, 410, 84 Cal. Rptr. 412 (1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Drake, </em>259 N.W.2d 862, 868 (Iowa 1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>363 So. 2d 458, 461 (La. 1978); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.); cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Betillo, </em>53 Misc. 2d 540, 279 N.Y.S.2d 444 (1967). The petitioner\u2019s conduct took place immediately after sentencing. A sentence is the judgment of the court formally pronounced which \u201cawardfs] the punishment to be inflicted.\u201d <em>Belden </em>v. <em>Hugo, </em>88 Conn. 500, 501, 91 A. 369 (1914). The petitioner\u2019s conduct took place while the sentencing court was \u201cin session\u201d when the court was actively presiding while engaged in processing the business of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">It is against this background and the legal and ethical benchmarks that we must now determine whether the petitioner\u2019s conduct in open court on November 10, 1988, was contumacious because it went beyond the permissible parameters of advocacy and, thus, a contempt of court. We answer this in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The petitioner\u2019s conduct took place in open court with the trial judge on the bench. It took place several weeks after a jury had found the petitioner\u2019s, client, Walker, guilty; the trial was over. It took place as the trial judge was attempting to instruct the clerk to give Walker notice of his rights to appeal, as provided for by Practice Book \u00a7 945.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court attempted to accomplish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>this twice and was interrupted by the petitioner on both occasions after the petitioner had already indicated that the sentence was \u201ctotally outrageous.\u201d Persisting after the second interruption of the court, the petitioner told the court that \u201cthere is no basis for the sentence just imposed,\u201d at which time the court warned him: \u201cYou\u2019re out of order.\u201d Rather than taking heed, the petitioner immediately responded, <em>\u201cI know I </em>am, but there is no basis for that sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) After acknowledging this, the trial court said: \u201c[The petitioner] is held in contempt. . . .\u201d Then the court again directed that the clerk notify the defendant Walker of his rights to appeal on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">This conduct was a criminal contempt, directed as it was against the dignity and authority of the court. Practice Book \u00a7 985. \u201c \u2018From necessity the court must be its own judge of contempts committed within its presence.\u2019 <em>Goodhart </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra [62-63].\u201d <em>McClain </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>189 Conn. 663, 669, 457 A.2d 1072 (1983). In <em>In re Little, </em>supra, 555-56, the court drew a distinction between the manner of the use of words by the alleged contemnors and doing so in a loud and boisterous manner as well as considering the effect of the conduct upon court proceedings. In reversing the state court judgment of contempt, the <em>In re Little </em>court said: \u201c \u2018It is not charged that [the alleged contemnors] disobeyed any valid court order, talked loudly, acted boisterously, or attempted to prevent the judge or any other officer of the court from carrying on his court duties. . . .\u2019 \u201d Id., 556. From what we have already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>noted, what occurred on November 10,1988, is factually very different from <em>In re Little. </em>With reference to any \u201creason\u201d for the petitioner\u2019s conduct, we note that the record is absolutely barren of any \u201crunning, bitter controversy\u201d between the trial judge and the petitioner even though the petitioner had only recently been through a murder trial before the same judge. See <em>Naunchek </em>v. <em>Naunchek, </em>191 Conn. 110, 118-19, 463 A.2d 603 (1983); but cf. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>418 U.S. 488, 501, 94 S. Ct. 2697, 41 L. Ed. 2d 897 (1974); <em>Mayberry </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>400 U.S. 455, 465, 91 S. Ct. 499, 27 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1971). The petitioner\u2019s statements and his conduct, insofar as the record discloses, were \u201cdirected against the dignity and authority of the court\u201d as an institution and not against the trial judge personally. Conduct which is directed against the dignity and authority of the court must be accompanied by the intent on the part of the alleged contemnor to do that. See, e.g., <em>Matter of Pilsbury, </em>866 F.2d 22, 27 (2d Cir. 1989); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Seale, </em>461 F.2d 345, 367-68 (7th Cir. 1972). While the United States Supreme Court in <em>In re McConnell, </em>supra, properly recognized the wide latitude to be permitted defense counsel in vigorously defending a client, <em>\u201cMcConnell </em>cannot be read as an immunization for all conduct undertaken by an attorney in good faith representation of his client. . . <em>.\"In re Dellinger, </em>461 F.2d 389, 398 (7th Cir. 1972), aff\u2019d, 502 F.2d 813 (7th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 990, 95 S. Ct. 1245, 43 L. Ed. 2d 671 (1975). Conduct, when allegedly contumacious, cannot be justified merely by asserting that it was undertaken in good faith. <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>497 A.2d 467, 473 (Me. 1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1032, 106 S. Ct. 594, 88 L. Ed. 2d 5741 (1985). Under the circumstances of this case, the petitioner \u201cshould reasonably have been aware that his conduct was wrongful.\u201d Id. He actually stated that he <em>knew </em>that he was \u201cout of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>order\u201d when the trial judge so cautioned him. There was thus nothing, insofar as the petitioner was concerned, that was unclear or indefinite about the trial court\u2019s caution. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>supra, 368-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">To be held in criminal contempt, a contemnor must have the requisite intent; the conduct must be willful. <em>Matter of Pilsbury, </em>supra; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thoreen, </em>653 F.2d 1332, 1342 (9th Cir. 1981); <em>Sykes </em>v. <em>United States, </em>444 F.2d 928, 930 (D.C. Cir. 1971); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.). Intent may be inferred from facts and circumstances. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thoreen, </em>supra. Generally, willfulness may be inferred from a reckless disregard for a court\u2019s order. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Delahanty, </em>488 F.2d 396 (6th Cir. 1973); <em>Sykes </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>State, </em>46 Md. App. 138, 416 A.2d 748 (1980). Stated another way, \u201c[t]he minimum requisite intent [for criminal contempt] is better defined as a volitional act by one who knows or should reasonably be aware that his conduct is wrongful.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Seale, </em>supra, 368. The requisite intent in this case may properly be inferred from the record of what occurred on November 10,1988. An attorney need not be accorded one contemptuous remark before a judge may consider a summary contempt adjudication. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>482 Pa. 76, 90, 393 A.2d 386 (1978). The danger of the allegedly contumacious conduct of offending the authority and dignity of the court \u201c \u2018must not be remote or even probable, it must immediately imperil [it] .... \u2019 \u201d <em>In re Little, </em>supra, 555; accord <em>In re McConnell, </em>supra (contempt reversed where attorney failed to carry out threat to disobey court order); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Seale, </em>supra, 370. It is evident that the authority of the court in this case was significantly hindered by the petitioner\u2019s conduct. Despite the court\u2019s order to the clerk to notify the defendant Walker of his right to appeal, the petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>conduct obstructed the execution of that valid order. This was not a mere affront to the sensibilities of the trial judge qua trial judge; it directly hindered and interfered with the Superior Court qua Superior Court in its orderly processing of business before it. This misconduct<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> led to obstruction and delay and was directed against the dignity of the court. The petitioner was guilty of criminal contempt in violation of Practice Book \u00a7 985 and the trial court had the summary contempt power to deal with such contumacious conduct that took place in open court and in its immediate presence and view. See <em>Naunchek </em>v. <em>Naunchek, </em>supra, 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">It is appropriate here to advert to the judgment of contempt which this writ of error brings to this court. In his second claim of error, the petitioner maintains that he was held in contempt on November 10, 1988, without any opportunity to address the court prior to the adjudication of guilt. The state argues, to the contrary, that the trial court\u2019s statement that \u201c[the petitioner] is held in contempt of this court\u201d on November 10,1988, was not a final adjudication of guilt because, otherwise, it would have been pointless to have afforded him an opportunity to obtain counsel and there would not have been any need to \u201ccontinue and finish\u201d the proceedings as the court was prepared to do on November 10,1988. The state claims, accordingly, that the final adjudication of guilt did not take place until the conclusion of the hearing on November 15, 1988. It contends that the petitioner incorrectly claims that he was not given the opportunity because the court\u2019s statement on November 10,1988, i.e., \u201c[h]e is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>held in contempt\u201d did not constitute a final adjudication of guilt. The state maintains rather that the final adjudication of guilt did not occur until November 15, 1988, at which time the petitioner was represented by-counsel who addressed the court and the petitioner himself spoke on his own behalf.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Although the court, in its articulation, said that \u201c[the petitioner] was held in contempt [on November 10, 1988],\u201d a writ of error lies only from a final judgment and for errors of law apparent on the face of the record. <em>Geddes </em>v. <em>Sibley, </em>116 Conn. 22, 24, 163 A. 596 (1932). Even though the petitioner was held in contempt on November 10,1988, it is evident, and the petitioner does not contend otherwise, that there was no final judgment on that date from which a writ of error would lie. This is so because no sanction or punishment had yet been imposed and, therefore, there had been no final judgment disposing of the matter. <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983); see <em>Barbato </em>v. <em>J. &amp; M. Corporation, </em>194 Conn. 245, 247-48, 478 A.2d 1020 (1984). No final judgment existed in this contempt proceeding until the court decided on November 15, 1988, not to change its earlier ruling but proceeded to final adjudication and imposed the sanction of the $100 fine. This, we submit, has significance on the remaining issues to be decided, particularly the petitioner\u2019s claim that the continuance to November 15, 1988, which <em>he </em>requested, all but attenuated the nature of the proceeding against him as one in summary criminal contempt and required, inter alia, the recusal of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The petitioner next claims that the proceedings that culminated in the finding of summary criminal contempt were conducted in violation of his due process rights as set forth in \u00a7 988 of the Practice Book, and as afforded by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In making this claim, he maintains that the matter was \u201cimproperly adjudicated\u201d before the same judge before whom the alleged contemptuous conduct occurred. The state, on the other hand, contends that the petitioner\u2019s adjudication of summary criminal contempt comported with the requirements of due process as provided in the United States and Connecticut constitutions and the Practice Book. In oral argument before this court, the state, while conceding that the \u201cliteral terms\u201d of the Practice Book had not been complied with, argued that the substance of the due process prescribed by the Practice Book had been fully extended to the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The United States Supreme Court \u201chas often recognized that the requirements of due process cannot be. ascertained through mechanistic application of a formula.\u201d <em>Groppi </em>v. <em>Leslie, </em>404 U.S. 496, 500, 92 S. Ct. 582, 30 L. Ed. 2d 632 (1972). The essence of due process is fundamental fairness. <em>United States ex rel. Crist </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>745 F.2d 476, 482 (7th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1068, 105 S. Ct. 2146, 85 L. Ed. 2d 503 (1985). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Due process is an element that, when absent, produces the reaction given to that which is \u201cshocking to the universal sense of justice.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>411 U.S. 423, 432, 93 S. Ct. 1637, 36 L. Ed. 2d 366 (1973). Due process, unlike some legal rules, is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>189 Conn. 471, 476, 457 A.2d 290, appeal dismissed, 464 U.S. 801, 104 S. Ct. 46, 78 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1983); <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>181 Conn. 69, 73, 434 A.2d 333 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The petitioner contends that he was denied the due process provided for by Practice Book \u00a7 988. The state disagrees, claiming that he was accorded the required due process although it does concede that \u00a7 988 was not followed literally. The lack of a \u201cmechanistic application\u201d; see <em>Groppi </em>v. <em>Leslie, </em>supra; of Practice Book \u00a7 988 should not serve to defeat its due process requirements if they were substantively met. \u201cThe design of the rules of practice is both to facilitate business and to advance justice; \u2018they will be interpreted liberally in any case where it shall be manifest that a strict adherence to them will work surprise or injustice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Calise, </em>174 Conn. 567, 574, 392 A.2d 440 (1978). Rules of practice must be construed reasonably and with consideration of this purpose. <em>Densmore </em>v. <em>Eyles, </em>32 Conn. Sup. 519, 521, 342 A.2d 62 (1975); 20 Am. Jur. 2d, Courts \u00a7 86. Rules \u201care a means to justice, and not an end in themselves; their purpose is to provide for a just determination of every proceeding.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Emmett, </em>108 N.J. Super. 322, 325, 261 A.2d 374 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The petitioner was not denied due process despite the trial court\u2019s failure to comply literally with Practice Book \u00a7 988. His being held in contempt on November 10, 1988, cannot be said to have come as any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>surprise to him at that time, because his conduct as an officer of the court was such that he acknowledged that he knew, as he should have, that he was \u201cout of order.\u201d Moreover, there was nothing unclear or indefinite about that caution given by the court. Undaunted, however, he compounded the earlier \u201ctotally outrageous\u201d tenor of his view of the sentence by saying thereafter \u201cbut there is no basis for that sentence.\u201d The trial court then said that \u201c[the petitioner] is held in contempt of this court.\u201d The petitioner clearly understood the trial judge\u2019s perception of his conduct. See <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Local Union 542, International Union of Operating Engineers, </em>552 F.2d 498, 512 n.20A (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 822, 98 S. Ct. 67, 54 L. Ed. 2d 79 (1977). This scenario, in justice, cannot be said to avoid the contempt merely because it did not include on November 10, 1988, \u201ca recital of those facts in which the adjudication of guilt is based\u201d as set out in \u00a7 988. Significantly, on November 10, 1988, as well as on November 15,1988, neither the petitioner nor his counsel ever claimed that he did not understand the factual scenario upon which the trial court \u201cheld\u201d him in contempt on November 10,1988. This is so especially when his counsel discussed the matter with the trial court in chambers on November 10,1988, at which time his counsel was shown the court proceedings of that date. Further, with reference to a \u201crecital\u201d of the facts under \u00a7 988, it must not be overlooked that on November 10, 1988, as well as on November 15,1988, neither the petitioner nor his counsel, who are both attorneys at law, ever claimed that there was a constitutional deprivation of notice of the factual scenario upon which the court \u201cheld\u201d .the petitioner in contempt on November 10,1988, or for that matter, any violation of a statute or rule of practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">As to that portion of Practice Book \u00a7 988 that provides, \u201c[p]rior to the adjudication of guilt, the judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>authority shall . . . inquire as to whether [the petitioner] has any cause to show why he should not be adjudged guilty of contempt by presenting evidence of excusing or mitigating circumstances,\u201d there was no violation of the substance of this portion of the rule. Any claim that this portion was not literally complied with overlooks the fact that the petitioner availed himself of the opportunity on November 10,1988, to obtain counsel who forthwith came to court, spoke to the trial judge and was shown a copy of the transcript at that time. The trial court \u201cwas prepared to continue and finish the summary contempt proceedings at that time.\u201d We are entitled to presume that the trial court would have done so by according the petitioner the due process prescribed by Practice Book \u00a7 988. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Crumpton, </em>202 Conn. 224, 231, 520 A.2d 226 (1987); <em>Brookfield </em>v. <em>Candlewood Shores Estates, Inc., </em>201 Conn. 1, 6, 513 A.2d 1218 (1986). We have had occasion to say: \u201c \u2018Where a contempt occurs in the presence of the court, no witnesses are required in proof of the contempt, and the court has inherent power to impose punishment on its own knowledge and of its own motion without formal presentation or hearing of the person adjudged in contempt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>147 Conn. 167, 169, 158 A.2d 166 [1960]; <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Hugo, </em>82 Conn. 262, 266, 73 A. 778 [1909], . . .\u2019 <em>Whiteside </em>v. <em>State, </em>[148 Conn. 77, 78, 167 A.2d 450 (1961)].\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>186 Conn. 256, 259, 440 A.2d 969 (1982). As already noted, petitioner\u2019s counsel, however, requested and was granted a continuance until the next court day, at which hearing the petitioner and his counsel were fully heard before sentence was imposed. Once again, there was no claim raised below that this portion of Practice Book \u00a7 988 was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">In addition, Practice Book \u00a7 988 permits a criminal contempt to be punished \u201csummarily if the conduct constituting the contempt was committed in the actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>presence of the court . . . and such punishment is necessary to maintain order in the courtroom.\u201d Although punishment, in this case, was not imposed \u201csummarily,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> in a technically temporal sense, it was imposed on the next court day to which it had been continued at the request of petitioner\u2019s counsel. Of course, \u201c[d]ue process cannot be measured in minutes and hours or dollars and cents.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>supra, 500. Judgment forthwith is not required by the text \u00f3f Practice Book \u00a7 988. Moreover, if the conduct of an attorney warranted immediate summary punishment, no possible prejudice to him could result from some delay if it were appropriate. The delay in imposing punishment here was appropriate, especially when it came about by the petitioner\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">That the matter was not fully disposed of until November 15,1988, cannot convert the contempt proceeding started on November 10,1988, into one requiring a hearing before another judge. See <em>Matter of DeMarco, </em>224 N.J. Super. 105, 118, 539 A.2d 1230 (1988). Some courts have indicated that it is often useful to postpone disposition of a contempt charge against an attorney for a time after the alleged contumacious conduct. <em>Sacher v. United States, </em>supra, 8-10; see <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>supra, 498-500; <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Local Union 542, International Union of Operating Engineers, </em>supra, 512-14 (trial judge\u2019s twenty-four hour delay did not bar summary contempt proceeding); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number><em>United States </em>v. <em>Schiffer, </em>351 F.2d 91, 93-94 (9th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 1003, 86 S. Ct. 1914, 16 L. Ed. 2d 1017, reh. denied, 385 U.S. 890, 87 S. Ct. 12, 17 L. Ed. 2d 121 (1966); <em>In re Osborne, </em>344 F.2d 611, 616 (9th Cir. 1965). One court has noted that when the misconduct is not likely to be repeated, withholding immediate action \u201chas much in its favor. ... A deliberate course encourages a more dispassionate evaluation of the incident.\u201d <em>In re Contempt of Ungar, </em>160 N.J. Super. 322, 333, 389 A.2d 995 (1978); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Zoppi, </em>72 N.J. Super. 432, 436-37, 178 A.2d 632 (1962). In this case, the matter was finally disposed of on the next court day following the incident. The trial judge was prepared to continue and finish the summary proceedings on the day the contempt occurred. He, however, decided to continue the matter at the request of petitioner\u2019s counsel.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It would be anomalous to conclude that, having postponed a final disposition at the petitioner\u2019s request, the trial court\u2019s power to uphold the authority and dignity of the court in this summary criminal contempt proceeding thereby became so attenuated and enfeebled as to render it constitutionally impermissible for the proceedings to be completed by this trial judge on the next court day.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Further, the petitioner advances another basis for arguing that a different judge should have conducted the hearing on November 15,1988. The petitioner now claims, although he never did in the trial court, that his \u201cremarks\u201d were directed at the trial judge, specifically the sentence imposed. He argues that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>\u201cstatement\u201d and the trial judge\u2019s \u201creaction,\u201d i.e., immediately holding him in contempt, were, without question, \u201ccausally linked.\u201d The petitioner says that \u201c[wjhile it is not at all apparent that [his] remarks constituted a \u2018personal attack\u2019 upon the trial judge, the circumstances reveal at minimum a disagreement between the Court and [the petitioner] to cause \u2018embroilment\u2019 of the judge.\u201d The nature of the circumstances on the record, the petitioner contends, \u201creasonably suggests that marked personal feelings were potentially present on both sides.\u201d He maintains that it is apparent from the record that there was sufficient reason and opportunity to convene a hearing before a different judge. We note that, despite his present claim, there is nothing on the record to suggest that he or his counsel ever raised the matter of the recusal of the trial judge in the trial court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The concern of due process is the fair administration of justice. <em>Mayberry </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>supra, 465. There are times when a judge, instead of representing \u201c \u2018the impersonal authority of [the] law,\u2019 \u201d has permitted himself to \u201cbecome so \u2018personally embroiled\u2019 with a lawyer in the trial as to make the judge unfit to sit in judgment on the contempt charge.\u201d Id.; <em>Offutt </em>v. <em>United States, </em>348 U.S. 11,17, 75 S. Ct. 11, 99 L. Ed. 11 (1954) (in <em>Ojfutt, </em>there was \u201can intermittently continuous wrangle on an unedifying level\u201d between the trial judge and the attorney over the fourteen days of the trial). This case is not <em>Offutt, </em>as the trial judge in this case was \u201cnot an activist seeking combat [as in <em>Offutt],\u201d </em>nor is there any claim of any difficulty between the trial judge and the petitioner during the underlying murder trial. <em>Mayberry </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>supra. This trial judge did not find himself in the position of the trial judge in <em>Mayberry, </em>where during the course of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>twenty-one day criminal trial, the defendant repeatedly insulted and slandered the trial judge calling him, inter alia, a \u201cdirty son of a bitch,\u201d \u201ca dirty tyrannical old dog,\u201d a \u201cstumbling dog,\u201d a \u201cfool,\u201d telling him to \u201cgo to hell,\u201d \u201cYou need to have some kind of psychiatric treatment. You\u2019re some kind of nut,\u201d \u201cI ask Your Honor to keep your mouth shut while I\u2019m questioning my own witness\u201d and \u201cyou ought to be Gilbert and Sullivan the way you sustain the district attorney every time he objects to the questions.\u201d Id., 457-62. In vacating the contempt convictions<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and remanding for a trial before a different judge, the United States Supreme Court said that a judge, \u201cvilified as was this Pennsylvania judge, necessarily becomes embroiled in a running bitter controversy\u201d and \u201c[n]o one so cruelly slandered is likely to maintain that calm detachment necessary for fair adjudication.\u201d Id., 465; see <em>Naunchek </em>v. <em>Naunehek, </em>supra, 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In circumstances where the final adjudication of criminal contempt and the sentencing are postponed until after the underlying trial, the later case of <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>supra, is instructive on the fundamental due process requirements of the fourteenth amendment in state court criminal contempt proceedings. Factually, <em>Taylor </em>is significantly distinguishable from this case.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In <em>Taylor, </em>where final conviction and punish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>ment were delayed and the petitioner was denied the opportunity, although he requested it, to respond to the trial judge, the court concluded that the petitioner \u201cwas entitled to more of a hearing and notice than he received prior to final conviction and sentence.\u201d Where conviction and punishment are delayed, <em>Taylor </em>noted that \u201c \u2018it is much more difficult to argue that action without notice or hearing of any kind is necessary to preserve order and enable [the court] to proceed with its business.\u2019 \u201d Id., 498. <em>Taylor </em>then appropriately turned to <em>Groppi\u2019s </em>allusion to the circumstance that the contemnors in <em>Sacher </em>were \u201c \u2018given an opportunity to speak\u2019 \u201d and the \u201c \u2018trial judge [in Sacher] would, no doubt[,] have modified his action had their statements proved persuasive.\u2019 \u201d Id.; see <em>Groppi </em>v. <em>Leslie, </em>supra, 506 n.11. Drawing further on <em>Groppi, Taylor </em>stated that <em>\u201cGroppi </em>counsels that before an attorney is finally adjudicated in contempt and sentenced after trial for conduct during trial, he should have reasonable notice of the specific charges and opportunity to be heard on his own behalf\u201d that could include, it said, inquiry that the \u201cbehavior at issue was not contempt but acceptable conduct of an attorney representing his client; or, he might present matters in mitigation or otherwise attempt to make amends with the court.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>supra, 498, 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">We recognize that there are cases where \u201ccontemptuous conduct, though short of personal attack, may still provoke a trial judge and so embroil him in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>troversy that he cannot \u2018hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused . . . .\u2019 <em>Tumey </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>273 U.S. 510, 532 [47 S. Ct. 437, 71 L. Ed. 749] (1927).\u201d Id., 501. The inquiry in making this ultimate judgment \u201cmust be not only whether there was actual bias on [the trial judge\u2019s] part, but also whether there was \u2018such a likelihood of bias or an appearance of bias that the judge was unable to hold the balance between vindicating the interests of the court and the interests of the accused.\u2019 <em>Ungar </em>v. <em>Sarafite, </em>376 U.S. 575, 588 [84 S. Ct. 841, 11 L. Ed. 2d 921] (1964).\u201d Id. The conduct of both the trial judge and the alleged contemnor are to be considered in the calculus of the ultimate determination of whether the trial judge is disqualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">With these considerations in mind, we examine the record. It does not appear that the trial judge ever became embroiled in a \u201crunning controversy\u201d with the petitioner. Moreover, the petitioner\u2019s conduct was not a \u201cpersonal attack\u201d on the trial judge as his brief all but explicitly concedes. In any event, even though short of a \u201cpersonal attack,\u201d the trial judge\u2019s reaction to the petitioner\u2019s conduct cannot fairly be said to have been such that the trial judge could not \u201c \u2018hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and the [petitioner] . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>Taylor v. Hayes, </em>supra, 501. The record does not disclose, as it did in <em>Taylor, </em>\u201ca mounting display of an unfavorable personal attitude . . . and his motives, sufficiently so that the contempt issue should have been finally adjudicated by another judge.\u201d Id., 501-502. Significantly, the petitioner does not refer to any instance on November 10,1988, where the court became personally embroiled with the petitioner. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Renfroe, </em>634 F. Sup. 1536 (W.D. Pa.), aff\u2019d, 806 F.2d 254 (3d Cir. 1986). Unlike the petitioner in <em>Taylor, </em>but like the petitioner in <em>Ungar </em>v. <em>Sarafite, </em>supra, the contempt of the petitioner in this case did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>not proceed summarily to its conclusion in the temporal context, but he was given notice and afforded an opportunity for a hearing that was conducted in a judicial setting with proper decorum.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The transcript of the hearing of November 15,1988,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> also discloses that petitioner\u2019s counsel had earlier asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>the trial judge to \u201cconsider changing his ruling\u201d of November 10, 1988, and that he also asked the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>court to consider doing so at the November 15, 1988 hearing. Petitioner\u2019s counsel spoke first and gave his argument for reconsideration, including the claim that the petitioner had reacted \u201cin an emotional way\u201d to the sentence, imposed on Walker, which petitioner\u2019s counsel referred to as \u201clegally] justified.\u201d Counsel also apologized to the court on the petitioner\u2019s behalf. He referred to certain statutes<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> on contempt and read from Practice Book \u00a7 988 and asked that if the court were not going to accept his apology, then the petitioner be disciplined under General Statutes \u00a7 51-84, \u201cwhich calls for just a fine up to one hundred dollars.\u201d That the petitioner did not know \u201cthe nature of [the] sanction\u201d and that he asked for \u201cclarification\u201d at the hearing lacks merit. He had actual knowledge of the specific accusation.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The petitioner was permitted to address the trial court at the hearing to urge that his behavior was \u201cthe acceptable conduct of an attorney representing his client,\u201d to \u201cpresent matters in mitigation\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> or \u201cotherwise attempt to make amends with the court.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>supra, 499. The petitioner was thus given this hearing with the attendant right of allocution. See id., 500; <em>Groppi </em>v. <em>Leslie, </em>supra, 504; <em>Weiss </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>484 F.2d 973, 987 (9th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1161, 94 S. Ct. 924, 39 L. Ed. 2d 115 (1974). Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>due process concepts, it is appropriate not only to allow the alleged contemnor to be represented by counsel, but also to allow him \u201cto retreat [if he so chooses] from his conduct, and to have the opportunity to correct misunderstandings on the part of the [trial] judge.\u201d <em>Matter of DeMarco, </em>224 N.J. Super. 105, 120-21, 539 A.2d 1230 (1988); <em>In re Kozlov, </em>156 N.J. Super. 316, 326, 383 A.2d 1158 (1978), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 79 N.J. 232, 398 A.2d 882 (1979). In his remarks on November 15, 1988, the petitioner described his conduct of November 10,1988, as \u201ca spontaneous and emotional response to what [he] perceived as a gross injustice done to [his] client,\u201d that \u201c[n]o disrespect of the court was intended\u201d and \u201cif [his] remarks were interpreted as disrespect, [he] sincerely apologize[d] to the court.\u201d He immediately continued, however, and said: \u201cOn the other hand, to me silence in the fact of injustice is acquiescence with it. To have said nothing would have been the easier and safer thing to do, but not something I could have done. As a zealous advocate of my client\u2019s interests, and as a human being, I had to let the court know what I perceived as an extreme miscarriage of justice. <em>To that extent I have no regrets and I would do it again. </em>Again, no disrespect shown to the court and I apologize.\u201d (Emphasis added.) After hearing both the petitioner and his counsel, it is apparent that the trial court did not find their arguments \u201cpersuasive\u201d; see <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>supra, 498; so as to cause it to change its ruling. The trial court then imposed the punishment of a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">We recognize that the \u201csole credible basis for the summary contempt process is necessity, a need that the assigned role of the judiciary be not frustrated.\u201d <em>In re Fair Lawn Education Assn., </em>63 N.J. 112, 114-15, 305 A.2d 72, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 855, 94 S. Ct. 155, 38 L. Ed. 2d 104 (1973).

Rep. 94, 99 (K.B. 1765); it should be exercised sparingly and in accordance with the requirements of due process. Summary criminal contempt should not be employed as a means of abuse but courts have the right in appropriate circumstances to employ it to vindicate their dignity and authority upon any interference and to go no further. See R. Goldfarb, The Contempt Power (1963) p. 182.

I was not, of course, there. I asked the court before, and I will ask again, to consider changing its ruling. It appears that Mr. Dodson was not expecting the legal justified sentence that the court imposed and reacted in an emotional way as attorneys from time to time do. I apologize to the court on his behalf as he apologized to the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-12\">\u201cI would like to ask the court to reconsider that, and if the court feels that some sanction is in order, I would again draw the court\u2019s attention to [\u00a7] 51-84 of the General Statutes, which subjects officers of this court, attomeys-at-law to certain rules and the court can fine any lawyer up to one hundred dollars or suspend or disbar that lawyer for an infraction of those rules, which is truly a civil matter. Any action under [General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7] 51-33 or 51-33a would, of course, be in the nature of a criminal conviction. I would respectfully suggest to the court that that might be too harsh a penalty upon this young attorney, who has been a member of the bar five or six years and in my opinion has a good reputation and obviously one only has to glance at the transcript to see that he spoke out of line. These things happen from time to time and I haven\u2019t seen him in that type of a situation before, the many times I have seen him appear before many judges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-13\">\u201cAgain, your Honor, [\u00a7] 51-33 the so-called summary criminal contempt indicates that the court may punish by fine or imprisonment anyone who behaves contemptuously or in a disorderly manner up to one hundred dollars or six months in jail or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-14\">\u201cThe Practice Book section in dealing with this particular statute, Section 988 summary criminal contempt.

Now, [a] very minor personal problem was bothering him earlier in the day [that] may have contributed to his outburst in the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">\u201cAgain, I read the transcript and I understand from speaking to other people who were here, that the way he expressed himself was worse than what you see in black and white, but I would ask the court to consider the various options apparently that the court would have here to fashion a sanction, if there is one, into a non-criminal situation which really if the court will not accept his belated apology or second apology, a more thorough apology to discipline him under [\u00a7] 51-84 which calls for just a fine up to one hundred dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-10\">\u201cThat is all I have to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-11\">\u201cThe Court: You have anything to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-12\">\u201cMr. Dodson: Yes, your Honor please. I have a brief statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-13\">\u201cMay it please the court, what I said in court last Thursday was a spontaneous and emotional response to what I perceived as a gross injustice done to my client. No disrespect of the court was intended and if my remarks were interpreted as disrespect, I sincerely apologize to the court. On the other hand, to me silence in the face of injustice is acquiescence with it. To have said nothing would have been the easier and safer thing to do, but not something I could have done. As a zealous advocate of my client\u2019s interests, and as a human being, I had to let the court know what I perceived as an extreme miscarriage of justice. To that extent I have no regrets and I would do it again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-14\">\u201cAgain, no disrespect shown to the court and I apologize.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-15\">\u201cThe Court: The statement contains portions that can be characterized as nothing less than unmitigated gall. Your statement concerning silence being acquiescence apparently is a lack of recognition on your part that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>the process provides an appellate review, which is available to your client. Clients are not to be served by outrageous outbursts of their lawyers during a session in Superior Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">\u201cThe court will impose a fine of one hundred dollars. These proceedings shall be certified to the Judges of the Superior Court, State Bar Grievance Association and the Hartford County Bar for their permanent records.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b392-8\"> Petitioner\u2019s counsel referred to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 51-33, 51-33a and 51-84.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b392-9\"> During his presentation, petitioner\u2019s counsel stated that he had spoken to the petitioner on November 10, 1988, at a time before the conduct involved in this appeal, and said that a \u201cvery minor personal problem was bothering [the petitioner] earlier in the day [that] may have contributed to his outburst in the courtroom.\u201d The petitioner never referred to any such \u201cproblem\u201d when he addressed the court on November 15, 1988.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b394-7\">Shea, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AFj\">dissenting. I agree with the majority that there is a sufficient basis in the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding of contempt. I disagree, however, with its conclusion that \u201cthere was no violation of the substance\u201d of the following provision of Practice Book \u00a7 988 prescribing the procedure for a summary criminal contempt proceeding: \u201cPrior to the adjudication of guilt the judicial authority shall inform the defendant of the.accusation against him and inquire as to whether he has any cause to show why he shoul,d not be adjudged guilty of contempt by presenting evidence of excusing or mitigating circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The state concedes that this provision, which incorporates the basic constitutional requirements of notice and hearing contained in our federal and state constitutions, \u201cwas not followed literally.\u201d Indeed, the record demonstrates that the trial court found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>petitioner in contempt without any prior notice or opportunity to be heard before that finding was made on November 10, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The majority attempts to justify this oversight of the trial court by relying upon the proceedings of November 15,1988, when the petitioner was given an opportunity to try to persuade the judge to reverse the finding of contempt that he had previously made. The majority does not explain how this proceeding can be deemed to cure the deficiency in the earlier proceeding when the contempt finding was made. Anyone familiar with human nature must recognize the herculean task imposed upon a litigant seeking reversal from the same trier of a finding of fact that has been publicly announced. Such a belated opportunity to be heard is not the equivalent of the notice and hearing prior to any adjudication of guilt that \u00a7 988 prescribes.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The evident purpose of the rule is to bar any adjudication of summary criminal contempt without prior notice that the offending person may be held in contempt and without allowing him to present \u201cexcusing or mitigating circumstances.\u201d Since we have the rule, the trial judge should have followed it or, as an alternative, should have referred the matter for prosecution under Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7991 and 992<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as a nonsummary criminal contempt before another judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\"> \u201c[Practice Book] Sec. 991.--nature of proceedings</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">\u201cA criminal contempt not adjudicated under Sec. 987 shall be prosecuted by means of an information.
