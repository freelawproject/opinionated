That appeal has not yet been heard. In the interim, the respondent has filed with this court a motion for review; see Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 4049<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>and 4053;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the court\u2019s denial of his motion for a stay of execution of that transfer order. We conclude that the juvenile court erred by not staying execution of the transfer order.-</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">On November 8,1989, the state\u2019s advocate filed a five count petition alleging that the respondent was a delinquent child, in that he had committed four \u201cserious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>juvenile offenses\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and had also violated a court order issued on July 24,1989, \u201cby being \u2018out\u2019 without a parent\u201d in the city of New Haven.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The respondent was fourteen years old at the time of the incident alleged in the petition. On November 15, 1989, the state\u2019s advocate filed a motion requesting that the respondent be transferred to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court. A hearing was held on that motion on December 14, 1989, after which the juvenile court, issued a written finding, on December 21,1989, that probable cause existed to believe that the respondent had committed the offenses alleged in the petition. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-127. On the basis of this finding the court ordered that the respondent be transferred to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">According to the state, the respondent was presented for arraignment in part B, geographical area number six, in New Haven, on January 9, 1990. Bond was set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>at $150,000 and the matter was transferred to part A of the judicial district of New Haven. The respondent was also, on January 9, transferred from the New Haven juvenile detention center to an adult pretrial detention facility, where he remains currently incarcerated. Present counsel for the respondent,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on January 11, 1990, filed a motion to stay execution of the transfer order. That motion was heard and denied by the Superior Court for juvenile matters, on February 13,1990. The respondent was presented in part A of the judicial district of New Haven, on February 15, 1990, where a hearing was conducted pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> after which the trial court, <em>Had-den, J., </em>determined that there existed probable cause to believe that the respondent had committed the offenses with which he had been charged.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The current motion, seeking review of the juvenile court\u2019s denial of a stay of execution, was filed in this court on February 20,1990. The opposition of the state\u2019s advocate was filed on March 1, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">In support of his motion for a stay of execution of the order transferring him to the regular criminal docket, the respondent argued before the juvenile court that the automatic stay prescribed by Practice Book \u00a7 4046<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was applicable in this case, and, alternatively, that the court could also order a stay of the transfer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>order pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4047. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court concluded, however, that: (1) the automatic stay provision of \u00a7 4046 was inapplicable in this case since that section specifically excludes \u201cjuvenile matters\u201d from its operation; (2) while \u00a7 4047 might have allowed it to stay execution of the transfer order, thus postponing the impending probable cause hearing on the regular criminal docket, such an order would derogate from the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d already exercised by both the part B and part A courts; and (3) even if it could authorize a stay of the transfer order, this case \u201cshould go ahead and follow the ordinary course,\u201d since \u201cunder the merits ... [it was] strong enough\u201d to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">In the motion for review submitted to this court, the respondent argues that: (1) this case is controlled by the automatic stay provision of \u00a7 4046; (2) while this is not technically a criminal case, \u201cthe same policy considerations that underlie the automatic stay provision of [Practice Book] \u00a7 4048<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> apply to this case\u201d; (3) the juvenile court had not lost \u201cjurisdiction\u201d over this matter and, thus, could have granted a stay pursuant to \u00a7 4047; and (4) the court erred in not concluding that a stay was required in this case. The respondent asks that this court grant a stay of execution and also order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>that he be returned to the custody of a juvenile detention facility. We agree with the second and fourth arguments put forth by the respondent and conclude that further proceedings should have been stayed in this case and that the respondent should have remained incarcerated in a juvenile detention facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u201cThe General Assembly . . . has expressed a preference for shielding children from criminal liability except in clearly circumscribed situations. The additional protections afforded juveniles, which include separation of juvenile matters from other business of the Superior Court; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-122; confidential proceedings; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-122; anonymity; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-124; and erasure of police and court records; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-146; demonstrate the legislature\u2019s intent that children accused of wrongdoing be accorded different treatment from adults.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>206 Conn. 346, 360-61, 538 A.2d 185 (1988). This intent was also manifested in the legislature\u2019s 1986 amendment to \u00a7 46b-127, providing that an order transferring a juvenile to the regular criminal docket \u201cshall be a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\u201d See also General Statutes \u00a7 46b-126.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Thus, it appears that the legislature has implicitly recognized that the harm to a juvenile that may result from his confinement in an adult detention facility as well as the exposure to publicity likely to result from a transfer order are irreversible consequences of the order that cannot adequately be rectified at a later time even if the juvenile should prevail at trial in a regular criminal proceeding or on appeal from the judgment in such a proceeding. This court has declared that an interlocutory order should be appealable \u201cwhere the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). The purpose of the legislature in protecting juveniles from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>adverse consequences of an erroneous transfer order that can never be remedied later, by providing in \u00a7 46b-127 for an appeal of such an order, would be largely defeated if the order were to be implemented while the appeal was pending. Although the rights of a juvenile that may be lost are statutory and not constitutional, those rights are analogous to those of a criminal defendant seeking to avoid a trial that would violate the constitutional protection against double jeopardy afforded by the fifth and fourteenth amendments to our federal constitution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In either case, \u201cthe right asserted would be lost, probably irreparably, unless interlocutory review was permitted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Spendolini, </em>189 Conn. 92, 95, 454 A.2d 720 (1983). The ability to halt further proceedings, pending such review, should not depend on whether the right being asserted is constitutional or, as in this case, statutory.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Having reached this conclusion, however, we are confronted by the fact that the rules of this court do not, at present, provide an explicit method for staying execution of juvenile transfer orders. First, \u00a7 4046 is not available, despite the respondent\u2019s argument to the contrary, since \u201cjuvenile matters brought pursuant to chapters 31 through 40\u201d are specifically excluded from the application of that provision\u2019s automatic stay of execution.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Second, \u00a7 4048 is not available, as conceded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>by the respondent, since that provision\u2019s automatic stay of execution is available only in \u201ccriminal\u201d cases, and the respondent is appealing from an order entered in a \u201cjuvenile\u201d rather than a \u201ccriminal\u201d matter. Given the nonavailability of either of the automatic stay of execution provisions, we turn our attention to \u00a7 4047, which is applicable \u201c[i]n non-criminal matters in which the automatic stay provisions of Sec. 4046 are not applicable and in which there are no statutory stay provisions . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Motions for a stay of execution brought pursuant to \u00a7 4047 are ordinarily addressed to the sound discretion of the court. In cases such as this, however, that discretion must necessarily be limited by the concerns we have already identified regarding the respondent\u2019s right to have further proceedings halted pending resolution of his statutory right to interlocutory appellate review of the order transferring him to the regular criminal docket. Thus, rather than deciding whether the strength of the state\u2019s case warrants having the respondent tried as an adult, which was the principal basis for the determination made by the juvenile court in this case, the proper inquiry should be whether the state has presented legitimate reasons why that trial, as well as any accompanying pretrial proceedings, should not be stayed until a final determination has been made concerning the propriety of the transfer order itself. In light of our conclusion that certain statutory rights of juveniles will be irrevocably lost if a stay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>of execution is not granted, it appears that the state will rarely, if ever, be able to present such legitimate reasons.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We conclude that it has not done so in this case, and that further proceedings, therefore, should have been stayed pending the outcome of the respondent\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The motion for review submitted by the respondent is granted and the relief requested is also granted. We order that pending the outcome of his appeal: (1) the respondent\u2019s case be returned to the juvenile docket; (2) the respondent be returned to the custody of a juvenile detention facility; see General Statutes \u00a7 46b-133 (d);<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and (3) the records of all proceedings having already taken place on the regular criminal docket be placed in the custody of the juvenile court. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-124.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 46b-127.
