Lakoff et al.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were required by law to seek permission from the plaintiff, the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>sion on hospitals and health care (commission), prior to providing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) services<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> at the Cromwell Imaging Center located in the town of Cromwell. The defendants acquired a Technicare 0.6 Teslacon MRI system and began offering MRI services to the public on March 21, 1988. Upon investigation, the commission determined that the defendants\u2019 failure to secure the approval of the commission prior to acquiring the MRI system and instituting the MRI services was in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19a-154<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 19a-155.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>commission brought an enforcement action under General Statutes \u00a7 19a-159,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> seeking temporary and permanent injunctions barring the defendants from providing MRI services at the Cromwell Imaging Center until such time as the defendants had secured the necessary commission approval. A de novo hearing on the merits of the commission\u2019s action was held, after which the court rendered judgment, in part, for the commission and, accordingly, granted the requested relief. From this judgment the defendants appeal. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. The commission filed a three count complaint against the defendants. The first count alleged a violation of \u00a7 19a-154 in that the defendants, in operating a health care facility, had failed to seek permission from the commission prior to their introduction of an additional function or service into their program of health care. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>The second and third counts alleged that the defendants had failed to seek permission from the commission prior to spending in excess of $400,000 for major medical equipment, in violation of \u00a7 19a-155 (a), and for imaging equipment, in violation of \u00a7 19a-155 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In considering the issues presented by the commission\u2019s action, the court made the following factual findings: \u201cThe defendants are Kenneth M. Lakoff, M.D. and a series of interlocking corporations which together own and operate a radiological center and an MRI center in the same quarters (but in different suites) of a building in Cromwell. Separate corporations have acquired the equipment in question . . . from the leasing and operating corporations. Separate corporations operate the radiology service and the MRI service. For the purposes of this action, the court will find that the defendants are jointly controlled by Dr. Lakoff and Medscan, Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The court further found that the \u201cMRI Service is performed for the defendants\u2019 MRI operating company, MRI of Cromwell Diagnostic, P.C., by an independent group of radiologists. The service is strictly a diagnostic function. This company receives virtually no business on its own but only from referring physicians. Hospitals make no referrals to it, nor does the company perform any imaging services for hospitals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">With these facts as its backdrop, the court rendered judgment in favor of the commission on the first count. The court\u2019s ruling was based on its conclusion that the defendants operate a \u201chealth care facility\u201d under \u00a7 19a-145 and are thus subject to the approval provision of \u00a7 19a-154. With respect to the second and third counts, the court found in favor of the defendants, concluding that the defendants had not exceeded the statutory limit of $400,000 in the acquisition of the MRI system. Given its ruling on the first count, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>granted the requested injunctions, ordering that the defendants cease operating and providing MRI services at the Cromwell Imaging Center until such time as they received the necessary commission approval. On appeal the defendants claim that the court erred in determining that the defendants were subject to the approval provision of \u00a7 19a-154 because: (1) the defendants are not a \u201chealth care facility\u201d as defined by \u00a7 19a-145; and (2) the defendants are not introducing \u201can additional function or service\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 19a-154 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">We turn first to the defendants\u2019 claim that the court erred in its conclusion that the defendants operate a \u201chealth care facility\u201d as defined by our statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 19a-145 provides in pertinent part: \u201c \u2018health care facility or institution\u2019 means any facility or institution engaged primarily in providing services for the prevention, diagnosis <em>and </em>treatment of human health conditions, including, but not limited to, home health care agencies, homemaker-home health aide agencies . . . clinical laboratory or <em>central service facilities </em>serving one or more health care facilities, practitioners or institutions . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) The court determined that \u201cthe legislature intended to include in this definition institutions which perform all of the health care functions of diagnosis, treatment and prevention, but in addition thereto, certain others which the statute specifically designates.\u201d Because the defendants perform only a (\u00bfagnostic function, the court found that the defendants do not fall within the parameters of the statute\u2019s general definition. The court determined, however, that the additional facilities designated by the statute are exceptions to the general definition of a health care facility and are not required to perform all of the services of prevention, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>diagnosis, and treatment. The court then concluded that \u201cthe MRI Center operated by the defendants falls within the statutory definition of a central service facility serving practitioners,\u201d and thus held that the defendants are a \u201chealth care facility or institution\u201d under \u00a7 19a-145 and as such are subject to the provisions of \u00a7 19a-154.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The defendants argue that the trial court\u2019s conclusion is erroneous for three reasons: (a) the defendants do not provide all the services necessary to be categorized as a \u201chealth care facility or institution\u201d; (b) MRI of Cromwell Diagnostic, P.C., is not a \u201ccentral service facility\u201d; and (c) to categorize the defendants as a \u201chealth care facility\u201d violates the defendants\u2019 constitutional right to equal protection of the laws. We are not persuaded by the defendants\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The definition of \u201chealth care facility or institution\u201d contained in \u00a7 19a-145 is comprised of two sections, a general definition and a list of specific facilities included thereunder. The trial court concluded that the defendants are a \u201chealth care facility,\u201d not under the general definition, but as a \u201ccentral service facility,\u201d a specifically designated exception to the general definition. While we agree with the trial court that the defendants are a \u201ccentral service facility,\u201d discussed in part B, infra, we disagree with the court\u2019s reading of the general definition of \u201chealth care facility or institution\u201d in \u00a7 19a-145.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The general definition of a health care facility as \u201cany facility or institution engaged primarily in providing services for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of human health conditions\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 19a-145; clearly applies to the specific operations listed after this definition. In leading from the general definition to the specific types of service organizations listed thereafter, the statute states: <em>\u201cincluding, </em>but not limited to . . . central service facilities . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 19a-145. To hold, as did the trial court, that the specific facilities listed in the statute are <em>exceptions </em>to the general definition would be to ignore the plain meaning of the words employed and the inexorable logic of the sentence structure of the statute. Therefore, the question to be answered in this appeal is the meaning of the general definition. The commission argues that the word \u201cand\u201d in the phrase \u201cprevention, diagnosis and treatment\u201d should be construed as \u201cor\u201d so that an entity performing only one of the three functions would meet the definition of a \u201chealth care facility or institution.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">We will review \u00a7 19a-145 in the light of well established principles that require us to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>201 Conn. 89, 93, 513 A.2d 124 (1986); <em>Norwich </em>v.

Sands 1984) \u00a7 45.05. An examination of the overall structure of \u00a7 19a-145 reveals that many of the itemized facilities do not provide all three of the services in question. Thus, the proper interpretation to be given the word \u201cand\u201d is not clear and unambiguous. \u201cWhen we are confronted . . . with ambiguity in a statute, we seek to ascertain the actual intent by looking to the words of the statute itself; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 673; <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>Durante, </em>192 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>207, 214, 471 A.2d 1368 (1984); the legislative history and circumstances surrounding the enactment of the statute; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 673; <em>DeFonce Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>State, </em>198 Conn. 185, 187, 501 A.2d 745 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Parmalee, </em>197 Conn. 158, 161, 496 A.2d 186 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delafose, </em>[185 Conn. 517, 522, 441 A.2d 158 (1981)]; and the purpose the statute is to serve. <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 64, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985); <em>Verrastro </em>v. <em>Sivertsen, </em>188 Conn. 213, 221, 448 A.2d <em>1344(1982); Robinson v.

What the legislative intent expressed by the phrase [in question] as used in the statute is cannot be determined by resort to a definition of the word \u2018and\u2019 per se but must be deduced from a consideration of the several pertinent statutory provisions indicative of the policy of the state in conferring upon [the commission, the responsibility at issue]. . . .

The statute specifically includes in its definition of \u201chealth care facility or institution,\u201d \u201cdiagnostic and treatment facilities,\u201d an obvious contradiction to the court\u2019s conclusion that the use of \u201cand\u201d is conjunctive. Likewise, \u201chome health care agencies,\u201d \u201chomemaker-home health aide agencies,\u201d and \u201cnursing home facilities,\u201d three types of operations also included within the statute, do not provide all three of these services. See General Statutes \u00a7 19a-490 (d) (definition of home health care agency); General Statutes \u00a7 l9a-490 (e) (definition of homemaker-home health aide agency); General Statutes \u00a7 19a-521 (definition of nursing home facility). Only the construction of \u201cand\u201d as disjunctive makes the inclusion of these four specific services logically consistent with the general definition of \u201chealth care facility or institution.\u201d \u201cIn construing a statute, we will assume the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result.\u201d <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>supra, 66. \u201cInsofar as it is possible, the entire enactment is to be harmonized, each part made operative.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>176 Conn. 17, 20, 404 A.2d 873 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The legislative intent expressed by the phrase in question can also be found in the fact that the legislature recently amended \u00a7 19a-145 to read in pertinent part: \u201cprevention, diagnosis <em>or </em>treatment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Public Acts 1989, No. 89-72, \u00a7 4. During the House of Representatives debate on the proposed amendment, Representative Doreen M. Del Bianco stated that the purpose of the amendment was one of clarification. 32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1989 Sess., pp. 3000-3002. \u201c[A] clarifying act, which \u2018in effect construes and clarifies a prior statute must be accepted as the legislative declaration of the meaning of the origi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>nal act.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasko, </em>202 Conn. 541, 557, 522 A.2d 753 (1987), quoting <em>Tax Commissioner </em>v. <em>Estate of Bissell, </em>173 Conn. 232, 246, 377 A.2d 305 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Finally, the restrictive interpretation of \u00a7 19a-145 adopted by the trial court, and urged by the defendants, would undermine the overall purpose of the legislature in creating the commission. The broad scope of the legislative scheme is evident in the provision of General Statutes \u00a7 19a-150 defining the general duties of the commission on hospitals and health care: \u201cThe commission, in consultation with the state bureau of health planning and development, shall carry out a continuing state-wide health care facility utilization review, including a study of existing health care delivery systems; recommend improvements in health care procedures to the health care facilities and institutions; recommend to the commissioner legislation in the area of health care programs; and report annually to the governor and the general assembly, on January first, its findings, recommendations and proposals for improving efficiency, lowering health care costs, coordinating use of facilities and services and expanding the availability of health care throughout the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The commission regulates rates and budgets for health care facilities. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19a-151, 19a-152, 19a-156, 19a-166. It also regulates the capital expenditures and acquisition of major medical equipment for health care facilities in an effort to increase the quality, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness of health care delivery in Connecticut. General Statutes \u00a7 19a-155. Clearly, in order to meet its panoramic responsibilities, the commission must be able to regulate the provision of health care services in facilities that fulfill any or all of the three broad statutory functions of \u201cprevention, diagnosis and treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>To adopt the trial court\u2019s reading of the general definition would enable providers of health care services to avoid regulation by the commission by the mere juggling of corporate entities or careful allocation of services to different operations. Such \u201cBalkanization\u201d of inherently unitary health services can only chip away at the commission\u2019s authority in this vitally important area of service to Connecticut\u2019s citizens. We will not advance such an undertaking. In order to achieve a reasonable and rational result that is harmonious with the broad socially ameliorative purposes of the statute, we construe the word \u201cand\u201d in \u00a7 19a-145 to mean \u201cor.\u201d Therefore, since the defendants provide a diagnostic service, they operate a \u201chealth care facility or institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The defendants next claim that the court erroneously determined that the defendants are a \u201ccentral service facility.\u201d The main thrust of the defendants\u2019 argument is somewhat difficult to grasp. They claim that the court answered a question that was not before it. The question before the court, the defendants argue, was not whether Cromwell Imaging Center or Cromwell Diagnostic, P.C., were health care facilities, but rather whether MRI of Cromwell Diagnostic, P.C., was a health care facility, because the commission sought injunctions only against MRI of Cromwell Diagnostic, P.C. This argument is seriously in error. In its prayer for relief, the commission sought temporary and permanent injunctions \u201cbarring the defendants from operating and providing MRI services at the \u2018Cromwell Imaging Center\u2019 until such time as the defendants . . . received the necessary approval . . . .\u201d The gravamen of the commission\u2019s complaint embraces the concept that, despite the labyrinthian corporate and management structure involved, all of the defendants together control the provision of services at the Crom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>well Imaging Center. Paragraph one of the first count alleges that <em>all </em>of the defendants operate and control the center. Paragraph 12 then alleges that \u201c[t]hese related entities . . . constitute a health care facility ... as defined in Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 19a-145.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">It is significant that the defendants at trial did not directly challenge the court\u2019s conclusion that the defendants are jointly controlled by Lakoff and Med-scan, Inc. The defendants also did not specifically challenge the court\u2019s conclusion that all of the defendants together, operating the Cromwell Imaging Center, are encompassed by the definition of a \u201chealth care facility\u201d in \u00a7 19a-145, because they operate a \u201ccentral service facilit[y] serving one or more . . . practitioners . . . . \u201d The defendants\u2019 argument thus fails if the interlocking entities constitute a \u201ccentral service facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The defendants rely principally on the unreported Superior Court decision of <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care </em>v. <em>Neuro-Diagnostics, P.C., </em>Court of Common Pleas, Hartford County, Docket No. 143812 (December 20, 1977), to argue that the court erroneously determined that, in operating a \u201ccentral service facility,\u201d the defendants are subject to the approval provision of General Statutes \u00a7 19a-154. In <em>NeuroDiagnostics, P.C., </em>a group of neurologists had formed a professional corporation to provide all manner of neurological services. The court denied the commission\u2019s request for an injunction, under the statutory predecessors of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19a-145 and 19a-155, against the defendants\u2019 proposed purchase and operation of a C.T. Scanner. In the opinion, the court stated that \u201cthe purpose and intention of the legislature was to regulate hospitals and public institutions and not the private practice of medicine.\u201d We note first that this opinion of the trial court, although entitled to serious consideration, is not binding authority in this court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>More cogently, <em>Neuro-Diagnostics, P.C., </em>concerned the private practice of medicine, and has remote relevance to the instant case where the private practice of medicine is not involved. In the present case, the defendants\u2019 operation resembles a hospital type of diagnostic service in that patients are referred to the center for particular tests rather than to specific physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">We are thus left with the simple question of whether the court correctly concluded that the Imaging Center is a \u201ccentral service facility.\u201d No litany of canons of statutory construction is required for this task. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) provides: \u201cIn the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language . . . .\u201d \u201cWhen the words of a statute are plain and unambiguous, we need look no further for interpretive guidance because we assume that the words themselves express the intention of the legislature. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>196 Conn. 309, 316, 493 A.2d 846 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1063, 106 S. Ct. 813, 88 L. Ed. 2d 787 (1986); <em>Mazur </em>v. <em>Blum, </em>184 Conn. 116, 118-19, 441 A.2d 65 (1981).\u201d <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra, 93. As the trial court stated, an imaging center \u201cprovides a diagnostic <em>service </em>to doctors or other facilities in its surrounding area, or . . . from\u2018all over.\u2019The geographical location of a center such as this must be central to the surrounding referring physicians.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) We agree that the Cromwell Imaging Center is a \u201ccentral service facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The defendants next claim that to subject them to the approval provision of General Statutes \u00a7 19a-154 violates their constitutional rights to equal protection under the federal and state constitutions. The basis of the defendants\u2019 claim is that a diagnostic facility should be treated no differently than are private doctors offices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>as in <em>Neuro-Diagnostics, P.C. </em>Since this claim was not raised below, we do not consider it. Practice Book \u00a7 4185. We note, in passing, however, that the defendants state the following: \u201cIf the court were to: (a) hold that MRI of Cromwell Diagnostic, P.C., is within the reach of \u00a7 19a-154, but (b) acknowledge that the group in <em>Neuro-Diagnostics, P.C., </em>is not within the statute (which was the determination of the <em>Neuro-Diagnostics, P.C. </em>court . . .), then a classification [that is unrelated to the purposes of the legislation] would be placed between the two groups.\u201d The defendants\u2019 equal protection argument is, therefore, based on a scenario that has not occurred. We have not acknowledged that the group in <em>Neuro-Diagnostics, P.C., </em>is not within the statute. That case is obviously not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The defendants\u2019 second claim is that the court erred in implicitly holding that they were introducing an \u201cadditional function or service\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 19a-154 (a). This claim focuses on the statutory language that provides for the regulation of those health care facilities \u201cwhich intend[s] to introduce any additional function or service into its program of care.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 19a-154 (a). The basis of the defendants\u2019 argument is that MRI of Cromwell Diagnostic, P.C., is a new MRI service just beginning operation and, as such, it seeks not to add to an existing service but to start an MRI service where nothing previously existed. We find this claim to be without merit. It overlooks completely the trial court\u2019s central finding concerning the functional unity of all the pieces of the corporate jigsaw puzzle that operated the Cromwell Imaging Center.
