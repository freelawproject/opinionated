Upon motions by the defendants, the trial court dismissed the appeals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, concluding that the plaintiffs lacked standing under General Statutes \u00a7 19a-158,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which specifically authorizes appeals from CHHC decisions by \u201c[ajny health care facility or institution,\u201d and that, in any event, they were not \u201caggrieved,\u201d as required for an appeal under both \u00a7 19a-158 and General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the latter of which the plaintiffs had relied upon in bringing these appeals. We do not address the first ground of the decision, but agree with the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>court in regard to the second ground, the failure of the plaintiffs to establish aggrievement. Accordingly, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The facts, which were presented to the trial court in the complaint and in affidavits and exhibits submitted in conjunction with the motions to dismiss, are not disputed. The plaintiffs are the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, Inc., which represents employers who provide health insurance to their employees; Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Connecticut, Inc., an insurer that provides health insurance to those insured under the policies it has issued; and the Insurance Association of Connecticut, a trade association whose members are domestic insurers that provide health insurance to their policyholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">During August and September, 1988, CHHC issued the 1989 rate orders, applicable to each Connecticut hospital for the fiscal year October 1,1988, to September 30, 1989. These rates were established in accordance with formulae set forth in the statutes and regulations as applied to the data concerning its past financial operations that each hospital is required to submit to CHHC in order to implement the prospective payment system adopted in 1984 for hospitals in this state. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19a-165 through 19a-165v. Thirty-two of the hospitals made timely requests for reconsideration of their rate orders. Each rate order had set forth the date on which a public hearing would be scheduled if a particular hospital should request reconsideration of its rates. CHHC granted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>requests for reconsideration and issued temporary stays of the rate orders. The plaintiffs sought to participate in the reconsideration proceedings, but CHHC denied them this opportunity. During October, 1988, CHHC cancelled the public hearings on reconsideration that had been previously scheduled and conducted informal negotiations with the hospitals concerning their requests for reconsideration. As a result of these negotiations, CHHC entered into an \u201cagreed settlement\u201d with each hospital regarding its request for reconsideration and revised the original 1989 rate orders by increasing the rates in order to allow the hospitals additional revenue. These settlements were approved in formal decisions issued by CHHC in December, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The plaintiffs filed appeals from the revisions of the original hospital rate orders effectuated by the settlements. The thirty-two appeals were consolidated for the purpose of resolving the jurisdictional issues raised by the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. Following the rendition of judgments dismissing each appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the plaintiffs filed a joint appeal seeking review of that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">It is fundamental that, in order to have standing to bring an administrative appeal, a person must be aggrieved. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>198 Conn. 498, 501, 503 A.2d 1161 (1986); <em>Hartford Distributors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>177 Conn. 616, 622, 419 A.2d 346 (1979). Both \u00a7 4-183 (a), upon which the plaintiffs rely for authority to appeal, and \u00a7 19a-158, which the defendants claim is the exclusive basis for appealing from a CHHC decision, expressly require that one be \u201caggrieved\u201d by a \u201cfinal decision\u201d in order to appeal. In the absence of such aggrievement, the appeal must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Local 1303 &amp; Local 1378 </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>191 Conn. 173, 177, 463 A.2d 613 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">\u201cThe fundamental test by which the status of aggrievement for purposes of qualifying to take an appeal from an administrative order or regulation is determined encompasses a well-settled twofold determination. First, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific, personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest, such as is the concern of all members of the community as a whole. Second, the party claiming aggrievement must successfuly establish that this specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the decision.\u201d <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>166 Conn. 43, 51, 347 A.2d 89 (1974). The trial court concluded that the plaintiffs had not passed the first part of this test \u201cin that they failed to demonstrate a specific, personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision as distinguished from a general interest, such as the concern of all members of the community as a whole.\u201d The court found it unnecessary to consider the second part.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">We agree with the trial court that the plaintiffs have no interest in the decisions of CHHC revising the hospital rates for the 1989 fiscal year beginning on October 1, 1988, that would satisfy the requirement of aggrievement. The fact that they are obligated contractually to pay the rates established by CHHC in these decisions gives them no more standing than their policyholders or other contractual beneficiaries would have to challenge the decision. These beneficiaries, in turn, have no greater interest than those members of the general public who have no health insurance and must pay the rates established. The financial impact of an increase in hospital rates is borne by all members of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>the public when they require hospitalization and are presented with bills for the services rendered. The agreements the plaintiffs have made to bear or share these hospitalization expenses with their policyholders or other contractual obligees do not create aggrievement for the purpose of an appeal unless those who pay directly for their hospitalization would be similarly aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The plaintiffs do not contend that members of the public can be deemed aggrieved by an increase in hospital rates so that they would be entitled to appeal. The rate setting procedures designed by the legislature in establishing the prospective payment system for hospitals do not provide for public hearings before those rates are initially established by CHHC. The rates are determined entirely upon the basis of the data submitted by the hospitals. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19a-165a and 19a-165b. Such a procedure does not constitute a \u201ccontested case,\u201d which is a prerequisite for an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (a), upon which the plaintiffs rely. It is not a proceeding \u201cin which the legal rights, duties or privileges of a party are required <em>by statute to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for hearing or in which a hearing is in fact held </em>. . .\u201d; (emphasis added); and thus does not satisfy the definition of a \u201ccontested case\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statutes provided no opportunity for hearings before the initial rate orders were issued by CHHC in August and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>September, 1988, and the record does not indicate that hearings were actually held. The plaintiffs, whose aggrievement status is no greater than that of the public,. therefore, could not have appealed from those orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The plaintiffs maintain, however, that, because the defendant hospitals, after receiving the original rate orders, requested hearings before CHHC, pursuant to \u00a7 19a-165q-45 (b)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, for reconsideration of the rates initially established, the plaintiffs would have had the opportunity to participate at such hearings if they had been held. Subdivision (4) of this regulation provides that \u201cpayers and other interested parties may participate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>in accordance with the Commission\u2019s rules of practice.\u201d The regulation cannot be construed to elevate the status of payers, such as the plaintiffs, for purposes of aggrievement above that of the general public, however, because it also allows for participation by members of the public as \u201cother interested parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">We need not determine whether, if the hearings had been held and the plaintiffs had participated in them, they might have been \u201caggrieved\u201d and, therefore, could have appealed pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (a). All the hospitals settled their disputes with CHHC without the necessity of any hearings, implicitly withdrawing their requests for reconsideration hearings. The plaintiffs, therefore, never were entitled to participate in any hearing to which the regulation relied upon would apply, once the hospitals no longer requested such hearings. Even if the mere filing of such a request were deemed to transform the proceeding before CHHC into a \u201ccontested case,\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-177 (d)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> expressly provides for a disposition of a contested case by an \u201cagreed settlement,\u201d the procedure followed by CHHC here. This specific statutory authorization is a sufficient rebuttal of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims that CHHC violated their rights by holding informal discussions with the hospitals culminating in settlements rather than rendering a formal decision after a hearing upon each of the thirty-two requests for reconsideration. Absent bad faith, collusion or other improprieties, none of which the plaintiffs here allege, the decision of an agency to settle a disputed case does not violate the rights of anyone, least of all one who is not a party to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>the proceeding. See <em>Sendak </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>7 Conn. App. 238, 244, 508 A.2d 781 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">We agree with the trial court that the plaintiffs are not aggrieved because they have failed to demonstrate a legal interest in the subject matter of the decisions approving the settlement agreements that can be distinguished from the interest of the general public in hospital rate increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 19a-158, when these appeals were commenced, provided: \u201cappeals.
