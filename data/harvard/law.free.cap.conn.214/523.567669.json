Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AA6p\">The plaintiff, Emery J. Vajda, brought this action for damages resulting from injuries and losses he sustained when a motorcycle he was operating collided with an automobile operated by the defendant Diane M. Tusla (defendant).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury, through interrogatories, found that the plaintiff was 25 percent negligent and the defendant 75 percent negligent. It further found that the total amount of damages sustained by the plaintiff was $200,000 and it, therefore, rendered a verdict of $150,000 under the doctrine of comparative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">The defendant thereafter filed a motion to set aside the verdict alleging a number of errors by the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>court. The trial court denied the motion on every ground advanced. This appeal followed. On appeal, however, the defendant has presented only one issue for our review. Her sole claim is that the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury as she orally requested with regard to comments made by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel during his argument when, referring to an anesthesiology bill, that had been admitted into evidence, which was for $311.50 for two hours of anesthesia, counsel suggested to the jury that relief from pain was worth $150 per hour.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The defendant focuses on the following portion of the plaintiff\u2019s argument: \u201cNobody pays for pain. Now how do you measure what he should get because he has pain? You see the problem? It\u2019s a problem. It\u2019s difficult, difficult. The only thing you\u2019ll notice in this case, you\u2019ll notice when you go through the bills, that Jimmy has incurred One Thousand Eight Hundred Dollars ($1,800) for anesthesiology. And you\u2019ll see that what he\u2019s incurred is a hundred and fifty dollars ($150) an hour on one bill to be relieved of pain. That\u2019s about the only time, I guess, if you think about it, that we sort of measure the value of pain and suffering, because I think all of us, whether it\u2019s going to the dentist or having an operation, or perhaps buying some sort of pain medication. But generally, when you look at those bills, that\u2019s about the only time that we sort of pay to be free from pain and suffering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>During the recess after the plaintiffs argument and prior to the defendant\u2019s argument, the defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel \u201cmentioning that a hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00) an hour is the only price, so far, that has been put on the relief of an hour\u2019s worth of pain, smacks of suggesting a figure and/or a formula which is precisely why the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled as it did last week on the cases <em>[Carchidi </em>v. <em>Rodenhiser, </em>209 Conn. 526, 551 A.2d 1249 (1989), and <em>Pool </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>209 Conn. 536, 551 A.2d 1254 (1989),] that were appealed with regard to mentioning a money figure to the jury both as an opinion; and mentioning a money figure to the jury with regard to a formula . . . but I would move that the Court, prior to my argument, issue a brief instruction to the jury that a figure suggested by Mr. Tremont is in no way indicative, and should not be considered by them as an appropriate amount or suggestion as to what an hour\u2019s worth of pain or suffering or whatever is worth.\u201d He continued: \u201cAnd also, it\u2019s misleading because what\u2019s going on in a surgical procedure, where you\u2019re opening up a part of the body, and removing bone or removing scar tissue is not the same sort of thing that Mr. Vajda testified to here in the courtroom. And it\u2019s awfully misleading to the jury for them to have thrown out to them, during a closing instruction, a figure about what an hour\u2019s worth of pain is worth in the sort of context.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel responded, arguing \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the [Supreme Court] decision says that you cannot mention pain . . . [and] suffering . . . .\u2019\u2019In further response to the defendant\u2019s argument that his comments equated $150 an hour to one hour\u2019s worth of pain, plaintiff\u2019s counsel continued stating that the fact is \u201c[t]he stuff is in evidence, and there\u2019s a three hundred and eleven dollar ($311.00) bill for two hours of anesthesia.\u201d Maintaining that he did not think of it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>as a formula nor did he suggest a formula to the jury, he said that \u201cI\u2019m saying that this is one of the few times in our life that we actually pay to be free of pain.\u201d Stating that he had been careful in his argument to avoid including comments that suggested \u201cany formula to [the jury] whatsoever, or any figure,\u201d he contended that no instruction was needed as the defendant claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The defendant\u2019s counsel, in reply, stated that what the plaintiff\u2019s counsel \u201cwas trying to do was to subliminally inject into [the jury] what an hour\u2019s worth of pain is worth,\u201d and he repeated that this was why this court ruled in <em>Carchidi </em>and <em>Pool </em>as it did. In further attacking these comments of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, he again argued that \u201can hour\u2019s worth of surgery is not the same thing\u201d as one hour\u2019s worth of pain. To support further his claim that the plaintiff was \u201csuggesting [to the jury] what they should do in the area of damages,\u201d he referred to the comment by the plaintiff during argument that, based upon the plaintiff\u2019s stipulated life expectancy of 45.7 years,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the jury would have \u201cto compensate [the plaintiff for forty-five-point-seven years for every minute and every hour for the rest of his life.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>The trial court indicated that it would take the matter under advisement and that if it did anything, it would be done during its final charge to the jury. The trial court did not give the jury any instructions until after the arguments were concluded. The defendant\u2019s counsel took no exception to the trial court\u2019s decision not to give an instruction at the time of the arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">At the outset of its final jury instructions, the trial court admonished the jury that \u201cin deciding this case, you must only consider that information which was admitted as evidence in this courtroom.\u201d On the issue of damages as to physical and mental pain and suffering, the trial court charged, inter alia: \u201cThe rule of damages is that insofar as money can do it, the Plaintiff is to get fair, just and reasonable compensation for the injuries which he has suffered. It is for you, ladies and gentlemen, in the exercise of your best judgment, to say what is fair and just compensation. You have to apply sound common sense in reaching the amount of your verdict. There is no mathematical formula, no formula, other than by human experience; and the exercise of your best judgment of what is fair and just compensation. . . . You must not speculate or guess as to damages. You must bear in mind at all times that the burden is on the Plaintiff to prove that [it] was a proximate consequence or the result of the incident which caused the injuries; and to prove the reasonable amount of his damages.\u201d The trial court thereafter told the jury that the elements of damages could be separated into two major categories: the first from the date of injury on June 29,1984, to the date of the trial, and the second, as to the future. As to the former, it told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>the jury that it could award a sum \u201cwhich will reasonably compensate him for any past physical suffering\u201d as well as damages \u201cfor mental suffering that he has experienced.\u201d After instructing the jury to consider the effects of the plaintiffs injuries \u201cand the resulting pain that he has experienced; and the effect it has had on his daily activities,\u201d it said that \u201c[a]s far as money can compensate him for this aspect of the case, you must award a fair, just, and reasonable sum.\u201d Immediately thereafter, it said: \u201cObviously, this is a difficult matter to determine. There are no objective guidelines by which you can measure the money equivalent of these elements of injury. The only real measuring stick, if it can be so described, is your collective enlightened judgment. In making your determination, you should consider all the relevant evidence; taking into consideration the extent and the duration of such pain and suffering. In this respect, you may consider the testimony of the Plaintiff, the Plaintiffs girlfriend, and the doctor. The amount you award for this aspect of the damages must be fair and reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Turning to damages for the future, the trial court said, inter alia: \u201cAs for the future, you must as best you can, compensate him for such results as are reasonably probable. Once this case is concluded, the Plaintiff cannot come back into Court and \u2014 in the future for additional damages against the Defendant for the incident in question. So any award to which he is entitled for the future, must be given to him now. Future damages are not a matter of speculation. It is not a matter of guesswork. You must be satisfied with a reasonable degree of certainty that the result which you are attempting to compensate him for is reasonably probable.\u201d The jury was also instructed that it \u201cmust determine for how long into the future [the plaintiff] will suffer these damages.\u201d Here, it referred to the evidence that the plaintiff had \u201csustained a twenty-five percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>permanent disability to his forearm,\u201d as well as that, according to the mortality tables, he had 45.7 years of life expectancy, the ramifications of which it explained fully.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Thereafter, the trial court also said: \u201cIn determining damages for the future, you should consider the physical pain and suffering he will endure, and the effects it will have on his daily activities. I realize that, for the future, this is even more difficult to evaluate than it was for that which has occurred before trial. However, you must award a fair, just, and reasonable sum for this aspect of the case, taking into consideration, where applicable, what I\u2019ve had to say about these elements of damages for the period prior to trial.\u201d After it had concluded its charge on damages, the court said: \u201c[Cjounsel [have] commented on some of the evidence in their summations. I wish to stress to you that you are the sole judges of the facts. And if [your] recollection of the facts differs from mine or that of the attorneys, it is your recollection that controls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">After the trial court had instructed the jury, the defendant\u2019s counsel took the following exception: <em>\u201cI </em>had requested yesterday at the conclusion of Attorney Tremont\u2019s remarks, that Your Honor issue some sort of a supplemental charge or instruction to the jury that counsel\u2019s mentioning of the one hundred and fifty dollar ($150.00) an hour figure was not to be considered by them in terms of evaluating an hour\u2019s worth of pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">\u201cFirst, because I believe it violated <em>Carchidi </em>v. <em>Rodenhiser </em>and <em>Pool </em>v. <em>Bell; </em>both of which came down about a week or two ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">\u201cAnd secondly, because I believe it was misleading for him to say that one hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00) an hour is what the marketplace, so to speak, has put on an hour\u2019s worth of pain and suffering, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>that really was what it cost to anesthetize the Plaintiff during a surgical procedure. And that\u2019s certainly not the same thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In its memorandum of decision on the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict, the trial court addressed the defendant\u2019s claim that it had erred \u201cby allowing plaintiff\u2019s counsel to comment in final argument on the hourly rate an anesthesiologist charged in the context that those comments were made.\u201d It noted the defendant\u2019s argument that \u201cConnecticut law prohibited [the plaintiff\u2019s counsel] from suggesting a monetary figure to the jury which he believed they should award for damages; <em>Carchidi </em>v. <em>Rodenhiser, </em>[supra,] 530; [or] a monetary formula. <em>Pool </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>[supra,] 539.\u201d Continuing, it also noted that during the plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s argument he \u201cproceeded to discuss the nature of pleasure by making reference to such things as attending the theater,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to which the defendant did not object.\u201d Turning to the anesthesiologist\u2019s bill, the trial court observed, in its memorandum, that that bill included \u201ca charge of $302 [sic] for 2 hours of service.\u201d It said that \u201c[surely], counsel [had] a right to comment on [this] bill which was a full exhibit and which itemized the charge of $302 [sic] for the 2 hours.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Not only did the plaintiff, the trial court said, have a right to argue the element of pain and suffering but in doing so, \u201che had a right to symbolically characterize the elements of pain and suffering just as he had a right to symbolically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>characterize pleasure.\u201d Positing that <em>Carchidi </em>and <em>Pool </em>\u201cmust be put in their proper factual perspectives,\u201d the trial court determined that \u201c[n]either [of] the arguments in <em>Carchidi </em>and <em>Pool </em>[was] similar to those in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It concluded its disposition of this claim by observing that \u201c[c]arrying <em>[Carchidi </em>and Pool] further than their factual underpinnings would certainly deprive counsel, both for the plaintiff and [the] defendant, of effective use of final arguments which is an essential part of a jury trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the excerpted portion of the plaintiffs summation is in direct contravention of our holdings in <em>Carchidi </em>and <em>Pool. </em>Here she claims that the challenged comments fall directly within the prohibitions of these decisions, particularly pointing to <em>Pool, </em>where we said that because we had concluded in <em>Carchidi </em>that counsel may not argue the pecuniary value of a plaintiff's personal injuries by suggesting specific sums to be awarded for such intangibles as pain and related disability, \u201cit necessarily follows that counsel may not indicate the monetary components used to arrive at the sums suggested for such elements of damages.\u201d <em>Pool </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>supra, 539; see <em>Carchidi </em>v. <em>Rodenhiser, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Damages may be awarded for pain and suffering, past, present and future, resulting from the injuries so long as the evidence affords a basis for a reasonable estimate by the trier of fact of the amount. <em>Levin </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>v. <em>Ritson, </em>179 Conn. 223, 228, 425 A.2d 1279 (1979); <em>Ball </em>v. <em>Pardy Construction Co., </em>108 Conn. 549, 551, 143 A. 855 (1928); <em>Leabo </em>v. <em>Leninski, 2 </em>Conn. App. 715, 727, 484 A.2d 239 (1984); see J. Stein, Damages and Recovery (1972) \u00a7 8. An award of damages for pain and suffering is peculiarly within the province of the trier of fact and the fact that it is difficult to measure pain and suffering in terms of money does not prevent a recovery for that element of damages. <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Michael, </em>188 Conn. 607, 616, 452 A.2d 1157 (1982); <em>Sadonis </em>v. <em>Govan, </em>132 Conn. 668, 670, 46 A.2d 895 (1946); <em>Leabo </em>v. <em>Leninski, </em>supra. Not only are damages for pain and suffering peculiarly for the trier of fact, but \u201c[p]roper compensation [for pain and suffering] cannot be computed by a mathematical formula . . . there is no iron-clad rule for the assessment of damages.\u201d <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Michael, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">It is against this background that we decided <em>Carchidi </em>and <em>Pool, </em>both of which are factually distinguishable from this case. In <em>Carchidi, </em>we held that counsel could not, during closing argument, \u201cstate to the jury his belief as to the pecuniary value of the plaintiff\u2019s personal injury claim . . . because [to do so] improperly influences the jury in arriving at a verdict.\u201d <em>Carchidi </em>v. <em>Rodenhiser, </em>supra, 526-27.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In that case, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel sought and obtained permission, over the defendant\u2019s objection, to argue to the jury a specific amount of money, $30,000, that the jury should return as a verdict. In ruling that he could do so, the trial court stated that \u201cthese suggestions could not be in combination with any mathematical formulae.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id., 527. In <em>Pool, </em>the trial court permitted the plaintiff\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>in closing argument to use a blackboard<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to set forth a per diem mathematical formula for use by the jury in computing the damages to be awarded to the plaintiff. <em>Pool </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>supra, 537. We further observed in <em>Pool </em>that although <em>Levin </em>v. <em>Ritson, </em>supra, \u201cdrew a distinction between suggesting a sum to be awarded for pain and suffering and using a mathematical formula based on speculative factors,\u201d because \u201cour holding in <em>Carchidi </em>is applicable to both types of arguments\u201d; id., 539; there was no need to decide whether our holding in <em>Levin </em>\u201cleft the use of mathematical formulae in closing argument to the discretion of the trial court, as that question is now academic.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id., 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>At the outset of our analysis, we take up the defendant\u2019s threshold claim that the piaintiff\u2019s argument violated our decisions in <em>Carchidi </em>and <em>Pool. </em>The plaintiff in this case, however, did not, as in <em>Carchidi, </em>state \u201cto the jury his belief as to the pecuniary value of the plaintiff\u2019s personal injury claim\u201d during his argument. <em>Carchidi </em>v. <em>Rodenhiser, </em>supra, 526. Specifically, we determine that there was no violation of our statement in <em>Carchidi </em>that \u201cthe practice of mentioning the sum to be awarded to the plaintiff for pain and suffering constitutes an unwarranted intrusion into the domain of the jurors.\u201d Id., 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">In discussing our determination that <em>Carchidi </em>was not violated, we should point out that, in <em>Pool, </em>we noted that our holding in <em>Carchidi </em>was applicable to both types of arguments, whether based on a \u201clump sum\u201d or on a mathematical formula. Moreover, in <em>Pool, </em>we commented upon the distinction we drew in <em>Levin </em>v. <em>Ritson, </em>supra, \u201cbetween suggesting a sum to be awarded for pain and suffering and using a mathematical formula based on speculative factors.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Pool </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>supra, 539. The plaintiff\u2019s challenged argument was not one, reasonably understood, to have \u201csuggest[ed] a sum to be awarded for pain and suffering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The challenged argument did not mention or suggest the sum to be awarded to the plaintiff for pain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>suffering, and it did not imply any mathematical formula to be used by the jury to do so. It did, at its worst, imply that during the two hours he was subjected to the anesthesia, he was free of conscious pain and suffering, and the charge for that service, as indicated by the anesthesiologist\u2019s bill, came to approximately $150 per hour.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The challenged remarks could not be considered a suggestion, as the defendant claims in violation of our case law. It then follows that there was no mathematical formula suggested in the practical use of that term in the sense of the existence of a group of components in association to express a single concept, i.e., how to arrive at a dollar amount. This portion of the plaintiff\u2019s argument was truly isolated in the sense that it stood alone in the argument; it contained nothing that the jury could conceivably have applied to the evidence to translate into a specific dollar amount. It hardly needs pointing out that there was no blackboard with the itemization of damages as in <em>Pool </em>nor the declaration by counsel of a specific sum for the value of the plaintiff\u2019s personal injury claim as in <em>Carchidi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">In the context of the defendant\u2019s claim that the argument violated our case law, it is important to keep in mind the effect of this argument upon the jury whose province as factfinders was thereby allegedly intruded upon. This jury had seen and heard all of the evidence including the testimony of the plaintiff, his girl friend and the medical expert concerning, inter alia, pain and suffering. It also had the exhibits, including medical and hospital records, and, in addition, the evidence on the plaintiff\u2019s life expectancy. Not only must the jury\u2019s knowledge of the evidence be factored into assessing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>the effect, if any, upon them of the argument, but the common sense and human experience of the jury must also be considered. \u201cJurors are not \u2018expected to lay aside matters of common knowledge or their own observation and experience of the affairs of life, but, on the contrary, to apply them to the evidence or facts in hand, to the end that their action may be intelligent and their conclusions correct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Frankovitch </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>185 Conn. 14, 22, 440 A.2d 254 (1981); <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>212 Conn. 509, 545, 562 A.2d 1100 (1989). \u201cJurors have the right to apply their own common sense and to use the general knowledge they have in common with the rest of mankind.\u201d <em>Noland </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>207 Kan. 72, 76, 483 P.2d 1029 (1971). \u201c[Tjrials do not take place in a vacuum and justice correctly relies on the common sense and common experience of jurors.\u201d <em>Malvicini </em>v. <em>Stratfield Motor Hotel, Inc., </em>206 Conn. 439, 448, 538 A.2d 690 (1988). The jurors could not reasonably have understood this argument as a \u201csuggestion\u201d or the \u201cmentioning\u201d of a sum to be awarded for pain and suffering because the court\u2019s instructions could reasonably have been interpreted to apply only to any <em>conscious </em>pain and suffering disclosed to them by the evidence that they might choose to credit. A charge to the jury is to be considered from the standpoint of its effect upon the jury in guiding it to a correct verdict and it is to be presumed, in the absence of a clear indication to the contrary, that the jury followed the court\u2019s instructions. <em>Tomczuk </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>184 Conn. 182, 193, 439 A.2d 935 (1981); <em>Lucier </em>v. <em>MeridenWallingford Sand &amp; Stone Co., </em>153 Conn. 422, 426, 216 A.2d 818 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the argument was misleading<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> because it dealt with anesthesia during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>surgery and, therefore, was not, in effect, conscious pain and suffering and, therefore, potentially compensatory also lacks merit for the same reason. It is well here to remember \u201cthat there are injuries to which human experience teaches there is accompanying pain\u201d and jurors \u201care not to be faulted ... if they do not believe all they are told and all that their common experience does not accept. That is not to say, they may disregard obvious injury. It is, however, to say that they are not obliged to believe that every injury causes pain or the pain alleged.\u201d <em>Boggavarapu </em>v. <em>Ponist, </em>518 Pa. 162, 167, 542 A.2d 516 (1988). In light of the trial court\u2019s explicit instructions, we can reasonably expect that the jurors in this case, drawing on their personal reservoir of common sense and human experience, properly assessed the evidence offered to them as to pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury that \u201cin deciding this case, you must only consider that information which was admitted as evidence in this courtroom.\u201d It is axiomatic that arguments of counsel are not evidence. We subscribe to the view that, absent a contrary showing, \u201c[w]e cannot attribute to any jury in this state a lack of sufficient mentality to distinguish between the two.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>56 Wash. 2d 23, 31-32, 351 P.2d 153 (1960); <em>see Newbury </em>v. <em>Vogel, </em>151 Colo. 520, 527, 379 P.2d 811 (1963); <em>Evening Star Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>179 A.2d 377, 382 (D.C.

App. 298, 306, 367 S.W.2d 288 (1962); 29 Am. Jur. 2d, Evidence \u00a7 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>In conclusion, we cannot accept the defendant\u2019s claims that the plaintiff\u2019s argument violated <em>Carchidi </em>or <em>Pool. </em>We have observed that proper compensation for pain and suffering cannot be computed by mathematical formula and that there is no iron-clad rule for the assessment of damages. <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Michael, </em>supra; see also <em>Birgel </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>163 Conn. 23, 34, 301 A.2d 249 (1972); <em>Jerz </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>160 Conn. 219, 222, 276 A.2d 884 (1971). It is fair to say that, had the instructions explicitly addressed the plaintiff\u2019s reference to the anesthesiology bill, as the defendant requested, the trial court in so doing would have highlighted the very argument now challenged. In that event, the jury could then have regarded such an instruction as \u201can implicit recognition\u201d that the trial court considered that argument improper. See <em>Carchidi </em>v. <em>Rodenhiser, </em>supra, 535. As an appellate court, we should not overlook the circumstance that \u201c[f]rom the vantage point of the trial bench, a presiding judge can sense the atmosphere of a trial and can apprehend far better than we can, upon the printed record, what factors, if any, could have improperly influenced the jury.\u201d <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Steck, </em>146 Conn. 114, 119, 148 A.2d 246 (1959); <em>Hearl </em>v. <em>Waterbury YMCA, </em>187 Conn. 1, 3, 444 A.2d 211 (1982); <em>Pisel </em>v. <em>Stamford Hospital, </em>180 Conn. 314, 322, 430 A.2d 1 (1980); <em>Marko </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop, Inc., </em>169 Conn. 550, 559, 364 A.2d 217 (1975). This consideration further supports our conclusion that the trial court did not err as claimed. Finally, it remains only to note that the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict, which included the defendant\u2019s present claim on appeal, is entitled to great weight. <em>Hearl </em>v. <em>Waterbury YMCA, </em>supra; <em>Kalleher </em>v. <em>Orr, </em>183 Conn. 125, 127, 438 A.2d 843 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-12\"> When this action was instituted, Anthony A.

Such significant circumstances involving the nature, extent and intensity of pain and suffering from one person to another reinforces the \"wisdom of the use of the fair, just and reasonable compensation standard for pain and suffering by the jury unaided by anything not disclosed by the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\"> Immediately prior to the comments upon which the defendant fbcuses, the plaintiffs counsel, without objection, said: \u201cAnd, again, we all know how to buy pleasure, you know?
