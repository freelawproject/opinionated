The defendants, Beechwood Gardens Limited Partnership and the individuals who comprise that partnership, Thomas Johnson and Wendell Harp, have appealed from the judgment sustaining the appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claiming that the trial court erred in applying \u00a7 8-79a-15 to a rent increase that had been approved by DOH before the defendants had made their investment in the property. We find error and remand the case with direction to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">The subordinate facts are not presently disputed. Beginning in late 1983, the defendants Johnson and Harp submitted applications to DOH with respect to a privately owned apartment complex of eighty-two units in New Haven for the purpose of converting it into a moderate rental housing complex pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-69 through 8-74. The final application, submitted on September 19, 1984, proposed renovation of all apartment units for energy conservation and, for eighteen units, to provide access to the handicapped. The estimated completion date for the improvements was February 1,1986, and the projected rent upon completion of the renovations was $465 per month for each apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">On December 1, 1984, the individual defendants formed the defendant partnership, which was to purchase the apartment complex, known as Beechwood Gardens, and complete the project. On the same date the partnership submitted its \u201cproject financing plan and development budget\u201d to DOH pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-74. Attached to this document were two \u201cproject management\u201d plans estimating annual income and expenses. The first estimate of yearly rental income of $326,400, was based upon a monthly rent of $425 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>for each of sixty-four units. This monthly rent, according to testimony at the DOH hearing, would be established while the planned renovations were being completed, it being contemplated that eighteen of the eighty-two apartments would not be occupied during this period. The second estimate of yearly rental income was $457,560, based upon a monthly rental of $465 for each of eighty-two units. According to the testimony at the hearing, this monthly rent was intended to be implemented upon substantial completion of the project. The documents submitted to DOH were approved on December 21, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">. After obtaining this approval, the partnership purchased the Beechwood Gardens apartment complex and, on April 9,1986, substantially completed the proposed renovations. By a letter dated March 24, 1987, DOH permitted implementation of the $465 monthly rental upon execution of some additional documents. After these were submitted to DOH, the partnership notified all tenants of Beechwood Gardens that the monthly rent would be increased to . $465, effective August 1, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The plaintiffs filed a request with DOH for a declaratory ruling invalidating the rent increase. After a hearing, DOH on February 10,1988, issued a final decision in favor of the defendants, in which it was found that \u201cduring the development stage of this project, a rent of $465 per month had been approved by [DOH] to be implemented upon the final completion of the project.\u201d The plaintiffs appealed from this decision seeking its reversal and other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The trial court accepted the factual finding of the DOH hearing officer<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with respect to approval by DOH <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>of the $465 monthly rent upon completion of the \u201cdevelopment stage\u201d of the project. The court concluded, nevertheless, that compliance with \u00a7 8-79a-15 of the regulations was mandated for implementation of the increase in rent from $425 to $465, even though DOH had previously approved the $465 rental charge to be effective upon completion of the project. Judgment was rendered sustaining the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">The defendants have appealed from the judgment, claiming essentially that \u00a7 8-79a-15 is inapplicable to a rental increase that was endorsed by DOH as part of its approval of the entire project before the defendants had made their investment in it. The plaintiffs, presumably as an alternate ground upon which to sustain the judgment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> have attacked the finding of the hearing officer concerning prior DOH approval of the $465 rental charge, maintaining that it is unsupported by the evidence, despite the trial court\u2019s acceptance of that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The regulation relied on by the trial court, \u00a7 8-79a-15, specifies certain procedures to be \u201cfollowed by all developers for any proposed rent increases.\u201d A thirty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>day written notice of the proposed change in rent must be mailed to all tenants informing them also of the date and time of a meeting at which the increase is to be considered. Tenants may submit written comments and may also attend and express their views at the meeting. When the developer applies to DOH for approval of the rent increase, these tenant comments must also be submitted. Following DOH approval of the increase, the developer must give at least thirty days written notice prior to the effective date of the increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The defendants concede that they never complied with this regulation but point out that its applicability is limited to \u201cany <em>proposed </em>rent increases.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The quoted phrase, they contend, does not include implementation of a change in a rent schedule previously approved by DOH. They also maintain that the trial court should have deferred to the DOH interpretation of the regulation as not applicable to the $465 rental charge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The trial court, in interpreting the regulation to apply to all increases in rent, including those approved at the time the project was authorized, relied upon (1) \u201cthe plain meaning of the language of that regulation\u201d; (2) the provision of General Statutes \u00a7 8-72<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that rents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>be fixed \u201cat the lowest possible rates\u201d; and (3) General Statutes \u00a7 8-74 (3),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> requiring that a developer submit annual budgets. The plaintiffs advance the samearguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Because \u00a7 8-79a-15 refers only to \u201cany <em>proposed </em>rent increases,\u201d (emphasis added) the \u201cplain meaning of the language\u201d that the court relied on is not sufficiently clear to resolve the controversy before us simply on that basis. As the defendants maintain, the $465 rental charge had been approved on December 21, 1984, as part of the plan for the entire project to take effect upon its completion. Approval by DOH of the \u201cproposed rents\u201d is a prerequisite to developing a moderate rental housing project and must be obtained when the project is authorized. General Statutes \u00a7 8-74 (3). Subparagraph (a) of the regulation requires notice that \u201ca change in the rent schedule\u201d is to be considered by the developer \u201cand may result in a rent increase.\u201d The schedule of rents submitted to DOH at the time of project approval, which showed the $465 rent for the eighty-two apartment units after completion, was not changed simply by imposition of a rental charge in accordance with that schedule. From the grammatical viewpoint, whether the reference to \u201cany proposed rent increases\u201d should include implementation of a previously approved rental increase is less than \u201cplain,\u201d as the court assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">The court found support for its interpretation in the provision of \u00a7 8-72 declaring that \u201c[e]ach developer . . . shall manage and operate its housing projects in an efficient manner so as to enable it to fix the rentals for dwelling accommodations at the lowest possible rates consistent with providing decent, safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations . . . . \u201d The fact that the initial rent was set at $425 per month while renovations were being completed, the \u201clowest possible\u201d rate as determined by DOH in accordance with the statute, was regarded by the court as an indication that no higher rent was necessary. The assumption of the court that the $425 approved as the \u201clowest possible\u201d rent during the renovation period would also be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>appropriate rent afterward, however, ignores the finding of the DOH hearing officer that the $425 rental was adequate during renovations \u201cdue to certain costs being covered by the construction loan prior to full completion\u201d and that \u201cthe higher amount was not necessary\u201d for that period. At the hearing there was testimony that during the rehabilitation phase of the project taxes and insurance were paid from the construction loan, and that loan interest charges were less than upon completion, when all of these expenses had to be paid from rental income. The court does not appear to have rejected the finding of the hearing officer, nor could it have done so in view of the supporting testimony. Accordingly, there is no basis for its conclusion that the rent established for the development stage should necessarily prevail upon completion of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">The court also referred for support of its interpretation to a provision of General Statutes \u00a7 8-74 (3) requiring a developer to submit for DOH approval \u201cits rent schedules . . . and any changes therein and its proposed budget for each fiscal year, together with such reports and financial and operating statements as the commissioner finds necessary.\u201d The plaintiffs argue that the purpose of this provision for annual DOH review of budgets would be undermined if the agency were permitted to approve future rent increases as part of the original project approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">We are not persuaded that the provision for annual review of proposed budgets was intended to limit DOH at the time a project is approved to setting only rental charges that are to become effective immediately. Such annual surveillance of moderate rental housing projects with respect to financial operation serves many purposes, such as enforcement of rental charges previously approved, controlling various expenses, and generally safeguarding the continued financial viability of the projects, in which the state has a substantial interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>as a mortgage lender. DOH may well have decided that it was necessary to approve rental charges to become effective after completion of the planned rehabilitation so that investors would have some assurance of the ultimate income that the project would generate. New would be inclined to invest in a project without being able to calculate with reasonable confidence the return likely to be realized. Nothing in \u00a7 8-74 can reasonably be construed to preclude DOH from establishing a lower rent for the development stage of a project, when tenants may be greatly inconvenienced by construction operations and not all of the costs must be paid from rental income, and a higher rent upon completion of the work, when these conditions have changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">We conclude that the trial court erred in interpreting \u00a7 8-79a-15 of the regulations to apply to the implementation of a rental charge that had been approved by DOH when the project was first authorized but was not to take effect until completion of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">In attacking the finding of the DOH hearing officer that approval of the $465 rent upon completion was included in the DOH authorization of the entire moderate rental project on December 21,1984, the plaintiffs contend that there is no substantial evidence to support that finding. They maintain that the signature of the deputy commissioner indicating approval on that date of the \u201cproject financing plan and development budget\u201d does not signify approval of the proposed rent of $465 for the eighty-two apartment units upon completion. The hearing officer could reasonably have found otherwise, however, since the $465 proposed rent was indicated in several other documents contained with the \u201cproject financing plan and development budget\u201d in the defendants\u2019 final proposal, which was approved on that date. Section 8-74 requires approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>of the \u201cproposed rents\u201d as one of the prerequisites for development of any moderate rental housing project and it must be presumed that public officials have performed their statutory duties, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary. <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>1477 Central Avenue Apartments, Inc., </em>203 Conn. 246, 254-55, 524 A.2d 610 (1987). \u201cPublic officers, acting in their official capacity, are presumed, until the contrary appears, to have acted legally and properly.\u201d <em>Brookfield </em>v. <em>Candlewood Shores Estates, Inc., </em>201 Conn. 1, 6, 513 A.2d 1218 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">The plaintiffs also refer to a document obtained from the DOH file after the decision of the hearing officer indicating approval of $425 as the rent for eighty-two units on March 5,1985, following the project approval on December 21, 1984. There is no reference to this document in the memorandum of decision, nor do the plaintiffs claim that it was ever called to the attention of the trial court. The plaintiffs have attempted to import this document into the record by attaching it to an affidavit filed while this appeal from the judgment of the trial court was pending,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> claiming that it was admitted into evidence at a later DOH hearing on some unspecified matter. The statute governing this administrative appeal, however, specifies that \u201c[t]he appeal shall be conducted by the court without a jury and <em>shall be confined to the record.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 4-183 (f).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiffs never attempted to enlarge the record by requesting the trial court to order further proceedings for taking additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>evidence pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 4-183 (e).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiffs are, therefore, necessarily limited in this appeal to the evidence presented at the DOH hearing and cannot be permitted to rely upon matters never called to the attention of any trier of fact. The factual issue they seek to raise for the first time on appeal cannot be adequately explored at this stage of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">We conclude that there is sufficient evidence in the record to sustain the finding that the $465 rent had been approved by DOH as part of the project authorization on December 21, 1984, to become effective on completion of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">In this opinion Covello, Hull and Santaniello, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\"> \u201c[Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies] Sec. 8-79a-15.

The trial court, after hearing evidence on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>this issue, concluded that this prior involvement was not substantial and rejected the claim of disqualification.

Because the defendants claim no prejudice from the failure to include a challenge to the findings of the hearing officer in the plaintiffs\u2019 preliminary statement of issues, and have filed a reply brief responding to the plaintiffs\u2019 attack upon the finding, we consider this belatedly raised issue on the merits. See Practice Book \u00a7 4013 (a) (1) and (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b528-6\"> In concluding that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 8-79a-15 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies was erroneous, we are not persuaded that the court disregarded the principle of judicial deference to interpretations of statutes and regulations made by agencies charged with their enforcement. See <em>E.I.S., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Registration, </em>200 Conn. 145, 148-49, 509 A.2d 1056 (1986).

Because I believe that the majority opinion establishes an unwarranted precedent by sanctioning a procedure that allows a developer of a moderate rental housing project to increase rents by not complying with the spirit if not the letter of \u00a7 8-79a-15 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>I accept the analysis of the regulation as set forth in the majority opinion. Under \u00a7 8-79a-15, the tenants have a right to a thirty day written notice that a change in the rent schedule will be considered by the developer at its next meeting. The tenants, during the thirty day period, have a right to submit written comments to the developer and review any documents supporting the proposed rent increase, which will be on file at the office of the developer or management agent. The tenants may attend the noticed meeting and make comments about the proposed rent increase. Furthermore, within fifteen days of the written noticed meeting, the developer must submit to the department of housing (DOH) its recommended management plan plus all of the comments of the tenants. Within thirty days after receipt of the developer\u2019s recommendation, the DOH must approve, disapprove or request modification of the rent increase or any portion of it. If the rent increase is approved by DOH, the developer must give the tenants at least thirty days written notice prior to the effective date of the rent increase. Thus, it must be stressed from the outset that this case has nothing to do with the merits of the determination of whether a developer\u2019s request for a rent increase should be granted. Rather, this case only concerns a developer\u2019s compliance with \u00a7 8-79a-15 as it pertains to a tenant\u2019s right to notice and a hearing regarding rent increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">The majority opinion recognizes that \u201c[t]he defendants concede that they never complied with this regulation but point out that its applicability is limited to \u2018any <em>proposed </em>rent increases.\u2019 (Emphasis added.)\u201d The quoted phrase, the defendants contend, and the majority agrees, does not include implementation of a change in a rent schedule previously approved by DOH. Apparently, however, DOH had some misgivings about the developers\u2019 noncompliance with the regulation because on March 24,1987, Michael T. Duffy, sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>ior director, management division of DOH, wrote a letter<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to Wendell C. Harp, general partner of Renais<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>sanee Beechwood Gardens. Among other matters discussed in his letter, Duffy stated: \u201cIn order to complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>our files, we are enclosing a project management plan for 82 units at a rental charge of $465. Until this time, this document had not been fully executed. This requires your local execution and should be returned to this Department for approval. This approval will be retroactive to April 1986. However, this rent of $465 cannot be charged to any current tenants until they receive thirty (30) days notice (no sooner than May 1, 1987) of this rental change.\u201d In sum, the DOH belatedly suggested that the developers could be rescued from noncompliance by the execution of a project management plan for eighty-two housing units at a rental charge of $465, as the DOH indicated that its approval would \u201cbe retroactive\u201d to April, 1986. According to another letter, dated March 31,1987, from Duffy to Harp, a \u201cfully executed Management Plan [became] effective April 9, 1986.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Thus, this \u201cretroactive\u201d approval of the developers\u2019 management plan enabled the developers to circumvent \u00a7 8-79a-15 of the regulations. Clearly, \u00a7 8-79a-15 of the regulations does no more than give the tenants of a moderate rental housing project an opportunity to have their views considered in the determination by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>DOH as to whether it should approve or disapprove a proposed rental increase by a moderate rental housing project developer. Giving the tenants a right to be heard does not compel disapproval of the developer\u2019s proposal. Presumably, DOH will determine the matter on its merits. Nonetheless, the majority concludes \u201cthat the trial court erred in interpreting \u00a7 8-79a-15 of the regulations to apply to the implementation of a rental charge that had been approved by DOH when the project was first authorized but was not to take effect until completion of the project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">This determination by the majority allows a moderate rental housing project developer to bank and stack rent increases in the developer\u2019s application and thus completely bypass the tenants\u2019 right under \u00a7 8-79a-15 to have their views considered in conjunction with the proposed rent increase. To the poor tenant, I am unpersuaded that there is difference between \u201cany proposed rent increase\u201d and a \u201cpreviously approved rental increase.\u201d The tenant pays more money regardless of the characterization of the \u201crent.\u201d It is significant to note that a letter<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> dated June 24,1987, sent by Bruce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Lebow, senior property manager of Beechwood Gardens, to give notice to the tenants about their future rent, characterized the action as follows: \u201cNotice of rent increase effective August 1,1987 and requirement for execution of apartment lease.\u201d Thus, if the tenants were being notified of a previously approved rent, it is mysterious as to why it would be characterized as a \u201cnotice of rent increase.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In addition, by endorsing the procedure used by the developers to circumvent the spirit if not the letter of \u00a7 8-79a-15, the majority speculates on the inducements for investors to place capital into moderate rental housing projects. The majority states: \u201cDOH may well have decided that it was necessary to approve rental charges to become effective after completion of the planned rehabilitation so that investors would have some assurance of the ultimate income that the project would generate. New would be inclined to invest in a project without being able to calculate with reasonable confidence the return likely to be realized. Nothing in \u00a7 8-74 can reasonably be construed to preclude DOH from establishing a lower rent for the development stage of a project, when tenants may be greatly inconvenienced by construction operations and not all of the costs must be paid from rental income, and a higher rent upon completion of the work, when these conditions have changed.\u201d In my view, however, \u00a7 8-79a-15 is a consumer-oriented regulation. It gives a tenant a minimum input in a moderate rental housing project rent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>increase decision. I am unable to discern any need to speculate about the inducements for investment in moderate rental public housing. Moreover, I do not understand, and the majority leaves it unexplained, as to how allowing tenants some input in a rent increase decision in a government controlled moderate rental housing project will, somehow, discourage investors. Certainly there is no demonstrated need to shield the investor-developer from the tenant-consumer. Furthermore, although I am unable to draw a definitive inference from DOH\u2019s failure to join in this appeal, in my view, it is indicative of DOH\u2019s acceptance of the trial court\u2019s construction and application of \u00a7 8-79a-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">In sum, I do not believe that the construction of \u00a7 8-79a-15 given by the majority is warranted. The majority\u2019s construction of this regulation sanctions a moderate rental housing project developer\u2019s action of banking and stacking rent increases in the project application, thereby emasculating the tenants\u2019 right to a hearing and to notice under \u00a7 8-79a-15. I therefore dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-4\"> \u201cMr. Wendell C. Harp</p>\n<p id=\"Alb\">General Partner</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Renaissance Beechwood Gardens Management, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">74 Dwight Street</p>\n<p id=\"AMt\">New Haven, CT 06511</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Dear Mr. Harp:</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Re: Meeting at Department of Housing on February 18, 1987 and subsequent meeting at Beechwood Gardens on March 10, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">This letter contains important issues that must be addressed by the Management of Beechwood Gardens in order to assure conformity to State regulations and procedures. The Department appreciates meeting with you to address these issues. We feel that these meetings were very helpful and much was accomplished. However, we expressed our strong concern with regard to the management operations of this complex. The following is a reiteration of the discussions that took place during our meetings and our directives on the actions we want you to pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">Financial Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">No management financial statements had been completed as of February 18, 1987. However, subsequent to that date a staff member from our accounting section has met with your accountant and financial statements through December 31,1986 were received February 24, 1987. We expect that the financial statements for March 31,1987 will be submitted in a timely fashion. As we pointed out, these statements are critical to Department of Housing for review of the operation and financial status of your complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">Rents/Management Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b536-13\">It was determined during our post-occupancy review that the rental being charged to all new tenants and for those tenants occupying the 18 rehabilitated units was $465. You indicated during the meetings that it was your understanding that the $465 rental charge was approved during the development stage for all of the units. It was acknowledged that this rent charge was an issue to be determined after reviewing our files.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-14\">It has been determined through a review of our files that you had submitted a management plan for development and 2 project management plans for operations. One of the project management plans was for 64 units at $425 which would be used during the construction phase of the complex. The other project management plan for operations, which you submitted, was for 82 units at $465 which would be used at time of completion of the complex. Since it was your understanding that both these project management plans were approved, you implemented the rental charge of $465 as of April 1986. It was also determined during our March 10,1987 meeting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>that currently those tenants that have been residents of the complex all along are not being charged the $465 rent. In order to complete our files, we are enclosing a project management plan for 82 units, at a rental charge of $465. Until this time, this document had not been fully executed. This requires your local execution and should be returned to this Department for approval. This approval will be retroactive to April 1986. However, this rent of $465 cannot be charged to any current tenants until they receive thirty (30) days notice (no sooner than May 1,1987) of this rental change.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In order to submit a new management plan, due process must be performed by the management of the complex. That is, if you would like to propose a rental increase above the $465, you would have to execute the following procedures:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">(1) A 30 day written notice mailed to all tenants that a change in the rent schedule will be considered by the developer at its next meeting, (including the date and time of the meeting) and may result in a rent increase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">(2) Advise tenants that they can submit written comments to the developer within the 30 day period, and that they may review any documents supporting the proposed rent increase which will be on file at the office of the developer or management agent. Also, tenants may attend meeting and make comments at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">(3) At the end of the 30 day period, the developer shall submit within 15 days to the Department its recommended management plan plus all tenant comments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">(4) Within 15 days after receipt of the developer\u2019s recommendation, the Department will approve, disapprove or request modification of the rent increase or any portion thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-10\">(5) If the rent increase is approved by the Department, the developer must then give the tenants at least 30 days written notice prior to the effective date of the rent increase.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">Therefore, the management plan which you recently submitted could not be considered at this time. Once you have revised this management plan based upon the information in this letter and once you have followed the above procedure, please submit a new management plan for review and approval.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">You also requested whether you could have the fee waived until the final audit. Our regulations are clear that the management fee will begin at the time a Certificate of Occupancy is issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">Post-Occupancy Review (dated February 5, 1987)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-14\">During our meeting of 3-10-87 you indicated that a response was sent to DOH dated January 11, 1987. However, in reviewing this letter, it is our feeling that this letter is in response to one sent to you on 12-12-86 from Michael Duffy with regard to a proposed management plan and rental increase. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Although the post-occupancy review may have covered similar concerns, we ask that you respond directly to our post-occupancy review at your earliest convenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">We hope that the above will resolve any past or current concerns with regard to the management of Beechwood Gardens. We also hope that the management of Beechwood Gardens will be strengthened to prevent similar gaps in implementing state rules and regulations in the future. With continuous communications between Beechwood Gardens and this Department, a good working relationship may be established. If we can be of any further assistance, please contact this office at 566-3329.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Very truly yours,</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">[s] Michael T.

Additionally, you are required to execute a one year lease effective as of the August 1,1987 date. In accordance with the provisions of the lease you must provide evidence of income from your employer. Accordingly we request that you obtain a statement on your employer\u2019s letterhead stating your current annual income.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>It has been a pleasure having you as a Beechwood tenant and I look forward to your continued tenancy. I will contact you in the near future concerning a date for execution of your lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Sincerely,</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\"><em>Isl </em>Bruce Lebow</p>\n<p id=\"AVc\">Senior Property Manager\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
