The named plaintiff and seven other mothers of dependent children were receiving AFDC benefits and were residing in various motels in New Haven that had been made available to them as emergency housing because of their inability to find affordable housing. They brought this action seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>certification as a class, injunctive relief, a declaratory judgment, and attorney\u2019s fees in relation to the 100 day per calendar year limit on emergency housing that had been established by the department of income maintenance (DIM). After certifying the plaintiffs, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 88, as representatives of the class of all AFDC recipients receiving emergency housing benefits, the trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiffs enjoining the commissioner from enforcing the 100 day limit upon emergency housing benefits and declaring that the limit violated General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-85,17-82d and 17-38a (a) as well as various provisions of our federal and state constitutions. The court denied the claim for attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>204 Conn. 17, 526 A.2d 1318 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">In her appeal from the judgment, the commissioner claims that the trial court erred: (1) in failing to dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction because (a) the case was tried as a \u201chousing matter,\u201d as the complaint alleged, rather than as an ordinary civil action, (b) the defense of sovereign immunity was available and (c) the plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies; (2) in holding that the limitation of emergency housing benefits to 100 days violates \u00a7\u00a7 17-85,17-82d and 17-38a (a); (3) in declaring that this limitation violates the rights of the AFDC recipients and their children to family integrity and to education as those rights are protected by our federal and state constitutions; and (4) in issuing an injunction that (a) transgresses the principle of separation of powers and (b) conflicts with the requirements of federal law. We conclude that the court did not lack jurisdiction to entertain this action, but that its interpretation or application of the statutory and constitutional provisions relied upon was erroneous. As these determinations are dispositive of the appeal, we do not address the fourth claim of error. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Accordingly, we set aside the judgment and remand the case with direction to render judgment for the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">The subordinate facts are not disputed. In addition to the payments made to AFDC recipients for food, shelter and other necessities in the form of a basic grant equal to the \u201cstandard of need\u201d as determined pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-2, an emergency housing program has been established by the commissioner as a \u201cspecial needs\u201d program, under which payments are made to those who provide temporary housing to families who have lost their former homes and are unable to find housing they can afford in the marketplace. The maximum period for which these emergency housing payments would be made was 180 days until May, 1988, when it was reduced to 100 days. The emergency housing program itself, as well as the limitations on the period of its availability for a particular AFDC recipient, are the subject of DIM regulations and are not controlled by any specific statute. The money supporting the emergency housing program, like that used for payment of the AFDC basic grants, is provided under a \u201cmatching funds\u201d plan by the state and by the federal government, each paying approximately one half. Emergency housing benefits are given to all eligible applicants by DIM regardless of prior legislative appropriations. Even after the initial legislative appropriation has been exhausted, the payments for housing qualified AFDC recipients have continued to be made and the commissioner has retrospectively sought a deficiency appropriation from the legislature. In the July 1988 \u2014 1989 fiscal year the original six million dollar appropriation for the emergency housing program was increased through a deficiency appropriation by an additional six million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">As previously indicated, eight plaintiffs who represent the class and their children resided in various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>motels and similar facilities in the New Haven area to which they had been assigned by DIM after being displaced from their former homes. After each of these plaintiffs had been notified that the 100 day period for which emergency housing had been provided to them would terminate on April 11, 1989, they commenced this action on April 10, 1989, claiming that they had no reasonable alternative but to remain at the emergency housing locations where they were situated, because they had been unable to find permanent housing they could afford.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The trial court on April 14,1989, issued a temporary injunction prohibiting the commissioner from terminating the emergency housing benefit of any member of the plaintiff class. After the case had been fully tried, the court, declaring the 100 day limit on emergency housing invalid, enjoined the commissioner from enforcing that regulation and from removing the plaintiffs and putative members of the class from emergency housing, except to place them in permanent homes. The commissioner\u2019s application to stay the judgment was denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The commissioner has raised three grounds in support of her claim that the trial court lacked jurisidiction of this case and erred in denying her motion to dismiss: (1) the inappropriateness of treating this complex case as a \u201chousing matter\u201d to be heard by the judge assigned to hear such matters in New Haven; (2) the sovereign immunity of the state; and (3) the failure of the plaintiffs to exhaust administrative remedies. We find none of these grounds meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 47a-70 (a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides that \u201c[ajll proceedings involving a housing matter in the judicial district of . . . New Haven . . . shall first be placed on the housing docket for that district . . . . \u201d The commissioner, relying on this provision, maintains that the \u201chousing courts\u201d were established for the limited purpose of handling housing litigation exclusively, and that the issues raised in this case far exceed the scope of housing matters as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 47a-68.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Accordingly, she contends that the trial court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter of the complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Despite the familiar reference to the judicial district courtroom where the judge assigned to hear housing matters presides as the \u201chousing court,\u201d our statutes create no such special jurisdictional entity. \u201cHousing matters\u201d are included within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, just as family relations matters, small claims matters and juvenile matters are so included. General Statutes \u00a7 51-164s. The Superior Court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-164t and Practice Book \u00a7 2, has been divided into four divisions: family, civil criminal and housing. The family, civil and criminal divisions have been, subdivided into \u201cparts,\u201d but not the housing division. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, 5 and 5A. The evident purpose of the statutes and rules relating to the divisions of the Superior Court was not to impose any jurisdictional limitation on judges but to achieve greater efficiency in the administration of the judicial department. The Superior Court judges assigned to each division or part thereof are authorized by Practice Book \u00a7 212 to transfer cases to different court locations as well as between judicial district and geographical area courts. A judge assigned to the housing division at a particular judicial district is authorized by \u00a7 47a-70.(a), after a case has first been placed on the housing docket, to \u201ctransfer such matter to the regular docket for a geographical area or judicial district if he determines that such matter is not a housing matter or that such docket is more suitable for the disposition of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Even if it were clear that the complaint fails to allege circumstances constituting a housing matter as defined by \u00a7 47a-68, it is plain that such a deficiency did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction over the action. A judge of the Superior Court assigned to hear housing matters does not lose his general authority to hear any cause of action pending in that court. Since the plaintiffs\u2019 action was properly brought to the Superior Court, the trial judge, as a member of that court, did not lack jurisdiction to decide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The commissioner\u2019s claim that this case is not a housing matter is essentially an objection to venue rather than to jurisdiction, because it does not implicate the authority of the Superior Court to entertain the case but involves only the question of whether one division of that court rather than another should properly have heard the case. \u201cVenue is not a jurisdictional question but a procedural one.\u201d 77 Am. Jur. 2d, Venue \u00a7 1. Statutory venue requirements \u201csimply [confer] a privilege not to be required to attend court at a particular location. Id., \u00a7 45.\u201d <em>Farricielli </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>186 Conn. 198, 207, 440 A.2d 286 (1982) <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting). \u201cAccordingly it may be waived by the parties, unlike subject matter jurisdiction, which cannot be conferred by consent.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss did not question whether the complaint alleged a housing matter but was based upon sovereign immunity and failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The trial court, therefore, had no occasion to address the issue the commissioner has belatedly raised on appeal. We hold that, in failing to raise this issue by a seasonable motion to transfer, the commissioner must be deemed to have waived any such deficiency in the complaint and is barred from raising the question on appeal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Orsini, </em>187 Conn. 264, 269-71, 445 A.2d 887 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The commissioner claims that the complaint should have been dismissed because her actions that are the basis for the suit were performed in her official capacity, as the plaintiffs concede,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and she, therefore, may invoke the mantle of the state\u2019s sovereign immunity. A suit against a state officer concerning his official acts is, \u201cin effect, against the state,\u201d and sovereign immunity is available to bar a suit against the officer just as if the state itself were the defendant. <em>Sentner </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>184 Conn. 339, 342, 439 A.2d 1033 (1981); see <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>supra, 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">We have held, however, that \u201c[sovereign immunity does not bar suits against state officials acting in excess of their statutory authority\u201d; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>supra; or in violation of constitutional rights. <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 624, 376 A.2d 359 (1977). The complaint in this case alleged that the defendant had failed \u201cto meet her legal duty\u201d as prescribed by \u00a7\u00a7 17-85,17-82d and 17-38a (a) to provide for support of the plaintiffs and their children in homes suitable for their upbringing and in health and decency. It is also alleged that, by requiring these AFDC recipients to leave emergency housing before they are able to obtain permanent housing, the commissioner has violated their constitutional rights to family unity and to adequate education.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since the court, in deciding a motion to dismiss, \u201cmust consider the allegations of the complaint in their most favorable light\u201d; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Soffer, </em>183 Conn. 67, 68, 438 A.2d 1163 (1981); it is evident that the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>profess to claim breaches of the statutory obligations of the commissioner that have also resulted in violations of their constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The commissioner contends that the trial court erred by overlooking the distinction between acts of a state official that are in excess of statutory authority and those that constitute an erroneous exercise of that authority. Previous decisions of this court have carefully distinguished situations in which the official acted within the limitations of his authority from those in which official duty was transcended. <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>152 Conn. 586, 590, 210 A.2d 661 (1965). We have not applied this distinction, however, when the malfeasance or nonfeasance of a state officer is alleged to constitute a violation of a constitutional right. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>supra; <em>University of Connecticut Chapter AAUP </em>v. <em>Governor, </em>200 Conn. 386, 388, 512 A.2d 152 (1986); <em>Sentner </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>supra; <em>Rogan </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>178 Conn. 579, 583, 424 A.2d 274 (1979); <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>supra. The plaintiffs have plainly alleged that the commissioner has violated their constitutional rights by failing to perform her statutory duties. We need not, therefore, consider whether the breaches of duty relied upon constitute a wrongful exercise of authority rather than actions in excess of authority.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Finally, the commissioner maintains that the scope of the injunction issued as part of the judgment far exceeds the restrictions this court has placed on the relief to be granted to a successful plaintiff in an action against a state official. She claims that the relief should have been limited to a declaratory judgment, deferring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>any further remedy until such time as the legislature had an opportunity to review the court\u2019s interpretation of the statutes involved and either to accept the additional financial burden entailed or to amend the statutes. \u201cWe have excepted declaratory and injunctive relief from the sovereign immunity doctrine on the ground that a court may fashion these remedies in such a manner as to minimize disruption of government and to afford an opportunity for voluntary compliance with the judgment.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>supra, 32; <em>Sentner </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>supra, 344-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Whether the injunction granted in this case conforms to these principles or infringes upon powers constitutionally reserved to other government departments is extraneous to whether the court should have granted the commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground of sovereign immunity. In addition to injunctive relief, the complaint sought a declaratory judgment which was awarded and is not claimed to transgress the limitations we have imposed on remedies against the sovereign. Whether it would have been preferable after rendering the declaratory judgment to await a legislative response before acting upon the claims for equitable relief; see <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>supra, 650-53; the court plainly had jurisdiction to hear the case and render appropriate relief despite the claim of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">\u201c[W]hen an adequat\u00e9 administrative remedy is provided bylaw, it should be exhausted.\u201d <em>Connecticut Life &amp; Health Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>173 Conn. 352, 357, 377 A.2d 1099 (1977). The commissioner relies on this familiar principle as her final ground in support of her claim of lack of jurisdiction. She maintains that two administrative remedies were available to the plaintiffs: (1) a \u201cfair hearing\u201d under General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\u00a7 17-2a,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which any \u201caggrieved person\u201d may request; and (2) a petition for a declaratory ruling by DIM as to the validity of the regulation limiting emergency housing to 100 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The plaintiffs point out, however, that the DIM regulations concerning fair hearings require the dismissal or denial of a request for such a hearing when \u201cthe sole issue is one of state or federal law requiring automatic benefit adjustment for a class of recipients.\u201d Department of Income Maintenance Uniform Policy Manual \u00a7 1570.05 C. 4. The 100 day limit on emergency housing, the \u201csole issue\u201d in this case, is contained in an agency regulation and thus constitutes \u201cstate law.\u201d A valid regulation has the force of a statute. <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Darrow, </em>161 Conn. 169, 179, 286 A.2d 288 (1971). Since the regulation contains no exception for individual circumstances, it requires automatic adjustment of the benefits being received by AFDC recipients who have resided in emergency housing for more than 100 days. We agree with the plaintiffs that requests for a fair hearing pursuant to \u00a7 17-2a would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>have been futile in view of the DIM regulation that makes this remedy unavailable to a class of AFDC recipients challenging the validity of another departmental regulation intended to be applied uniformly to all such recipients.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">There is a firmer basis for the commissioner\u2019s contention that a petition for a declaratory ruling was an available administrative remedy. Section 4-176 (a)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act provides that \u201c[a]ny person may petition an agency ... for a declaratory ruling as to the validity of any regulation . . . . \u201d Section 4-175, <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as in effect prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>July 1,1989, provides that, after the agency has acted on a petition filed pursuant to \u00a7 4-176, \u201c[tjhe validity ... of a regulation . . . may be determined in an action for declaratory judgment brought in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain, if the regulation . , . or its threatened application, interferes with or impairs, or threatens to interfere with or impair, the legal rights or privileges of the plaintiff.\u201d A petition for a declaratory ruling would have permitted the plaintiffs to challenge the 100 day emergency housing limit as conflicting with our statutes. They could not have raised their constitutional claims of invalidity in such a petition, however, because the adjudication of such constitutional issues is reserved exclusively to the judiciary. <em>Cioffoletti </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>209 Conn. 544, 551, 552 A.2d 796 (1989); <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 15, Local 530, </em>208 Conn. 411, 416, 544 A.2d 186 (1988); <em>Stratford </em>v. <em>Local 134, IFPTE, </em>201 Conn. 577, 586, 519 A.2d 1 (1986); <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>191 Conn. 336, 344, 464 A.2d 785 (1983), aff'd, 472 U.S. 703, 105 S. Ct. 2914, 86 L. Ed. 2d 557 (1985). We have indicated that nonjudicial branches of government \u201cexceed their authority when they address the constitutional validity of a statute.\u201d <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 15, Local 530, </em>supra. Since a regulation commands the same obedience as a statute, the arbiter of its constitutionality must be of equal competence and authority. The constitutional claims of the plaintiffs are not directed to the application of the regulation to individual plaintiffs whose circumstances may create a special hardship, but to the class of plaintiffs as a whole, when the time for which the regulation makes emergency housing available has expired. Despite the commissioner\u2019s claim to the contrary, there is no basis for distinguishing the DIM regulation at issue from a statute that is constitutionally challenged in its general application and not merely in its application to individual circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Although a petition under \u00a7 4-176 challenging the validity of the regulation on statutory grounds might have been successful and obviated the need for a constitutional attack, the trial judge was faced with the reality that, when the case came before him, the eight plaintiffs who represent the class were subject to termination of their emergency housing benefits immediately and such relief as might be afforded by the administrative process would come too late to protect their interests, if the plaintiffs should ultimately prevail. The commissioner does not claim that such equitable relief as that granted by the court would have been available through her department. We have held that when \u201c[t]he relief sought and the issues raised are distinctly equitable in nature,\u201d administrative remedies were not adequate, even though some of the issues involved could have been resolved before an administrative agency. <em>Bianco </em>v. <em>Darien, </em>157 Conn. 548, 554, 254 A.2d 898 (1969). \u201cIn order that another remedy be adequate, it must be equally complete and completely practical.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Golembeske </em>v. <em>White, </em>168 Conn. 278, 283, 362 A.2d 1354 (1975). We agree with the trial court that the administrative route would not have provided the plaintiffs with a sufficiently expeditious remedy by which to resolve all the issues raised in challenging the regulation in time to afford the plaintiffs effective relief. The motion to dismiss on the ground of failure to exhaust administrative remedies was, therefore, properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The plaintiffs contend that our public assistance statutes require that children of AFDC recipients \u201cshall be supported in a home in this state, suitable for [their] upbringing\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 17-85 (a); and that these children shall receive aid sufficient to be supported \u201cin health and decency.\u201d General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>\u00a7 17-82d. The trial court essentially endorsed this view, concluding that \u00a7\u00a7 17-85 (a) and 17-82d \u201cforbid an arbitrary period of 100 days for those homeless,\u201d as the regulation provides. We disagree with this interpretation of these statutes and conclude that the regulation is not in conflict with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The trial court concluded that the commissioner could not promulgate a regulation that disregards \u201cthe legislature\u2019s mandate that support be adequate for the relative and dependent child to live in \u2018health and decency\u2019 in \u2018a home . . . which such relative maintains as his/her own.\u2019 \u201d The phrase \u201chealth and decency\u201d refers to \u00a7 17-82d (a),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which provides that the commissioner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>if the applicant is eligible, \u201cshall grant aid in such amount, <em>determined in accordance with levels of payments established by the commissioner, </em>as is needed in order to <em>enable </em>the applicant to support himself, or, in the case of aid to dependent children, to enable the relative to support such dependent child or children and himself, <em>in health and decency </em>. . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) This standard of support is applicable to all those seeking aid from DIM, not only to AFDC recipients, and is not specifically related to housing as compared to other necessities of life. Another statute, General Statutes \u00a7 17-12o,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> specifically addresses the need for shelter and provides for \u201ca special need payment of fifty dollars per month, for shelter costs, under the aid to families with dependent children program.\u201d Both \u00a7\u00a7 17-82d and 17-12o impose limits on the amount to be paid to an AFDC family under the programs established, \u00a7 17-82d restricting payments for any applicant to the \u201clevels of payments established by the commissioner\u201d and \u00a7 17-12o providing a monthly shel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>ter cost subsidy of only fifty dollars. Neither of these statutes is related to emergency housing or the duration of its availability.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The reference of the court to \u201ca home . . . which such relative maintains as his/her own\u201d concerns the following provision of \u00a7 17-85,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> upon which the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>principally rely: \u201cEach such dependent child shall be supported in a home in this state, suitable for his upbringing, which such relative maintains as his own.\u201d The court viewed this provision as a \u201cclear mandate,\u201d requiring DIM to provide emergency housing for the plaintiffs until they were placed in \u201cpermanent homes.\u201d The court concluded, therefore, that this provision overrides the restriction in \u00a7 17-82d limiting aid for an eligible applicant to the amount \u201cdetermined in accordance with levels of payments established by the commissioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">This interpretation of the provision of \u00a7 17-85 relied upon by the plaintiffs wholly ignores the context in which it is placed. Section 17-85 is entitled \u201cEligibility. Consideration of stepparent\u2019s incomes.\u201d The first, second, third and fifth sentences of subsection (a) set forth various conditions relating solely to the eligibility of AFDC recipients, and subsection (b) similarly establishes an additional eligibility criterion. Not only the statutory construction principle of noscitur a sociis,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> but also the improbability that the legislature, without any history of such intention, would have placed a provision of such overwhelming fiscal and social significance, if given the impact attributed by the trial court, in a statute purporting to relate only to AFDC eligibility, persuade us that the provision involved, the fourth sentence of subsection (a), must also have been intended as an eligibility condition. Its purpose is to require that, when AFDC payments are made to a relative for a dependent child, the relative must support the child in a suitable home maintained by the relative. Unless the relative applying for AFDC is willing and able to fulfill that condition, aid cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>be granted. This provision corresponds closely to a requirement of the definition of \u201cdependent child\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 17-82<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that such a child be living with a relative \u201cin a place of residence maintained by one or more of such relatives as his or their own home.\u201d The latter phrase is identical to one of the conditions established by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 606 (e) (1)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> in defining \u201cemergency assistance to needy families with children\u201d and appears as a condition of eligibility for AFDC recipients in the statutes of many states.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Even if we were to take the view expressed by the trial court that the provision of \u00a7 17-85 relied upon imposed some obligation on the part of the commissioner to arrange that \u201c[e]ach . . . dependent child shall be supported in a home in this state, suitable for his upbringing\u201d maintained by a relative, we would disagree with the further conclusion of the court that this provision is not subject to the limitation contained in \u00a7 17-82d (a) that the amount of aid to be granted be \u201cdetermined in accordance with levels of payments established by the commissioner.\u201d There is no reason to suppose that emergency housing, which is provided by payments directly to those who operate the motels and other facilities occupied by AFDC recipients, is not subject to the restrictions established by the commissioner on the amount of such aid to be furnished, the 100 day limitation. The commissioner is authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 17-2 (a)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> to determine the standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>of need for AFDC recipients annually, subject to the legislative directives contained in \u00a7 17-2 (b).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Because her determination cannot be implemented except through the appropriation process, it is ultimately the legislature that controls the amount of aid available. \u201cThere is no question that States have considerable latitude in allocating their AFDC resources, since each State is free to set its own standard of need . . . .\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>392 U.S. 309, 318, 88 S.

Ed. 2d 658 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The plaintiffs cite no state or federal statute requiring the commissioner to establish an emergency housing program or requiring her to provide such housing for a period greater than 100 days. They maintain, nevertheless, that, because DIM chose to create such a program as a special need and originally set 180 days as the maximum period, emergency housing must remain available for that time and even longer if a permanent home has not been found.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> They argue also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>that because emergency housing is provided as \u201cin kind assistance\u201d rather than in a fixed dollar amount, like the \u201cbasic needs\u201d payment made pursuant to \u00a7 17-82d, it is not subject to the restriction of that section that aid be granted only in accordance \u201cwith levels of payments established by the commissioner.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Both these contentions overlook General Statutes \u00a7 17-82g,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>provides that \u201c[t]he aid granted under this chapter [c. 302, entitled \u2018Public Assistance\u2019] shall be in the form of <em>money payments </em>and shall be made by the. commissioner <em>within available department of income maintenance appropriations, </em>directly to the applicant or other person entitled to receive the same . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) It is clear under this statute that <em>all </em>expenditures for the benefits or programs established by this \u201cPublic Assistance\u201d chapter, which include AFDC payments, are limited to the appropriations made for them by the legislature, whether these expenditures are made in the form of payments directly to those eligible for the benefit or to those who furnish such benefit, as in the case of emergency housing. The commissioner is given whatever authority might be necessary to conform to \u00a7 17-82g by decreasing the \u201clevel of certain assistance . . . programs when necessary to correct an inequity or to comply with state or federal law or regulation.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17-82n.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s reliance upon \u00a7 17-82d (a) and \u00a7 17-85 (a) was misplaced and that there is no statutory support for its decision.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In the declaratory judgment accompanying the injunction against enforcement of the 100 day limit on emergency housing, the trial court held that limitation to violate provisions of the third,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> ninth<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and fourteenth<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> amendments to our federal constitution and article eighth, \u00a7 l<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and \u00a7 4<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> of our state consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>tution. The court concluded that the federal constitutional provisions collectively created a constitutional right to family unity, which the 100 day limit threatened to disrupt, and that the state constitutional provisions established a fundamental right to public education, which would also be endangered if the plaintiffs were compelled to leave their present residences.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">At trial the plaintiffs presented testimony concerning the predicament they and their children would face if emergency housing assistance should be terminated after the 100 day limit had expired. The court found that \u201cmembers of this class have no social or familial network to fall back on when they face a financial crisis.\u201d Their AFDC grants pursuant to \u00a7 17-82d, which presumably reflect \u201call components of the standards of need,\u201d including housing costs; General Statutes \u00a7 17-2; were considered inadequate to provide decent private rental housing in the New Haven area. Although the court found that \u201cthere were more than enough vacant housing units in public housing projects in the New Haven area to house the entire group,\u201d for reasons that are unclear, these housing facilities were also deemed unavailable to the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Several plaintiffs testified that after being offered governmentally subsidized housing units, apparently pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-345<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>8-345a,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> they had found the units assigned to them already rented, uninhabitable or boarded up. Several expert witnesses testified concerning the detrimental effects that the lack of permanent housing had upon the interpersonal relationships among family members and the plight of children forced to change their residences frequently.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The commissioner presented testimony that the current policy of the department of human resources was \u201cto offer shelter to any family that needed it\u201d and that AFDC recipients who had remained in emergency housing for more than 100 days would be offered shelter facilities by that agency.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The court apparently credited this testimony, finding that the defendant had \u201cproposed to move some of the plaintiffs to shelters in Derby or Torrington.\u201d The plaintiffs also concede that they were offered shelter facilities in towns some distance away from New Haven. The court concluded, however, that to require the plaintiffs to move so far from New Haven would necessitate transfers of the children to other schools and that contacts with the facilities and agencies presently providing medical treatment, existing employment or job training would be interrupted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>and seriously risk the welfare of the plaintiffs and their children. The court also found that, because the shelter facilities offered were \u201ccommunal,\u201d with the family unit sharing many facilities with other families, they lacked privacy and \u201cthis enforced intimacy with strangers frequently produces stress, anxiety and friction between the occupants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u201cThe integrity of the family has found protection in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>[262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S.

All of the cases cited for this proposition, however, involve interference by the state in such private family matters as the custody and education of children or procreation. The financial circumstances of these plaintiffs, which are the root cause of their inability to obtain \u201cpermanent\u201d homes, have not been produced by any state action, an essential requirement for invocation of the due process clauses of both our federal and state constitutions. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>McRae, </em>448 U.S. 297, 316-17, 100 S.

They argue, nevertheless, that, because the commissioner \u201ctook one helpful action \u2014 providing emergency housing \u2014 and then another shattering one \u2014 revoking availability of such housing even if individuals had no alternative place to live,\u201d her policy amounts to one whose direct effect is to intrude on choices concerning family arrangements. The United States Supreme Court has declared, however, that \u201c[t]he prospective right to support payments, and the child\u2019s expectations with respect to the use of such funds, are clearly subject to modification by law, be it through judicial decree, state legislation, or congressional enactment.\u201d <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Gilliard, </em>483 U.S. 587, 607, 107 S. Ct. 3008, 97 L. Ed. 2d 485 (1987). The court has upheld actions of the state affecting family living arrangements by changes in support payments so long as they have a rational basis. Id. (federal AFDC statute requiring that a portion of the payments by a non-custodial parent for support of a child living with an AFDC family be treated as income to the family unit upheld); <em>Lyng </em>v. <em>Castillo, </em>477 U.S. 635, 106 S.

The plaintiffs in this case, unlike those in the cases cited above in which changes in laws relating to the distribution of welfare benefits also have serious effects upon the recipient families, have raised no equal protection of the laws claim. We do not perceive how the absence of such a claim, which does serve to differentiate this case from the cases cited, can be said to enhance the plaintiffs\u2019 claim to constitutional protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The trial court found that terminating emergency housing and offering as an alternative only group shelter housing distant from the New Haven area, where the children of these plaintiffs have been attending school, would violate their state constitutional right to education because of the harmful effect upon them of frequent school transfers. In <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>648-49, supra, this court construed article eighth, \u00a7 1 of our state constitution to create a fundamental right to elementary and secondary public school education, entitling pupils in those schools to the equal enjoyment of that right. The plaintiffs claim that the right recognized in <em>Horton </em>will be violated if they are forced to move from their present housing facilities to distant towns where their children would attend school for a few weeks or months only to change schools again when permanent homes are found for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">We do not believe that the burden imposed on the state by our decision in <em>Horton </em>to ensure approximate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>equality in the public educational opportunities offered to children throughout this state; id., 651-52; despite variations in funding by the towns, includes any guaranty that children are entitled to receive their education at any particular school or that the state must provide housing accommodations for them and their families close to the schools they are presently attending. The undoubted hardship imposed upon the children of these plaintiffs from the lack of affordable housing near the schools where they now are being educated cannot be disputed. It results, however, from the difficult financial circumstances they face, not from anything the state has done to deprive them of the right to equal educational opportunity. When the plaintiffs were displaced from their former homes, the commissioner was not obligated to provide emergency housing for them located near their former homes so that their children could continue to attend the same schools. The fact that such housing facilities have been made available for a limited period does not create any constitutionally protected right in the plaintiffs to continue to occupy their present residences indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">In this opinion Healey, Callahan, Covello, Hull and Santaniello, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-5\"> The plaintiffs have not appealed from this determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b278-8\"> The commissoner filed a motion for review of the denial of her application for a stay.

Because I disagree with the majority\u2019s determination that the trial court erred in its declaration that the regulation adopted by the Connecticut department of income maintenance (DIM) setting a 100 day per calendar year limit on emergency housing was contrary to General Statutes \u00a7 17-82d, and therefore unenforceable, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Pursuant to the program of Connecticut\u2019s Aid To Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), DIM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>makes cash payments for emergency housing to housing providers on behalf of recipient families. As noted by the majority, \u201c[i]n addition to the payments made to AFDC recipients for food, shelter and other necessities in the form of a basic grant equal to the \u2018standard of need\u2019 as determined pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-2, an emergency housing program has been established by the commissioner [of the department of income maintenance] as a \u2018special needs\u2019 program, under which payments are made to those who provide temporary housing to families that have lost their former homes and are unable to find housing they can afford in the marketplace. The maximum period for which these emergency housing payments would be made was 180 days until May, 1988, when it was reduced to 100 days.\u201d The majority states further that the \u201ceight plaintiffs who represent the class and their children resided in various motels and similar facilities in the New Haven area to which they had been assigned by DIM after being displaced from their former homes. After each of these plaintiffs had been notified that the 100 day period for which emergency housing had been provided to them would terminate on April 11, 1989, they commenced this action on April 10, 1989, claiming that they had no reasonable alternative but to remain at the emergency housing locations where they were situated, because they had been unable to find permanent housing they could afford.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">These poor people have come to the court seeking some type of relief. In construing \u00a7 17-82d (a) in a manner that effectively rejects their plea for help, the majority adopts the argument of DIM that the state is not responsible for the consequences of poverty. But neither is Connecticut callous to the consequences of poverty. The legislature has provided the statutory basis for help by mandating that DIM provide assistance \u201cas is needed\u201d under \u00a7 17-82d (a). In addition, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>legislature has honored DIM\u2019s requests for deficiency appropriations. Nonetheless, the majority returns these poor people back to the same emergency status that they were in when this action was commenced on April 10, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u201cA statute should be construed so that no word, phrase or clause will be rendered meaningless.\u201d <em>C. White &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rocky Hill, </em>181 Conn. 114, 122, 434 A.2d 949 (1980). \u201c[W]e must consider the statutory scheme as a whole, giving meaning to every section, and assuming no word or phrase to be superfluous.\u201d <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Tonken, </em>192 Conn. 581, 589, 473 A.2d 782 (1984). In adopting the argument of DIM that the commissioner shall grant aid in such amount, \u201cdetermined in accordance with levels of payments established by the commissioner,\u201d the majority reads this part of \u00a7 17-82d (a) as if it were disconnected from the remaining part of the sentence in the statute. The pertinent portion of the sentence in \u00a7 17-82d (a), concerning the discretionary level of aid to be granted to an applicant by the commissioner, provides that the commissioner \u201cshall grant aid only if he finds the applicant eligible therefor, in which case <em>he shall grant aid in such amount, </em>determined in accordance <em>with levels of payments established by the commissioner, as is needed in order </em>to enable the applicant to support himself, or, in the case of aid to dependent children, <em>to enable the relative to support such dependent child or children and himself, in health and decency </em>. . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) DIM determined that because of the plaintiffs\u2019 emergency housing requirement they were eligible for \u201cspecial needs\u201d assistance for housing. The majority does not challenge this determination. In fact, absent a determination of need over and above basic or \u201cstandard need,\u201d the plaintiffs would not be eligible for, nor awarded, \u201cspecial needs\u201d assistance. Given the fact that the plaintiffs have been awarded \u201cspecial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>needs\u201d assistance, a fair reading of the sentence in focus indicates that the commissioner\u2019s determination of the \u201clevel of payments\u201d must be established \u201cas is needed\u201d by the applicants. Thus, the commissioner\u2019s discretion in determining the level of payment to an applicant is controlled by what is needed to enable the applicant to support himself and his child or children in health and decency. In sum, the majority\u2019s narrow construction of this pertinent part of \u00a7 17-82d (a) disregards the \u201cas is needed\u201d phrase in the sentence in focus in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Furthermore, the trial court found that \u201c[a]t the time this matter was heard, there were 127 families in emergency housing in the New Haven area. Emergency housing costs $2000 for 30 days. For this sum, the landlord also provides the recipients counseling and support services. Ironically, at the same time many of these families were facing eviction and the alternatives of shelters, the street, or the generosity of relatives and friends, there were more than enough vacant housing projects in the New Haven area to house the entire group.\u201d The majority, after recognizing the trial court\u2019s ironic observation, concludes that \u201cfor reasons that are unclear, these housing facilities were also deemed unavailable to the plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">In setting aside the judgment of the trial court, the majority does not suggest or indicate what is to happen to the eight plaintiffs and their children or the 127 families in emergency housing in the New Haven area at the time of the hearing. Certainly, having the plaintiffs live in \u201cmotels\u201d and other \u201csimilar facilities\u201d at $2000 per month, or put out on New Haven streets is not the solution to their problem. The same emergency housing \u201cspecial need\u201d exists today, just as acutely as it existed when the trial judge issued the temporary and permanent injunctions. As the majority recognizes, \u201cthe trial judge was faced with the reality that, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>the case came before him, the eight plaintiffs who represent the class were subject to termination of their emergency housing benefits immediately. ...\u201d Although the legislature has responded favorably to DIM\u2019s requests for deficiency appropriations, nonetheless, that part of the deficiency appropriation resulting from the payments of $2000 per month for emergency housing for motels and other similar facilities and counseling is logically inconsistent with the trial court\u2019s finding that, at the time of the hearing, there were more than enough vacant housing units in public housing projects in the New Haven area to \u201chouse the entire group.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Therefore, although I would uphold the trial court\u2019s determination that the DIM regulation setting a 100 day per calendar year limit on emergency housing is contrary to \u00a7 17-82d, and therefore unenforceable, nonetheless, because I believe that the trial court\u2019s order is too broad, I would return this case to the trial court for consideration of its finding that there was enough public housing in the New Haven area \u201cto house the entire group.\u201d The trial court\u2019s order maintains the status quo without direction for some immediate, permanent relief based on the court\u2019s finding of available public housing in the New Haven area. Additionally, since DIM argues that under General Statutes \u00a7 8-345a the commissioner of the department of housing is authorized to administer a program of rental assistance to recipients of assistance, and the department of human resources under General Statutes \u00a7 17-31v is authorized to provide grants and to advance security deposits on behalf of recipients of AFDC who reside in emergency housing in order to assist their relocation to permanent housing, the trial court should be directed to order these state agencies to be brought into the case to assist DIM in locating and funding permanent housing for \u201cthe entire group\u201d in the New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Haven area. There is no reason to assume that administrative relief would not be afforded to other members of the plaintiffs\u2019 class needing relief from emergency housing, and, therefore, there would be no need to resort to the court for assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Because I believe that the judgment of the trial court was correct except in regard to its broad order of relief, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
