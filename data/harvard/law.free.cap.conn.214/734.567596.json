Subsequently, Smith, the plaintiff in the first case, applied to the Superior Court to vacate, modify or correct the award. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4). Hartford Casualty, the plaintiff in the second case, applied to the Superior Court to confirm the award. The trial court denied Smith\u2019s application and confirmed the award of the arbitration panel. Smith thereafter took an appeal to the Appellate Court which this court transferred to itself, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>According to the stipulation of facts, on March 22, 1986, Smith was a passenger in an automobile owned and operated by Eric S. Harrington when it was involved in a one car accident. She suffered severe injuries. Damages attributable to Smith\u2019s injuries could exceed $260,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Eric Harrington was insured by Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (Nationwide). Pursuant to its policy, Nationwide paid Smith $30,000 on behalf of its insured.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Eric Harrington\u2019s policy did not fully compensate her, she also pursued a claim under a policy issued by Hartford Casualty to Robert Harrington, the father of Eric Harrington. The policy issued by Hartford Casualty provided coverage, for two cars owned by Robert Harrington, neither of which was the automobile involved in the accident in question. As to each of Robert Harrington\u2019s automobiles, the policy provided $100,000 of underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">On appeal, Smith claims she is entitled to recover underinsured motorist benefits under Hartford Casualty\u2019s policy issued to Robert Harrington. Her argument is based upon the premise that once a policy provides liability coverage to an insured, the underinsured motorist coverage therein is coextensive with the liability coverage. In support of her argument, Smith cites the liability coverage section of Hartford Casualty\u2019s policy which provides that \u201c[w]e will pay damages for bodily injury or property damage for which any covered person becomes legally responsible because of an auto accident.\u201d The policy defines \u201ccovered person\u201d as \u201cyou or any family member for the ownership, maintenance or use of any auto or trailer.\u201d Smith contends that Eric Harrington, as a family member, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>a \u201ccovered\u201d person under the terms of Robert Harrington\u2019s policy, who became legally responsible for her injuries because of an automobile accident while driving \u201cany auto.\u201d Because Robert Harrington\u2019s policy provides liability coverage to Eric Harrington while using \u201cany auto,\u201d Smith argues that the policy must also provide underinsured benefits to her as an occupant of that vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Smith\u2019s analysis, however, crumbles at its foundation because Eric Harrington was not a \u201ccovered\u201d person under the liability portion of Robert Harrington\u2019s policy in these circumstances. That policy explicitly excludes from coverage \u201cany vehicle other than your covered auto which is owned by any family member.\u201d Thus, it did not provide liability coverage to Eric Harrington while he was driving his own vehicle, a vehicle not covered by the policy. Apparently recognizing this limitation, Smith cites our decision in <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>188 Conn. 245, 248, 449 A.2d 157 (1982), to argue that uninsured motorist coverage attaches to the insured person and therefore \u201can insured party may receive the benefits of a policy even though not occupying a vehicle insured under the policy.\u201d Thus, Smith asks this court to invalidate the policy\u2019s exclusion \u201cin the context of uninsured/ underinsured motorist coverage.\u201d This approach, she claims, would further the public policy embodied in General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c and \u00a7 38-175a-6 (a) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are unpersuaded by her arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>\u201cSection 38-175c (a) (1) requires insurance, designated as \u2018uninsured motorist coverage,\u2019 for protection against operators of uninsured and underinsured motor vehicles . . . .\u201d <em>American Motorist Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>213 Conn. 625, 628, 569 A.2d 1105 (1990). Section 38-175c (a) (1) states: \u201cEvery policy shall provide insurance, herein called uninsured motorist coverage . . . for the protection of persons insured thereunder . . . . \u201d In <em>Harvey v. Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>we held that the public policy embodied in \u00a7 38-175c directs that <em>uninsured motorist coverage </em>is \u201cperson oriented\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>therefore must be provided to insureds while they are occupants of insured vehicles or uninsured vehicles. <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>supra, 248. \u201cThe coverage attaches to the insured person, not the insured vehicle.\u201d Id. In <em>Harvey, </em>we ruled that the plaintiff, <em>an insured under his mother\u2019s policy, </em>was entitled to coverage under <em>that policy, </em>even though he was injured while occupying a vehicle owned by his father which was not insured. We concluded that the exclusion in the policy, which purported to disclaim liability because the plaintiff was injured while occupying an uninsured vehicle, was invalid as against the public policy underlying uninsured motorist coverage in Connecticut. Id., 246, 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Unlike <em>Harvey, </em>however, Smith is not an insured under the defendant\u2019s policy. The portion of the policy defining uninsured motorist coverage provides: \u201cWe will pay damages which a covered person is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury: 1. Sustained by a covered person; and 2. Caused by an accident.\u201d Thus, in order for Smith to recover under the terms of the policy, she must satisfy both conditions. The policy defines \u201ccovered person\u201d in this part as: \u201c1. You or any family member; 2. Any other person occupying your covered auto; 3. Any person for damages that person is entitled to recover because of bodily injury to which this coverage applies sustained by a person described in 1. or 2. above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">There is no dispute that the \u201cyou\u201d in the first definition refers to Robert Harrington. Furthermore, Smith obviously is not a Harrington family member and therefore is not a \u201ccovered\u201d person under the first definition. Similarly, when Smith was injured, she was not occupying a covered auto, i.e., one of the two automobiles described in the policy, and therefore does not fall within the second definition. Since she does not fall within either the first or second definitions, she automatically does not fall within the third.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Smith claims that these provisions are invalid because they \u201care attempted exclusions based upon the claimant\u2019s occupancy of a particular vehicle or upon the naming of a particular vehicle in the policy.\u201d We disagree. These provisions are not exclusions from coverage but rather simply definitions of who is an \u201cinsured\u201d and a \u201ccovered person\u201d under the terms of the policy. \u201c Tn an insurance policy, an exclusion is a provision which eliminates coverage where, were it not for the exclusion, coverage would have existed.\u2019 <em>Kansas-Nebraska Natural Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Hawkeye-Security Ins. Co., </em>195 Neb. 658, 664, 240 N.W.2d 28 (1976) [Citations omitted.] .... \u2018It is apparent, then, that before the need for an exclusion arises, there must first be coverage within the defined scope of the policy.\u2019 <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>Boston Old Colony Ins. Co., </em>67 App. Div. 2d 757, 758, 412 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>N.Y.S.2d 465 (1979).\u201d <em>Hammer </em>v. <em>Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co., </em>214 Conn. 573, 588-89, 573 A.2d 699 (1990). Whether Smith is entitled to collect, pursuant to the uninsured motorist coverage provision of Hartford Casualty\u2019s policy, is a question of coverage, not exclusion. See <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>203 Conn. 258, 264, 524 A.2d 616 (1987); <em>Security Ins. Co. of Hartford </em>v. <em>DeLaurentis, </em>202 Conn. 178, 188, 520 A.2d 202 (1987). Because Smith is not \u201ccovered\u201d under the terms of the policy, the trial court properly denied her claim for underinsured motorist benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-9\"> The trial court concluded that because Celestine Smith failed to present either oral argument or a brief to support her claims against Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (Nationwide), that portion of the claim was deemed abandoned. Nevertheless, on October 3,1989, the trial court granted Smith\u2019s motion to join and consolidate the appeals in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company </em>and <em>Hartford Casualty Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Smith. </em>Again, Smith has failed to brief any issue pertaining to Nationwide, therefore we will consider that appeal abandoned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b754-8\"> Smith also received $20,000 from Prudential Insurance, pursuant to the underinsured motorist coverage provided by a policy on a car owned by her mother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b755-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 38-175c. uninsured motorist coverage.
