The instruction, therefore, as applied to the evidence, was misleading and erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The judgment must be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial to be had, not inconsistent with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
