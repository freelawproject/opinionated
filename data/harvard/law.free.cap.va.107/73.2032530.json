Contracts by <em>Correspondence\u2014Accession to Same </em>Terms.-\u2014In order to establish a contract by correspondence, there must appear upon the face of the correspondence a clear accession by both parties to one and the same set of terms. A proposal to accept, or an acceptance &lt;ra terms varying from the offer, is a rejection of the offer. The acceptance must be unqualified, and no point left open for future consideration or negotiation between the parties. In the case at bar) the acceptor of the offer introduced into his acceptance new terms not contained in the offer, nor implied by law, and hence no contract was concluded between the parties.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-7\">Error to a judgment of the Hustings Court of the city of Petersburg in an action of <em>assumpsit. </em>Judgment for the defendant.

Taylor, Pres. &amp; Treas.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">After some further. correspondence between the parties the plaintiff in error instituted this action to recover damages for the breach of the agreement which it was alleged the correspondence between the parties established.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Upon the trial of the cause the plaintiffs introduced the correspondence quoted and some other evidence as to the dealings between the parties and the usages of the trade. The defendant introduced no testimony, but demurred to the plaintiff\u2019s evidence. Upon that demurrer the trial court was of opinion that the law was for the defendant and gave judgment accordingly.' To that judgment this writ of error was awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The only question involved'in the case is whether or not the correspondence quoted established a contract between the parties for the sale and purchase of fifty thousand pounds of yam.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">The evidence introduced showed the circumstances surrounding the parties when the correspondence took place. They had been dealing with each other during a part of the year 1904 and the early part of the year 1905. During that time the plaintiffs had purchased from the defendant thirty or thirty-five thousand pounds of yarn in eight or nine different orders of the same .numbers, but no one of the orders had exceeded ten thousand pounds, and the yarn had been furnished in such quantities and at such times as the parties had expressly or impliedly agreed upon or assented to.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>It was held by this court iu the case of <em>Virginia Hot Springs Co. </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>93 Va. 569, 25 S. E. 888, that in order to. establish a contract by correspondence there must appear upon the face of the correspondence a clear accession by both parties, to one and the same set of terms. A proposal to acept or an acceptance on terms varying from the offer is a rejection of the offer. The acceptance must be unqualified and no point, left open for future consideration or negotiation between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Tested by this rule it is clear that the correspondence in this case does not establish a contract. In the defendant\u2019s letter of July 3, the quantity of yarn proposed to be sold is not fixed, nor the time for its delivery. But if it be conceded, as the plaintiff\u2019s counsel argues, that the' law would imply that the delivery was to be within a reasonable time and that since the defendant had not fixed the quantity of yarn which it was willing to sell upon the terms named, the law gave the plaintiffs the right in accepting the offer to fix the quantity at any reasonable quantity, and that fifty thousand pounds was not unreasonable, the plaintiff\u2019s telegram and letter of July 3 are not an\u2019unconditional aceptance of the defendant\u2019s offer. In their letter the plaintiffs tell the defendant they wish him to deliver 1300 lbs. of No. 14 and 800 lbs. of No. 12 per week, commencing in two or three weeks from date and such delivery to continue for ten weeks; that they will furnish the defendant with the proportions for balance of yarn not less than four weeks ahead of time for delivery; and that if it needed definite instructions for balance of order sooner than this to let them know and they would furnish them.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">There was nothing in the defendant\u2019s offer which required it to furnish more pounds of yarn of one number than of the other, nor to commence the delivery in two or three weeks and continue it for ten weeks, and then to await the plaintiff\u2019s pleasure as to the time and the proportions in which the residue of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>yarn was to be furnished. These were new terms which the plaintiffs had introduced into their acceptance not contained in the defendant\u2019s offer nor implied by law. The plaintiffs seem at that time to have recognized this for they ask the defendant to send acceptance of contract by return mail, which would have been wholly unnecessary if their acceptance had been an unconditional acceptance of the defendant\u2019s offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\u25a0 We are of opinion that there is no error in the judgment complained of, and that it must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
