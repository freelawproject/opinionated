Citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), Lewis contends that the district court erred in sentencing him under a mandatory Sentencing Guidelines scheme. He also has filed a motion to remand for resentencing, relying on <em>United States v. Booker</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which the government does not oppose. Lewis does not challenge his conviction on appeal. We affirm Lewis\u2019 conviction, grant the motion to remand, vacate the sentence, and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">Lewis asserts that he should be resentenced in light of <em>Booker </em>because the district court sentenced him under the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines scheme. In <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208 (4th Cir.2005), we held that treating the Guidelines as mandatory constitutes error under <em>Booker. See id. </em>at 216-17. Because Lewis preserved this error for our review, we must reverse unless the government demonstrates that the error is harmless. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) (\u201c[A]ny error ... that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.\u201d); <em>White, </em>405 F.3d at 223 (discussing difference in burden of proving that error affected substantial rights under harmless error standard in Rule 52(a) and plain error standard in Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b)). Our review of the record as a whole leads us to conclude that the government has not met its burden of demonstrating that the error in sentencing Lewis under a mandatory Sentencing Guidelines scheme did not affect his substantial rights. <em>See White, </em>405 F.3d at 223. Thus, the error is not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">Accordingly, we grant Lewis\u2019 motion to remand, vacate the sentence, and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We also affirm Lewis\u2019 conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-11\">. Just as we noted in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 545 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005), \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Lewis' sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b233-12\">. Although the Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \"consult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court). On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), and then impose a sentence. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005). <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The sentence must be \"within the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\" <em>Id. </em>at 547.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
