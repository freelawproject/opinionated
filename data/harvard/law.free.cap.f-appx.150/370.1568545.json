This Court affirmed Wang\u2019s judgment of conviction. <em>United States v. Wang, </em>89 Fed.Appx. 470 (5th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court vacated this court\u2019s judgment and remanded the case for fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>ther consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Wang v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1614, 161 L.Ed.2d 274 (2005). We requested and received supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621, and <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court emphasized that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. Wang argued that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights as outlined in <em>Booker </em>by enhancing his sentence based on an additional quantity of MDMA that was not alleged in the indictment, but attributed to his relevant conduct. Wang did not concede liability for that additional quantity of MDMA in his guilty plea. More importantly, Wang objected to the second addendum to the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) on the ground that \u201cthe relevant conduct alleged therein must be proven by clear and convincing evidence\u201d because inclusion of that relevant conduct would have an \u201cextremely disproportionate effect\u201d upon his sentence. In response, the Probation Officer asserted that a defendant must show factual findings in the PSR implausible in light of the record as a whole. Using the preponderance of the evidence standard, the district court specifically found that Wang was responsible for the additional amount of MDMA, which increased his total offense level from 26 to 30. Wang challenges this offense level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Ultimately, this case turns on whether Wang properly preserved his <em>Booker </em>argument in the district court. If the error was not preserved, we review the appellant\u2019s sentence for plain error. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511. If the error was preserved, we review his sentence for harmless error. <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 n. 9 (\u201c... if either the Sixth Amendment issue presented in <em>Booker </em>or the issue presented in <em>Fanfan </em>is preserved in the district court by an objection, we will ordinarily vacate the sentence and remand, unless we can say the error is harmless under Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1778, 123 L.Ed.2d 508(1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">\n<em>Preservation of Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">Wang contends that his objection regarding the applicable standard upon which to apply the guideline enhancements was sufficient to preserve error. The Government, on the other hand, argues that error was not preserved because defendants routinely argue for a higher standard of proof without also making a case for a jury-determination beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">Wang did not, however, fail to preserve his <em>Booker </em>challenge to the district court\u2019s enhancement of his sentence. An objection preserves error if it \u201cwas specific enough to allow the trial court to take testimony, receive argument, or otherwise explore the issue raised.\u201d <em>United States v. Burton, </em>126 F.3d 666, 673 (5th Cir.1997). The major rationale behind requiring litigants to make timely objections in an effort to avoid forfeiture of rights is \u201cfounded upon considerations of fairness to the court and to the parties and of the public interest in bringing litigation to an end after fair opportunity has been afforded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>present all issues of law and fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Ocana, </em>204 F.3d 585, 589 (5th Cir.2000)(quoting <em>United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162 (5th Cir.1994)). Hence, to preserve error, the objection must be sufficiently specific to alert the district court as to the nature of the objection and allow the court to correct the perceived error at that level. <em>See Ocana, </em>204 F.3d at 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Wang\u2019s objection that the relevant conduct alleged by the Probation Officer must be proven by clear and convincing evidence, rather than the preponderance of the evidence, was tantamount to stating that the district court\u2019s standard violated his Sixth Amendment rights. Thus, his objection was sufficient to preserve error. Wang\u2019s written objection not only notified the court of his disagreement with the proposed standard, but also gave the district court the opportunity to address the appropriateness of the standard. Furthermore, the objection elicited a response in opposition from the Probation Officer. Finally, the district court specifically applied the preponderance of the evidence standard. Wang\u2019s objections thus adequately apprised the district court that he was raising a Sixth Amendment objection to the appropriateness of the proposed standard for guideline enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\n<em>Harmless Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">There is no question that the district court committed Sixth Amendment <em>Booker </em>error by enhancing Wang\u2019s sentence pursuant to its finding that he was responsible for a greater quantity of drugs than that which was alleged in his indictment or conceded in his guilty plea. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 738. Because we hold that Wang preserved his <em>Booker </em>challenge to the district court\u2019s enhancement of his sentence, we review his sentence for harmless error. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1778, 123 L.Ed.2d 508. <em>See also Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Harmless error is \u201c[a]ny defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect [the] substantial rights\u201d of the defendant. Fed. R. Crim.P. 52(a). An error afflicts the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and thus is prejudicial, \u201cif it affects the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 285 (5th Cir.2005)(citing <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508(1993)). Hence, to show harmlessness, the government bears the burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the federal constitutional error of which a defendant complains did not contribute to the sentence that he received. <em>United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">The government cannot meet this arduous burden here. It can point to no record evidence that would prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would not have sentenced Wang differently had it acted under an advisory Guidelines regime. There is no indication from the record as to what sentence the district court would have imposed if the Federal Sentencing Guidelines were advisory rather than mandatory. Therefore, based on the record before us, we cannot conclude that the mandatory nature of the Guidelines at the time of Wang\u2019s sentence did not contribute to the sentence that he received. Accordingly, we VACATE Wang\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b393-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
