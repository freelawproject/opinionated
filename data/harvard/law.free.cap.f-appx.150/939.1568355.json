Pri- or to leaving China, he lived with his girlfriend, whom he identified in his application and testimony as \u201cLiu Yen Shin,\u201d but who was identified as \u201cYanqing Liu\u201d on a document evidencing an abortion and on a statement apparently made by You\u2019s girlfriend.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He stated that he wanted to marry Shin, but was not allowed to because he was below the legal age under Chinese law. He claimed that he was entitled to asylum because he feared persecution on the basis that Shin became pregnant by him and underwent a forced abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-17\">You argues that although he was not married to Shin, he should be granted asylum because the only reason they were not married was because of China\u2019s age restrictions on marriage, which \u201care part of a coercive family planning policy that Congress has condemned.\u201d He argues that, as the male partner of a woman forced to undergo an abortion, he is entitled to asylum as though he were a spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-18\">To the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-19\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). Asylum may be granted if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cTo establish asylum eligibility based on ... [a protected ground], the alien must, with credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of [a protected ground], or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u2019 that [the protected ground] will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-20\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b963-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>To be eligible for asylum, an applicant must show that he is \u201cunable or unwilling\u201d to return to his country of origin \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). A person who has undergone a forced abortion, been persecuted for refusal to undergo such a procedure, or otherwise resisted a coercive population control program, is deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B). Further, \u201ca person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because You is male, these first two provisions are inapplicable to his situation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">You also cannot be entitled to asylum as Shin\u2019s spouse because, as he acknowledged, they were never married. Recently in <em>Yang v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1204 n. 6 (11th Cir.2005), we stated that \u201c[t]he BIA only extends refugee protection to an applicant whose <em>spouse </em>suffered forced sterilization or abortion.\u201d <em>Yang </em>at 1204 n. 6 (citing <em>In re C-Y-Z, </em>21 L &amp; N Dec. 915, 918 (BIA 1997) (emphasis in original)). Accordingly, we conclude that the BIA did not err in finding that You was ineligible for asylum as Shin\u2019s spouse. Moreover, we have considered this record and find that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that You\u2019s testimony was not credible and its finding that he was not entitled to asylum or withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b962-15\">.
