He contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction; that the district court erred by dismissing two venire members for cause; that his previous state-court conviction of retaliation did not constitute a crime of violence as defined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2; and that his sentence violated <em>United States v. Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-22\">We will affirm the jury\u2019s verdict so long as there is evidence sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find Lewis guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury could have inferred from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that Lewis knowingly possessed ammunition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Police testimony indicated that Lewis was the sole occupant of the residence in which the ammunition was found, and that the ammunition was found in plain view. Testimony also established that the ammunition was manufactured in Arkansas and that it had to have traveled across state lines to be possessed in Texas.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>The district court did not abuse its discretion by striking two venirepersons for cause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Those venirepersons\u2019 answers during voir dire indicated that they would not be able to put their personal beliefs aside and base their decisions on the evidence presented in the case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Lewis\u2019s contentions regarding the validity of his conviction are unavailing. The conviction therefore is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The Texas offense of retaliation is not a crime of violence for purposes of the Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The issue was raised for the first time on appeal, and the adjustment for the previous commission of a crime of violence constituted plain error that affected Lewis\u2019s substantial rights and that undermined the fairness of his sentencing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Lewis\u2019s sentence therefore is VACATED and REMANDED for resentencing. Because the district court plainly erred regarding the adjustment for previous commission of a crime of violence, we do not address Lewis\u2019s <em>Booker </em>contention.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
