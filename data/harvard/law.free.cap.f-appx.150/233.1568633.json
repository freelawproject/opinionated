We affirm Querubin\u2019s convictions, but we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-19\">Querub\u00edn claims the district court erred when it denied his motion to suppress his statements to the police because police officers violated his right to remain silent under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). This court reviews the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying a motion to suppress for clear error and the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). A defendant may waive his constitutional rights to remain silent and to have counsel present if he does so \u201cvoluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-20\">Querub\u00edn claims he could not understand the <em>Miranda </em>warnings because he is not fluent in English. While the limited ability to understand English may render a waiver of rights defective, a lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>guage barrier mil not necessarily frustrate an effective waiver. <em>See United States v. Guay, </em>108 F.3d 545, 549 (4th Cir.1997). The police officers read Querub\u00edn his rights in English and he responded in English that he understood those rights. The district court listened to a tape recording of the interview and noted that Querub\u00edn answered the questions in English with detail. The language barrier did not frustrate an effective waiver of Querubin\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights and the district court did not err when it denied his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Querub\u00edn claims that the district court erred when it denied his motion in limine to exclude witness testimony about Querubin\u2019s prior drug possession. The decision to admit evidence is reviewed on appeal for an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion; the relevant inquiry therefore is whether the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion was \u201carbitrary or irrational.\u201d <em>See United States v. Ellis, </em>121 F.3d 908, 926 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The witnesses testified about events during the year prior to Querubin\u2019s arrest, but did not testify about the events charged in the indictment. The witness testimony provided context and was probative of Querubin\u2019s methamphetamine activities. \u201cWhile [Fed.R.Evid.] Rule 404(b) forecloses admission of similar acts evidence simply to prove a defendant\u2019s bad character, it permits such evidence where necessary to provide the context or <em>res gestae </em>of the charged offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Brewer, </em>1 F.3d 1430, 1436 (4th Cir.1993). The testimony was relevant to show Querubin\u2019s intent to distribute the methamphetamine, the events testified about occurred only a few months prior to his arrest, the testimony was reliable because it was similar in many respects to Querubin\u2019s statement to the police, and it was not unfairly prejudicial to Querub\u00edn. <em>See United States v. Queen, </em>132 F.3d 991, 994-95 (4th Cir.1997). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Querubin\u2019s motion in limine and admitting into evidence the witnesses\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Querub\u00edn next claims that the district court erred at sentencing when it denied him a two-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Querub\u00edn did not plead guilty; instead, he went to trial. The adjustment for acceptance of responsibility \u201cis not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.2) (2003). A defendant may go to trial and still receive an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, but such circumstances are rare and only warranted if the defendant went to trial \u201cto assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court did not clearly err when it found that Querub\u00edn did not qualify for an acceptance of responsibility adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Querub\u00edn claims the district court erred by not granting him a downward departure from his sentencing guideline range. A sentencing court\u2019s decision not to depart downward is not renewable on appeal unless the district court\u2019s decision resulted from a mistaken belief that it lacked the legal authority to depart. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>313 F.3d 219, 222 (4th Cir.2002). The record discloses that the district court was aware of its authority to depart and exercised its discretion in deciding not to depart. Therefore, this claim is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">Querub\u00edn claims the district court erred in calculating his criminal history category because the district court assigned him criminal history points for the commission of the crime while on probation for a prior offense pursuant to USSG <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 4A1.1(d), 4A1.2. He claims this enhancement violated <em>Booker </em>because the district court\u2019s finding that he committed the offense while on probation was a fact not found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence.\u201d <em>See also United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349 (4th Cir.2005) (noting that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was not overruled by <em>Booker). </em>In <em>United States v. Washington, </em>404 F.3d 834, 842-43 (4th Cir. 2005), this court, applying <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), held that relying on facts outside the indictment in order to conclude a prior conviction for burglary was a crime of violence that enhanced the defendant\u2019s offense level was plain error warranting correction. Querubin\u2019s case is distinguishable from the facts in <em>Washington </em>because the district court\u2019s assessment of criminal history points in this case only required that the district court determine when Querub\u00edn committed the offenses relative to the date of the instant offense and how long his probation lasted. The district court\u2019s assessment of criminal history points because Querub\u00edn was under a criminal justice sentence when he committed the charged offenses was not improper. <em>See Shepard, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Querub\u00edn finally claims that the district court improperly sentenced him when it attributed a drug quantity to him greater than that found by the jury. Querub\u00edn preserved this issue for appeal by raising it in the district court. In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that the mandatory manner in which the federal sentencing guidelines required courts to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the judge by a preponderance of the evidence violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 746, 750. Here, the district court\u2019s use of 993.6 grams of methamphetamine and 28.1 grams of marijuana went beyond the jury\u2019s verdict because the jury found Querub\u00edn responsible for only 73.91 grams of methamphetamine. In light of <em>Booker, </em>we vacate Querubin\u2019s sentence and remand the case for resentencing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Although the sentencing guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005) (applying <em>Booker </em>on plain error review). The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">We affirm Querubin\u2019s convictions. In light of <em>Booker, </em>we vacate Querubin\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b258-8\"> Just as we noted in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 545 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005), \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Querubin\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
