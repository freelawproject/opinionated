Green was sentenced to thirty-six months of imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">Green, representing himself on appeal as he did below, raises several challenges to his conviction. Because these arguments are baseless,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> we deny Green\u2019s motion for transcript at government expense and affirm Green\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b239-13\"> Green argues: (1) that he removed any \"presumption of power of attorney that the United States government\u201d had on him; (2) that he declared that he is of the Washitaw Muurs nationality, rather than a U.S. citizen; (3) that he revoked all signatures and powers of attorney of previously filed W-4 forms and state and local tax forms; (4) that he emancipated himself from his government-issued birth certificate in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code; and (5) that the government's use of his name violates a copyright as the name is a trade name under the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
