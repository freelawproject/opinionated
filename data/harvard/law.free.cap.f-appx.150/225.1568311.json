On appeal, Salmons argues that his six-month sentence is unreasonable in light of the factors set out in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), and that the mitigating factors surrounding his employment status warrant modification of the terms and conditions of supervised release. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">We review a district court\u2019s judgment revoking supervised release and imposing a term of imprisonment for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). In exercising this discretion, the district court must consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005). Our review of the record convinces us the district court fully considered Salmons\u2019s history and characteristics and did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
