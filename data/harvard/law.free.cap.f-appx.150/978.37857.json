Greenfield appeals. In January 2003, BFP Investments Limited (\u201cBFP Limited\u201d) filed a petition for reorganization under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. On August 5, 2003, a bankruptcy judge entered an order confirming BFP Limited\u2019s second amended plan of reorganization. On August 4, 2004, Greenfield filed a \u201ccomplaint\u201d in the district court pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) against BFP Limited, Susan Lasky, Jeffrey Gambino, and Barry Fernandez. The defendants moved to dismiss the \u201ccomplaint,\u201d alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that it was untimely. On November 9, 2004, the district court agreed and granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-25\">On appeal, Greenfield argues that the district court erroneously .dismissed his \u201ccomplaint\u201d which sought to vacate the bankruptcy court\u2019s order of confirmation. He claims that the court failed to recognize that although Fed.R.Bankr.9024 requires that an action to revoke a confirmation order be filed within 180 days as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>specified by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144, where relief is sought under Rule 60(b) based on fraud of the court, the law does not impose time limits or limit the power of the court to consider independent actions to relieve a party from a judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Greenfield argues that his Rule 60(b) motion alleged 29 acts of fraud perpetrated on the bankruptcy court, resulting in the defendants defrauding him and over 300 stockholders, investors, and officers of their cash and equity in real estate through the use of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Greenfield argues that these allegations of fraud under Rule 60(b)(6) constituted extraordinary grounds warranting revocation of the order of confirmation. He contends that the time limits provided in Bankruptcy Rule 9024 are not applicable to Rule 60(b)(6) complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-4\">A motion to relieve a party from judgment is within the sound discretion of the district court. <em>First Wisconsin Nat\u2019l Bank of Milwaukee v. Grandlich Devt. Corp., </em>565 F.2d 879, 880 (5th Cir.1978). Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) a court may relieve a party from a final judgment or order for, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cfraud ..., misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party,\u201d or \u201cany other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3), (b)(6). Title 11 United States Code Section 1144 provides that \u201c[o]n request of a party in interest at any time before 180 days after the date of the entry of the order of confirmation, and after notice and a hearing, the court may revoke such order if and only if such order was procured by fraud.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144; <em>see also In re Orange Tree Assoc. Ltd., </em>961 F.2d 1445, 1447 (9th Cir.1992) (requiring strict compliance with the 180-day time limitation for filing a complaint to revoke an order confirming a chapter 11 plan). Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9024 further provides that \u201c[rjule 60 F.R.Civ.P. applies in cases under the Code except that ... a complaint to revoke an order confirming a plan may be filed only within the time allowed by \u00a7 1144.\u201d Fed. R.Bankr.P. 9024. Additionally, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply to proceedings in bankruptcy only to the extent provided by the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. Fed.R.Civ.P. 81(a)(1); <em>see also Chrysler Financial Corp. v. Powe, </em>312 F.3d 1241, 1243 (11th Cir.2002) (same). Rules of procedure may not modify substantive law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2075.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">Greenfield concedes that \u00a7 1144 and Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9024 together require that an action to revoke a confirmation order be filed within the 180-day period specified in \u00a7 1144. Greenfield argues, however, that by filing a cause of action seeking relief directly under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) his claim avoids the time provisions of \u00a7 1144 and Rule 9024. Greenfield offers no statutory language supporting his reading of the rules, and no such case law exists. The Advisory Committee Notes for Rule 9024 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure directly refute Greenfield\u2019s argument: \u201cClauses (2) and (3) of this rule make it clear that the time periods established by \u00a7\u00a7 727(e), 1144 and 1330 of the [Federal] Code may <em>not be circumvented by the invocation of </em>F.R.Civ.P. 60(b).\u201d Fed.R.Bankr.P. 9024 advisory committee\u2019s notes (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">Because Greenfield\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion was not filed within 180 days of the entry of the confirmation order as required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9024 and 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">Affirmed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">. Although Greenfield repeatedly cites to the rules as Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3)(6), it appears that he intends to refer to Rule 60(b)(6). Nevertheless, we discuss both Rule 60(b)(3) and Rule 60(b)(6) <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">.
