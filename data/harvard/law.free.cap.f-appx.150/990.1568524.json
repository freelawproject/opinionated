Lambert argues on appeal that the district court improperly dismissed his complaint for having alleged discriminatory acts differing from those presented to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in his original administrative charge of discrimination. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">Lambert, proceeding <em>pro se </em>below, sued his former employer, the Alabama Department of Youth Services, and several individuals, alleging racial discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and retaliation under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 20006-5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, Lambert, a former Youth Services Aide, alleged in his complaint that his supervisor was requiring him to strip and wax floors, which was not part of his job description, and that, if he failed to do so, it would be reflected in a lower evaluation. He further alleged that the sick leave policy was being applied against him in a discriminatory fashion because he was required, on one occasion, to provide a doctor\u2019s letter excusing a sick day. Lambert sought compensatory, punitive, and any other damages the court deemed feasible. Included with his complaint was, <em>inter alia, </em>a notice of right to sue letter issued by the EEOC on August 30, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-14\">The state responded by filing a motion to dismiss the complaint for, <em>inter alia, </em>failure to exhaust administrative remedies. It argued that Lambert\u2019s charge of discrimination, filed with the EEOC on July 12, 2002, alleged only that Lambert had been suspended for being disruptive and had been transferred to a less desirable shift. The \u201ccharge of discrimination\u201d was attached, and alleged that, on June 20, 2002, Lambert was \u201csuspended for one day\u201d for being disruptive, and that, on June 22, 2002, Lambert was transferred to a \u201cless desirable shift.\u201d Because Lambert\u2019s complaint mentioned issues concerning his sick leave and being required to wax and strip floors, the state argued that the district court had no jurisdiction over the complaint because the allegations of the complaint were unrelated to the charge of discrimination filed with the EEOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>Lambert objected to the state\u2019s motion, but did not address the failure to exhaust argument directly. Instead, he argued that his complaint should have been construed as defective and that he should be given the opportunity to amend it. Lambert further argued that the complaint should not be dismissed because there were justiciable and valid issues to address. He also filed a motion for judgment by default, and included with that motion another right to sue letter issued by the EEOC on March 17, 2003. The state\u2019s motion was denied, based in part on the March 17, 2003, letter, which the magistrate said suggested at least some additional EEOC action since Lambert\u2019s June 2002 complaint, and the requirement that Lambert\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint be construed liberally.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Lambert then amended his complaint, including the same claims as before regarding sick leave and the stripping and waxing of floors, and adding a claim alleging that the state violated his First Amendment rights when it retaliated against him for speaking out on a matter of public concern. Specifically, Lambert alleged that he was terminated for complaining that the \u201cThomasville facility\u201d was out of compliance with the \u201cA.W. Consent Decree,\u201d and for ordering someone to retrieve a nurse to attend to a sick student whom his supervisor believed was \u201cfaking it.\u201d Several months later, an attorney entered an appearance on Lambert\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">In response to Lambert\u2019s amended complaint, the state filed a renewed motion to dismiss the complaint, arguing that (1) the substance of Lambert\u2019s complaint did not match the allegations of the charge of discrimination filed with the EEOC, and (2) in any event, the March 17, 2003, letter was not a \u201cRight to Sue\u201d letter from the Attorney General, but rather a simple determination letter from the EEOC, and the state argued that Lambert, therefore, had failed to plead a jurisdictional requirement of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e \u2014 5(f)(1). Attached were the March 17, 2003, \u201cnotice of suit rights,\u201d referencing Charge No. 130 A30 0993, and the July 12, 2002, \u201ccharge of discrimination\u201d filed with the EEOC and referencing Charge No. 130A202606. Lambert was informed that he had one week to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">A magistrate then issued a report and recommendation and, after noting that Lambert failed to respond to the state\u2019s renewed motion to dismiss, found that the only EEOC charge that it was aware of was the one alleging that Lambert was suspended for being disruptive and assigned to a less desirable shift. Because those charges were different from the ones raised in Lambert\u2019s amended complaint, and there was no evidence that the allegations in that complaint were raised in a separate EEOC charge, the magistrate recommended dismissing the complaint without prejudice for failure to exhaust remedies. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and dismissed the case without prejudice on July 29, 2004. However, three days earlier, Lambert had filed a motion to set aside the judgment and reinstate the case because of his attorney\u2019s inadequate representation and failure to lodge objections to the magistrate\u2019s report. A magistrate granted the motion for the limited purpose of permitting Lambert to file objections to the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">Lambert then filed objections, requesting leniency regarding his complaint due to his <em>pro se </em>status and arguing that he had complied with Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(1). He further argued that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) did not require that the Attorney General issue a right to sue letter, but dealt with notice of any conciliation agreement reached. The district court reviewed the objections, found them to be without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>merit, and again ordered the case dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">On appeal, Lambert proceeds <em>pro se, </em>arguing that the district court erred by dismissing his complaint and he believes that his case should be allowed to go forward. In his statement of the facts, Lambert reiterates that his supervisor demanded that he strip and wax floors, which was not a part of his duties, and if he failed to do so, it would be reflected in his evaluation. He further notes that a white supervisor permitted white students to enter the building unsupervised, but reprimanded blacks, including Lambert, for doing the same thing. Lastly, he argues that he was entitled to sick pay and that the sick leave policy was inherently discriminatory. Lambert does not make any argument regarding the First Amendment claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s order granting a motion to dismiss. <em>McGinley v. Houston, </em>361 F.3d 1328, 1330 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cNo action alleging a violation of Title VII may be brought unless the alleged discrimination has been made the subject of a timely-filed EEOC charge.\u201d <em>Alexander v. Fulton County, Georgia, </em>207 F.3d 1303, 1332 (11th Cir. 2000) <em>citing </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5. \u201cEEOC regulations provide that charges should contain, among other things, \u2018[a] clear and concise statement of the facts, including pertinent dates, constituting the alleged unlawful employment practices.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. citing </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.12(a)(3). \u201cA plaintiffs judicial complaint is limited by the scope of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe filing of an administrative complaint with the EEOC is ordinarily a jurisdictional prerequisite to a Title VII action.\u201d <em>Chanda v. Engelhard/ICC, </em>234 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">As we have explained, \u201c[t]he purpose of this exhaustion requirement \u2018is that the [EEOC] should have the first opportunity to investigate the alleged discriminatory practices to permit it to perform its role in obtaining voluntary compliance and promoting conciliation efforts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gregory v. Georgia Dep\u2019t of Human Resources, </em>355 F.3d 1277, 1279 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted). Thus, we have held that \u201cjudicial claims are allowed if they \u2018amplify, clarify, or more clearly focus\u2019 the allegations in the EEOC complaint, but [have] cautioned that allegations of new acts of discrimination are inappropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1279-80 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">The record in this case reveals two different EEOC notices of a right to sue, but only one actual charge of discrimination. That one charge of discrimination, filed on July 12, 2002, stated that, on June 20, 2002, Lambert was suspended for one day for being disruptive, and that on or about June 22, 2002, he was transferred to a less desirable shift. Lambert claimed that these actions were discriminatory based on his race and sex, and that he was retaliated against for filing a grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">Lambert\u2019s amended complaint, however, alleges that his supervisor has demanded that Lambert wax and strip floors, something not a part of his job duties, and that if Lambert fails to do so, it would be reflected in a negative evaluation. He fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>ther alleges that the sick leave policy is inherently discriminatory, and cites an incident where he called in sick, was told that he had to bring a doctor\u2019s note excusing his absence, and ended up being denied paid sick leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">On these allegations, we conclude that the district court properly found that Lambert had failed to exhaust his remedies with the EEOC, and properly granted the state\u2019s motion to dismiss. Lambert\u2019s claim to the EEOC, that he was suspended for being disrupted and transferred to a less desirable shift on the basis of his race and gender, would not reasonably lead the EEOC to investigate whether Lambert was being forced to wax and strip floors or being denied sick leave on the basis of his race and gender. These allegations do not clarify, amplify, or more clearly focus the allegations in the original EEOC complaint, but rather are allegations of new acts of discrimination that this Court has held are inappropriate. <em>See Gregory, </em>355 F.3d at 1279-80. There is no evidence in the record that Lambert raised these claims to the EEOC in a formal charge of discrimination and, therefore, Lambert improperly failed to exhaust his remedies prior to filing suit in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">Accordingly, the district court did not err by dismissing Lambert\u2019s complaint without prejudice. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">. The case styling of the action was later amended to reflect that liability could be asserted only against Lambert\u2019s employer, Alabama Department of Youth Services, rather than any individual defendants. Thus, the defendant is referred to as \"the state\u201d in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">. This issue is deemed waived. <em>See Farrow v. West, </em>320 F.3d 1235, 1242 n. 10 (11th Cir. 2003). Furthermore, Lambert's allegation that a white supervisor allowed white students to enter the building unsupervised but reprimanded Lambert and black children for doing the same thing is raised for the first time on appeal, will not be considered. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004). In any event, as discussed below, none of these allegations were related to the only record evidence of charges of discrimination filed with the EEOC and, therefore, these allegations are not properly before us on that ground as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
