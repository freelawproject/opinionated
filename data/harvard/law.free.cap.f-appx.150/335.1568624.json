The district court sentenced Castro to 46 months of imprisonment followed by two years of supervised release and imposed the mandatory assessment. The Government expressly declines to seek enforcement of the waiver provision in Castro\u2019s plea agreement; therefore, this court will not enforce it. <em>See United States v. Rhodes, </em>253 F.3d 800, 804 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">For the first time on appeal, Castro argues that the district court erred by imposing sentence pursuant to the formerly mandatory sentencing guidelines regime, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Castro\u2019s arguments that this error is either structural or presumptively prejudicial are foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">Sentencing a defendant pursuant to a mandatory guidelines regime, standing alone, constitutes \u201cFanfan\u201d error, and such an error is \u201cplain.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 601. Castro contends that this error affected his substantial rights because the district court sentenced him at the bottom of the guideline range and had no discretion under the mandatory scheme to impose a lower sentence. However, the court\u2019s imposition of a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range is, standing alone, no indication that the sentencing judge would have reached a different conclusion under an advisory scheme. <em>See United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317-18 n. 4 (5th Cir.2005). There is no indication in the record, either in the sentencing judge\u2019s statements or otherwise, that the district court would have imposed a different sentence under an advisory guidelines scheme. Castro has not shown that the error affected his substantial rights and, thus, he has not demonstrated plain error. <em>See Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">Castro also argues that, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional because it permits a sentencing judge to increase a sentence beyond the statutory maximum based on a factor that need not be submitted to a jury for proof or admitted by the defendant. Castro concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for possible Supreme Court review. This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201c \u2018unless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 277-78 (5th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
