Jones contends the district court erred enhancing his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000), despite his argument that with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>spect to one of the predicate convictions, he did not voluntarily waive his right to counsel. Jones further contends the use of prior convictions to enhance his sentence is improper under the rule announced in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), when the convictions were not charged in the indictment, proven to a jury or admitted by the defendant. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) noted Jones was an armed career criminal within the meaning of <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) (2002). Accordingly, his base offense level was raised to 34. The PSR noted a 1993 conviction for burglary, a 1994 conviction for burglary and a 1998 state conviction for possession with intent to distribute powder cocaine. At sentencing, Jones argued the cocaine conviction could not be used to determine his sentence because it was uncounseled and he did not voluntarily waive counsel. After taking evidence, the district court found Jones did not meet his burden establishing he did not voluntarily waive counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">While a defendant may challenge at sentencing the validity of a prior conviction used to enhance a sentence on the ground that he was denied counsel, <em>Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 495-96, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994), he bears the \u201cheavy\u201d burden of showing the prior conviction is invalid. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>977 F.2d 105, 110, 111 (4th Cir.1992). The determination of whether counsel is waived is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Hondo, </em>366 F.3d 363, 365 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Here, Jones had to overcome the presumption that the state court informed him of his right to counsel as it was required by statute to do. <em>Parke v. Raley, </em>506 U.S. 20, 28-34, 113 S.Ct. 517, 121 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992) (holding a presumption of regularity attaches to final judgments and makes it appropriate for defendant to have burden of showing irregularity of prior plea). We agree with the district court in its findings and find Jones did not meet his burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">Jones further contends the use of prior convictions not charged in the indictment, found by a jury or admitted by the defendant, to increase a sentence is improper under the rule announced in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Jones challenges the continued viability of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 233-35, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Jones did not raise this issue in the district court. Consequently, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). To meet this plain error standard: (1) there must be an error; (2) the error must be plain; and (3) the error must affect substantial rights. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770. If the three elements of the plain error standard are met, we may exercise our discretion to notice error only \u201cwhen failure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice, such as when the defendant is actually innocent or the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 555 (4th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court held the government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence. Although the opinion in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>expressed some uncertainty regarding the future vitality of <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>we have subsequently confirmed that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was not overruled by <em>Apprendi, </em>and remains the law. <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 353-54 (4th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b232-13\"> We note the holding in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), does not support Jones\u2019 claim. The district court did not look beyond the record of conviction to determine facts about the conviction. Once the court determined Jones voluntarily waived counsel, the fact of conviction was all that was necessary for it to be used to increase the offense level.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
