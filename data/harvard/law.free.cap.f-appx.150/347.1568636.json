Accordingly, this matter is decided by a quorum. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\n<em>ON REMAND FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b370-5\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">This court affirmed Niguel Deshon Holder\u2019s judgment of conviction. <em>United States v. Holder, </em>109 Fed. Appx. 673, 674 (5th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Holder v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1093, 160 L.Ed.2d 1061 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Holder argues that his <em>Booker </em>claim is not subject to plain-error review because his petition for certiorari was pending when <em>Booker </em>was issued. This court applies the plain-error standard of review to unpreserved <em>Booker </em>claims even in cases such as this one. <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>418 F.3d 481, 482 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>412 F.3d 614, 616 (5th Cir.2005). Holder\u2019s challenge to his sentence fails to meet the plain-error standard because he has not shown that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">Accordingly, we conclude that nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>decision requires us to change our prior affirmance in this case. We therefore reinstate our judgment affirming the defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b370-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
