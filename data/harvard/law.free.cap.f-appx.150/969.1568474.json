The district court, finding that Clarke\u2019s case was closed and that more than a year had passed since sentencing, determined it lacked jurisdiction to decide the motion and therefore dismissed it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>On appeal, Clarke identifies no source of subject matter jurisdiction that would have empowered the district court to reach the merits of his motion. Clarke nevertheless contends that he is entitled to dismissal of the indictment because: (1) the indictment should have contained an allegation of willfulness; (2) Clarke was charged with and pleaded guilty to \u201cattempted reentry,\u201d but the written plea agreement and the judgment of conviction describe his offense as one of unlawful re-entry and do not use the term \u201cattempt\u201d; and (3) the attribution of this \u201c[unjindicted offense\u201d to Clarke violates <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">A district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See United States v. Perez, </em>956 F.2d 1098, 1101 (11th Cir.1992) (per curiam). Clarke essentially claims that his indictment was so defective as to fail to invoke the district court\u2019s jurisdiction or state an offense. Generally, a motion alleging a defect in an indictment must be raised before trial, \u201cbut at any time while the case is <em>pending, </em>the court may hear a claim that the indictment ... fails to invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction or to state an offense.\u201d Fed. R.Crim. P. 12(b)(3)(B) (emphasis added). By the time Clarke moved to dismiss his indictment, he had already pled guilty and been sentenced \u2014 and the period to appeal the conviction and/or sentence had long since passed. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, Clarke\u2019s case was not \u201cpending\u201d within the meaning of Rule 12(b)(3)(B) when he filed his motion to dismiss, and the district court correctly refused to entertain the motion. <em>See United States v. Patton, </em>309 F.3d 1093, 1094 (8th Cir.2002) (per curiam) (holding that district court properly denied Rule 12(b) motion where proceeding that led to prisoner\u2019s conviction was no longer pending); <em>United States v. Wolff, </em>241 F.3d 1055, 1056-57 (8th Cir. 2001) (per curiam) (\u201cAfter final judgment was entered and Wolff did not file a direct appeal, the proceedings were no longer pending.\u201d). Moreover, Clarke\u2019s motion was effectively a collateral attack upon his sentence, and he may not circumvent habeas requirements by presenting his challenge under a different guise. <em>Cf. Patton, </em>309 F.3d at 1094.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">Upon review of the record, consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, and for the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Clarke\u2019s post-conviction motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b991-17\">. While appellant's first name is spelled \"Eric\u201d in various parts of the record, appellant uses the spelling \"Erick\u201d in his brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b991-29\">. Although the dismissal was without prejudice to refiling under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, the district court noted- \u2014 and it is uncontroverted on appeal \u2014 that such a filing would be time-barred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b992-5\">. Indeed, this Court previously dismissed Clarke\u2019s instant appeal <em>sua sponte </em>as untimely, to extent the appeal challenged his conviction and sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
