On appeal, Estacio argues that the district court erred by not granting him a minor-role reduction. In support of his claim, Estacio asserts that he was less culpable than most other participants in the conspiracy. After thorough review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-24\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s entitlement to a minor-role reduction for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc). \u201cThe defendant bears the burden of proving his minor role by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-25\">A two-level reduction for playing a minor role in the offense under \u00a7 3B1.2(b) is warranted if the defendant is less culpable than most other participants, but his role could not be described as minimal. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.3). Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number><em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>the district court conducts a two-pronged analysis of the defendant\u2019s conduct to determine whether the defendant warrants a minor-role reduction. First, the district court must measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which he has been held accountable. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940-41. Second, the district court may measure a defendant\u2019s culpability compared to that of other participants in the relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 944. A defendant whose role in the relevant conduct was less than that of other participants is not necessarily entitled to a minor-role reduction where no participants are minor participants. <em>Id. </em>(\u201c[A] defendant is not automatically entitled to a minor role adjustment merely because [he] is somewhat less culpable than the other discernible participants. Rather, the district court must determine that the defendant was less culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in [his] relevant act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in the original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Estacio asserts that he met his burden to receive a reduction because (1) five of the eight crew members had more culpable roles; (2) the venture could have succeeded without Estacio, who provided no specialized training or knowledge; and (3) Estacio\u2019s role was limited to moving the cocaine once it was on the boat and driving the boat only in accordance with the captain\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">Estacio has not established that the district court clearly erred in finding that he was not entitled to a minor-role reduction because (1) he was held responsible only for the drugs in which he was directly involved \u2014 907.2 kilograms of cocaine (a not insubstantial amount) \u2014 so that his relevant conduct was the same as his actual conduct; and (2) while onboard the vessel, Estacio helped move the cocaine and took turns with other crew members steering and driving the vessel based on instructions given by the captain or navigator.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on these tasks, Estacio did not play a minor role in these drug conspiracy and possession offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">As for the second prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis, the evidence is insufficient to show that Estacio was a minor participant in comparison to others. Estacio claims that five of the eight crew members had more culpable roles. However, the record clearly reflects that Estacio performed the same tasks, which we note were <em>integral </em>tasks to the overall conspiracy, as <em>all </em>other crew members, other than the captain and the navigator. After thorough review of the record, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in finding that Estacio\u2019s role was not minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">The district court\u2019s denial of a minor-role reduction was entirely consistent with our decision in <em>De Var\u00f3n. </em>Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b990-6\">. Estacio makes much of the district court's finding that his tasks included looking out for law enforcement vessels. He urges that there is no evidence in the record to support this finding. We note, however, that irrespective of his look-out duties, Estacio\u2019s tasks included the ones we have enumerated above, and those tasks are sufficient to show that Estacio did not play a minor role.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
