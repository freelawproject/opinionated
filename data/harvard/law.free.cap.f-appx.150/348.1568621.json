Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). The testimony and evidence challenged by Spell is not facially such as to compel the conclusion that no reasonable juror could properly credit it, and it did not \u201crelate[] to facts the witnesses] could not possibly have observed or to events which could not have occurred under the laws of nature.\u201d <em>United States v. De La Rosa, </em>171 F.3d 215, 221 (5th Cir.1999) (quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we will not disturb the credibility determinations of the jury. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
