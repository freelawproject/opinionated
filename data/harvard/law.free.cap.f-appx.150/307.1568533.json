Cohen appeals the denial of his pretrial motion to suppress. He argues that the district court erred in denying his motion because his detention following the initially valid traffic stop was unconstitutionally prolonged and because a subsequent search of his vehicle exceeded the scope of his consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-24\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s ultimate conclusions on Fourth Amendment issues de novo. <em>United States v. Brigham, </em>382 F.3d 500, 506 n. 2 (5th Cir. 2004) (en banc). Because Cohen does not challenge the validity of his initial stop, the pertinent inquiry in this appeal is whether his detention following the stop was reasonable to dispel Trooper Oscar C. Esqueda\u2019s suspicion of unlawful activity that developed during the course of the stop. <em>See id. </em>at 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-25\">Cohen contends that Trooper Esqueda unreasonably and unconstitutionally prolonged his detention beyond that necessary to effectuate the purpose of the initial stop, asking questions unrelated to the stop and relying only on a generalized suspicion of wrongdoing, a hunch. Contrary to Cohen\u2019s assertion, Trooper Esqueda did not ask any impermissible questions during the course of his detention. <em>See Brigham, </em>382 F.3d at 508. Moreover, the transcript of the suppression hearing establishes that Trooper Esqueda relied on more than a generalized suspicion of wrongdoing; in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>stead, Trooper Esqueda\u2019s actions were a graduated response to emerging facts, were reasonable under a totality of the circumstances, and did not unconstitutionally extend Cohen\u2019s detention. <em>See id. </em>at 506-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Cohen\u2019s contention that his consent to search his truck was limited to the tractor or cab portion of the truck and that Trooper Esqueda exceeded the scope of Cohen\u2019s consent when he searched the truck\u2019s trailer without Cohen\u2019s explicit consent to search it is unavailing. <em>United States v. McSween, </em>53 F.3d 684, 688 (5th Cir.1995). Cohen\u2019s conduct, unlocking and opening the trailer for Trooper Esqueda, would indicate to a reasonable officer that Cohen consented to the search of the trailer. <em>See id. </em>Because Cohen knew that cocaine was hidden in his trailer at the time of the search, he should have limited his consent, if he deemed it necessary to do so, to clarify any ambiguity from which he now seeks to benefit. <em>See id. </em>Cohen failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
