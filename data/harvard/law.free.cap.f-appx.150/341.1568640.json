Accordingly, this matter is decided by a quorum. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\">ON REMAND FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<author id=\"b364-9\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">In late 2004, this court affirmed Joe Bob Moncriefs convictions of conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 &amp; 1956(h); of two counts of bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344; of five counts of illegal money transactions, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957(a); and of nine counts of money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1). <em>United States v. Moncrief, </em>133 Fed.Appx. 924, 932 (5th Cir. 2004). It also affirmed his sentence to 210 months imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court granted Moncriefs petition for <em>writ of certiorari; </em>vacated our judgment; and remanded the case for further consideration in the light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Moncrief v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2273, 161 L.Ed.2d 1051 (2005). We requested, and received, supplemental briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker. </em>Having reconsidered our decision pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions, we reinstate our judgment affirming the conviction, but remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-19\">Moncrief raised <em>Booker-error </em>for the first time on appeal; therefore, our review is only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005) (No. 04-9517). Plain error review permits an appellate court to correct a forfeited issue only when, <em>inter alia, </em>there is \u201c(1) error (2) that is plain and (3) that affects substantial rights\u201d. <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (citation and internal quotations marks omitted). Because the district court sentenced Moncrief under the mandatory Guidelines held unconstitutional in <em>Booker, </em>the first two prongs are satisfied. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>petition for cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005) (No. 05-5556). As discussed <em>infra, </em>Moncrief has shown \u201cthe outcome would have been different if the district court had been operating under an advisory system\u201d, <em>United States v. Holmes, </em>406 F.3d 337, 365 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 375, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>(2005) (No. 05-38); accordingly, he has also satisfied the third prong of plain-error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Moncrief met his burden of showing his substantial rights were affected by \u201cdemonstrating] a probability \u2018sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\u2019 \u201c of his sentencing. <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521 (quoting <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 2340, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004)). At sentencing, the district court stated that, although a review of Moncriefs life made the sentencing \u201call the more heart-breaking\u201d, the court was unable to grant a downward departure because of the constraints imposed by the Guidelines. The sentencing judge imposed the minimum term of imprisonment allowed under the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\"><em>United States v. Pennell, </em>409 F.3d 240 (5th Cir.2005), considered similar language from a defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing, at which the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">Once again, I say that from many standpoints of fairness and justice, it might be better to sentence people based on actual loss, <em>but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way the guidelines are written </em>or the appellate courts interpreted them in most cases. <em>So I feel constrained to overrule your objection.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 245 (emphasis added). There, the court imposed the lowest sentence possible under the then-mandatory Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 246. On appeal, our court remanded the case for resentencing, after interpreting the district court\u2019s statement to show that, \u201chad [the judge] been free to do so[,] he would have selected a different loss figure which would have resulted in a lesser sentence\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">The language used by the district court at Moncriefs sentencing is sufficiently similar to the district court\u2019s in <em>Pennell. </em>Because Moncrief likely would have received a different sentence, had the judge not felt constrained by the then-mandatory Guidelines, Moncrief has satisfied the third prong of the plain error test. <em>See id. </em>(noting it was \u201clikely\u201d that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence had the judge not been bound under the mandatory Guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">Even though Moncrief has satisfied these three prongs, we have discretion whether to correct plain error; generally we will not do so unless the error \u201cseriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d. <em>Id. </em>In this regard, because the plain error likely increased his sentence, Moncrief has made the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">Finally, as recognized by this court on plain error review on direct appeal: the district court committed clear error by using the 2000 edition of the Sentencing Guidelines, rather than the 2001 edition, in determining the applicable Guidelines range for Moncriefs sentence; but Moncrief failed to show such error affected his substantial rights. <em>Moncrief, </em>133 Fed. Appx. at 939. (Moncrief now appears to urge his sentence should be imposed in the light of the 2002 edition.) Although the Supreme Court limited its remand to this court for further consideration in the light of <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. At 738, we are confident that, on remand, the district court will consider the correct edition of the Guidelines in resentencing Moncrief.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">Therefore, we AFFIRM Moncriefs conviction; VACATE his sentence; and REMAND for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART; AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b364-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
