Carter\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in her opinion, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Although concluding that such allegations lacked merit, counsel asserts that the district court erred in denying Carter\u2019s motion to suppress evidence and in its consideration of dismissed counts as relevant conduct in determining Carter\u2019s sentence. Counsel also asserts that Carter\u2019s sentence violates <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Carter filed a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">In the <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel asserts that the district court erred in denying Carter\u2019s motion to suppress evidence based on Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment violations. We find that the district court did not clearly err in finding that there was reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot as required under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). We further find that the district court did not clearly err in finding no evidence to support Carter\u2019s claims that he did not receive <em>Miranda </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark> warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Counsel also questions the court\u2019s consideration of dismissed counts as relevant conduct in its sentencing determination. We find that the court\u2019s consideration of Carter\u2019s previous charges of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon was proper. We further find that even if Carter\u2019s sentence violated the Sixth Amendment, that error was harmless. The harmless error standard permits an error at sentencing to be disregarded if the reviewing court is certain that any such error \u201cdid not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992). Here, because the district court explained that it would impose an alternate discretionary sentence that was identical to the guideline sentence, the error inherent in the application of the guidelines as mandatory did not affect the court\u2019s ultimate determination of the sentence, nor Carter\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Carter\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b253-13\"> <em>Miranda v.
