Thibodeaux, </em>115 Fed. Appx. 708 (5th Cir. Dec.17, 2004)(unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We requested and received supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Thibodeaux argues that the district court\u2019s application of sentencing guidelines adjustments based upon the amount of loss and victims involved and for means of identification used violated the Sixth Amendment. Thibodeaux concedes that her argument is raised for the first time on appeal and is reviewable for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">As Thibodeaux admits, the district court made no statements indicating that it would have imposed a lower sentence under an advisory guidelines regime. Accordingly, although the district court\u2019s adjustments to Thibodeaux\u2019s sentence constitute error that is plain, i.e., obvious, Thibodeaux cannot demonstrate that the error affected her substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>at 521-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">Thibodeaux correctly acknowledges that this court has rejected the argument that a <em>Booker </em>error is a structural error or that such error is presumed to be prejudicial. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 611 (5th Cir.2005). She likewise concedes that our precedent forecloses her contention that application of <em>Booker\u2019 </em>s remedial opinion to her violates the Ex Post Facto Clause. <em>See United States v. Scroggins, </em>411 F.3d 572, 577 (5th Cir. 2005). She raises these arguments to preserve them for further review. Thibodeaux\u2019s reliance on the plain error analysis set forth in <em>United States v. Dazey, </em>403 F.3d 1147 (10th Cir.2005), is unavailing in light of <em>Mares.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-16\">Because nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>decision requires us to change our prior affirmance in this case, we reinstate our judgment affirming Thibodeaux\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-12\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
