Guardado-Ortega, </em>No. 04-20299 (5th Cir. Dec. 17, 2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See Vences v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1991, 161 L.Ed.2d 847 (2005). We requested and received supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-19\">Guardado argues that he is entitled to resentencing because the district court sentenced him under a mandatory application of the guidelines prohibited by <em>Booker. </em>This court will not consider a <em>Booker-related </em>challenge raised for the first time in a petition for certiorari absent extraordinary circumstances. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>409 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-20\">Guardado argues that this court\u2019s holding in <em>Taylor </em>is not controlling because it is contrary to earlier precedent in this circuit and that plain error is therefore the proper standard of review in this case. He concedes, however, that he cannot make the necessary showing of plain error that is required by our precedent in <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). Moreover, this court has rejected his arguments that a <em>Booker </em>error is a structural error or that such error is presumed to be prejudicial. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520-22; <em>see also United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 11, 2005) (No. 05-5297).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-21\">Because nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>decision requires us to change our prior affirmance in this case, we reinstate our judgment affirming Guardado\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
