On appeal, Terriquez argues that the district court erred by denying him a reduction for a mitigating role in the offense. In addition, Terriquez argues that the district court violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments as defined by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), by considering the Guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-25\">\n<em>Mitigating-role Reduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b995-26\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>fense for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc). The defendant bears the burden of proving that his role in the offense was minor by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">A minor-role reduction of a defendant\u2019s base offense level by two levels is appropriate where the defendant is less culpable than most other participants, but where his role could not be described as minimal. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 5. A four-level reduction for playing a minimal role in the offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a) is warranted only if the defendant is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group,\u201d and such a reduction is intended to be used infrequently. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 4. Indicators of a minimal participant are the \u201cdefendant\u2019s lack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise and of the activities of others.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>A three-level reduction may be warranted for a defendant whose conduct falls between these two standards. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">Two principles guide the district court\u2019s determination of whether to grant a minor-role reduction. First, the district court must measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which he has been held accountable. <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 940. The amount of drugs in a courier\u2019s possession may be the best indication of the magnitude of the courier\u2019s participation in the criminal enterprise. <em>Id. </em>at 943. \u201cOnly if the defendant can establish that [he] played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable \u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant a downward adjustment for a minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. \u201c[W]here the relevant conduct attributed to a defendant is identical to [his] actual conduct, [he] cannot prove that [he] is entitled to a minor role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader criminal scheme in which [he] was a minor participant but for which [he] was not held accountable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">Second, the district court may measure the defendant\u2019s culpability in comparison to that of other participants in the relevant conduct. The district court should consider other participants only to the extent that they are \u201cidentifiable or discernable from the evidence,\u201d and only if they were \u201cinvolved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">In the present case, the district court sentenced Terriquez based on the activities to which he pled. Terriquez\u2019s relevant conduct and actual conduct were identical so he has not met the first prong of <em>De Var\u00f3n. See De Varon </em>175 F.3d at 941. Terriquez fails to meet the second prong of <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>because of all the individuals involved, Terriquez and his codefendants were key members who were to transport the drugs, and it cannot be said that Terriquez is \u201cplainly among the least culpable.\u201d Futhermore, Terriquez pled guilty to possessing over 10,000 pounds of cocaine, and this enforces the denial of a mitigating-role reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 943. Finally, because Terriquez cannot meet the \u201cless culpable than most other participants\u201d minor-role standard, he cannot meet the standard for a minimal-role reduction, which states that the defendant must be \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">\n<em>Booker Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number><em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>the Supreme Court reversed an upward departure under Washington state\u2019s sentencing guidelines system and held that the relevant \u201c \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2537, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">In <em>Booker, </em>a case involving <em>Blakely\u2019s </em>application to the federal Guidelines, the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe Sixth Amendment as construed in <em>Blakely </em>does apply to the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d 543 U.S. at -, 125 S.Ct. at 746. The Supreme Court also held that, in light of its holding that <em>Blakely </em>does apply to the Guidelines, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (requiring a sentence within the guideline range, absent a departure) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (establishing standards of review on appeal) must be severed and excised from the Guidelines, rendering the Guidelines merely advisory. <em>Id. </em>at -, 125 S.Ct. at 756-57. The Supreme Court held, however, that district courts still must consider the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at -, 125 S.Ct. at 757, 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">In reviewing a <em>Booker </em>claim, we must first determine whether there is a preserved objection. <em>See United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242, 1246 (11th Cir. 2005). Here, Terriquez made a <em>Blakely </em>objection to the application of the Guidelines in the PSI and at sentencing. Where a defendant timely raised a <em>Blakely </em>objection in the district court, we review the claim on appeal <em>de novo, </em>but reverse only for harmful error. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">The standard for harmless error depends on the type of error that is alleged, either constitutional error or statutory error. <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005)). A constitutional error occurs when there is an extra-verdict enhancement that results in a Guidelines range that is binding on the district court. <em>Id. </em>A statutory violation occurs when, in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation, the district court sentences under a mandatory Guidelines scheme. <em>Id. </em>We have held that \u201cconstitutional errors are harmless where the government can show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the alleged error did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence,\u201d and a statutory error is harmless if it is determined that the proceedings in their entirety did not affect the sentence \u201cor had but a very slight effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-13\">Here, Terriquez raises a statutory error, and the district court erred in sentencing him under the Guidelines as mandatory. Because there is no clear indication of what sentence the district court would have imposed had it known the Guidelines were only advisory, the government has not met its burden to show that the error did not affect the sentence \u201cor had but a very slight effect.\u201d <em>Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292. Accordingly, the error was not harmless, and we vacate and remand. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b997-14\">Upon a review of the record and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of a mitigating-role reduction and vacate and remand for resentencing consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b997-15\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED AND REMANDED in part.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b997-11\">.
