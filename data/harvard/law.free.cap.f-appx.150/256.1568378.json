He was sentenced to seventy-seven months in prison and three years of supervised release. We affirmed his conviction and sentence. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>88 Fed.Appx. 580 (4th Cir.2004) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-14\">Campbell filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court, which was denied on June 21, 2004. <em>Campbell v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2893, 159 L.Ed.2d 796 (2004). However, the Supreme Court decided <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), three days later on June 24, 2004. Campbell filed a timely petition for rehearing, which was granted. <em>Campbell v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1112, 160 L.Ed.2d 991 (2005). The Court vacated its previous denial of certiorari and this court\u2019s February 20, 2004 judgment in light of the decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Id. </em>Campbell\u2019s case has been remanded to this court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-20\">Because Campbell\u2019s sentence was imposed prior to the decisions in <em>Booker </em>and <em>Blakely, </em>he did not raise objections to his sentence based on the mandatory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines or the district court\u2019s application of sentencing enhancements based on facts not admitted by Campbell or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we review his sentence for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). To demonstrate plain error, a defendant must establish that the error occurred, that it was plain, and that it affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 547-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-21\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court applied the rationale of <em>Blakely </em>to the federal sentencing guidelines and held that the mandatory guidelines scheme that provided for sentence enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. 746-48, 755-56 (Stevens, J., opinion of the court). The Court remedied the constitutional violation by severing two statutory provisions, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (West Supp.2004) (requiring sentencing courts to impose a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>sentence within the applicable guidelines range), and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2004) (setting forth appellate standards of review for guideline issues), thereby making the guidelines advisory. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546 (citing <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757, 764 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court)).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">We conclude that Campbell has demonstrated plain error under <em>United Stats v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208 (4th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In <em>White, </em>we held that a' defendant can demonstrate the prejudice associated with a mandatory application of the guidelines on the basis of statements by the sentencing court that it would otherwise have departed from the guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 223-24. As the Government concedes, this is the case here based on the court\u2019s comments at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Accordingly, we vacate Campbell\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker </em>and its progeny. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\"> Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4, \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Campbell\u2019s sentencing. <em>See generally Johnson v. United </em>States, 520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating that an error is \"plain\u201d if \"the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
