After White\u2019s guilty plea to Count One, Count Two was dismissed. The district court sentenced White on Count One to a term of 96 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by a three-year term of supervised release. On appeal, 'White advances two challenges to the district court\u2019s four-level enhancement of his sentence for possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2003), first to the propriety of the application of the enhancement under the Guidelines, and second to the district court\u2019s application of the enhancement as a violation of White\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. We have reviewed the record, together with White\u2019s claims on appeal, and find that White\u2019s sentence must be vacated pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-17\">As a preliminary matter, we find that the enhancement applied by the district court to White\u2019s case was proper under the Guidelines and the law of this circuit. White challenges his sentence on the ground that it \u201cappears\u201d as though the district court relied on the legal standard employed by the Fifth Circuit in <em>United States v. Condren, </em>18 F.3d 1190 (5th Cir. 1994), and similar cases, that hold that mere possession of the firearm is a sufficient basis on which to apply the enhancement, rather than the standard followed in this circuit, as reaffirmed in <em>United States v. Blount, </em>337 F.3d 404 (4th Cir.2003). The basis for his challenge is that <em>Condren </em>and similar cases were cited by the parties during the sentencing hearing, and the district court found the enhancement to be appropriate under all the cases discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-18\">Having reviewed the record, we conclude the undisputed evidence supported the district court\u2019s enhancement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>under the Guidelines in White\u2019s case. Upon seeing police officers approaching his residence, White ran inside the house, donned a sweatshirt, emerged through a side door several seconds later and was pursued by the officers on foot for 300 yards, prior to throwing the firearm at issue onto the roof of a neighboring residence. After apprehending White, the officers discovered a quantity of crack in his pocket. These facts support the conclusion that White simultaneously possessed both the firearm and the crack for at least 300 yards while attempting to evade law enforcement, and used the firearm to embolden him during the commission of the crime of possession of the crack, and to protect his person and property, including the crack. We find such facts constitute evidence of a nexus between the firearm and the drugs sufficient to support the district court\u2019s application of the enhancement under the Guidelines, as set forth in <em>Blount See also United States v. Nale, </em>101 F.3d 1000, 1003-1004 (4th Cir.1996) (interpreting the \u201cin connection with\u201d standard applicable in the instant case).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">White\u2019s second challenge to the enhancement is advanced under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). After the filing of the briefs in this case, the Supreme Court rendered its decision in <em>Booker. </em>Based on <em>Booker, </em>we find that the district court\u2019s enhancement of White\u2019s sentence based upon facts found by a preponderance of the evidence and not established beyond a reasonable doubt was plain error. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756; <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">As White advances no challenge to his conviction, we affirm his conviction, vacate his sentence, and remand for resentencing in accordance with those factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and viewing the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory, consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and directive in <em>Booker. See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764-65, 767; <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-47. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-6\"> We note that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Nale </em>was among the cases cited by the parties during sentencing on which the district court relied in rendering its decision on the enhancement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
