Ventura argues that the district court\u2019s upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 was erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>because his prior offenses were not egregious, that the district court had a mistaken understanding of the facts, and that the district court failed adequately to explain the reasons for departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Ventura had an offense level of 13, a criminal history category of VI, and a Guidelines range of 33-41 months. The district court departed upward to an offense level of 15 and imposed a sentence of 51 months. The court explained that it was moving up incrementally two levels because of Ventura\u2019s long criminal history, which included numerous offenses for which no criminal history points were assigned, because Ventura had been deported on four prior occasions, and because of Ventura\u2019s likelihood to recidivate. Guided by the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), we conclude that there is no reversible error and that the district court\u2019s sentence was reasonable for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Simkanin, </em>No. 04-10531, 420 F.3d 397, 2005 WL 1847218 at *15-17 (5th Cir. Aug.5, 2005); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>No. 03-10171, 417 F.3d 483, 2005 WL 1663784 at *4-5 (5th Cir. July 18, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Ventura also argues that the felony and aggravated felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), but he correctly concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). We must follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Mancia-Perez, </em>331 F.3d 464, 470 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 935, 124 S.Ct. 358, 157 L.Ed.2d 245 (2003)(internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined, that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
