The pump in the room could not handle the thick liquid, so Garry and his crew removed the oil by climbing down into it, scooping up buckets of oil, and climbing back out. The floor of the room was about eight feet below the room\u2019s entrance, and the room had no fixed ladder. To get to the oil, crew members would climb over a walkway handrail, step onto a structural bulkhead, and then lower themselves onto a support beam below. On the second or third day of this process, Garry stepped on the thruster dome on his way down to the oil, slipped, and injured his knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">Garry challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that, as a matter of law, he did not create a genuine issue of material fact whether Ocean Rig owed him a duty to intervene and stop him from continuing to work under dangerous conditions. \u201cThis court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number><em>novo, </em>applying the same standards as the district court.\u201d <em>Keelan v. Majesco Software, Inc., </em>407 F.3d 332, 338 (5th Cir. 2005). A vessel owner owes a longshoreman a duty to intervene when the vessel owner has: \u201c(1) actual knowledge of the dangerous condition, and (2) actual knowledge that the stevedore would do nothing to protect his employees from the danger.\u201d <em>Barrios v. Pelham Marine, Inc., </em>796 F.2d 128, 131 (5th Cir.1986) (citing <em>Helaire v. Mobil Oil Co., </em>709 F.2d 1031, 1038-39 (5th Cir.1983)). Garry failed to establish a material issue of fact as to whether Ocean Rig knew of the dangerous condition, specifically that Garry and his employees would remove the oil by climbing over structures that over time would become slick. The summary judgment evidence only indicates that after instructing Garry to remove the oil, but before Garry settled on a removal method, David Cusiter (\u201cCusiter\u201d), an Ocean Rig engineer, left the thruster compartment and never returned. Because Garry failed to create a material issue of fact as to Ocean Rig\u2019s actual knowledge of the dangerous condition, Ocean Rig had no duty to intervene. Accordingly, the district court correctly granted summary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Garry also challenges that the district court erred in finding that Ocean Rig did not control Garry\u2019s work area at the time of his injury. This court reviews a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>Moore v. M/V ANGELA, </em>353 F.3d 376, 380 (5th Cir.2003). A vessel owner has a duty to prevent injuries to contractors in areas remaining under the \u201cactive control of the vessel.\u201d <em>Howlett v. Birkdale Shipping Co., S.A., </em>512 U.S. 92, 98, 114 S.Ct. 2057, 129 L.Ed.2d 78 (1994) (quoting <em>Scindia Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. v. De Los Santos, </em>451 U.S. 156, 167, 101 S.Ct. 1614, 68 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981). The district court found that Ocean Rig owed no control duty because it did not have active control of Garry\u2019s work area. Cusiter instructed Garry and his crew to remove the oil, but did not tell them how to do so and provided no equipment with which to do the job. Cusiter then left the area and did not return to the thruster room for at least two days. No one else from Ocean Rig was in the thruster room during the. relevant time. Garry himself devised the method for removing the oil from the room. On the basis of these facts, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Ocean Rig did not retain active or operational control over the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-16\">. \"Ocean Rig\u201d refers collectively to Ocean Rig I A/S; Ocean Rig, Inc.; Ocean Rig A/S/A; and U.S. Ocean Rig, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b387-6\">. As the case can be resolved on the basis of Ocean Rig\u2019s actual knowledge of the dangerous condition, we need not examine the second element necessary to create a duty to intervene, Ocean Rig's knowledge that it could not rely on Friede Goldman, the stevedore, to protect its employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
