Cox contends his conviction should be reversed because there was insufficient evidence that his misrepresentation was material to a matter with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>in the jurisdiction of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). <em>See United States v. Arch Trading Co., </em>987 F.2d 1087, 1095 (4th Cir.1993) (citations omitted). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">A defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence faces a heavy burden. <em>See United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997). When, as here, the defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence at trial, the relevant question is whether, taking the view most favorable to the Government, there is substantial evidence to support the verdict. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). This court \u201cha[s] defined \u2018substantial evidence,\u2019 in the context of a criminal action, as that evidence which \u2018a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>322 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862-63 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc)). This court \u201cmust consider circumstantial as well as direct evidence, and allow the Government the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts proven to those sought to be established.\u201d <em>United States v. Tresvant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir.1982). With these standards in mind, and after reviewing the record, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support Cox\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Cox\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
