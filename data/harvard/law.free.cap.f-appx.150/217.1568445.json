On appeal, the sole issue raised by Dodge is whether the district court erred in calculating his guideline range by denying him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-17\">In order to receive a reduction pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3E1.1 (2003), \u201cthe defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he has clearly recognized and affirmatively accepted personal responsibility for his criminal conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. May, </em>359 F.3d 683, 693 (4th Cir.2004) (citing <em>United States v. Note, </em>101 F.3d 1000, 1005 (4th Cir.1996)). We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility for clear error. <em>United States v. Ruhe, </em>191 F.3d 376, 388 (4th Cir.1999). Based on our review of the record, including Dodge\u2019s filings and testimony, we find no clear error in the district court\u2019s finding that Dodge failed to accept responsibility for his criminal conduct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number><em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.l(a)) (\u201c[A] defendant who falsely denies, or frivolously contests, relevant conduct that the court determines to be true has acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Dodge\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b240-9\"> Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v.
