Johnson appeals following the revocation of his supervised release and the sentence imposed following his guilty plea conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-24\">Johnson argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to revoke his supervised release. He contends that at the time he allegedly violated the terms of his release he was under the jurisdiction of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (\u201cMDOC\u201d) as a participant in the MDOC\u2019s Earned Release Supervision (\u201cERS\u201d) Program and that his federal supervised release had not yet commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-25\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s jurisdiction to revoke supervised release. <em>United States v. English, </em>400 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.2005). We conclude from a plain reading of the relevant statutes that Johnson\u2019s federal supervised release commenced when he was released from confinement to the ERS program, and the district court did not lack jurisdiction to revoke the supervised release. <em>See </em>18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(e); Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 47-5-138; <em>cf.
