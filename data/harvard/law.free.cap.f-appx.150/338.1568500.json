Nieves-Alvarez, </em>No. 04-40805 (5th Cir. Dec. 17, 2005)(unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See de la Cruz-Gonzalez v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1995, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005). We requested and received supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-22\">Nieves argues that his sentence should be vacated because the district court sentenced him under a mandatory Guidelines scheme in violation of <em>Booker. </em>He argues that he should not be required to show plain error because the district court\u2019s error was \u201cstructural\u201d and should be presumed prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-23\">The district court erred by imposing a sentence pursuant to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2005) (No. 05-5556); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 &amp; n. 9. (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). However, Nieves must establish that the error was \u201csufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome [of the case].\u201d <em>Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Nieves cannot make such a showing because the record does not establish that the sentencing court would have imposed a different sentence had it been proceeding under an advisory Guidelines scheme. Although the district court sentenced Nieves to the lowest end of the Guidelines range, it did so without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>comment. In the absence of a showing that his sentence likely would have been different had the Sentencing Guidelines been advisory, Nieves cannot establish plain error. Accordingly, we conclude that nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>decision requires us to change our prior affirmance in this case. We therefore reinstate our judgment affirming the defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
