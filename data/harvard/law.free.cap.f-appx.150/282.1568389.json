We have consolidated his appeals. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3(b). For the reasons given below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">\n<em>Appeal No. 03-51H5</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The district court dismissed Soliz\u2019s claims against defendants Troy C. Bennett and John Jasuta in their official capacities, finding that they were entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity. The district court also found that Bennett and Jasuta were entitled to qualified immunity as to all claims against them in their individual capacities. Although Soliz has challenged the district court\u2019s dismissal on particular grounds, he has not briefed the issues of Eleventh Amendment or qualified immunity-</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 521, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), but to preserve arguments on appeal, even pro se litigants must brief them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993). Arguments not adequately addressed in the body of the brief are deemed abandoned on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 225. Although the district court found some <em>of </em>the claims against the defendants time-barred, the district court\u2019s unchallenged dismissal of Soliz\u2019s claims against Bennett and Jasuta on grounds of Eleventh Amendment and qualified immunity is sufficient to dispose of all of Soliz\u2019s claims against them. <em>See American Eagle Airlines, Inc. v. Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int\u2019l, </em>343 F.3d 401, 411 n. 6 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-14\">Soliz\u2019s assertion that the district court erred in allowing the defendants to file a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment out of time also fails. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b) gives a district court broad discretion to expand filing deadlines. <em>Hetzel v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>50 F.3d 360, 367 (5th Cir.1995). Rule 6(b) gives discretion to a district court to allow such an enlargement at any time a motion is made after the expiration of a specified time period if the failure to act resulted from excusable neglect. Fed. R.Crv.P. 6(b). Here, the district court exercised its discretion by granting the defendants leave to file a dispositive motion out of time based on their assertions that (1) the ease had been neglected by a previous attorney who had been fired and (2) their motion raised important jurisdictional issues. We cannot say that the district court\u2019s decision to grant the defendants leave to file a dispositive motion out of time under these circumstances constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>See Cozzo v. Tangipahoa Parish Council</em>\u2014President <em>Government, </em>279 F.3d 273, 280 (5th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-15\">Soliz next contends that the district court erred in failing to consider his response and amended response to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss or for summary judgment. Soliz failed to file a response to this motion by the court\u2019s deadline. As previously indicated, Fed. R.Civ.P. 6(b) allows a district court broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>discretion to expand filing deadlines. <em>Hetzel, </em>50 F.3d at 367. Here, after reviewing Soliz\u2019s untimely pleadings, the district court indicated that the pleadings would not have caused it to alter its judgment. As the district court considered Soliz\u2019s untimely pleadings and exercised its discretion in not expanding the time for filing, Soliz\u2019s argument lacks merit. He has failed to meet his burden of proving the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court in appeal No. OS-51445 is</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\n<em>Appeal No. 04-41135</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The district court dismissed Soliz\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action against defendants Patrick Flanigan and Patricia Norton pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e), 1915A and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(c) for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. The court reasoned that Soliz\u2019s claims were barred by the applicable Texas, two-year statute of limitations: Soliz had become aware of the claims on May 23, 2000, but did not file his \u00a7 1983 complaint until July 18, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">The district court\u2019s assessment of the timeliness of Soliz\u2019s complaint against these defendants is correct. In the context of \u00a7 1983, a federal court \u201cborrows\u201d a statute of limitations from the forum state\u2019s general personal-injury limitations provision. <em>Jacobsen v. Osborne, </em>133 F.3d 315, 319 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Owens v. Okure, </em>488 U.S. 235, 249-50, 109 S.Ct. 573, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989). In Texas, that period is two years. <em>Hitt v. Connell, </em>301 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2002). Soliz acknowledges that he learned that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had denied his state habeas application on May 23, 2000. As Soliz became aware that his habeas application had been denied on that date, and the denial was the injury that he alleged, his causes of action accrued at that time. <em>See Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 157 (5th Cir.1999). Thus, Soliz had until May 23, 2002, to file his \u00a7 1983 action, yet did not do so until July 18, 2003. The district court correctly ruled that Soliz\u2019s complaint was time-barred unless the statute of limitations is equitably tolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">As the Texas statute of limitations is borrowed in \u00a7 1983 cases, we also look to Texas\u2019s equitable tolling principles. <em>Rotella v. Pederson, </em>144 F.3d 892, 894 (5th Cir.1998). Texas permits the tolling of a statute of limitations when a plaintiff\u2019s legal remedies are precluded by the pendency of other legal proceedings. <em>Holmes v. Texas A &amp; M Univ., </em>145 F.3d 681, 684-85 (5th Cir.1998). As Soliz has asserted no viable grounds on which the statute of limitations could be tolled, the district court did correctly dismiss his suit against defendants Flanigan and Norton as time-barred. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">Soliz also contends that the district court erred by denying him leave to amend his \u00a7 1983 complaint to add more defendants. Under Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, only with leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party may a party amend his pleadings after a responsive pleading has been served. Rule 15(a) also instructs the court to grant leave to amend freely. Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a). We review a district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend a pleading for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. R\u00edaseos, </em>76 F.3d 93, 94 (5th Cir.1996). \u201cA district court acts within its discretion when dismissing a motion to amend that is frivolous or futile.\u201d <em>Martin\u2019s Herend Imports, Inc. v. Diamond &amp; Gem Trading United States of America Co., </em>195 F.3d 765, 771 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">Soliz\u2019s claims against the putative defendants, like his claims against the initial defendants, are based on the assertion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>that, by failing to provide him with notice of the state habeas corpus proceedings, the putative defendants deprived him of his constitutional rights. Also as with the claims in his initial complaint, Soliz became aware of the basis for his \u00a7 1983 action more than two years before he filed his suit. As the amendments he sought to file were futile, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to amend. See <em>id. </em>at 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Soliz also appealed the district court\u2019s denial of his request for the appointment of counsel. In his brief, Soliz merely notes that the district court denied his request for the appointment of counsel. As Soliz has failed to brief this issue, it is deemed abandoned. <em>See Yokey, 985 </em>F.2d at 224-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court in appeal No. 04-41135 is</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
