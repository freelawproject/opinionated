Cazel and the judgment entered thereon. The other defendants are not involved on this appeal. As in the ease of <em>Solot </em>v. <em>Linch, ante, </em>p. 99 [292 P.2d 887], this case involves the question concerning the controlling statute governing a nonresident motorist\u2019s right to relief from a default taken against him. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7473 or 473a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s action was commenced against respondent and others on June 17, 1953, and within the following three weeks the prescribed service on respondent was completed pursuant to section 404 of the Vehicle Code. Respondent\u2019s default was entered on August 24, 1953, and on May 10, 1954, <em>nunc pro tunc </em>as of May 7, the court entered judgment thereon. On April 29, 1955, respondent filed his notice of motion to set aside the default and vacate the judgment rendered thereon; hearing was had on May 6, and the order granting respondent\u2019s motion was made on May 17, 1955, all of which was well beyond six months after the entry of his default. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 473.) Upon the authority of <em>Solot </em>v. <em>Linch, ante, </em>p. 99 [292 P.2d 887], and for the reasons therein stated, the court was without jurisdiction to set aside the default.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">The order is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">Gibson, C. J., Shenk, J., Carter, J., Traynor, J., Schauer, J., and McComb, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied February 29, 1956.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
