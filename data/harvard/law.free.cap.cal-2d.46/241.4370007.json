(33 Cal.2d 27.) After hearing, the local administrative committee found petitioner guilty as charged and recommended to the board his suspension from practice for four weeks. Petitioner failed to appear before the board and after a consideration of his case, the board made its own findings, which were in substantial agreement with the committee\u2019s but added that the improper \u201cactivities of the lay persons\u201d acting on petitioner\u2019s behalf \u201cwere carried on with [petitioner\u2019s] knowledge, acquiescence and consent and were part of a scheme and design by [petitioner] to solicit professional employment.\u201d The board recommended a six months\u2019 suspension period, with three dissenting on the ground that \u201cthe degree of discipline recommended [was] too severe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">Petitioner, who is 32 years of age, was admitted to practice in January, 1951. He contends that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the board\u2019s findings and that, in any event, its disciplinary recommendation is too severe.  While such findings are not binding on this court, which will itself pass upon the sufficiency and weight of the evidence <em>(Fall </em>v. <em>State Bar, </em>25 Cal.2d 149, 159 [153 P.2d 1]; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>State Bar, </em>39 Cal.2d 161, 165 [246 P.2d 1]), petitioner has the burden of showing wherein the decision of the board is erroneous or unlawful. <em>(Alkow </em>v. <em>State Bar, </em>38 Cal.2d 257, 258 [239 P.2d 871].) He has not met that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">It appears that petitioner improperly solicited professional employment in two instances: one in September, 1953, from Mrs. Loma Porter following injuries to her child as the result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>of an automobile accident; and the other in January, 1954, from Mr. and Mrs. Henry Augustus following injuries to their child, also as the result of an automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">With respect to the first charge, Mrs. Porter testified that about a week after her child was injured, two men called at her home, introduced themselves as investigators, gave her one of petitioner\u2019s professional cards, interviewed her at length about the accident, and had her sign a statement as well as a contract employing petitioner as her attorney but left no copy of either document with her. She further testified that petitioner called upon her about a week later, identified himself as \u201cMr. Higgins\u201d and the two men who had previously visited her as \u201chis investigators\u201d; that she signed another contract with him; that he also interviewed her and took notes with regard to the accident; and that at no time between the interview by the two investigators and petitioner\u2019s visit had she undertaken to communicate with petitioner. Petitioner professed to be unable to remember any of these related events but claimed that he called on Mrs. Porter because a former client had told him of the accident to the Porter child, and that the mother \u201cwanted some legal counsel.\u201d Mrs. Porter denied knowing the person who allegedly gave petitioner her name, and he was not called as a witness at the hearing. The Porter case was handled by petitioner and a settlement was concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">With respect to the second charge, Mrs. Augustus testified that on the day after her child was injured a \u201cMr. Jacobs\u201d and another man came to her home, introduced themselves, one as an attorney and the other as an investigator, had contract blanks with them, had her sign one though she did not remember the attorney\u2019s name on it, told her she should employ Mr. Higgins to handle her case, and gave her about 30 of the latter\u2019s professional cards. She further testified that the next day a man identifying himself as Mr. Higgins telephoned her, told her to take her child to a certain doctor, and cautioned her not to give out any information until he told her; that she thereupon stated to petitioner that she already had a lawyer, whom she named and whom petitioner said that he did not know; that she then described the persons who had called on her the preceding day in petitioner\u2019s behalf, but petitioner disclaimed any knowledge of or connection with them. She also testified that some few days later petitioner came to her home, at which time her lawyer happened to be there; that petitioner talked with her husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>in the front room while she was talking to her lawyer in the kitchen; that petitioner then met her lawyer in the hall, that the two went outside to talk a few minutes, and that she did not see or hear from petitioner again. Mr. Augustus substantially corroborated his wife\u2019s account of the visit by the two men in petitioner\u2019s behalf. He added that they identified themselves as \u201cmembers of Mr. Higgins\u2019 firm,\u201d gave him one of petitioner\u2019s cards, and told him that \u201call references in the case were ... to be referred to [petitioner] \u201d when they had his wife sign an agreement and took notes as to the happening of the accident. Mr. Augustus also corroborated his wife\u2019s account of petitioner\u2019s later visit to their home, adding that petitioner said \u201che came out to discuss the accident with [him] \u201d and that he thereupon gave petitioner a statement because he took it for granted that petitioner was his attorney. Mr. Augustus likewise corroborated his wife\u2019s statement as to petitioner\u2019s meeting with the other lawyer in their home, and that after the conversation between the two, which he did not hear, he did not see petitioner again. The other lawyer testified that he had represented the Augustuses in some prior litigation; that on the day following the accident here in question, Mrs. Augustus telephoned to him, saying that if there were any legal problems involved, she wanted him to handle them; that nothing further was done in the matter until some 10 days later, when he received another call from Mrs. Augustus, wherein she said that \u201csomething funny was happening\u201d in that some other attorney was trying to handle the case, that she wanted him [the witness] to handle the case, and that he thereupon went that evening to the Augustus home, where he met petitioner as previously related by both Mr. and Mrs. Augustus. He further testified that in his conversation with petitioner outside the Augustus home, petitioner stated that he did not know that the Augustuses had an attorney, and that a friend of the Augustuses had referred him to them; and that after some conversation about the doctor whom petitioner had recommended in the case, petitioner left. This lawyer also testified that he then returned to the Augustus home, asked them if they knew the alleged friend whom petitioner had identified as making the reference.of his name to the Augustuses, and that both expressed ignorance of such person.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">At the outset in testifying with respect to this charge, petitioner stated that his uncertainty on many points stemmed from, the fact that a long period of time had elapsed between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the questioned occurrences and the date of his examination in these proceedings (about 10% months), and that he had meanwhile handled a lot of litigation. He then testified that it was his \u201crecollection\u201d that Mrs. Augustus had first called him about the accident (which was directly contrary to the testimony of both Mr. and Mrs. Augustus that petitioner had first called her), and that she asked to see him about the accident. Petitioner testified to his later visit to the Augustus home for the purpose of getting the facts from Mr. Augustus, admitting the private talk between himself and the previously mentioned lawyer, and that he [petitioner], upon being advised of the former\u2019s employment in the ease, left the Augustus home and \u201cforgot about the matter.\u201d Petitioner denied knowing the persons whom the Augustuses described as first coming to their home in petitioner\u2019s behalf. Petitioner also stated that he had always practiced alone; that during the almost three years intervening between his admission to practice and the matters here in question, he had circulated between 7,000 and 8,000 of his professional cards, which number he later called only \u201can estimate,\u201d with the correction that he ordinarily ordered about 500 cards every six months, which he gave to \u201cfriends\u201d and to those who came to his office for legal advice, suggesting that they keep him in mind. When asked about his employment of \u201cinvestigators\u201d at the time here in question, petitioner stated that for the purpose of checking police reports and interviewing witnesses, he had hired various persons, \u201cpart-time people,\u201d who \u201cwould do the work\u201d for him \u201cin the evening after they finished their regular occupations\u201d but he could not recall any of their names. He characterized the whole matter of his investigating requirements as a \u201chit-and-miss affair,\u201d depending on what work had to be done, and sometimes he would \u201cgo out and make the investigation\u201d himself. When asked whether his office records would show the names of the persons he had hired as investigators, petitioner stated that he was \u201cnot sure\u201d because he did not keep records on such matters and usually just paid them in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">From the above summary of the record, it appears that the principal point of conflict in the evidence concerned the matter of whether petitioner had knowledge of the identity of the investigators and whether he had authorized their activities. However, there was abundant credible evidence that in both instances here in question a definite pattern was followed, wherein two men called at the respective homes soon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>after the accidents, interviewed the parents, had them sign contracts, left some of petitioner\u2019s professional cards, and indicated that petitioner would communicate with them later, which he did. While petitioner denied any wrongdoing in these cases, maintaining that the referrals had come to him rather than his initiating the original contacts, his explanations appear vague and unconvincing, coupled with a professed inability to recall any of the essential points in relation to his admitted hiring of investigators as the occasion might demand. Such conduct, evasive testimony and lack of candor are not consistent with the high degree of fidelity to his professional duties owed by petitioner as an attorney at law. <em>(Burns </em>v. <em>State Bar, </em>45 Cal.2d 296, 303 [288 P.2d 514].) Under the circumstances, the record amply supports the board\u2019s finding that in both instances petitioner violated rules 2 and 3 of the Rules of Professional Conduct in the solicitation of professional employment through the use of lay persons, and further justifies the board\u2019s added finding that these lay persons\u2019 activities were carried on with petitioner\u2019s knowledge, acquiescence and consent in pursuance of an established scheme or design.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">While the record thus clearly shows petitioner\u2019s misconduct, there remains the question of the extent to which petitioner should be disciplined. In this connection petitioner claims that so far as he was concerned, no harm or damage was done to the clients in either instance, citing his termination of the Porter case through ultimate settlement (disregarding Mrs. Porter\u2019s stated dissatisfaction with the terms of the contract signed with petitioner) and his withdrawal from the Augustus case as soon as he learned that another lawyer was handling it. He further argues that any wrongdoing that might have occurred in these matters on his part was unintentional, attributable in the main to his inexperience and the \u201cexcitement of a young attorney\u201d at the prospect of obtaining a ease, causing him to overlook - the proprieties in seeking professional employment. He also notes that there is no evidence in the record of any past misconduct on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The controlling question, however, is not whether any harm or damage resulted to the particular clients from petitioner\u2019s handling of their affairs after he had obtained the contracts of employment. The rules which petitioner violated are primarily designed to prohibit unprofessional conduct in obtaining such contracts of employment regardless of the quality of the work which may be performed thereunder. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s conduct in obtaining such contracts appears to have constituted an intentional, flagrant violation of the rules; and under all the circumstances, it further appears that the recommended discipline is appropriate and should not be reduced by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">It is ordered that William Higgins be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months, commencing 30 days after the filing of this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
