Plaintiff William G. Straube is the nephew, and plaintiff Suzanne Gay is the niece, of William Boering Straube, deceased, and each was bequeathed $2,000 by the uncle\u2019s will, and each was awarded that sum by a decree of distribution. Defendant Evelyn Straube is the duly appointed executrix of the deceased\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Before the trial court each side sought summary judgment. The plaintiffs prevailed, and the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Upon appeal to the Appellate Department of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County the judgments were affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">This court ordered these cases transferred to it for hearing and decision upon the certification of said appellate department that such transfer appeared necessary to secure uniformity of decision and to settle an important question of law. (Cal. Rules of Court, rules 62, 63.)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Plaintiffs sue the executrix for legacies awarded them by a decree of distribution. The decree became final more than four years but less than ten years before the complaint was filed.  In opposing motions for summary judgment the question is one of law: What statute of limitations governs this cause of action?</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">The ten-year statute for an \u201caction upon a judgment or decree\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 337.5, subd. 3) will mean judgment for plaintiffs. The defendant will prevail under a three-year or a four-year statute: the three-year statute for an \u201caction upon a liability created by statute\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 338, subd. 1); the four-year statute for an \u201caction upon any . . . obligation or liability founded upon an instrument\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 337, subd. 1); the four year statute for \u201crelief not hereinbefore provided for\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 343).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">The language of the ten-year statute strikes us as being plain enough in favor of the plaintiffs\u2019 contention. We can only conclude that it is its relative clarity that has discouraged litigation and so deprived us of a square precedent. While the executrix\u2019 liability under Probate Code, section 1021, is personal <em>(Rafferty </em>v. <em>Mitchell </em>(1935) 4 Cal.App.2d 491 [41 P.2d 563], and the legatees\u2019 rights stem from the will, the action is based upon the decree. <em>(Wheeler </em>v. <em>Bolton </em>(1880) 54 Cal. 302; <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. of Maryland </em>v. <em>Lindholm </em>(1933) 66 F.2d 56; <em>Elkins </em>v. <em>Bryson </em>(1936) 16 Cal.App.2d 173 [60 P.2d 301].)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Accordingly, the trial court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motions for summary judgment, and the appellate department affirmed. We agree. The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Files, P. J., and Jefferson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied December 14, 1966.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b706-11\"> Assigned by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
