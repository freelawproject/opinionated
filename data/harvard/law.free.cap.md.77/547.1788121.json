By the second paragraph of its certificate of incorporation, it appears that the said corporation so formed is a corporation for social or fraternal beneficial purposes, or both, and to carry out which it shall enact a constitution and laws for its government, which shall prescribe- and define the duties of its officers, its mode of govern-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>merit and methods of conduct, and the various moans whereby it may aim to improve and benefit its members, their families, or those having a legal interest therein. The members of said Order shall convene in assemblies (or local bodies) and shall conduct their operations by and according to the ritual of the Order aforesaid, and in \u25a0conformity with the charter, constitution and laws of the Order at all times.\u201d Upon its organization it adopted a constitution and code of general laws, which clearly outlined the character of business proposed to he conducted by it; section 2, of Article one, of the constitution declaring the object of the Order to he \u201cto benefit, its members morally, intellectually and financially.\u201d Section 4 of the same Article provides, that \u201cone of the purposes of this organization shall be the establishment of a benefit fund for the relief of its members in sickness, \u2022accident or distress, or for their families or heirs in case of their decease, and also to encourage habits of economy and frugality by a provision whereby those of the members of this Order who desire to, shall he allowed to pay into a common fund, which may be distributed at definite intervals succeeding the date of the certificate, which may be written in favor of said member, with this benefit provision or provisions thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">We have carefully examined the methods which have been adopted by the appellant to accomplish the purposes for which it became a body corporate, and we are \u25a0convinced that no hotter estimate could be formed of the manner in which the appellant exercised its corporate powers than by giving <em>in extenso </em>copies of the two policies which it has been issuing to its members. They \u2022constitute, in connection with the terms and conditions thereon written, the ground of controversy in this cause, \u2022and give practical illustration of the methods resorted to by the appellant to further its purposes. They furnish in themselves the evidence which must in great measure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>control us in seeking to determine the character of business the appellant is conducting. They are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">The International Fraternal Alliance oe Balto. City.

No sick benefits shall be paid for rheumatic, gouty or neuralgic complaints, venereal diseases, confinement, abuse of person, chronic diseases, diseases peculiar to women, those caused by reckless exposure, broils or intemperance.

The Order may, at the option of its cabinet, provide a separate form of policy therefor, or it may stamp or endorse in a conspicuous place upon the face of the regular and usual form of policy of the said Golden Cycle Class, the words \u201cthe insured under this policy is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>entitled to maturity benefits only.\u201d In the latter event, then there shall not be due under any such policy either any disability or death benefit, should the insured thereunder become disabled or die during the continuance in force of any such stamped or endorsed policy, except as follows: In the event of the death of the insured under the said stamped or endorsed policy before the completion of any period of maturity, then all payments made on account of the said policy shall be repaid to the beneficiary of the said named, less an equitable portion of the same for expenses incurred thereupon by the Order, or the said beneficiary may carry the same until matured and receive the benefit then due.

[ Seal. ] ---</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARg\"><em>Secretary of the </em>Cabinet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-14\">It was asserted at the argument in this Court and not denied, that such had been the progress made by the appellant within a period of four years, that it now had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>members exceeding eight thousand, and assets in excess of the sum of three hundred thousand dollars. Doubtless its very success called the attention of the State\u2019s officers to it, and suggested an inquiry into its business methods. . At all events, the Attorney-General, by direction of the Governor, (acting under the provisions of sec. 255, of Art. 23 of the Code,) filed in the Supreme Court of Baltimore City, on the first of September, 1892, a petition in the name of the State against the appellant, praying a forfeiture of its charter, and the appointment of receivers, and assigning the following reasons therefor:</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">1st. \u201cThat from an examination of its constitution and general laws, it abundantly appears that said Order is not in any respect a \u2018social organization,\u2019 and that so far as its charter authorizes aud contemplates the organization and administration of a social corporation, the powers \u2022conferred upon it have not been used or exercised at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">2nd. \u201cThat the said corporation, as shown by said constitution and general laws, is not organized for \u2018fraternal beneficial purposes, \u2019 and that in conducting the operations described im said constitution and general laws, it has been from the beginning and is now guilty of both abuser and misuser of its corporate functions, and is carrying on operations without due warrant of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">3rd. \u201cThat the business carried on by said corporation is substantially in the nature of an insurance business, and is being conducted in violation of section 121 of Article 23 of the Code of Public General Laws of this State, title Corporations, and that so far from being operated for beneficial fraternal purposes, as authorized by its charter, its affairs are conducted with a view to profit by its officers and members.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">4th. \u201cThat the scheme, as disclosed by its charter and general laws, and as practically administrated, is an endowment insurance on the assessment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>\"Persons applying to be admitted as members are called on to pay: First, an admission fee, next, monthly dues to the several assemblies to which they respectively belong, and then from time to time assessments as the same are ordered, which are collected through the medium of the several assemblies, and transmitted to the Order to be applied to the payment of benefit certificate holders according to the plans detailed in the constitution and general laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">5th. \"That these certificates are practically and substantially policies of insurance, payable as the case may be, in the event of death or at the expiration of seven years, provided the holders shall not in the meantime have suffered the same to lapse and become forfeited by non-payment of monthly dues and assessments when the latter are called and payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">6th. \"That the business of the corporation is accordingly not a benevolent or beneficial one for fraternal purposes only, but is a speculative one, involving hazard, losses and profits, and conducted with great risk, many contingencies, and without any substantial beneficial feature in it, apart from the element of insurance upon the assessment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">7th. \"It makes loans of its assets, and buys real estate, and in short carries on business transactions for the pecuniary profit of the Order, its officers and members.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">8th. \"That it altogether transcends the powers conferred upon it by its charter, and is exercising corporate functions not authorized by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">On the 12th of September, 1892, the appellant filed its answer to said petition, substantially denying all its material allegations, and claiming that it had strictly complied with the requirements of the law, and fully recognized and discharged its obligations to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">The State then interposed a demurrer to the second and third paragraphs of the appellant\u2019s answer, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>joined issue on the fourth and fifth, so far as the same deny the allegations of the petition, and demurred to the same so far as they might be taken to aver new matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">In' this state of pleadings, the case was submitted for decree, and after argument, the Court, on January 9th, 1893, filed a decree annulling and vacating the charter of the appellant, and adjudging that all its corporate powers and franchises should cease and henceforth be void.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The large number of persons whose interests are involved, as well as the character and magnitude of those interests, have not failed to suggest to the Court, the exercise of patient examination and careful determination of the important question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The defences which the appellant sets up are well summarized in the opinion of Judge Wicks in the Court below:</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">1. A denial that it is doing substantially or otherwise a life or endowment insurance business, and</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">2. That it is exempt from the operation of the law, because of its lodge system and its ritual.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">He further pertinently remarks that, \u201cif it, (the appellant) is not doing a life insurance business \u2018substantially or otherwise,\u2019 there is no necessity to invoke the aid of the Act in its behalf; but if it is, the question must then be considered as to how far this proviso can be relied upon to impart immunity to acts, which otherwise would be unlawful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">Sec. 127 of Art. 23 of the Code, so far as it affects this case, provides as follows: .</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">\u201cAny person, body politic or corporate, partnership or association, who or which shall make, negotiate or solicit within this State any contract of insurance, whether of adult or infant, or by whatsoever title the same may be known, or shall effect an insurance or insurances <em>* </em>* * or shall do any business of insurance of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>kind, or make any guaranty, contract or pledge for the payment of annuities or <em>endowments, </em>or money, whether the amount thereof be fixed or contingent, to the families or representatives of any policy or certificate holder or the like: or shall advertise, or circulate any card, circular, notice, or open or keep any office for the transaction of said business, except an insurance broker duly licensed, without fully complying with all the provisions of this sub-title to this Article, shall be subject, &amp;c. * * * And the term insurance company, as used in this Article, shall be taken to embrace every corporation, association, partnership or individual engaging in such business; and every such corporation, association, partnership or individual making any engagement for the payment of any money or other benefits in the event of sickness, accident or death or other contingency, either to the member, policy or certificate holder, or by whatsoever name the same may be known, or to their families or representatives, * * * shall be deemed and taken to be a life insurance company within the meaning of this Article, and shall be subject to all the requirements of law applicable to said life insurance companies. * * * Provided, also, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to apply to the granting of relief or benefits to members of their families by any societies of a purely or exclusively religious, charitable or benevolent description not operated with a view to a profit by its officers or members; <em>nor to orders or associations having ritualistic work and, ceremonies in their lodges, councils or societies: </em>provided, also, that the business commonly known as industrial insurance, or on the weekly payment plan, shall not be permitted to operate under the guise of privileges of the Orders as exempted in this Article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The \u201cGeneral Laws\u201d of the appellant form part of the evidence in the record. Section one of Article 15, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>said laws provides that there shall he two distinct funds; \u201cthe benefitfund\u201d and \u201cthe general fund.\u201d The former is divided into the reserve, sinking and claims funds; but the same shall be for the exclusive benefit of members of the Order, as hereinafter stated, and there shall be paid therefrom, \u201call sick, accident, endowment, death or disability claims, all bought or cancelled policies, legal expenses incurred directly in defending this fund from alleged fraudulent claims and attorney\u2019s hire and expenses in adding new members to the Order, also necessary fixtures as permanent assets. \u201d The benefit fund consists of the monthly payments made by the members, either of dues or assessments, and is required to be deposited in the corporation name of the appellant, and its securities also shall be so held. The \u201cgeneral fund\u201d consists of \u201call receipts from entrance fees, sale of supplies, <em>per capita </em>tax, fines and other sundry fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Section one of Art. 15 of the General Laws says that, \u201cthe benefit plan of this order is known as the \u2018Golden Cycle Class,\u2019 in contra-distinction to the social or non-beneficial class, and pays benefits as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">A. A weekly benefit of $7.00 upon each certificate in case of sickness.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">B. A death benefit of $80.00 per annum or <em>pro rata </em>thereon for an unexpired portion of the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">C. A maturity (during life) benefit of $700.00 at the end of each 7 years, according to the illustration table hereinbefore set out.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Sec. 5 of Article 7 of the Constitution provides, that \u201cThe Cabinet shall appoint an actuary or accountant to make an estimate of the values of all certificates of membership at various periods of their age, and amounts of collections that may be deemed necessary for the fulfilment of all contracts or certificates of the Order, and order the collection thereof, so that the full sums shall be in the treasury upon the maturity of the same.

Every corporation ought to have a name by which it is recognized, and the business in which it is engaged should be known to the prublic. This can be accomplished by a reasonable compliance with the obligations imposed upon it by the laws of the State. If the appellant had restricted itself to the declared purpose of its charter, and only utilized \u201cthe lodge system and its ritual,\u201d. there would have been no justification for this assault upon its business methods and against its charter. We are fully impressed with the importance of keeping a strict scrutiny upon all matters which relate to the business of insurance. It has grown to such magnitude that its ramifications penetrate to the hearthstone of almost every home in this State, humble though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>it be. It bas, when properly conducted, earned and received the encomiums of almost every Court in the -country. But the business is of that character which requires careful and prudent management, and therefore it is that almost every State in the Union has sought to provide proper safeguards for the protection of the insured, and the regulation of the methods of the insurer. This can only be done by bringing the insurance companies under State supervision, and requiring them to \u2022submit to State regulations under the provisions of law which the legislative departments of the several States have in their wisdom thought just and proper to provide. In this case we have eight thousand interested parties, \u2022doubtless many of whom are possessed of very limited means, and three hundred thousand dollars of assets under the control of a cabinet, whose powers we have already characterized. An examination of the documentary proof in the record, some of which we have thought proper to insert in this opinion, clearly demonstrates that the appellant has, as a leading and prominent feature of its transactions, been and is now illegally engaged in conducting an insurance business. When the case of <em>Goodman, et al. vs. Jedidjah Lodge, No. </em>7, <em>&amp;c., </em>67 <em>Md., </em>127, was before this Court, Mr. Justice Miller, delivering the opinion of the Court, said \u201cBut there is another view that may be taken of the case, so far as the ^endowment sinking fund\u2019 is concerned. In our opinion in the former case we said that the endowment plan (the adoption of which has given rise to the present litigation) was practically a system of mutual or co-operative life insurance. A re-examination of that plan has convinced us of the soundness of this position. Under it a book of endowment certificates was furnished to each subordinate lodge, and one of these certificates was issued to each member; and it stipulated for the payment of $1,000 upon his death to his widow and children, if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>left any, and if not, then to a beneficiary to be designated by him, whose name must appear in the body of the instrument. Such certificates differ in no substantial point from ordinary life insurance policies, issued by ordinary life insurance companies. The death dues and the contributions to the sinking fund are nothing -more nor less than premiums exacted as in ordinary cases by the payment of which the policies are kept alive.\" Ap-\u2019 plying this doctrine to the case under consideration, we think either of the policies in the record, with the conditions thereon written and the restrictions contained in the \u201cgeneral laws\" of the appellant regulating their meaning and controlling their effect, contemplate and create a system of insurance, which the appellant under its charter had no authority to adopt, and the use of which must not be further tolerated. The Court below in a very admirable and elaborate opinion has discussed all of the phases of this question. Speaking of a member insured, the Court says: \u201cHe has all the advantages of those who hold policies in the regular insurance companies, except that this Order pays but a small proportion at death, while the old line companies pay the full amount; but the amount promised to be paid in the event of living and keeping his policy alive is vastly more than the regular companies are able to return. When asked how this\u2019 can be done we are told by \u2018lapses'.and \u2018assessments.' The unfortunate members drop out, the others reap the benefit of what remains in the treasury of the Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">\u201cWhether this scheme can be successfully worked out when, after seven years have passed, the certificates mature, is not the inquiry. But, if it can, in what proper sense can it be called benevolent or beneficial, resting, as it must, for success upon the misfortune of its own members.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The law (section 127, Article 23 of the Code,) forbids \u201cany person, body politic or corporate, partnership or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>association, from effecting\u201d or pretending- to \u201ceffect an insurance or insurances,\u201d or from doing \u201cany business of insurance of any kind, or making any guaranty, contract or pledge for tbe payment of annuities, or <em>endowments, </em>or money, whether the amount thereof be fixed or contingent.\u201d Nor can this be'done by societies of a purely religious, charitable or benevolent character, for the relief or benefit of members of their own families, if it is also done with a view to the profit of its officers or members. But it would be profitless to pursue further the discussion of this question, as we regard it as clear beyond controversy that the appellant has assumed and is now engaged in the exercise of franchises and privileges not allowed by its certificate of incorporation, and is transacting and conducting an insurance business not by law allowed to be assumed or exercised by it. Whilst this is the conclusion we have reached, we are unable to give our assent to the destruction of the charter of the appellant. To strike down Vie charter would be to entail disaster upon a large number of persons, who could but illy afford to encounter such a result. Better far that the appellant be permitted to continue its existence, and resort to the appropriate jurisdiction, by which its insurance business may be adjusted and wound up, with as little costs and expenses as may be, and thereby reduce as much as possible, the loss which will inevitably ensue. The appellant can, by the course suggested, continue the exercise of its authorized powers as a \u201csocial or fraternal beneficial Order or both,\u201d or it may amend its charter under sections T7 and 38, of Article 23 of the Code, and bring itself within the provisions of the insurance laws of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">But it must now confine its operations within the legitimate scope of its undertaking, and carry out in good faith its declared purposes, otherwise it will become the duty of the law officers of the State under section 263, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Article 23 of the Code, to'take such action in the premises as will restrain the appellant, its officers and agents from further transacting an insurance business.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b614-9\">(Decided 21st June, 1893.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">It follows from the views expressed, that the decree-of the Court below, forfeiting the charter of the appellant and appointing receivers to wind up its affairs, must he reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In consequence of the unauthorized assumption and: illegal exercise of franchises not allowed by its charter, the appellant must pay the costs below and upon this-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">\n<em>Decree reversed ; appellant to pay costs as stated.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
