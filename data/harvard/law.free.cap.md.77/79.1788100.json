In an action on the policy, it was Held:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b127-6\">That the proceedings for sale under the power contained in the mortgage showed such a notice of sale under a mortgage or trust deed as was meant by the clause of forfeiture, and the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b127-7\">Appeal from the Court of Common Pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-8\">The case is stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b127-9\">The cause was argued before Alvey, C.

This clause makes the policy void, \u201cif, with the knowledge of the insured, foreclosure proceedings be commenced or notice given of sale of any property covered by this policy by virtue of any mortgage or trust deed.\u201d The defendant\u2019s second prayer presents the defence that the proceedings for sale under the power contained in the mortgage showed such a notice of sale under a mortgage or trust deed as was meant by this clause of forfeiture. It was rejected by the Court and defendant excepted. The language of the policy is clear and distinct and we must give effect to it. The prayer ought to have been granted. As the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action is defeated by the operation of this clause, the judgment must be reversed without a new trial.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b128-6\">(Decided 19th January, 1893.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
