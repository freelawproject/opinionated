Strang was killed in the accident. Booth brought suit against Strang\u2019s administratrix and recovered judgment for $10,000. Execution was issued upon this judgment and there was a return of \u201cNo Effects\u201d. Booth then brought a civil action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (hereinafter called the company) upon an insurance policy issued by the Company to Strang, covering the automobile driven by Strang which caused the accident resulting in the injuries to Booth.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-14\">Booth contended that the policy issued to Strang was a liability policy under which the Company was legally bound to pay the judgment obtained by Booth] against the administratrix of Strang\u2019s estate. The Company contended that the policy covered only loss of, or injury to, Strang\u2019s automobile. Both Booth and the Company filed, under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, motions for summary judgment. The District Court overruled Booth\u2019s motion and granted the motion of the Company. Booth has duly appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-16\">The District Judge, in an opinion filed January 26, 1943, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-17\">\u201cFrom the pleadings, the policy and the rider thereto attached, the admissions on file and the affidavits, the following facts appear:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-18\">\u201cOn July 26, 1941, Charles C. Strang bought a used automobile from the Lawrence Motor Company, and to finance the purchase, borrowed from the Southern Bank &amp; Trust Company $399.35 and gave the Bank a lien on the car. The Bank required Strang to take out insurance on the car for the protection of the lien. For that purpose, only a policy insuring against loss or damage to the automobile was necessary. The Bank did not require a policy protecting Strang against liability for damage done by his automobile to the person or property of others. A policy-clause that insures against all kinds of loss or damage, except damage resulting from an impact of the insured chattel against another object, is called \u2018Comprehensive\u2019; and a clause that insures against damage caused by such impact is called \u2018Collision.\u2019 Strang, in order to comply with the conditions imposed by the Bank that He insure his automobile completely against all forms of loss, damage or destruction, applied to the defendant for \u2018Comprehensive\u2019 and \u2018Collision\u2019 insurance and paid the premiums for those two types of insurance. The defendant issued to him a policy with a rider attached. The rider was issued as a part of the original policy; it was not issued later. The policy period provided in the policy is six months and for terms of six calendar months thereafter. The rider recites: \u2018In consideration of the payment of an additional $18.80, it is agreed that the term of this policy is hereby extended for two terms of six months each.\u2019 On the front page of the policy it is stated that it covered \u2018Liability1 and \u2018Collision.\u2019 On the rider, immediateley above the clause which recites the payment of an additional premium of $18.80, thal-sum is broken down as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-20\">\u2018COMP 4.20</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-21\">$25 DED 14.60\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-22\">\u201cThe rider also contains the following provision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-23\">\u201c \u2018Nothing herein contained shall be held to alter, vary, waive or extend any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>terms, conditions, agreements or limitations of the undermentioned policy other than as hereinabove stated.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Any ambiguity, or lack of clearness, in the policy, if such existed, arose from the fact that by obvious mistake the premium was entered on the first page of the policy under the heading \u201cSection 1, A, Bodily Injury Liability\u201d, instead of under the heading \u201c2 C, Comprehensive\u201d. On this same first page, under the caption \u201cAs stated in endorsement attached\u201d was the symbol \u201cx 330\u201d, and this same symbol, \u201cx 330\u201d appeared at the bottom of the rider.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">We agree with the District Court that the policy and contemporaneous rider, when construed together as a single contract, in the light oi the uncontradicted affidavits as to the facts surrounding the issuance of the policy, show clearly that the coverage of the policy extended only to \u201cComprehensive\u201d and \u201cCollision \u2014 $25 Deductible\u201d insurance, and not to \u201cBodily Injury Liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">The expressions on the top of the rider: \u201cCOMP 4.20\u201d and \u201c$25 DED 14.60\u201d contain no real ambiguity, when read in connection with the policy. By the rider, the policy was extended for iwo terms of six months each. \u201cCOMP\u201d could, in this connection, mean only \u201cComprehensive\u201d. \u201c$25 DED\u201d could mean only \u201c$25 Deductible\u201d in connection with collision insurance. The premiums for the two extensions of six months each would naturally and normally be twice the amount of the premiums for the original term of six months set out on the first page of the policy. $4.20 is just twice the specified premium of $2.10, entered by obvious mistake under the caption \u201c1 A Bodily Injury Liability\u201d, instead of under the caption \u201cC Comprehensive\u201d; $14.60 is just twice the premium of $7.30 entered likewise under the caption \u201cG Collision \u2014 Deductible\u2014 Actual cash value less $25.00 deductible\u201d. It is conceded that the premium charged is far less than the minimum fixed by Virginia law for liability insurance. We think it is unnecessary to add anything further to the opinion of the District Judge on this point. If there be any ambiguity here (we think there is not), parol, extrinsic evidence would seem to be admissible to explain the ambiguity. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Justis, 168 Va. 158, 190 S.E. 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Two other defenses were raised by the Company: (1) If the policy grants liability coverage, the <em>policy is </em>illegal and unenforceable, because the minimum premiums prescribed by the law of Virginia were not paid; (2) Booth cannot recover against the Company because no judgment \u25a0has been obtained against the insured. Strang, since the judgment was obtained against Strang\u2019s administratrix. The District Court found <em>it </em>unnecessary to pass upon these two defenses; we feel there is no occasion for us to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
