As to the discharge, the usual conflict arose whether it was due to the employee\u2019s union activities or to her insubordination; it was possible to find either way. The first objection, being to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the Board\u2019s findings, is without merit; there was \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence, which it will serve no purpose to set out in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-23\">The discharged employee at the time of the hearing had obtained employment which she preferred to reinstatement with the respondents. However, she had been employed upon a probationary period of two months which had not then quite expired. The order directed the respondents to reinstate her with back pay if she applied within five days after the order issued, and if she did not, to pay her any loss of wages from her discharge until she got the new j'ob. The respondents are not content with this, because her new job was at a higher wage than she had earned with them. As we understand it, they wish to be credited with the excess from the time of her new employment until the date of the order, or at least until she declared for reinstatement. If the employee had demanded reinstatement she would have had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>to credit all that she had earned, because the order would then have restored her to the same position she would have been in, had she been continuously employed. But when she was not reinstated, the wrong so far as it can be measured in dollars ceased as soon as she began to earn as much elsewhere. The respondents were no more entitled to any part of her wages during the probationary period than thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">The respondents also object to the order because of its breadth, invoking National Labor Relations Board v. Express Publishing Co., 312 U.S. 426, 61 S.Ct. 693, 85 L.Ed. 930. We have discussed this question in National Labor Relations Board v. Standard Oil Co., 2 Cir., 138 F.2d 885, handed down herewith, to which we refer.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">An enforcement order may pass.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
