The application alleges that a similar application to the district court denied him the right so to proceed because his appeal lacked the merit required also by \u00a7 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-17\">The permission to appeal rests with the court in which was commenced the proceeding in which the appeal is sought. Cf. Steffler v. United States, 319 U.S. 38, 41, 63 S.Ct. 948, 87 L.Ed. 1197; Stanley v. Swope, 9 Cir., 99 F.2d 308; Kelly v. Johnston, 9 Cir., 99 F.2d 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-18\">The application is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
