The indictment contained seven counts, the first six of which charged the substantive offense of sedition, while count <em>7 </em>charged a conspiracy to commit such substantive offense. A motion for new trial was allowed as to Mecartney and the cause dismissed as to him. Judgment was renr dered against Hartzel and Soller, who have perfected separate appeals. They may both be appropriately disposed of in one opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-17\">The substantive counts are predicated upon three pamphlets, entitled \u201cThe British: An Inferior Breed\u201d; \u201cThe Jew Makes A Sacrifice: Forthcoming Collapse of Amer-ica\u201d; and \u201cThe Diseased Spinal Cord.\u201d In all of such counts, it is charged that the defendants prepared, published and distributed such pamphlets throughout the United States, while the United States was at war. Counts 1, 3 and 5 alleged that by such action the defendants wilfully and knowingly obstructed the recruiting and enlistment service of the United States, and counts 2, 4 and 6 that the defendants wil-fully and knowingly did cause and attempt to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny and refusal of duty in the military and naval forces of the United States,- and that the defendants well knew that said pamphlets would produce the result complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-18\">It perhaps would serve no good purpose to set forth all these pamphlets in their entirety, and certainly it would unduly lengthen this opinion. The one entitled \u201cThe British: An Inferior Breed\u201d is in question and answer form, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-19\">\n<em>\u201cAre they degenerate?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-20\">\u201cPlainly. Never again shall they be permitted to <em>try to </em>bring the slinking death of starvation to Europe, squealing hysterically as they do so about \u2018freedom\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-21\"><em>\u201cWhat is the present position of our \u2018protectors\u2019, </em>proclaimed saviors of Poland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-22\">\u201cNow on the lease-lend dole, they are a kept woman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-23\">\n<em>\u201cAre they a cultured people?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-24\">\u201cStanding as an outpost to the continent of Europe, they are a parasite on its art, science and civilization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-25\">\n<em>\u201cIn wlmt way are they kept flying?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-26\">\u201cThe Germans keep \u2019em flying wherever they find them. They run at the mouth as well as the bowels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-27\">\n<em>\u201cWill the British Isles be policed?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-28\">\u201cIt will be unnecessary. When <em>the </em>people upon whom they are fastened withdraw their support, they will collapse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-29\">\n<em>\u201cWhat is the new blasphemy?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-30\">\u201cMaking Christianity a slimy thing for those who crawl and creep by an island breed which \u2014 possessed of an empire obtained by aggression \u2014 points the finger of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>guilt at others. They are now fighting for Christ with bloody Joe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\"><em>\u201cWho betrayed America </em>to the empire of the British-Jewish yellow race?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">\u201cRosenfeldt. We are victims of his In-fantilism; he cannot stand alone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\"><em>\u201cAre Jews rushing forward to war </em>after urging you to crush \u2019em?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">\u201cNo. But when America is exhausted they, as in Russia, will slither forth to sink their fangs into its body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">\n<em>\u201cAre Americans united?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-10\">\u201cYes. Externally with the corpus of a degenerate empire: internally with the sick body of \u2018our leader.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-11\">\n<em>\u201cWhat is behind, the doctrine of \u2018no appeasement??</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-12\">\u201cThe fear of aggression on the bloated domains of an empire which cannot stand alone;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-13\">\u201cThe inhuman cruelty of America\u2019s first blood soaked boom;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-14\">\u201cThe rumble of world revolution \u2014 a repercussion of its indecencies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-15\">\u201cThe effort of the Jew \u2014 vicious persecutor of peoples \u2014 to save himself ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-16\">\u201cThe disease of a Paralytic who wants to be a hero as compensation for his ailment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-17\">\u201cThe beginning of insanity as the masses of the so-called \u2018democracies\u2019 are led toward the destruction of Europe, homeland of the West.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-18\">\n<em>\u201cWhy was Pearl Harbor evidence of justice?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-19\">\u201cWhile trying to save a yellow race in the Atlantic we were hit a deadly blow by a yellow race in the Pacific. Like a cow hit on the head by a hammer when led to slaughter, we now follow \u2018our leader\u2019 as he moves forward on a sick spine to war.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-20\">The pamphlet entitled \u201cThe Jew Makes A Sacrifice: The Forthcoming Collapse of America\u201d is in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-21\">\u201cOur blood soaked boom of the first World War was followed by a speculative orgy, then collapse. A similar maladjustment now seeks an outlet in another blood soaked boom which will end as before. In all of this the Jew \u2014 oriental hyphenated American, propagandist for bloody Joe and the British (Jewish) empire \u2014 has been an eager participant. Indeed, like a snake forced from its nest, the slimy blood lust of the \u2018holy people\u2019 now stands revealed\u2014 for is it not evident that the Jew hates bloodshed only when his own skin is in danger? * * * Today, in fact, almost any crime may be committed in his name in connection with fine words such as \u2018freedom\u2019. How else justify blood soaked booms; attempts to starve Europe by blockade; an alliance with bloody Joe; and the massing of enormous quantities of men and materials with which to \u2018crush\u2019 the Germans \u2014 except by offsetting the degeneracy of such acts by declaring them to be dictated by the \u2018spirit\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-25\">\u201cThe oriental Japanese struck at Port Arthur, in 1904, and at Pearl Harbor while negotiating. The Jew does not have their manfulness for open warfare, but he will \u2014while conserving his own blood \u2014 eventually strike those with whom he lives in the back. He is now infiltrating into Government jobs under cover of \u2018no race prejudice\u2019. He is, in fact, \u2018dying\u2019 for the coming of bolshevism by making ready for your collapse. After many of the young men of America are killed \u2014 when the sick, the exhausted, the cunning remain \u2014 then he will, as in Russia, crawl from his nest. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-26\">The pamphlet entitled \u201cThe Diseased Spinal Cord\u201d is in part as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-27\">\u201cWilson died an invalid; Roosevelt became president one. What is the social significance of his condition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-28\">\u201cA clue is given in the statement that syphilis is \u2018the result of an illness of moral, social and racial instincts\u2019 of which prostitution is an integral part. Similarly the breakdown of Wilson after the \u2018peace\u2019 was probably connected with reactions from the emotional debauchery of preceding years. It is, therefore, suggested that the epidemic of paralysis in New York State at a later time had a source in the weakening of nervous systems, brought about by the emotional self-masturbation of stories of the \u2018bad\u2019 Germans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-29\">\u201cOur leader \u2014 safe in Washington \u2014 escaped the actual horrors of war, but he could not escape the virus of a child\u2019s disease. As with syphilis his paralysis is indicative of severe maladjustments within the nation. He reproduces within his body our internal breakdown; he is in fact a degenerate who now seeks ways of having us cure him of his ailment. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-30\">\u201cHidden within the present program to save humanity are germs of infantilism, paralysis and death. For we now follow, not a little child, but a man with a child\u2019s disease. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>\u201cCrush my enemies screams Jewry; be bold; take the offensive; we\u2019ll back you up. We\u2019re fighting for freedom says our leader, with his sick body coiled around the brain as with a snake prepared to strike. We\u2019re fighting to save Poland say the British hysterically; we hate other peoples aggression.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\">\u201cAmerica was betrayed. The butchery, misery and death they would take to Germany must now, if necessary, be returned upon ourselves by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">\u201cA stench from rotting carcasses of those who would again invade Europe;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">\u201cStarvation for millions of British who thought they could starve others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">\u201cDissolution from an internal war of race against race;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">\u201cOccupation by foreign troops until we are able to stand alone; and at last</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-9\">\u201cThe appointment of a bedside cabinet to investigate the condition of (Rosenfeld) our leader.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">That defendant Hartzel was the author of these pamphlets, and sent several hundred of them through the United States mail, is not disputed. There were also introduced as bearing upon the question of intent and purpose numerous other articles and pamphlets of the same general tenor, prepared and circulated by him prior to the entry of the United States into the present war.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">Both Hartzel and Soller urgently insist that the proof failed to present a jury question and that the court erred in its refusal to direct a verdict in their favor. In deciding this question, we need not consider the proof as it pertains to each count of the indictment for the reason that the judgment could have been imposed upon any of,the substantive counts. If the proof is sufficient to sustain any count, an affirmance is required. Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616, 619, 40 S. Ct. 17, 63 L.Ed. 1173. It follows, therefore, that we need not discuss defendants\u2019 argument that the proof fails to show a successful accomplishment of the alleged objectives. Counts 2, 4 and 6 charge the defendants with an \u201cattempt to cause, insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, and refusal of duty in the military and naval forces of the United States.\u201d Whatever room there may be for difference of opinion as to whether an accomplished result must be proved when alleged, there seems little, if any, merit in the contention that such proof is required to sustain an attempt to cause such result.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">It is argued that the publications in controversy were permissible as free speech, guaranteed by the Constitution. Certainly free speech is not an empty privilege, even during a time of war, but on the other hand, the right is not without limitation. As was said by the court in Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52, 39 S.Ct. 247, 249, 63 L.Ed. 470: \u201cThe most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic.\u201d Location of the boundary line -between that which is privileged and that which is restrained is ofttimes difficult to determine. Generally, it must be found from the character of the utterance, in connection with the time, place and manner of its making. As was said in the Schenck case, supra, 249 U.S. at page 52, 39 S.Ct. at page 249, 63 L.Ed. 470: \u201cThe question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree. When a nation is at war many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight and that no Court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">A charge of attempt to accomplish that which Congress has proscribed must depend upon intent or. motive, and ordinarily presents a jury question. As was said by the court in Pierce v. United States, 252 U.S. 239, 249, 40 S.Ct. 205, 209, 64 L. Ed. 542: \u201cIf its probable effect was at all disputable, at least the jury fairly might believe that, under the circumstances existing, it would have a tendency to cause insubordination, disloyalty, and refusal of duty in the military and naval forces of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">And again, the court on the following page stated: \u201cWhat interpretation ought to be placed upon the pamphlet, what would be the probable effect of distributing it in the mode adopted, and what were defendants\u2019 motives in doing this, were questions for the jury, not the court, to decide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-16\">It is true, as pointed out by the defendants, that in the Pierce case, as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>as in some of the other cases in which the Supreme Court has announced a similar rule, the alleged seditious pamphlets or speeches contain some direct reference or appeal to those eligible for or actually engaged in the military service. No doubt in such instances the intent or motive is more readily apparent. We are of the view, however, that the test enunciated by the Supreme Court as to what constitutes a seditious utterance is not to be limited merely to those cases where a direct appeal is made. If the condemned utterance is reasonably calculated to produce the proscribed result, the purpose and motive is within the province of a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Defendant Hartzel stated his motive thus: \u201cFinally, the prime motive which impelled me in writing and distributing the articles discussed above, was the hope that they might tend to create sentiment against war amongst the white races and in diverting the war from them, to unite the white races against what I consider to be the more dangerous enemies, the yellow races.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">It is inconceivable that his defamatory statements concerning the President, the British or the Jews, could have created any sentiment against war or have been any aid in uniting the white against the yellow races. It is equally inconceivable that the attacks were made with any such motive. It is likewise inconceivable that any purpose was sought to be achieved consistent with the welfare of the country. On the other hand, it is entirely reasonable to believe that the purpose was to interfere with the successful prosecution of the war. It must be assumed, we think, that Hartzel expected those who read his pamphlets to accept their contents as the truth; otherwise, there could have been no purpose in their circulation. Certainly it cannot be reasonably insisted that the defamatory and vicious attack made upon the President of the United States, the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces of the nation, if believed as the defendant Hartzel expected, would not seriously affect, if not destroy, the morale of the nation, both the civilian and the military. With the morale thus destroyed, insubordination, disloyalty and mutiny would be the inevitable result. Publications concerning the British and the Jews, if believed, would no doubt produce a similar result.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">It may be, we hope it is a fact, that there are few if any persons in this country so naive as to place any credence m the articles complained of, and it may be that no great harm resulted from their publication. Assuming such to be the case, Hartzel is not relieved of attempting to do that which Congress has proscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Even though an intent is the gist of the offense, it is not necessary that such intent be shown by direct proof. It is to be gathered from the defendants\u2019 acts, together with the surrounding facts and circumstances. We see no reason why the intent in a case of the instant character may not be found in the same manner as in any other case where it is an essential element. If a person deliberately shoots at another without reason or excuse, he would be guilty of an assault with intent to kill. We suppose that if he deliberately fired a gun into an assembly of people, all of whom were strangers, he likewise would be guilty of an assault with intent to kill any person who might be injured. It is a familiar rule of law, and we think applicable in the instant case, that a person who acts in reckless disregard of the rights of others is liable for the consequences of such acts. Under such circumstances, he is presumed to intend that which is calculated to result from his act. \u201cMen must be held to have intended, and to be accountable for, the effects which their acts were likely to produce.\u201d Abrams v. United States, supra, 250 U.S. at page 621, 40 S.Ct. at page 19, 63 L.Ed. 1173. We are of the view that a jury question was presented as to Hartzel, especially under counts 2, 4 and 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">As to the defendant Soller, a different situation is presented. If the judgment against him is affirmed, it must be solely upon the ground that he mimeographed the alleged seditious pamphlets. The proof discloses that Soller first met Hartzel in March or April of 1941, when the latter came to his office and made inquiry as to the price of mimeographing, in which business Soller was engaged. On three occasions, Soller mimeographed pamphlets from manuscripts furnished by Hartzel. He charged and was paid his usual compensation for such work. There is no proof that Soller at any time prior to doing the work was advised or had knowledge of the use to which the pamphlets were to be put by Hartzel. True, after the third and last lot of pamphlets had been delivered to Hartzel, Soller became suspicious and upon inquiry learned from Hartzel that the pamphlets were being sent through the mail. Soller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>as a witness even denies that he had knowledge of the contents o'f the pamphlets, except as to certain words which attracted his attention as they were being mimeographed. Incredible as this may sound on its face, a reading of his testimony furnishes support to the plausibility of such statement. At any rate, there is no proof as to his knowledge. A few minor circumstances relied upon by the government are without significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">We are of the view and so hold that the proof was not sufficient to present a jury question as to Soller and that he was entitled to a directed verdict. What we have said applies to the conspiracy as well as the substantive counts. The proof fails to show an agreement between these two defendants or that they were acting in concert or in a conspiracy, as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Complaint is also made of the court\u2019s charge as it pertains to the matter of intent. What we have said on that subject largely disposes of the criticism and we shall not discuss it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The proof being sufficient to present a jury question on some of the counts as to the defendant Hartzel, the judgment as to him is affirmed. As to the defendant Sol-ler, it is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
