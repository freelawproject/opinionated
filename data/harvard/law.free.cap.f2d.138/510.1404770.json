The jury at first returned a verdict fixing in one sum the total value. The Judge required them to separate the items and \u2018 make separate verdicts. ' This was done without substantial change in the total. This separation was proper and not erroneous. We do not find the charge as a whole confusing, as is objected against it. No other errors in the trial are specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
