That finding alone is sufficient to justify the order so far as it forbids the continuation of such activities. The discharge of the four employees depended upon the respondent\u2019s motive and necessarily rested upon inference. They had all been active in the organization of the union,' and they were all discharged a few days after they began to agitate to that end. The testimony would have permitted an inference contrary to the finding, but certainly did not demand one, once the credibility of the Board\u2019s witnesses is \u25a0 conceded. It is curious that after the repeated decisions of the courts the Board\u2019s findings should continue to be challenged when that is the situation. Indeed, in the case at bar even upon the bare record it seems to us extremely probable that the findings were right.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-13\">The respondent objects to the general injunction in the order forbidding it to interfere \u201cin any other manner\u201d with the rights guaranteed its employees under section seven of the act, alleging that this is contrary to th.e decision of the Supreme Court in National Labor Relations Board v. Express Publishing Co., 312 U.S. 426, 61 S.Ct. 693, 85 L.Ed. 930. We have discussed this point in National Labor Relations Board v. Standard Oil Company, 138 F.2d 885, handed down herewith, to which we refer.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-14\">The respondent also complains that the words, \u201cnet earnings,\u201d may be construed to cover only actual net earnings, and not those which the employee might with reasonable diligence have earned. This phrase in our order will be understood to have the meaning which the Supreme Court put upon it in Phelps-Dodge Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 313 U.S. 177, 197-200, 61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. 1271, 133 A.L.R. 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-15\">The enforcement order may pass.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
