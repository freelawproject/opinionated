If its method did not clearly reflect its income, the Commissioner was right in allocating to the taxpayer the method under which the deficiency was assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">Substantially all of the taxpayer\u2019s income was derived from the rental of farm lands owned by it in Florida. Its rental contracts were for a crop year, approximately from October to May; and its fiscal year for tax purposes was from July 1st to June 30th. Other than normal overhead, its principal business expense was for the maintenance and operation of an elaborate system of ditches, dams, locks, and pumps, by means of which the lands were protected against flood and drought.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-14\">During the tax year here involved the taxpayer collected $18,911.76 in cash as advance payments of rental for the next crop year. In accordance with its bookkeeping practice, this sum was credited to an account styled \u201cdeposits for future rent\u201d, and when the leases were signed in the succeeding fiscal year the sum was credited to \u201crental income\u201d. Tax returns were made on the accrual basis, but the $18,911.76 was not reported as income until the fiscal year ending in June, 1938. Expenses incurred in the operation and maintenance of the drainage and irrigation system were allocated to the crop year in which the benefits of the expenses were realized, irrespective of the fiscal year in which the expenditures were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-15\">In all cases where advance rentals were paid but no lease subsequently was signed, the rent payments were refunded; but in all cases of advance rental payments the taxpayer had unfettered dominion and control over the use and disposition of the money. The taxpayer contends that its method of bookkeeping, in that it accounted for income in the fiscal year it was actually earned and deducted therefrom such expenses as were incurred in the earning thereof, reflected its actual net earnings more clearly than would any other method.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-16\">The difficulty of this position is that Section 41, supra, required that the method of accounting should clearly reflect income, not net earnings. In Brown v. Helvering, where the taxpayer was on the accrual basis, it was held that money received without restriction upon its use and disposition by the recipient was income in the year received, even though it was received before it was earned and some portion of it might have to be refunded in the future.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-17\">Since the advance rentals were income when received in the fiscal year ending in June, 1937, and since the taxpayer\u2019s bookkeeping method for reporting income did not take cognizance thereof, it is apparent that the method of accounting of the taxpayer did not clearly reflect its income. The Tax Court so held, and its decision is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-10\"> 26 U.S.C.A.
