No request was made by the petitioner for the issuance of a subpoena to any witness. On the contrary, he advised the Court that he desired to have only Hickey as a witness. The case was called for trial and nothing was said by the petitioner to the Court as to a desire to procure other witnesses until after the trial of the case was in full progress. The Court thereupon properly ruled that the request had come too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-27\">The mere writing of a letter to an Assistant United States Attorney requesting him to direct the jailer to allow a prisoner to use the long distance telephone in order to communicate with a prospective witness in another State and the non-action by the Assistant United States Attorney on the request falls far short of being a denial of due process for the procuration of defendant\u2019s witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-28\">The judgment of the Court below in discharging the writ and remanding the petitioner to the custody of the Warden is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
