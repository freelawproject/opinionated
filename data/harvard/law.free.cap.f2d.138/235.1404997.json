Bankers Trust Co., 318 U.S. 163, 63 S.Ct. 515, 87 L.Ed. -, decided by the Supreme Court on February 8, 1943, in which the Supreme Court said this Court erred in holding I hat the maximum fixed by the Commission is, in all circumstances, binding and unalterable.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-27\">It further appears that after the appellants had filed objections to the report of the Commission, the District Court refused to examine the evidence on the theory that no matter what the evidence showed, the court was powerless to set aside the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-28\"><em> </em>Since the proceedings and orders of a bankruptcy court are interlocutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>until entry of the discharge, Meyer v.
