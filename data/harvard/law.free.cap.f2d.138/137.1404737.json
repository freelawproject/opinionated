Validity of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-28\">The invalidity of the Act is urged upon two bases: (A) its inherent invalidity and (B) its invalidity as applied to the fact situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-29\">(A) <em>Inherent Invalidity. </em>This attack is made upon each of the three here involved sections 9, 10 and 11. These sections, hereinafter set forth, have to do with the overthrow of the Government by force, the advocacy of insubordination, etc., in the armed forces, and conspiracies to effect either such overthrow or such insubordination.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>We agree with appellants that, in approaching the problem of validity of a statute, which appears on its face to limit exercise of a right specifically protected by the Constitution, a presumption of validity is narrowed in its scope. Schneider v. State, 308 U.S. 147, 161, 60 S.Ct. 146, 84 L.Ed. 155; United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152, 58 S.Ct. 778, 82 L.Ed. 1234. In truth, \u201ccourts should be astute to examine the effect of the challenged legislation\u201d where it affects the exercise of those fundamental individual rights expressly protected by the Constitution. Schneider v. State, 308 U.S. 147, 161, 60 S.Ct. 146, 84 L.Ed. 155. Here the challenge is that this Act abridges the freedom of speech specifically protected by the First Amendment. Therefore, we approach the problem with the attitude just stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"> Appellants state that \u201cThis statute must seek its validating force in the vague and undefined \u2018right of self-preservation\u2019.\u201d No such extremity exists. The statute is grounded upon specific Constitutional grants of power. The Preamble, setting forth the purposes of the Constitution, includes to \u201cinsure domestic Tranquility\u201d and to \u201cprovide for the common defence\u201d, as well as to \u201csecure the Blessings of Liberty.\u201d Article I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1 specifically grants to Congress the power to \u201cprovide for the common Defence.\u201d Clauses 12 to 16 grant the specific powers \u201cto raise and support Armies,\u201d \u201cto provide and maintain a Navy,\u201d \u201cto make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces,\u201d and covering the Militia. Clause 18 grants the power \u201cTo make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers.\u201d Article IV, \u00a7 4 is \u201cThe United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion\u201d and, upon application, \u201cagainst domestic Violence.\u201d Thus, the Constitution expresses clearly the thoughts that the life of the Nation and of the States and the liberties and. welfare of their citizens are to be preserve^ and that they are to have the protection of armed forces raised and maintained by th Hnited States with power in Congress vpass all necessary and proper laws to rai^e, maintain and govern such forces.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The serious penalties of the Act are suggested as bearing upon our consideration. If the extent of penalties has any bearing, it is purely as make-weight. If the Act is invalid, it must be because of other reasons. If it be valid, the penalties to be assessed for violation are solely matters of legislative selection so long as they do not transcend the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">In addition to the above examined contentions which appellants urge to the Act in general, they make various specific attacks upon sections 9, 10 and 11 separately. We next examine these attacks upon the separate sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\"><em>Section </em>9<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> makes it a crime \u201cto advise, counsel, urge, or in any manner cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty by any member of the military or naval forces\u201d or \u201cto distribute any written or printed matter\u201d doing these things, \u201cwith intent to interfere with, impair, or influence the loyalty, morale, or discipline\u201d of such forces.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">As preliminary to an attack upon this section, appellants recognize the similarity of this section to a part of section 3 of the Espionage Act of June 15, 1917, 40 Stat. 219, 50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 33, which has been upheld (Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 39 S.Ct. 247, 63 L.Ed. 470; Frohwerk v. United States, 249 U.S. 204, 39 S.Ct. 249, 63 L.Ed. 561; Debs v. United States, 249 U.S. 211, 39 S.Ct. 252, 63 L.Ed. 566), and, therefore, the necessity of avoiding here the effect of those decisions upon that Act. They rightly urge that this portion of the Espionage Act, by its express terms, was limited to periods when this country might be at war; and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>above decisions must be construed, as ruling authority, with that situation in mind. Also, they rightly contend that this section 9 is, by its terms, also applicable to a state of peace. Therefore, they urge that such decisions are not here applicable and that whether section 9 is valid or not is not ruled by these authorities. We agree that these three cases do not rule this case as direct decisive authorities. The situation her&lt; that section 9 applies to a peace status/ai well as to war and that the conspirar claimed here was during time of peace suf ciently differentiates those cases to prevenjt them from ruling these appeals. The q iesv tion of validity of section 9 is, in that reA spect, open. On the other hand, it doesv not follow that those cases contain \\no expressions which are useful guides for determining the character of questions present here simply because the situation dealt with in those cases was different from that here present. In this connection, a pertinent matter should be stated. Although there had long been a seditious conspiracy Act, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6, there was a situation in 1940 which impressed Congress with the need for this Act. That situation, known to all, was the existence of war in Europe; the apprehension that this country might be drawn into war; the knowledge of the effective use of \u201cfifth column\u201d activities by countries which might be our enemies; and the apprehension that such activities were being or might be used in this country. In stating the purposes of the Bill, it was said in the House: \u201cThe officers testified before our committee that they were loath to ask for this provision in peacetime but that conditions had become worse, that propagandists were now gaining a foothold ta some extent among the enlisted men of our Army and Navy, and that but for the high character and splendid loyalty that has always obtained among the rank and file of our men they would have had to ask for the enactment of this bill much sooner. So, then, title I interdicts the exertion of subversive influences with the intent to undermine the loyalty, morale, or discipline of our fighting men.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Thus, while this Act is applicable to peace as well as war conditions, it was enacted on the brink of war and to correct existing dangers.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The vital necessity of armed forces to maintain the National and the State governments and the liberties of the citizens is expressly recognized and provided for in the Constitution. The lack of such in the Confederation was one of the cardinal reasons for calling the meeting which became the Constitutional Convention. Congressional enactments having the purposes of raising or maintaining armed forces have high standing because of their importance^ <em>fAt </em>the same time, they must not limit the constitutionally protected individual liberties of the citizen to any greater extent than is reasonably necessary and proper to accomplish the important allowable ends of preserving the life of the Government and the States and their orderly conduct. An armed force which lacks loyalty, morale or discipline or wherein is insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny or refusals to do their duty is far worse than no armed force at all and is positively an active menace to constituted government and to the liberties of the people. Therefore, the question here is whether this section of this Act goes so far beyond what is necessary or proper to effectuate its obviously necessary and proper purposes as to infringe upon protected individual rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The argument against validity of this section is as follows. That the threat to free speech arises from the provisions as to (1) what may not be said or written, (2) as to whom it may not be said or written, and (3) as to the extent to which the motives behind the statement or writing affect the verdict. (1) As to what may not be expressed, the argument centers around the statutory expression \u201cor <em>in any manner cause </em>insubordination\u201d (italics added), etc. It is urged that this expression is so broad that it includes \u201cvirtually the entire range of civilian expression\u201d since it covers \u201cany utterances whose effect upon any member of the armed forces may be to sow doubts in his mind concerning his duty\u201d even if the forces were not mentioned therein; that such expressions could consist merely of \u201copinion concerning our defense policy, the conduct of the defense program, the nature of our allies, or any other important political or economic problem\u201d; that such expression need not urge or suggest refusal of duty but be such merely as to cause him to wonder or doubt the accuracy of statements by his superior officers or the wisdom of governmental policies. (2) As to whom such expressions may not be made, the argument is that the provision includes utterances to civilians, if they \u201clater reach, or conceivably might reach, or influence, actual members of the armed forces\u201d; that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>is no requirement that the utterances be made \u201cdirectly\u201d to members of the forces. (3) As to the extent to which motives affect the verdict, the argument is that \u201ca wicked intent can always be inferred from the nature of the words, if the jury considers those to be objectionable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The fatal weakness in the above arguments arises from the situation that they do not examine the section as a unit but seek to dissect it and destroy it piecemeal. This method avoids or slurs over the governing consideration which runs throughout. That is the intent with which the expressions are made. Intent is the cardinal characteristic and vehicle which is necessary to carry any and all interdicted expressions across the boundary line into crime. This is merely an instance of usual criminal law which protects society from evildoers when they do acts \u2014 otherwise innocent \u2014 with intent to harm. Thus a man may even kill another and he may be entirely unblamed or he may be executed, dependent solely upon the intent motivating the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Another consideration is that words used must be capable of bringing about the forbidden result, since one cannot be found guilty \u201cfor advocacy of any of his opinions unless the words used had as their natural tendency and reasonably probable effect to obstruct the recruiting service, etc. [here create insubordination, etc.], and unless the defendant had the specific intent to do so in his mind\u201d. Debs v. United States, 249 U.S. 211, 216, 39 S.Ct. 252, 254, 63 L.Ed. 566; Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52, 39 S.Ct. 247, 63 L.Ed. 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">While what has been stated in the two paragraphs preceding has to do with the protection thrown around persons accused of any crime, it is apposite to the issue and has a very direct application to the question of validity here. Neither by terms nor fair intendment does this section limit expressions of opinion or of criticisms of the Government or of its policies (civil or military) or of any officials or officers (civil or military) or of their actions so long as such expressions are not made with intent to bring about the unlawful things and situations covered by the section and, in addition, so long as they do not have a natural tendency and a reasonable probability of effecting these forbidden results. Section 9 is not inherently invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\"><em>Section 10 </em>is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">\u201c\u00a7 10. Same [Subversive activities];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">advocating overthrow of government by force</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-10\">\u201c(a) It shall be unlawful for any person\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">\u201c(1) to knowingly or willfully advocate, abet, advise, or teach the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or violence, or by the assassination of any officer of any such government ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-12\">\u201c(2) with the intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any government in the United States, to print, publish, edit, issue, circulate, sell, distribute, or publicly display any written or printed matter advocating, advising, or teaching the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or violence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-13\">\u201c(3) to organize or help to organize any society, group, or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow or destruction of any government in the United States by force or violence; or to be or become a member of, or affiliate with, any such society, group, or assembly of persons, knowing the purposes thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-14\">\u201c(b) For the purposes of this section, the term \u2018government in the United States\u2019 means the Government of the United States, the government of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, the government of the District of Columbia, or the government of any political subdivision of any of them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-15\">Appellants attack the expression in subsection (a) (1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cadvocate, abet, advise, or teach the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety\u201d as being so vague and sweeping \u201cthat they bring within the forbidden area virtually any expression which is considered dangerous or subversive by prosecutor, court or jury.\u201d The words attacked are ordinary everyday terms with generally understood meanings. They are not vague. They are \u201csweeping\u201d only in the sense that' they endeavor to cover the different means by which Congress deemed the forbidden result might be brought about. The argument that the wording of the statute would be construed and applied as anything the prosecutor, court or jury considered dangerous or subversive has no force. If it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>implies that those officials would not act honestly, it is unique, unpleasant and unsound. If it means only that it is unsafe to the citizen to leave determination of such matters to those officials, then it is an argument against our system of administering justice rather than one of invalidity of this language. This objection is not well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Appellants call attention to: the \u201cSeditious conspiracy\u201d Act, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6, and suggest that \u201cno statute in addition * * is needed.\u201d That is a legislative and not a judicial concern. As stated herein-before, there was a situation at the time this Act was before Congress which would well justify the enactment \u2014 if any justification be needed. -</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Appellants urge that the section \u201cmakes no allowance for the circumstances under which an utterance is made.\u201d As shown earlier herein, that is a matter fully taken care of in the application of any criminal statute to the facts of each particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Appellants state: , \u201cWhen once we eliminate, as we must, the actual or attempted use of force as the evil to be prevented by this statute, there remains nothing upon which it can operate, except prophecies, speculation; and analysis of fu1 ture contingencies.\u201d The defect in this statement is that we are not privileged to \u201celiminate\u201d from the section some of its most vital words.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Appellants attack subsection (a) . (3) which makes it a crime \u201cto organize or help to organize any society,, group, or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow or destruction of any government in the United States by force or violence; or- to' b\u00e9 or become a member of, or affiliate with, any such society, group, or assembly of persons, knowing the purposes thereof;\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">, One argument is that this \u201cseeks to impose guilt, by \"association.\u201d The language is incapable of that construction'. The guilt is entirely individual and personal.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">Another argument is, stated thus: \u201cthe statute permits the predication of guilt upon the later judgment of court and jury as to the doctrines of a group. No member can know, until the verdict of guilt is passed upon him in a courtroom that his group holds views contrary to law. Thus, the statute affords no ascertainable standard of guilt. The assumption that it does, and that it is a simple matter to determine whether a party\u2019s doctrines advocate violence, or revolution rests upon a misconception, deliberate or unconscious, of the nature of the doctrines and credos of the \u2018radical\u2019 groups against which the statute is ostensibly aimed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">This argument is unsound. The sub-section applies to two classes of persons, to-wit, organizers and mere members. Organizers of a group certainly know, at the time, . whether the organization they seek to create teaches, advocates or encourages the overthrow Or destruction of any government in the United States by force .or violence. As to mere members, the statute expressly requires that they-be or become such \u201cknowing the purposes thereof.\u201d What the court and. jury do is ascertain whether the organization has such forbidden purposes and whether such requisite knowledge exists and these must appear beyond a reasonable doubt before conviction .can be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-14\">It is argued further that the \u201cdoctrines of radical parties are framed in a technical language which carry meaning only to the initiate,\u201d the assumption seemingly being that, therefore, it is difficult to determine therefrom whether overthrow of the Government by force is intended or not. In' passing, one might wonder .why obscure or doubtful or technical language is used. The English language does not lack for words to express clearly any thought which is intended to be widely understood, and party doctrines of importance are usually intended to be widely understood. However, language is sometimes purposely used to suggest or conceal meanings which, for some reason, the utterer does not care to bring entirely into the open. Appellants, emphasize that this is a \u201cradical\u201d party and th\u00e1t opposition thereto would or might warp the judgments of triers of offenses in their construction of the meaning of language setting forth the party doctrines. For thirty-four years \u2014 long before the Communist Party in any form existed\u2014 there has been a statute making it criminal to conspire \u201cto overthrow, put down, 'or to destroy by force' the Government of the United States\u201d 18 U.S.C.A., \u00a7 6. If a party or' group \u2014 \u201cradical\u201d or otherwise\u2014 has no intention to overthrow or destroy the Government, nothing would be easier than to avoid doubtful language; and, considering existence of the above statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>nothing would be more natural and advisable; and this would seem to be peculiarly so where the party or group regards itself as \u201cradical\u201d and thinks many \u2014 even officials and juries \u2014 would grasp opportunities to weaken or destroy it. When such a group with such apprehensions consciously uses cloudy words concerning a matter of such vital importance in their doctrines and to the safety of themselves individually and to existence of their group, they do not use them accidentally but for a very definite purpose. When they use words which may or may not mean the forbidden thing, they intend just one thing and that is to squirm through the statute leaving a haze which they hope will make it impossible or difficult to find any fracture by their passage. Courts should be careful in all things\u2014 particularly and equally where basic human liberties or where the life of the country is involved \u2014 but they do neither liberty nor their country a service by being so naive or simple as not to take into account human nature and existing situations known to every alert adult in the country. But however this may be, a trial puts the language before the judge and jury with every opportunity on each side to present their several constructions and to bring to bear thereon such side lights of facts as may help to bring out the meaning. The sinister significance must appear beyond reasonable doubt. The difficulty of determining a fact is no argument against the validity of a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Another argument is that many members of groups \u201care without true comprehension of the actual program or doctrine\u201d thereof. Generally speaking, this is certainly true \u2014 even where group or party tenets are couched in non-technical terms and intended to be and easily understood. The protection here is that the statute does not cover such members unless they have knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the group. If they have that knowledge, they are adding their weight to the accomplishment of such unlawful purposes, whether those purposes are approved by them or not and whether any of such purposes were or .were not the incentive for their becoming or remaining members. Appellants say that requirement of such g\u00failty knowledge is of \u201clittle value\u201d but their supporting argument is only repetition of their argument that prosecutors, judges and juries will not do their duty in judging'the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\"> Finally, it is argued that every member of a group or party is penally responsible for the conduct of every other member and \u201cfor every phrase in the statements and documents which are adjudged to reflect party views.\u201d If by this is meant the responsibility of a co-conspirator <em>under a conspiracy charge </em>for what is said or done to effectuate the conspiracy, the statement is true. If, as seems likely, it is meant that such acts and expressions of others could be used to prove the unlawful purpose of the group, then the statement is too broad. Such responsibility is not indefinitely sweeping. It attaches only to authoritative statements of which the member has knowledge; and it depends upon what he does or does not do or say, as manifesting his approval or disapproval, after he has such knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Section 10 is not inherently invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\"><em>Section 11 </em>is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">\u201c\u00a7 11. Same: attempting or conspiring to commit prohibited acts</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, or to conspire to commit, any of the acts prohibited by the provisions of sections 9-13 of this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">The attacks upon this section are (1) it extends into illimitable fields \u201cto punish evil thinking\u201d and not even speech or writing but \u201csimply an agreement to speak or write\u201d; and (2) that the legal machinery to determine violation will lead to misconstruction through the \u201cinfluences of background, temperament, prejudice, emotional pressure and fear of public criticism.\u201d These are ill-founded. The section merely makes criminal all attempts or conspiracies to commit the acts declared criminal by sections 9 and 10 and extends those sections not at all. The \u201clegal machinery\u201d is simply that which works out justice in all criminal cases \u2014 the prosecutor, grand jury, judge and jury. Section 11 is not inherently invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">(B) <em>Invalidity as Applied. </em>The attack upon the validity of the Act which appellants base on the \u201capplication\u201d of the Act is the contention that the \u201cclear and present danger\u201d doctrine of Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52, 39 S.Ct. 247, 249, 63 L.Ed. 470, controls a statute of this character and that the facts here fall outside of that doctrine. \u201cWhere regulations of the liberty of free, discussion are concerned, there are special reasons for observing the rule that it is the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>ute, and not the accusation or the evidence under it, which prescribes the limits of permissible conduct and warns against transgression\u201d. Thornhill v. State of Alabama, 310 U.S. 88, 98, 60 S.Ct. 736, 742, 84 L.Ed. 1093. Whether the Act is of a character to be measured by the above doctrine and, if so, whether it meets such measurement are pertinent to the issue of validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">While the doctrine of the Schenck case \u201chas afforded practical guidance in a great variety of cases in which the scope of constitutional protections of freedom of expression was in issue\u201d (Bridges v. State of California, 314 U.S. 252, 262, 62 S.Ct. 190, 193, 86 L.Ed. 192), yet it is by no means of universal application. Gitlow v. People of State of New York, 268 U.S. 652, 45 S.Ct. 625, 69 L.Ed. 1138, definitely determines that the Schenck case doctrine is not applicable in situations where the legislative body has, by statute, determined that \u201cutterances of a certain kind involve such danger of substantive evil that they may be punished\u201d. 268 U.S. at page 670, 45 S.Ct. at page 631, 69 L.Ed. 1138. The distinction between such cases and those to which the Schenck case doctrine is applicable is clearly stated in the Gitlow opinion at pages 670 and 671 of 268 U.S., 45 S.Ct. at page 631, 69 L.Ed. 1138. This distinction has not been departed from nor weakened by any subsequent holding of the Supreme Court but, to the contrary, has been recognized and applied. Cantwell v. State of Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 307, 308, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1213, 128 A.L.R. 1352; Herndon v. Lowry, 301 U.S. 242, 256-258, 57 S.Ct. 732, 81 L.Ed. 1066; Stromberg v. People of State of California, 283 U.S. 359, 368, 369, 51 S.Ct. 532, 75 L.Ed. 1117, 73 A. L.R. 1484; Whitney v: People of State of California, 274 U.S. 357, 371, 372, 47 S.Ct. 641, 71 L.Ed. 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The problem here is whether this Act falls within the rule of the Schenck case or the rule of the Gitlow case. We think it is within the Gitlow case. That the Nation may protect the integrity of its armed forces and may prevent the overthrow of the Government by force and that it may, as a means to those ends, punish utterances which have a tendency to and are intended to produce the forbidden results is not open to question. Near v. State of Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, 716, 51 S.Ct. 625, 75 L.Ed. 1357; Whitney v. People of State of California, 274 U.S. 357, 371, 47 S.Ct. 641, 71 L.Ed. 1095; Gitlow v. People of State of New York, 268 U.S. 652, 667, 45 S.Ct. 625, 69 L.Ed. 1138. This Act does nothing more. The language defining the offences is clear, understandable \u00e1nd definite.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">To avoid the effect of the Gitlow and following cases appellants argue that a stricter scrutiny of validity should be exercised in instances of a National statute under the First Amendment than in those of a State statute under the Fourteenth Amendment. There is no foundation for such contention. It is the First Amendment which protects freedom of utterance. The effect of the Gitlow and subsequent cases was simply to \u201crecognize in the Fourteenth Amendment the application to the states of the same standards of freedom-of expression as, under the First Amendment, are applicable to the federal government\u201d. Bridges v. State of California, 314 U.S. 252, 268, 62 S.Ct. 190, 196, 86 L. Ed. 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Our conclusion is that sections 9, 10 and' 11 of this Act are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">II. Sufficiency of Indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">Appellants contend that the indictment (Count 2) is insufficient \u201cbecause it merely repeats the words of the statute, fails to-allege facts showing the commission of a crime, and is vague and uncertain\u201d and because it \u201cdoes not allege a conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">Count 2 follows the wording of the statute closely in stating the <em>broad </em>purposes of the conspiracy. Whether a crime is sufficiently charged where the statutory wording is followed depends upon the particularity of the statutory wording. If the statutory language is, \u201caccording to the natural import of the words, fully descriptive of the offense, then ordinarily it is-sufficient\u201d. Potter v. United States, 155 U.S. 438, 444, 15 S.Ct. 144, 146, 39 L.Ed. 214; also see Armour Packing Co. v. United States, 209 U.S. 56, 84, 28 S.Ct. 428;. 52 L.Ed. 681; Ledbetter v. United States,. 170 U.S. 606, 610-612, 18 S.Ct. 774, 42 L.Ed. 1162; Hodgson v. State of Vermont, 168 U.S. 262, 269, 18 S.Ct. 80, 42 L.Ed. 461;. Taran v. United States, 8 Cir., 88 F.2d 54, 56. The statutory definition here is definitely descriptive. However, this count of the indictment did not stop with stating the-broad purposes of the conspiracy. It particularized that the conspirators \u201cwould * * attempt to carry out and accomplish said conspiracy in the manner set out at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>numbered paragraphs One to Thirteen, inclusive, in the first count of this indictment.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the indictment clearly stated the conspiracy was to do the things forbidden by the statute in the particular manners set forth. This count of the indictment is not insufficient as fully informing accused of just what the conspiracy was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>designed to accomplish and just how it was planned to accomplish those designs.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">As to the contention that no conspiracy was alleged, little need be said. The language of this count is clear as to such allegation. The argument that use of the word \u201cwould\u201d instead of \u201cto\u201d to state the purposes of the conspiracy is defective is, to say the least, hypercritical.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">This count of the indictment is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">III. <em>Sufficiency of Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aic\">Appellants urge insufficiency of the evidence in the four respects that it does not show: (a) that they conspired to advocate the overthrow of the Government by violence or to cause insubordination in the armed forces; (b), that they had knowledge of the nature of the conspiracy; (c) that the alleged conspiracy existed after enactment of this statute; (d) that certain of the appellants were parties to the alleged conspiracy after enactment of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">(a) <em>Advocacy of Violence and of Insubordination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Under this point, appellants treat separately the advocacy of violence to overthrow the Government and the advising, etc., insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny or refusal of duty in the armed forces. This is a convenient method of presentation and will be followed in our examination and determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-14\"><em>Advocacy of Violence #o Overthrow the Government. </em>We adopt, in part, appellants\u2019 definition as to \u201coverthrow of the Government,\u201d which is that \u201cThe overthrow or destruction of a state consists essentially in abolishing its forms and institutions * Whether the remainder of the definition \u2014 \u201cand substituting other institutions in their place\u201d \u2014 is valid, we need not inquire since our interest here is only in the overthrow of the existing Government of the United States. That such a drastic, complete change in the present form of Government in the United States was advocated as would inevitably result in abolishing that present form is beyond dispute in this evidence. But the Act is not intended to prevent changes in our Government but to prevent such changes being brought about in a particular manner- \u2014 by violence. The Constitution expressly recognizes that changes might be desired by the people in the form and substance of the government which it prescribed and it defined a clear, workable, orderly method for making any changes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>people might ever deem necessary or desirable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> An individual or organization may advocate any changes whatsoever in the present government \u2014 no matter how drastic or how complete \u2014 so long as the changes are to be brought about in the orderly manner provided. It is only when the change is to be brought about by violence that the Act reaches out its restraining hand. Therefore, the question here is not the fact of change or the character of change advocated by appellants but whether they propose to accomplish those changes by violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">The purposes and methods of appellants centered in their activities in connection with the Socialist Workers Party. Therefore, the purposes and particularly the methods of accomplishment of such purposes are most important. In 1937, various individuals were expelled from the Socialist Party because of their revolutionary\u2014 \u201cleft wing\u201d \u2014 beliefs. These persons held a convention (December 31, 1937 to January 3, 1938) at which the Socialist Workers Party was organized. This convention issued a Declaration of Principles and adopted a Constitution. Thus a party organization was set up and party activities proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The Declaration of Principles is \u201can application of the Marxian theories and doctrines, his whole system of ideas, to the social problem in America\u201d (R. 940). To understand whether that document itself advocated the use of force to overthrow the Government in order to accomplish its purposes, it is necessary to outline some of those purposes. The Declaration states that the present social situation in the United States is that of a \u201ccapitalistic\u201d society; that such society is based on private ownership of property; that a small minority owns the vast amount of basic productive property; that this minority exploit the majority; that the \u201cState\u201d is simply an organization to protect and aid this minority in perpetuating themselves and in their exploitations; that this situation can be corrected only by a \u201csocial revolution\u201d; that such revolution means a political and economic transformation fundamentally affecting the property system and methods of production; that such \u201crevolution\u201d will necessitate expropriation, without compensation, of the property held by this minority and its operation by jHe proposed new \u201cproletarian\u201d government; that it is necessary to take complete political power; that, to accomplish these things, the exploited classes need leadership ; and that the Party is formed to supply the leadership.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">The Declaration sets forth the program of action to effectuate this overthrow of the existing capitalistic society and the Government which supports it. The first step is to build up the strength of the party so that it can have a majority of the exploited classes back of its leadership. The final step is to overthrow the existing Government by force. The statements now to be quoted from the Declaration leave no doubt that the final means are to be force and not orderly change. \u201cThe belief that in such a country as the United States we live in a free, democratic society in which fundamental economic change can be effected by persuasion, by education, by legal and purely parliamentary methods is an illusion\u201d (R. 1182). \u201cThe fundamental instruments of the workers\u2019 struggle for power cannot be the existing institutions of the governmental apparatus, since these represent basically the interests only of the capitalistic minority\u201d (R. 1183). \u201cWhenever the revolutionists find themselves in a Labor Party, they will stand at each stage for those concrete policies and actions which sum up a progressive and class perspective; for complete breaks with the capitalist parties and no support of candidates on capitalist tickets; <em>for direct mass actions and avoidance of limitation to parliamentary activities; </em>for full internal democracy; for support and defense of concrete working class rights against their invasion from any source, including invasions from candidates of the Labor Party itself; etc.\u201d (R. 1199, italics added). \u201cWhile relying primarily on mass actions, propaganda and agitation as the means for furthering its revolutionary aim, the Party will also participate in electoral campaigns, though <em>at all times contending against the fatal illusion that the masses can acconu-plish their emancipation through the ballot box\u2019\u2019 </em>(R. 1200, italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">That the final use of force to overthrow the Government was the method of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Party is further shown by expressions in the official publications of the Party, by its leaders, officers, organizers, speakers, lecturers and writers, and by the privately expressed statements of such.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Party opposed Stalin (R. 932-4, 1196, 1266, 1272), supported Trotsky and adopted and supported the Trotsky program from the beginning of the Party (R. 944-5). After Trotsky arrived in Mexico (January, 1937) various leaders of the Party conferred with him there as to policies and actions. In the Spring of 1938 and thereafter, the matter \u2022of the use of Defense Guards was discussed with him (R. 288, 946-7). He either originated or endorsed the idea of such bodies (R. 286-7, 546, 569, 606, 686, 742-3, 949-50). The Guards were to be organizations which Party members would foster within labor unions to use force in protection of the unions. They were to grow into a militia and finally into the Red Army (R. 286-9, 415, 491, 546, 606, 716, 968-9, 1085-6). Such a Defense Guard was organized in the Teamsters\u2019 Local No. 544 at Minneapolis in July or August, 1938 (R. 1044) or in the Fall of 1938 (R. 1014, 1102). This record leaves no doubt that force was the ultimate means to be used by the Party in the overthrow of the Government by the \u201cproletariat\u201d. Also, the record is substantial that a plan of organizing this force through the development of Defense Guards was employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\"><em>Insubordination in the Armed Forces. </em>The record here contains substantial evidence of the purpose to create insubordination in the armed forces by propaganda therein. Some of the evidence to this effect is found at the pages of the record following:' 265, 277-8, 280, 343, 344, 361, 458, 494, 515, 523, 548, 565, 589, 616, 621, 685, 688, 708, 709, 712-13, 741, 742, 802, 806, 817, 915-22, 974-5, 981-1003, 1063, 1084, 1085-6, 1112, 1126, 1127, 1128.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">\n<em>(b) Knowledge of Defendants as to Nature of Conspiracy.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">Under this point, appellants argue the insufficiency of the evidence to show that the defendants had knowledge that the conspiracy involved advocacy of overthrowing the Government by force and of causing insubordination in the armed forces. We are not dealing here with persons who were simply members of the Party and nothing more. Every one of them was a prominent active worker in the organization and in propaganda work.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Several of them participated in the organization of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>the Party and all of them were or became members during the year (1938) the Party was founded. Each of them was active in spreading the Party propaganda and in increasing membership \u2014 in fact, the major activities of the Party were devoted to building up, mainly by propaganda, the membership of the Party to the strength where the social revolution could be successfully launched. Considering the long association with and the prominent positions and activities of the defendants in the Party and the important place in the Party program of use of force to overthrow the Government and of creation of insubordination, etc., in the armed forces, it would be idle to suppose that each of them did not have full knowledge of these two vital elements of the Party program. In addition, there is direct proof of such knowledge as to each defendant, except Schoenfeld.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This direct evidence comes partly from testimony of the four defendants (Cannon, Carlson, Dobbs and Dunne) who were witnesses; partly from basic Party documents (such as the Communist Manifesto) which defendants urged as reading matter upon those they were soliciting for membership; partly from writings of Party literature by various defendants; partly from editorials and articles in official publications (such as the Socialist Appeal, The Militant, the Fourth International and pamphlets) put out by the Party, kept for sale at its headquarters in Minneapolis and urged upon members and prospects; and partly from oral statements by various defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><em>(c) Existence of Conspiracy after Enactment of Act. </em>This point is that, assuming the Party advocated the forcible overthrow of the Government and advocacy of. insubordination, etc., in the arined forces prior to the date (June 28, 1940) of enactment of this Act, yet there is no proof of continuance of this policy after this date. The argument is that the Declaration of Principles was withdrawn at a Convention held in December, 1940; that the only official publication (What is Trot-skyism) published after June 28, 1940, which could be interpreted as advocating violence was not written by any defendant, was an expression of .opinion by the author not binding on the Party, with no showing it was adopted by the Party and only three mimeographed copies found at Party headquarters; that there is no evidence that any of defendants were concerned with this publication or even knew its contents. The main stress of this argument is based on the effect of withdrawal of the Declaration of Principles..</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">It is true that a specially called convention of the Party adopted (December 21, 1940) a resolution reading as follows: \u201cThe Declaration of Principles of the Socialist Workers Party- \u2014 adopted by the Foundation Convention, (Dec. 1937 to Jan. 3, 1938) \u2014 requires some changes and additions to bring it up to date and correspond with new developments which have transpired since the Foundation Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">This task can be performed satisfactorily only after adequate time has been provided for consideration of proposed changes and their discussion in the ranks of the party. As a step towards the preparation of this task, the Fourth (Special) 'National Convention resolves:</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">1. To suspend and withdraw the Declaration of Principles adopted at the Foundation Convention;</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>2. To authorized [authorize] and instruct the National Committee to prepare a draft of an amended Declaration of Principles for submission to the party for discussion and eventual decision by party convention or referendum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">A committee was appointed to make \u201ca new draft of an amended declaration\u201d (Cannon, R. 872). This draft was considered and accepted by a Party convention held October 10-12, 1941 \u2014 two weeks before this trial began. The Convention submitted this accepted draft to the Party \u201cfor discussion and possible amendment.\u201d So far as this record shows, no final action has been taken on this draft by the Party. Under what \u201cprinciples\u201d has the Party been operating since that date? None at all? Have all of the \u201cprinciples\u201d of the Party been suspended and withdrawn?</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">That this \u201csuspension and withdrawal\u201d was not motivated by a desire and intention to comply with the Act is shown by the purposes in view in passing the resolution. The purposes of this \u201csuspension and withdrawal\u201d had nothing to do with the doctrine of the Party as to overthrow of the Government by force or as to advocacy of insubordination, etc., in the armed forces. The purposes are stated by defendant James P. Cannon, one of the principal leaders of the Party, to be as follows: \u201cThe principal reason, I may say, was the passage by Congress of a bill known as the Voorhis Act, which penalized parties belonging to international organizations. That was the principal reason. Subsidiary reasons were that we had in the meantime \u2014 the party in the meantime had changed its position on the question of the labor party and differently from the way it is stated in the Declaration. Some questions had become outdated by the passage of events, and in general we felt the necessity of a new draft.\u201d The main purpose had to do with a desire to escape registration under the Voorhis Act, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 14-17 which was enacted October 17, 1940, and \u201csubsidiary\u201d purposes were to \u201cbring it up to date and correspond with new developments which have transpired since the Foundation Convention.\u201d There was not the slightest hint of any contemplated change in the important program as to use of force. If such a change was contemplated or intended to be so understood by Party members, it was carefully and intentionally concealed. Even as to the Voorhis Act, this action was merely a subterfuge and smoke screen. As to that Act, members were advised that the Party might have to go \u201cunderground\u201d and they should destroy membership cards and be designated by numbers in order to conceal their identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">This \u201csuspension and withdrawal\u201d was not intended to have and it did not have the slightest effect upon the Party doctrines and methods. No diminution of Party activity since \u201csuspension and withdrawal\u201d of the Declaration in December, 1940, is anywhere suggested in this record. The contrary is shown. About February 1, 1941 \u2014 less than six weeks after adoption of the withdrawal resolution \u2014 the Party issued a bulletin entitled \u201cA B C of Marxism.\u201d At that time, defendant Farrell Dobbs (National Labor Secretary of the Party) was in charge of publications. This bulletin states that the class struggle ends in revolution or in common ruin of the contending classes; that the trade unions unify the mass workers for \u201cevery day ends\u201d; that the Party unifies the working class around a revolutionary program; that the revolutionary party must be an international party, organized with international leadership as well as nationally with national leaders; that the Russian Revolution of 1917-1918 was the greatest event in history; that \u201cthe Bolsheviks started out with a clear idea (at least in the minds of its greatest leaders, Lenin and Trotsky) that the ruling class would never give up power voluntarily, that it was necessary to overthrow that ruling class. But the rulers were entrenched behind the power of the state with its army and police force. Hence, it was necessary to crush completely the old state\u201d; that Trotsky, \u201cthe greatest living exponent of Marxism\u201d organized a new international to guide the workers to victory; and that such victory cannot be achieved without a \u201crevolutionary leadership.\u201d Between March 1 and 10, 1941 \u2014 about two and one-half months after this resolution \u2014 the Party put out a bulletin entitled \u201cWhat is Trotskyism.\u201d At that time also, defendant Farrell Dobbs was still in charge of such publications. This bulletin advocated insubordination in the armed forces and stated \u201cthe whole object of the proletarian military policy is to mobilize and militarize the youth, the proletarian ones, so as to further the interests of the revolution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>The two above bulletins were not the only-manifestations, after December, 1940, that the Party was still pursuing its advocacy of force. Articles appeared in the official publications (R. 796, 800, 822, 1125), two of these being by defendant Goldman. Also, the same literature (including the Declaration of Principles and the Communist Manifesto) continued to be sold at Party headquarters in Minneapolis where defendants Carlson and Coover were in charge. Also, when the search warrant was served at headquarters, on June 27, 1941, a large variety of communistic books, pamphlets and official Party publications were seized. As to many of these, the number of copies on hand showed clearly that they were not there merely for library purposes but were for sale or distribution. In fact, the FBI agent bought from Mrs. Carlson at headquarters, on June 27, 1941, a copy each of the Declaration of Principles and of the Communist Manifesto. This record shows convincingly that neither the enactment of this Act nor the \u201csuspension and withdrawal\u201d resolution had the slightest effect upon the doctrines, purposes or methods of the Party. There was no break, much less abandonment, of the conspiracy to use force to overthrow the Government and to advocate insubordination, etc., in the armed forces.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\n<em>(d) Parties to Conspiracy Following Enactment of Act.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">This point is that it was necessary to prove, as to every defendant, that each continued to be a party to the conspiracy after June 28, 1940 (date of enactment of this Act) and that proof of Party membership before that date is not sufficient. It is urged that the proof is deficient as to this. Whether the necessity of proof thus stated exists or not, we need not and do not examine or determine. However assuming it does exist, it was met by evidence of membership activity by each of the defendants subsequent to enactment of this Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Every word of this record of over thirteen hundred pages has been carefully read and considered. Consideration thereof has required the assembly from the record of the evidence as to each of eighteen defendants and as to four different matters as to each defendant. This has. been done. This thorough examination of the record leaves no doubt as to the sufficiency of the evidence and as to the justice of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">The judgment as to each appellant is. affirmed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-10\">We are not here concerned with subsection \u201c(b)\u201d of section 9 which merely defines \u201cmilitary or naval forces\u201d as used in subsection \u201c(a)\u201d.
