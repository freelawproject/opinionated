HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b888-27\">This case comes before us upon a petition to review an order of the Federal Trade Commission which forbade the petitioner to use the words, \u201cScout,\u201d \u201cBoyScout,\u201d or \u201cScouting,\u201d upon, or in connection with, any knives made or sold by it. The facts upon which the order issued are-in substance as follows. The Kastor Company, or its predecessor \u2014 a partnership\u2014 has been making and selling cutlery and\u2019 the like since 1879; and the subject of this-controversy is a \u201cScout Set,\u201d comprising a three-bladed \u201cScout Knife,\u201d and a \u201cSportsman\u2019s Knife,\u201d sold together in a box, for fifty cents. The \u201cScout Knife\" has one-large cutting blade, a can opener, and a combination screw driver and bottle opener; the \u201cSportsman\u2019s Knife\u201d is a hunting knife with one large blade and a bone handle. On the cover of the cardboard-box it used to print the words, \u201cScouting Set,\u201d with the picture of a tent, a campfire, and boys in \u201cBoy Scout\u2019s\u201d uniform;, but this box it discarded some years ago,, and it now sells the set in a plain box.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>It also makes and sells a four-bladed \u25a0\u201cScout Knife\u201d like the three-bladed knife just mentioned, except that this knife has a leather punch in addition to the other tools. It introduced testimony that it had begun selling a similar \u201cGerman Army\u201d knife, marked \u201cScout Knife,\u201d as early as 1895 like the present \u201cScout Knife\u201d; and that before 1910 it had also imported from England, and sold, hatchets and knives with the words, \u201cBoy Scout,\u201d on the blades. The Commission found that before 1910 \u201cthere was and had been no pocket knife on the market marked with the word \u2018Scout\u2019 \u201d; but it is not necessary for us to decide whether the testimony should have prevailed, because, as will appear, such user would be in any event immaterial, whatever its length. In the year 1910, the sale began which the order forbids and it has continued ever since except that the legend, \u201cBoy Scout\u201d was discontinued more than fifteen years ago, giving place to \u201cScout,\u201d simpliciter.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The Boy Scouts of America is a corporation organized under the laws of the District of Columbia on February 8, 1910; its general activities are so well known that it is scarcely necessary to describe them in detail. At present there are sold with its consent and by its license two-bladed knives costing $1.50, which bear the legend, \u201cOfficial Knife \u2014 Boy Scouts of America,\u201d the insignia of the organization, and the motto \u2014 \u201cBe Prepared.\u201d On the handle of these there is a disc which also carries the insignia, and on the box in which it is sold the insignia appear. No knives sold with its consent \u2014 no \u201cofficial knives\u201d \u2014 bear merely the words, \u201cScout,\u201d or \u201cBoy Scout.\u201d The Commission has found, however, that \u201ceven before the incorporation of the Boy Scouts of America, the words \u2018Scout\u2019 and \u2018Scouting\u2019 had acquired a secondary meaning as applying to the Boy Scout movement.\u201d There was adequate support for that conclusion in the testimony of persons who were in a position to know the public mind, and whom the Commission credited. Indeed, the Commissioner of Patents refused to register the name, \u201cWinchester Scout\u201d as a trade-mark for pocket knives upon the opposition of the Boy Scouts of America. Boy Scouts of America v. Winchester Repeating Arms Co., 15 Trade Mark Reporter 142. See, also, In re Excelsior Shoe Company, 40 App.D.C. 480. At the outset we hold therefore that the word, \u201cScout,\u201d when applied to a boy\u2019s pocket knife, suggests, if indeed it does not actually indicate, that the knife is in some way sponsored by the Boy Scouts of Amer-ica. It is true that this suggestion is vague; it does not mean that the Boy Scouts sell the knife, and would be misleading if it did, for they sell no knives of any kind. But it does, we think, indicate that the knives have the countenance of the organization, either by being licensed as an \u201cofficial knife,\u201d or by having some less explicit recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">That is enough as matter of law under the circumstances. In cases of trademark the right test is to compare what prejudice it will impose upon an infringer to avoid infringing, and what will be the damage to the \u201cowner\u201d of the mark, if the infringer persists. In the case at bar the Kastor Company is using a word of common speech, which all are entitled prima facie to use; for this reason we agree that it may demand that the Boy Scouts show some superior interest. On the other hand it is an error to suppose that its past user \u2014 even though dated, as it claims, from 1895 \u2014 adds any privilege to that of a newcomer. The only protected private interest in words of common-speech is after they have come to connote, in addition to their colloquial meaning, provenience from some single source of the goods to which they are applied. The Kastor Company does not assert that the word, \u201cScout,\u201d on a pocket knife means anything of the sort; and no such assertion could be sustained, for there is not a shred of evidence in the record to sustain it. Therefore, the decision turns upon whether the suggestion \u2014 to put it no more strongly \u2014 from the name, \u201cScout,\u201d upon a boy\u2019s pocket knife that the Boy Scouts of America sponsor it as proper for Boy Scouts, is enough to support the order. We hold that it is; that the Boy Scouts have a cognizable interest in preventing such possible confusion. It is not even necessary that the label shall lead \u201cboy scouts\u201d to buy Kastor knives supposing that they are \u201cOfficial Knives\u201d; boys who are not \u201cScouts\u201d may be led to buy them because in their minds they vaguely have the imprimatur of the Boy Scouts of America. That interest the law will protect against an opposing interest no greater that that of all persons in the use of common speech. We have again and again decided, in cases where a merchant\u2019s mark has been used upon goods which he does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>not in fact sell, but may be thought to be selling, that he may stop the use. No one need expose his reputation to the trade practices of another, even though he can show no pecuniary loss. Aunt Jemima Mills v. Rigney &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 247 F. 407, L.R.A.1918C, 1039; Anheuser-Busch V. Budweiser M. P. Co., 2 Cir., 295 F. 306; France Milling Co. v. Washburn-Crosby Co., 2 Cir., 7 F.2d 304; Yale Electric Corp. v. Robertson, 2 Cir., 26 F.2d 972; L. E. Waterman Co. v. Gordon, 2 Cir., 72 F.2d 272; Emerson Electric Mfg. Co. v. Emerson R. &amp; P. Corp., 2 Cir., 105 F.2d 908. The Boy Scouts of America have a legal grievance if anyone buys the fifty cent knife supposing that it has their approval. The Kastor Company is in a dilemma: either its knives will sell as well under some other name, or the name, \u201cScout,\u201d gives them an advantage to th.e prejudice of the Boy Scouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">In the foregoing we have not relied upon section 7 of the Act of Congress of June 15, 1916, 36 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 27. We have not done so, because the validity of that section has not been argued before us, and because there might be some question whether the word, \u201cScout,\u201d taken by itself, was within the clause \u201cwords or phrases * * <em>* </em>used by the Boy Scouts of America in carrying out its program.\u201d True, it is a part of \u201cwords or phrases\u201d so used; but whether the statute meant to go so far as to protect a single word broken from its context, might be open to debate. Moreover, the Commission does not appear to have relied upon the statute in making its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
