From that judgment, plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">On a motion for summary judgment, where the facts are in dispute, a judgment can properly be entered against the plaintiff only if, on the undisputed facts, he has no valid claim; if, then, any fact asserted by the plaintiff is contradicted by the defendant, the facts as stated by the plaintiff must, on such a motion, be taken as true. Accordingly for the purpose of our decision here, we take the facts as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">Plaintiff, by a letter addressed to defendant company dated October 17, 1941, offered to make efforts to procure for defendant contracts for manufacturing products for national defense or war purposes, in consideration of defendant\u2019s agreement to pay him $1,000 per month for a three months\u2019 period if he were unsuccessful in his efforts, but, if he were successful, to pay him a further sum in an amount not to be less than 3% nor more than 8% of the \u201cpurchase price of said contracts.\u201d On October 31, 1941, at a meeting in Grand Rapids, Michigan, between plaintiff and defendant\u2019s President, the latter, on behalf of his company, orally made an agreement with plaintiff substantially on the terms set forth in plaintiff\u2019s letter, one of the terms being that mentioned in plaintiff\u2019s letter as to commissions; it was orally agreed that the exact amount within the two percentages was to be later determined by the parties. After this agreement was made, the parties executed, in Grand Rapids, a written instrument dated October 31, 1941, appearing on its face to embody a complete agreement between them; but that writing omitted the provision of their agreement that plaintiff, if successful, was to receive a bonus varying from three to eight per cent; instead, there was inserted in the writing a clause that the $1,000 per month \u201cwill be full compensation, but the company may, if it desires, pay you something in the nature of a bonus.\u201d However, at the time when they executed this writing, the parties orally agreed that the previous oral agreement was still their actual contract, that the writing was deliberately erroneous with respect to plaintiff\u2019s commissions, and that the misstatement in that writing was made solely in order to \u201cavoid any possible stigma which might result\u201d from putting such a provision \u201cin writing,\u201d the defendant\u2019s President stating that \u201chis fears were based upon the criticism of contingent fee contracts.\u201d Nothing in the record discloses whose criticism the defendant feared; but plaintiff, in his brief, says that defendant was apprehensive because adverse comments had been made in Congress of such contingent-fee arrangements in connection with war contracts. The parties subsequently executed further writings extending, for two three-month periods, their \u201cagreement under date of October 31, 1941.\u201d Through plaintiff\u2019s efforts and expenditures of large sums for traveling expenses, defendant, within this extended period, procured contracts between it and companies supplying aircraft to the government for war purposes, the aggregate purchase price named in said contracts being $5,950,000. The defendant has refused to pay the plaintiff commissions thereon in the agreed amount (i.e., not less than three percent) but has paid him merely $8,950 (at the rate of $1,000 a month) and has offered him, by way of settlement, an additional sum of $9,000 which he has refused to accept as full payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">Defendant argues that the summary judgment was proper on the ground that, under the parol evidence rule, the court could not properly consider as relevant anything except the writing of October 31, 1941, which appears on its face to set forth a complete and unambiguous agreement between the parties. If defendant on this point is in error, then, if the plaintiff at a trial proves the facts as alleged by him, and no other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>defenses are successfully interposed, he will be entitled to a sum equal to 3% of $5,950,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Were the parol evidence rule a rule of evidence, we could decide this question without reference to state court decisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But the federal courts have held, in line with what has become the customary doctrine in most states, that it is a rule of substantive law, i.e., the extrinsic proof is excluded because no claim or defense can be founded upon it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The acid test of whether the rule is substantive or procedural would seem to be whether, if extrinsic evidence is received without objection, it can be regarded as material and made the basis of the court\u2019s decision;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> if it can, then, presumably the rule is like the hearsay rule. But in Higgs v. De Maziroff, 263 N.Y. 473, 189 N.E. 555, 92 A.L.R. 807, the court said that if extrinsic evidence is thus received and if the attention of the trial court is not otherwise called to the parol evidence rule, that evidence becomes relevant and that no complaint because of the reception of that evidence can be raised on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It might therefore be argued that, in New York, the parol evidence rule is procedural, with the consequence that, although the contract was made in Michigan, the New York parol evidence decisions would govern.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But the court, in Higgs v. De Maziroff, explicitly stated that the rule creates a substantive defense and, in effect, held that, like many other substantive defenses, it is \u201cwaived\u201d if not properly raised in the trial court; in other words, \u201cwaivability\u201d is not a unique quality of procedural errors. The substantive character of the rule, although perhaps shadowy, still exists in New York. It seems clear then that, for purposes of conflict of laws, New York would consider that rule as not procedural. Consequently, we must here apply the law of Michigan.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">It is not surprising that confusion results from a rule called \u201cthe parol evidence rule\u201d which is not a rule of evidence, which relates to extrinsic proof whether written or parol,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and which has been said to be virtually no rule at all.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As Thayer said of it, \u201cFew things are darker than this, or fuller of subtle difficulties.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The rule is often loosely and confusingly stated as if, once the evidence establishes that the parties executed a writing containing what appears to' be a complete and unambiguous agreement, then no evidence may be received of previous or contemporaneous oral understandings which contradict or vary its terms. But, under the parol evidence rule correctly stated, such a writing does not acquire that dominating position if it has been proved by extrinsic evidence that the parties did not intend it to be an exclusive authoritative memorial of their agreement. If they did intend it to occupy that position, their secret mutual intentions as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>terms of the contract or its meaning are usually irrelevant, so that parties who exchange promises may be bound, at least \u201cat law\u201d as distinguished from \u201cequity,\u201d in a way which neither intended, since their so-called \u201cobjective\u201d intent governs. When, however, they have previously agreed that their written promises are not to bind them, that agreement controls and no legal obligations flow from the writing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It has been held virtually everywhere, when the question has arisen that (certainly in the absence of any fraudulent or illegal purpose) a purported written agreement, which the parties designed as a mere sham, lacks legal efficacy, and that extrinsic parol or other extrinsic evidence will always be received on that issue. So the highest court of Michigan has several times held.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It has gone further: In Woodard v. Walker, 192 Mich. 188, 158 N.W. 846, that court specifically enforced against the seller an oral agreement for the sale of land which had been followed by a sham written agreement, for sale of the same land at a higher price, intended to deceive the seller\u2019s children who were jealous of the buyer.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">We need not here consider cases where third persons have relied on the delusive agreement to their detriment<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or cases in other jurisdictions (we find none in Michigan) where the mutual purpose of the deception was fraudulent or illegal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> For the instant case involves no such elements. As noted above, the pleadings and affidavits are silent as to the matter of whom the parties here intended to mislead, and we cannot infer a fraudul\u00e9nt or illegal purpose. Even the explanation contained in plaintiff\u2019s brief discloses no fraud or illegality: No law existed rendering illegal the commission provision of the oral agreement which the parties here omitted from the sham writing; while it may be undesirable that citizens should prepare documents so contrived as to spoil the scent of legislators bent on proposing new legislation, yet such conduct is surely not unlawful and does not deserve judicial castigation as immoral or fraudulent; the courts should not erect standards of morality so far above the customary. Woodard v. Walker leaves no doubt that the Michigan courts would hold the parol evidence rule inapplicable to the facts as we have interpreted them.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-17\">Candor compels the admission that, were we enthusiastic devotees of that rule, we might so construe the record as to bring this case within the rule\u2019s scope; we could dwell on the fact that plaintiff, in his complaint, states that the acceptance of his offer \u201cwas partly oral and partly contained\u201d in the October 31 writing, and could then hold that, as that writing unambiguously covers the item of commissions, the plaintiff is trying to use extrinsic evidence to \u201ccontradict\u201d the writing. But the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit, if accepted as true and liberally construed, makes it plain that the parties deliberately intended the October 31 writing to be a misleading, untrue, statement of their real agreement.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-18\">/ We thus construe the record because we I do not share defendant\u2019s belief that the rule is so beneficent, so promotive of the administration of justice, and so necessary to business stability, that it should be given the widest possible application.. The truth is that the rule does but little to achieve the ends it supposedly serves. Although seldom mentioned in modern decisions, the most important motive for perpetuation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>of the rule is distrust of juries, fear that they cannot adequately cope .with, or will be unfairly prejudiced by, conflicting \u201cparol\u201d testimony.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>-\u25a0 If the rule were frankly recognized as primarily a device to control juries, its shortcomings would become obvious)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>, since it is not true that the execution by the parties of an unambiguous writing, \u201cfacially complete,\u201d bars extrinsic proof. The courts admit such \u201cparol\u201d testimony (other than the parties\u2019 statements of what they meant by the writing) for a variety of purposes: to show \u201call the operative usages\u201d and \u201call the surrounding circumstances prior to and contemporaneous with the making\u201d of a writingf<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>-\\to show an agreed oral condition, nowhere referred to in the writing, that the writing was not to be binding until some third person approved; to show that a deed, absolute on its face, is but a mortgage. These and numerous other exceptions have removed most of that insulation of the jury from \u201coral\u201d testimony which the rule is said to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">The rule, then, does relatively little to deserve its much advertised virtue of reducing the dangers of successful fraudulent recoveries and defenses brought about through perjury. The rule is too small a hook to catch such a leviathan. Moreover, if at times it does prevent a person from winning, by lying witnesses, a lawsuit which he should lose, it also, at times, by shutting out the true facts, unjustly aids other persons to win lawsuits they should and would lose, were the suppressed evidence known to the courts. Exclusionary rules, which frequently result in injustice, have always been defended \u2014 as was the rule, now fortunately extinct, excluding testimony of the parties to an action \u2014 with the danger-of-perjury argument.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Perjury, of course, is pernicious and doubtless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>much of it is used in our courts daily with unfortunate success. The problem of avoiding its efficacious use should be met head on. Were it consistently met in an indirect manner \u2014 in accordance with the viewpoint of the adulators of the parol evidence rule \u2014 by wiping out substantive rights provable only through oral testimony, we would have wholesale destruction of familiar causes of action such as, for instance, suits for personal injury and for enforcement of wholly oral agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The parol evidence rule is lauded as an important aid in the judicial quest for \u201cobjectivity,\u201d a quest which aims to avoid that problem the solution of which was judicially said in the latter part of the fifteenth century to be beyond even the powers of Satan \u2014 the discovery of the inner thoughts of man. The policy of stern refusal to consider subjective intention, prevalent in the centralized common law courts of that period, later gave way; in the latter part of the 18th and the early part of the 19th century, the recession from that policy went far, and there was much talk of the \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d in the formation of contracts, of giving effect to the actual \u201cwill\u201d of the contracting parties. The obstacles to learning that actual intention have, more recently, induced a partial reversion to the older view.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Today a court generally restricts its attention to the outward behavior of the parties: the meaning of their acts is not what either party or both parties intended but the meaning which a \u201creasonable man\u201d puts on those acts; the expression of mutual assent, not the assent itself, is usually the essential element.<footnotemark>20a</footnotemark> We now speak of \u201cexternality,\u201d insisting on judicial consideration of only those manifestations of intention which are public (\u201copen to the scrutiny and knowledge of the community\u201d) and not private (\u201csecreted in the heart\u201d of a person),<footnotemark>20b</footnotemark> This objective approach is of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>great value, for a legal system can be more effectively administered if legal rights and obligations ordinarily attach only to overt conduct. Moreover, to call the standard \u201cobjective\u201d and candidly to confess that the actual intention is not the guiding factor serves desirably to high-light the fact that much of the \u201claw of contracts\u201d has nothing whatever to do with what the parties contemplated but consists of rules \u25a0 \u2014 -founded on considerations of public policy \u2014 by which the courts impose on the contracting parties obligations of which the parties were often unaware; this \u201cobjective\u201d perspective discloses that the voluntary act of entering into a contract creates a jural \u201crelation\u201d or \u201cstatus\u201d much in the same way as does being married or holding a public office.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">But we should not demand too much of this concept of \u201cobjectivity\u201d; like all useful concepts it becomes a thought-muddler if its limitations are disregarded. We can. largely rid ourselves of concern with the subjective reactions of the parties ;<footnotemark>21a</footnotemark> when, however, we test their public behavior by inquiring how it appears to the \u201creasonable man,\u201d we must recognize, unless we wish to fool ourselves, that although one area of subjectivity has been conquered, another remains unsubdued. For instance, under the parol evidence rule, the standard of interpretation of a written contract is usually \u201cthe meaning that would be attached to\u201d it \u201cby a <em>reasonably intelligent person </em>acquainted with all operative usages and knowing all the circumstances prior to, and contemporaneous with, the making\u201d of the contract, \u201cother than oral statements by the parties of what they intended it to mean.\u201d<footnotemark>21b</footnotemark> We say that \u201cthe objective viewpoint of a third person is used.\u201d<footnotemark>21c</footnotemark>5 But where do we find that \u201cobjective\u201d third person? We ask judges or juries to discover that \u201cobjective viewpoint\u201d \u2014 through their own subjective processes. Being but human, their beliefs cannot be objectified, in the sense of being standardized. Doubtless, there is some moderate approximation to objectivity, that is, to uniformity of beliefs, among judges \u2014 men with substantially similar training \u2014 although less than is sometimes supposed.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> But no one can seriously maintain that such uniformity exists among the multitude of jurymen, men with the greatest conceivable variety of training and background. When juries try cases, objectivity is largely a mirage; most of the objectivity inheres in the words of the \u201creasonable man\u201d standard which the judges, often futilely, admonish juries to apply to the evidence. Certain aspects of subjectivity common to all men seem to have been successfully eliminated in the field of science through the \u201crelativity theory\u201d \u2014 which might better be called the \u201canti-relativity\u201d or \u201cabsolute\u201d theory.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> But equal success has not attended the anti-rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>tivity or objective theory in the legal field.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Perhaps nine-tenths of legal uncertainty is caused by uncertainty as to what courts will find, on conflicting evidence, to be the facts of cases.<footnotemark>24a</footnotemark> Early in the history of our legal institutions, litigants strongly objected to a determination of the facts by mere fallible human beings. A man, they felt, ought to be allowed to demonstrate the facts \u201cby supernatural means, by some such process as the ordeal or the judicial combat; God may be for him, though his neighbors be against him.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We have accepted the \u201crational\u201d method of trial based on evidence but the longing persists for some means of counter-acting the fallibility of the triers of the facts. Mechanical devices, like the parol evidence rule, are symptoms of that longing,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> a longing particularly strong when juries participate in trials.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> But a mechanical device like the parol evidence rule cannot satisfy that longing, especially because the injustice of applying the rule rigidly has led to its being riddled with exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-12\">Those exceptions have, too, played havoc with the contention that business stability depends upon that rule, that, as one court put it \u201cthe tremendous but closely adjusted machinery of modern business cannot function at all without\u201d the assurance afforded by the rule and that, \u201cif such as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>surance were removed today from our law, general disaster would result * *.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We are asked to believe that the rule enables businessmen, advised by their lawyers, to rely with indispensable confidence on written contracts unimpeachable by oral testimony. In fact, seldom can a conscientious lawyer advise his client, about to sign an agreement, that, should the client become involved in litigation relating to that agreement, one of the many exceptions to the rule will not permit the introduction of uncertainty-producing oral testimony. As Corbin says, \u201cThat rule has so many exceptions that only with difficulty can it be correctly stated in the form of a rule.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> One need but thumb the pages of Wigmore, Williston, or the Restatement of Contracts to see how illusory is the certainty that the rule supplies. \u201cCollateral parol agreements contradicting a writing are inadmissible,\u201d runs the rule as ordinarily stated; but in the application of that standard there exists, as Williston notes, \u201cno final test which can be applied with unvarying regularity.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Wigmore more bluntly says that only vague generalizations are possible, since the application of the rule, \u201cresting as it does on the parties\u2019 intent, can properly be made only after a comparison of the kind of transaction, the terms of the document, and the circumstances of the parties * * * Such is the complexity of circumstances and the variety of documentary phraseology, and so minute the indicia of intent, that one ruling can seldom be controlling authority or even of utility for a subsequent one.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The recognized exceptions to the rule demonstrate strikingly that business can endure even when oral testimony competes with written instruments. If business stability has not been ruined by the deed-mortgage exception, or because juries may hear witnesses narrate oral understandings that written contracts were not to be operative except on the performance of extrinsic conditions, it is unlikely that commercial disaster would follow even if legislatures abolished the rule in its entirety.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-18\">In sum, a rule so leaky cannot fairly be described as a stout container of legal certainty. John Chipman Gray, a seasoned practical lawyer, expressed grave doubts concerning the reliance of businessmen on legal precedents generally.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> If they rely on the parol evidence rule in particular, they will often be duped. It has been seriously questioned whether in fact they do so to any considerable extent.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> We see no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>good reason why we should strain to interpret the record facts here to bring them within such a rule.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A2oo\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-8\"> As we did in the carefree days before the advent of Erie R.

Forness, 2 Cir., 125 F.2d 928, 935, 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Another factor was veneration for the written word. See Wigmore, ibid. Paul Radin, Primitive Man as Philosopher (1927) 59-60, says: \u201cMuch if not all of the magical quality and potency possessed by the word is derived from its connection with the written script. That is quite intelligible. Granted a dynamic and ever-changing world, then the written word with its semi-permanence and its static character was a much desired oasis * * * But culturally and psychologically it possessed even a greater significance, for it completed the victory of the visual-minded man over his competitors. From that time on, at least for the literate man, the main verities were the visual verities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">The perpetuation of the parol evidence rule doubtless owes much to inertia. Cf. Hoffman v. Palmer, 2 Cir., 129 F.2d 976, 997, 998. Any profession, the medical as well as the legal, possessed of a monopoly in its field, tends to develop what are today called \u201cbureaucratic\u201d habits of strong disinclination to alter its established ways. Cf. Seagle, The Quest for Law (1941) xv, 86, 96, 100, 101, 136; Stern, Social Factors in Medical Progress (1927). Unconscious sadism perhaps, too, influences some of the academic praise of the parol evidence rule: some cloistered scholars seem to take satisfaction in \u201chard cases\u201d which, they feel, should not lead to deviations from \u201cgood law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b709-15\"> See McCormick, The Parole Evidence Rule as a Procedural Device for Control of the Jury, 41 Yale L.J. (1932) 364. McCormick points out that there is little-discussion of the important procedural problem of division of functions between judge and jury in the administration of the rule. Had the rule been regarded as one of evidence, it would, for instance, have been dealt with in the A. L. I. Code of Evidence, and the procedural workings of the rule would there have received full consideration. Instead, the subject of that rule was made a part of the Restatement of Contracts, which gives that problem only a side-glance.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-16\">It is one of the anomalies of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins that the federal courts, where the trial judge has an important role in a trial, must adopt state court rulings concerning parol evidence although those rulings are often a product of fear of the jury engendered by the relative impotence of the state trial judge in jury cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b709-17\"> Restatement of Contracts, \u00a7 230.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b709-18\"> \u201cPerjury is one of the great bugaboos of the law.

The mutual intent of the parties, not \u201cobjectively\u201d manifested, is considered for instance, in an action in equity for reformation of a written contract because of mutual mistake. As Wig-more puts it, \u201cThe theory of reformation is to make the instrument state, objectively and in appearance to others, what it did subjectively state to the parties themselves\" ; the reformation is needed only to make it \u201cappear to the rest of the world as it appeared (and therefore legally was) to the parties when they signed it.\u201d Wig-more, loe. cit., \u00a7\u00a7 2417, 2418.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">Williston insists that equity, in the reformation cases, does not abandon the \u201cobjective test,\u201d that, no matter what the equity courts say, they do not really hold that the parties made a contract according to their \u201csubjective\u201d intent but merely that the parties must be dealt with \u201cas if\u201d they had. He relies on the fae- that equity will not grant such relief unless it is \u201cequitable\u201d to do so. See, Williston, Mutual Assent in The Formation of Contracts, 14 IlLL.Rev. (1919) 85. But such a distinction seems excessively to depend on a procedural difference (on the side of the court in which the action is brought), a distinction peculiarly tenuous today under the new Rules of Civil Procedure. Moreover, in actions \u201cat law,\u201d equitable factors are considered, as in the case of \u201cequitable defenses.\u201d Since equity does frequently regard what the parties mutually intended, despite the fact that that intention is not \u201cobjective,\u201d it cannot be said that \u201cobjectivity\u201d is the exclusive test in the \u201claw of contracts\u201d under our judicial system today.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">As Olipnant notes, \u201cIt may be that the old subjective theory is yet a half truth * * * We may find that one cannot assert rights and powers unless he was actually, as well as reasonably, led to expect the performance for which he sues, that upon such expectation he subjectively relied at the time the alleged bargain was made.\u201d Oliphant, Review of Williston on Contracts, 19 Mich.L.R.

Undeniably, however, that rule, when operative, often artificializos the problem; it creates a picture which, because of its inaccuracy, may have sharper outlines than the actual facts. The task of triers of the facts is indeed difficult \u2014 that of inferring, from present evidence, events which happened in the past and which cannot be made to occur before their eyes. The greater the conflict in tile evidence, the more the subjective uncertainty of the jurymen about those past happenings. So that a false appearance of certainty in knowledge about the past conduct of the parties can to some extent be attained through the ignorance compelled by the parol evidence rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-14\">Vis a vis the parol evidence rule, however, the major cause of distrust of the jury is not so much the fear that they will not comprehend the complicated facts or be unable to detect perjury, but rather that they will base their verdict not on the evidence but on their sympathies and that their verdict cannot be upset should the perjured testimony support the verdict, regarding that testimony as true (as it must be regarded after a general verdict).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-15\">Much of the difficulty derives from the use of the general verdict which makes it all but impossible to control the jury especially when there is conflicting evidence.

Like most of the law\u2019s basic assumptions, this one has never been tested by any survey of the actual effects in business of the presence or absence of such assurance * * * It would, perhaps, be worthwhile to canvass the managers and counsel of business enterprises of country-wide scope, to ascertain whether they are aware of the lack of strictness of the courts of a few of the states (e. g., North Carolina) in protecting writings against claimed oral agreements, and, if so, whether this influences the amount and methods of business done by them in those states * <em>* </em>The telephone, and the urgent call for high speed in certain types of important transactions, such as security trading, have accustomed businessmen to rely upon word-of-mouth, and to dispense with the safeguard of writing. This is suggested in a letter from Professor Nathan Isaacs, from which I take the liberty of quoting: \u2018In the first place, the businessman of today relies and must rely less and less on writing than he did even fifty years ago. The telephone has something to do with this change, but a more important factor is the speed required in modern business. It is true that our facilities for rapid writing have increased, but our need for rapidity in transactions has increased much more rapidly. The result is that the businessman, is ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>customed to seeing millions of dollars worth of securities change hands on the stock exchange without the scratch of a pen. But this is not the whole or even the most important part of the story. Even where writing is resorted to, two forces have conspired to prevent the writing from containing or even purporting to contain the \u201cwhole\u201d contract. One of these is the growing complexity of transactions, and the other is a phase of the speed already mentioned which shows itself in the brevity of business letters and other memoranda. To- fill the gaps which necessarily result in the modern business contract, we resort more and more to the standardizing elements (customs, statutes, rules of trade associations, chambers of commerce, exchanges), but a great many blanks still remain to be filled in by oral understanding. The real danger therefore to the businessman that comes from a strict enforcement of the parol evidence rule, is that as contracts are made today essential parts are in danger of being excluded. In other words, I mean to suggest that however fitting the parol evidence rule may have been when it grew up, it is not in strict accord with the needs of business today. It is a gratuitous assumption that, where people fake the trouble to reduce their contract to writing, their motive is to prevent explanations \u2014 even contradictory explanations\u2014 from entering into the situation. On the contrary, the motive for writing may be the very simple motive of satisfying the need of quick communication or of making a memorandum in such a form as to fit into the plan of a business for having the memorandum acted on, or it may be some quite different motive.\u2019 \u201d McCormick, 41 Yale L. J. 364, 365, 366, 384.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b714-19\"> Rather than judicially to extend the scope of the rule, it might be well by legislation to restrict it. If the basic motive in perpetuating it is fear of juries, the legislatures might deal with it somewhat as the proposed A. L. I. Code of Evidence deals with certain phrases of the hearsay rule: When a judge tries a ease without a jury, make the parol evidence rule inapplicable or reduce it to the level of a rebut-table presumption; when a jury sits, leave it to the trial judge to apply the rule to the extent that, in his discretion, he thinks that the extrinsic evidence now excluded by the rule will prejudicially affect the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-20\">For discussion of suggested modifications of the rule, see McCormick, 41 Yale L.
