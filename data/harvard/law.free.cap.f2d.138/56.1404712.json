Use of the mark here sought to be registered is claimed in the application since November 16, 1938.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-25\">In its notice of opposition appellee pleaded its ownership of the well-known trade-mark \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d for which it holds many registrations, the first being one granted in 1893.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-26\">The validity of the several registrations of \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d is not questioned in this-proceeding, nor is the validity of the \u201cRock Spring\u201d registrations at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-27\">The issue here revolves solely about the word \u201cKola,\u201d which, of course, is the equivalent of \u201cCola\u201d in sound and in meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-28\">It is conceded that the goods of appellant to which it applies the particular mark*. \u201cRock Spring Kola,\u201d are of the same descriptive properties as the goods to which* appellee applies the mark \u201cCoca-Cola.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-29\">So, no complicated question is presented,, nor does this case differ in principle from* other cases which have been before us involving the \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-30\">Reduced to its simplest terms, the question to be decided is whether the inclusion, of the word \u201cKola\u201d in appellant\u2019s mark-should forbid its registration, upon the* ground of likelihood of confusion, in view? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>of the word \u201cCola\u201d in appellee\u2019s registered marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">It is proper to emphasize the fact that the only question before us is that of appellant\u2019s right to register and that this right is governed by the terms of the \u25a0statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Appellant introduced much evidence which, however pertinent it might be in a proceeding involving a question of infringement, or unfair competition, is irrelevant in a registration proceeding, and appellant\u2019s brief presents arguments, based upon many cited cases of which the same may be said.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">In consequence, we agree with the commissioner that no discussion of the evidence is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">There is no distinction in principle between this case and the case of Corn Products Refining Co. v. Coca-Cola Co., 103 F.2d 385, 26 C.C.P.A.,Patents, 1181. The arguments made before us in this case (while more elaborate) are practically the same as the arguments made before us in that case. The applicant in that case sought to register the notation \u201cDextra-Cola\u201d for use as a trade-mark on a syrup identical in its nature with the syrup on which the Coca-Cola Company used its \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d mark. The Examiner of Trade-Marks there required disclaimer of the word \u201cCola\u201d (and it was disclaimed) just as in this case disclaimer of the word \u201cKola\u201d was required and made. The Coca-Cola Company there opposed the application just as it opposes the application here. In that \u25a0case the tribunals of the Patent Office concurred in the view that the marks at issue were confusingly similar and that the opposition should be sustained, and we agreed with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">If the decisions were correct there, and we think they were, certainly the commissioner rendered the correct decision in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">It was urged in that case, just as it is urged here, that \u201cCola\u201d (\u201cKola\u201d) is a descriptive term and, therefore, open to public use.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">Assuming that it is a descriptive term, open to public use, it does not follow that it is open to registration as a mark, or part of a mark, so long as the Coca-Cola Company\u2019s several registrations remain un-cancelled in the Patent Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">Appellant here contends that \u201cCoca\u201d is the dominant part of appellee\u2019s mark and that \u201cRock Spring\u201d is the dominant part of appellant\u2019s mark.' With this contention we are unable to agree. It is perfectly obvious that appellant desires to include \u201cKola\u201d in its mark solely in order to indicate the character of the particular type of beverage which it manufactures and markets under the name of \u201cRock Spring Kola,\u201d and in actual use \u201cKola\u201d is the part which is of interest to the purchaser of the product. Its disclaimer of the word \u201cKola,\u201d of course, adds nothing to its right to register. Tetley &amp; Co., Inc., v. Bay State Fishing Co., 82 F.2d 299, 23 C.C.P.A.,Patents, 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">In the Corn Products Refining Co. case, supra, \u201cCola\u201d was disclaimed but it was held, in effect, that such disclaimer did not render \u201cDextra-Cola\u201d registrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">Appellant has placed some emphasis upon our decision in the case of Puerto Rico Distilling Co. v. Coca-Cola Co., 120 F.2d 370, 28 C.C.P.A.,Patents, 1143. We there held (two of the five judges dissenting) that the appellant was entitled to register the word \u201cRonricola\u201d as a trade-mark for an alcoholic beverage which, it was stated, contained a considerable amount of cola syrup. It was the view of the majority in that case that the difference between the words \u201cRonricola\u201d and \u201cCoca-Cola,\u201d when considered in connection with the difference between an alcoholic and a nonalcoholic beverage, justified a holding that no confusion would likely result from the concurrent use of the respective marks, and that the notation Ronricola might properly be registered. It is obvious that the decision there has no applicability here.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-16\">We deem it unnecessary further to pursue a discussion of the case, but attention may be directed to the cases of Steinreich v. The Coca Cola Co., 67 F.2d 498, 21 C.C.P. A.,Patents, 722; King Kola Mfg. Co. v. Coca Cola Co., 99 F.2d 983, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-17\">The decision of the commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b121-19\">JACKSON, Associate Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A-q\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-20\">BLAND, Associate Judge, took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
