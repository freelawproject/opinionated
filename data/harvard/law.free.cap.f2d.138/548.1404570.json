It alleged, though, that after August 17, 1940, when it became advised that it was subject to the act, it had faithfully undertaken to comply with the law, and it did pay minimum and overtime wages as the law required.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-24\">There followed: a full hearing before the court; and opinion <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the facts established did not warrant the issuance of an injunction; an affidavit<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> filed pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>to Par. 5 of the court\u2019s conclusion of law showing that the defendant had before March 6, 1943, gone out of business, was on that date a completely dormant corporation without agents, servants, or employees of any kind; a motion to strike, and an order striking, the third paragraph of the affidavit; and a judgment denying the injunction and ordering the complaint dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Notwithstanding the undisputed fact of record that the defendant is no longer in business and has no employees, and that whether the injunction was correctly refused is of no practical importance, plaintiff, for the purpose of obtaining an advisory opinion upon the academic correctness of the plans<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> under which defendant had operated while it was in business, prosecutes this appeal, stating the question for decision to be, whether defendant paid overtime compensation to its employees at not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which each was employed. Defendant, having neither practical nor academic interest in the further proceedings, has appeared neither in person nor by brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Under these circumstances, it is sufficient for us, without entering upon the inquiry which appellant\u2019s brief invites, to say that the question presented is not, as appellant states it, whether appellee has paid overtime compensation as required by the act, but whether the refusal of the injunction was an abuse of the wise and sound discretion vested in the district judge which should be corrected by us. A careful examination of the findings of fact and conclusions of law, in the light of the whole record, makes it abundantly clear that there was no such abuse and that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-11\"> 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 201 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b612-12\"> 49 Fed.Supp. 192.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b612-13\"> Georgia, Fulton County.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-14\">Personally appeared before me, the undersigned attesting officer, E.
