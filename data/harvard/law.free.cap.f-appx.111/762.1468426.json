Dean was convicted by a jury of threatening to murder a federal judge with the intent to retaliate against the judge on account of the performance of his official duties, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115. The district court determined that Dean was a career criminal for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2. Dean was sentenced to a 100-month imprisonment term and a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-23\">Dean has filed a motion seeking to relieve the counsel appointed to represent him on appeal so that he can raise claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel on direct appeal. He has also filed a motion seeking the appointment of substitute counsel so that he can file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging his state conviction for murder. Those motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-24\">Dean appeals his sentence on the ground that the district court erred in finding him to be a career offender. Specifically, he argues that, because he was incarcerated in a Texas state prison at the time he made the threat, it was not a credible threat that posed a serious potential risk of physical harm to the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-25\">Section 4B1.2 of the sentencing guidelines offers two disjunctive definitions of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The district court did not err in finding that Dean\u2019s instant offense is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>poses of determining career offender status. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115; U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2(a)(l). Thus, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b794-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
