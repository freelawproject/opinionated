We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Salta v. INS, </em>314 F.3d 1076, 1078 (9th Cir.2002). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-23\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying reopening because Asghar was served in person with the Notice to Appear, which specified the date and time of his hearing and warned him explicitly of the consequences of his failure to appear. <em>See id. </em>(citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A), 1229a(b)(5)(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-24\">To the extent Asghar raises additional issues about the processing of his asylum application, they are not properly before this Court because he failed to raise them to the BIA. <em>See Barron v.
