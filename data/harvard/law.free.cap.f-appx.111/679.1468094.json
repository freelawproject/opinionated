(\u201cProd-X\u201d) and Nasir M. Khan appeal from the district court\u2019s order dismissing their breach of contract claim and entering judgment in favor of Defendant Capitol Resource Funding, Inc. on its counterclaim for breach of contract. With respect to the district court\u2019s dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim and the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Defendant on its counterclaims against Khan, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Prod-X Distribs., Inc. v. Capitol Res. Funding, Inc., </em>No. CA-03-1065-1 (E.D.Va. filed Nov. 26, 2003 &amp; entered Dec. 4, 2003). However, because Prod-X has filed a bankruptcy petition, we stay the appeal of the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Defendant on its counterclaim against Prod-X. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a) (2000). We deny Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees and Khan\u2019s emergency motion to stay enforcement of the contract and to stay the bankruptcy proceeding. We deny Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss but grant Defendant\u2019s motion to submit the case on briefs. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART AND STAYED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b712-7\"> Because Plaintiffs\u2019 breach of paragraph three of the repayment agreement was a material breach of the contract that excused Defendant\u2019s performance under the contract, we need not consider the alternative grounds provided by the district court for excusing Defendant\u2019s performance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
