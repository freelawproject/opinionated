At the hearing the evidence against him was adduced largely through testimony of DEA Special Agent James Lasota. Coded conversations in which Santos-Ferrer participated had been intercepted by authorities and Lasota offered testimony that the conversations referred to drug transactions. Following the hearing, the Court, based primarily on the Magistrate\u2019s report, terminated SantosFerrer\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him principally to a year and a day. Familiarity with the relevant facts, procedur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>al history and issues presented raised on appeal is presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Santos-Ferrer claims that the Magistrate Judge and the District Court erred in admitting Special Agent Lasota\u2019s testimony, because \u201cdespite the latitude given District Courts [in hearing expert testimony concerning the narcotics trade] the cases ... caution against the admission of expert testimony that strays from a witness\u2019 expertise.\u201d Appellant br. at 21. Specifically, he contends that the District Court abused its discretion in admitting the testimony because blurring the distinction between expert and lay testimony created a risk of confusing the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">We see no error, much less any abuse of discretion. It is well-settled that revocation hearings are not the same as criminal trials and judicial officers have considerable discretion at such hearings in determining the testimony to admit and the manner in which it may be given. The full range of procedural safeguards associated with a criminal trial do not attach to parole revocation proceedings because \u201ca probationer already stands convicted of a crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>299 F.3d 103, 109 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Moreover, the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to supervised release revocation hearings. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 1101(d)(3) (federal rules of evidence not applicable to proceedings \u201cgranting or revoking probation\u201d); Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(a)(2) advisory committee\u2019s notes (2003 ed.) (\u201cThe hearing required by Rule 32.1(a)(2) is not a formal trial; the usual rules of evidence need not be applied.\u201d). Consequently, Santos-Ferrer\u2019s objections to the admission of Special Agent Lasota\u2019s testimony are simply misplaced. We have reviewed his other contentions and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
