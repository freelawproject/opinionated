He argues that: the sentence imposed by the district court violated his due process rights because the sentence was vindictive, the district court erred by adding a six-level increase to his total offense level based on facts not proven at trial nor stipulated to by him, the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence, the district court erred by adding a four-level increase to his total offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), and the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Washington may not bring a vindictiveness claim because his sentence on remand is lower than his original sentence. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>997 F.2d 30, 38 (5th Cir.1993). Washington\u2019s argument regarding the increase in his total offense level, which is based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>-U.S.-,-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2537, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 03-30437). The \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine precludes review of his remaining arguments. <em>See United States v. Becerra, </em>155 F.3d 740, 752 (5th Cir.1998). Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b781-42\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
