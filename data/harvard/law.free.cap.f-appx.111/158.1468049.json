These charges arose from his participation in a drug trafficking scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-18\">On appeal, Parris contends that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for violating \u00a7 924(c) and \u00a7 922(g), and thus, the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on these counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-19\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for judgment of acquittal de novo. <em>United States v. Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d 134, 136 (4th Cir.2001). Where, as here, the motion was based on insufficient evidence, \u201c[t]he verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). This Court \u201cha[s] defined \u2018substantial evidence,\u2019 in the context of a criminal action, as that evidence which \u2018a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>322 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862-63 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc)). This Court does not review the credibility of the witnesses and assumes that the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the Government. <em>United States v. Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-20\">Parris first alleges that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking scheme, in violation of \u00a7 924(c). In establishing a violation of \u00a7 924(c), the Government is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the firearm \u201cfurthered, advanced, or helped forward a drug trafficking crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Lomax, </em>293 F.3d 701, 705 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>denied, </em>537 U.S. 1031, 123 S.Ct. 555, 154 L.Ed.2d 448 (2002). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, and assuming the jury resolved all contradictions in favor of the Government, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to establish that Parris possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking scheme, in violation of \u00a7 924(c). <em>Glasser, </em>315 U.S. at 80, 62 S.Ct. 457; <em>Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 364; <em>Lomax, </em>293 F.3d at 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Parris also contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he was an unlawful drug user, rendering his firearm possession a violation of \u00a7 922(g)(3). In order to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 922(g)(3), the Government must prove that the Defendant\u2019s drug use was sufficiently consistent, \u201cprolonged,\u201d and close in time to his gun possession to put him on notice that he qualified as an unlawful user of drugs under the statute. <em>United States v. Purdy, </em>264 F.3d 809, 812 (9th Cir.2001) (recognizing that statute may not encompass a defendant whose illegal drug use was \u201cinfrequent\u201d or in the \u201cdistant past\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Jackson, </em>280 F.3d 403, 406 (4th Cir.2002) (finding that firearm possession and drug use need not be simultaneous). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, and assuming the jury resolved all contradictions in favor of the Government, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to establish that Parris was an unlawful user at the time he possessed the firearm. <em>Glasser, </em>315 U.S. at 80, 62 S.Ct. 457; <em>Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 364; <em>Jackson, </em>280 F.3d at 406.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s denial of Parris\u2019 motion for judgment of acquittal on both counts, <em>Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d at 136, and we affirm Parris\u2019 conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-19\">. We note that the Fifth Circuit decision relied on by Parris was vacated by that court\u2019s grant of en banc rehearing. <em>See United States v. Herrera, </em>289 F.3d 311 (5th Cir.), <em>vacated by, </em>313 F.3d 882 (5th Cir.2002) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1242, 123 S.Ct. 1375, 155 L.Ed.2d 213 (2003); <em>see generally Byrne v. Butler, </em>845 F.2d 501, 507 (5th Cir.1988) (recognizing circuit rule that grant of en banc rehearing vacates panel opinion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-20\">. On July 23, 2004, Parris filed a motion for leave to file a supplemental brief addressing the effect of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>-U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), on his sentence. We grant this motion. We deem the motion to be the supplemental brief, and we conclude that the <em>Blakely </em>claim is without merit. <em>See United States v. Hammoud, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.2004) (order), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>73 U.S.L.W. 3121, - U.S. -, - S.Ct. -, - L.Ed.2d -, 2004 WL 2153053 (U.S. Aug. 6, 2004) (No. 04-193), and 381 F.3d 316 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
