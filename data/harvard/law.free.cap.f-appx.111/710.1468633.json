Herron alleges that when the police arrived, they mistook his \u201cstate of unconsciousness\u201d for intoxication, treated him roughly, refused to let him attend to his wife as she was put into an ambulance, and attempted to force him to take a field sobriety test. He was arrested and taken to the city jail, allegedly without <em>Miranda </em>warnings. At the jail, he claims to have complied with the officers\u2019 attempts to give him sobriety tests until the point at which he realized that they were conspiring to charge him with a DWI. At the time of his arrest, Herron was on parole from a conviction for aggra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>vated sexual assault on a child. He was charged with DWI and failure to register as a sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Herron claims that for several days, while he was incarcerated at the city jail and later the county jail, various officers refused to inform him of his wife\u2019s condition or whereabouts and refused his requests for medical attention. He sued <em>pro se </em>and <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d), seeking dismissal of his DWI charge, $500,000 in compensatory damages for four days of \u201cpsychiatric abuse,\u201d and medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">After ordering a more definite statement from Herron, the district court dismissed his claims with prejudice as frivolous because they lacked an arguable basis in law. The court gave three reasons: (1) Herron had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with regard to his claims of prison conditions, as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); (2) Herron\u2019s claim for mental anguish was barred by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e), because he could not demonstrate sufficient physical injury; and (3) the <em>Miranda </em>claim was barred by <em>Younger </em>abstention.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">A district court may dismiss a prisoner\u2019s IFP claims as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. We review such a dismissal for abuse of discretion. <em>Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">\u201cThis Court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 1983 suit for failure to exhaust administrative remedies pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e.\u201d <em>Days v. Johnson, </em>322 F.3d 863, 866 (5th Cir.2003). Section 1997e(a) provides that \u201c[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">Herron admits that he has not exhausted the administrative remedies available at either of the jails. He argues, however that he did not exhaust the jail grievance procedures because it would have been futile, because the city and county procedures were not suitable to decide the federal issues that formed the basis of his complaint, that the grievance procedures were not meaningful, that monetary relief was not available, and that he was no longer incarcerated in the city jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">These reasons are unavailing, because \u201cit is not for the courts to inquire whether administrative procedures satisfy \u2018minimum acceptable standards\u2019 of fairness and effectiveness.\u201d <em>Alexander v. Tippah County, Miss., </em>351 F.3d 626 (5th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Booth v. Chumer, </em>532 U.S. 731, 740 n. 5, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001)). \u201cExhaustion is now mandatory, \u2018irrespective of the forms of relief sought and offered through administrative avenues.\u2019\u201d <em>Days, </em>322 F.3d at 866 (quoting <em>Booth, </em>532 U.S. at 739, 741 n. 6 (2001)). Therefore, the district court did not err in dismissing Herron\u2019s claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">Although the June 20 order was ineffective, we consider the district court\u2019s willingness to dismiss Herron\u2019s claims without prejudice and apply equitable tolling to allow him to exhaust his administrative remedies, along with our history of doing so in similar cases. <em>See, e.g. Clifford v. Gibbs, </em>298 F.3d 328, 333 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Wright v. Hollingsworth, </em>260 F.3d 357, 358 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, on the issue of jail conditions, we remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The district court dismissed Herron\u2019s claims of mental anguish and \u201cpsychiatric abuse\u201d pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e, which provides that \u201c[n]o federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner confined in jail, prison or other correctional facility for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.\u201d \u201cRelying on our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, we have determined that the \u2018physical injury1 required by \u00a7 1997e(e) must be more than de minimus [sic], but need not be significant.\u201d <em>Harper, </em>174 F.3d at 719 (citing <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191 (5th Cir.1997) (finding that where a guard twisted a prisoner\u2019s arm and twisted his ear, resulting in bruising and soreness for three days, the injury was <em>de minimis </em>and would not support a claim for mental or emotional suffering)).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Even if Herron\u2019s complaint is liberally construed regarding his claim for compensatory damages, the only possible claim of physical injury is rough handling, which resulted in a temporary increase of pain in his already injured neck. As in <em>Siglar, </em>this is at most a <em>de minimis </em>injury that will not support a claim of mental or emotional suffering.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, this alleged injury is insufficiently connected to the alleged cause of Herron\u2019s mental suffering, the \u201cpsychiatric abuse\u201d of refusing to inform him of his wife\u2019s condition or whereabouts, to satisfy \u00a7 1997e(e). Therefore, the dismissal as to Herron\u2019s claim for compensatory damages was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">We acknowledge that lawsuits by arrestees, detainees, or prisoners who cannot allege a sufficiently serious physical injury to support psychological injury are not necessarily barred altogether by \u00a7 1997e(e). Physical injury is a predicate to an award of compensatory damages for mental or emotional injury; its absence does not necessarily preclude recovery of, e.g., injunctive relief or nominal damages for constitutional injuries.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">Herron alleges that defendants maliciously inflicted psychological pain by refusing, for four days, to inform him of the condition of his seriously injured wife. Although such conduct, if true, is not acceptable, this is not the appropriate occasion to decide whether this can state a constitutional violation, because injunctive relief is inapposite here, and Herron has given no indication that he seeks nominal damages. His claim, instead, is for $500,000 in compensatory damages. Moreover, even if, hypothetically, we were to say that the failure to inform Herron of his wife\u2019s situation was a constitutional violation, that by no means would be a clearly established right that would benefit this plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-14\">The district court dismissed Herron\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>claim based on <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 45, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). A federal court cannot intervene in state criminal matters except in extraordinary circumstances, which Herron has not established. The district court was correct in its determination that Herron\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>claim was not a proper subject of this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-15\">In conclusion, the district court committed no error. We therefore AFFIRM the dismissal of Herron\u2019s claims, but we RE<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>MAND so that the court can change the dismissal of Herron\u2019s prison condition claims to one without prejudice and can apply equitable tolling if it sees fit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b743-10\"> Pursuant to 5th. Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b743-11\">. The district court entered judgment on April 24, 2003. Herron\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on June 2, more than 30 days after the entry of judgment. We remanded this case to the district court for a determination of whether Herron delivered his notice of appeal to prison officials in a timely manner on or before May 27, 2003. <em>Herron v. Patrolman # 1, </em>80 Fed.Appx. 946 (5th Cir.2003). The district court having determined that Herron had deposited his notice of appeal by that date, this appeal is properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">At the same time Herron filed his notice of appeal, he filed a pleading labeled an \"objection.\u201d The district court construed this pleading as a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion and granted relief in part. Its order of June 20, 2003, changed the dismissal of Herron\u2019s unexhausted medical care claims to without prejudice, and equitably tolled them to allow Herron to exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-17\">In his motion for reconsideration, Herron argues that the June 20 order superseded the April 24 order. Herron also avers, however, that his \"objection\u201d was directed toward his appeal, that he did not intend to file a rule 60(b) motion, and that the district court was without authority to amend its judgment after his appeal had been noticed. Whatever Herron\u2019s intentions, and irrespective of whether the district court properly construed his \"objection\u201d as a rule 60(b) motion, the district court was without jurisdiction to enter its June 20, 2003, order.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-18\">A notice of appeal divests the district court of jurisdiction except to take action in aid of the appeal. A district court may deny a rule 60(b) motion on the merits but may not grant rule 60(b) relief without authorization from this court. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. v. Liljeberg Enters., Inc., </em>38 F.3d 1404, 1408 n. 3 (5th Cir.1994). Therefore, Herron\u2019s motion to reconsider remand has been denied, and the operative final judgment is the order of April 24, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b745-8\">. For the same reason, Herron's allegations are insufficient to state a claim for excessive use of force.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b745-16\">. <em>See, e.g., Harper v.
