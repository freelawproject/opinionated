McTizic was sentenced, <em>inter alia, </em>to 77 months imprisonment. A district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cabrera, </em>288 F.3d 163, 168 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">McTizic claims the district court erred by engaging in \u201cdouble counting\u201d by relying on the \u201csame facts\u201d to impose both a four-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), for McTizic\u2019s role as a \u201cleader\u201d or \u201corganizer\u201d of the offense and a two-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(8)(c), for the \u201csophisticated means\u201d used to commit the offense. \u201cDouble counting\u201d under the guidelines is prohibited only if it is expressly forbidden by the guidelines being applied. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>145 F.3d 736, 737 (5th Cir.1998); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, comment. (n.4). Neither \u00a7 3B1.1 nor \u00a7 2B1.1 prohibit the cumulative application of the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">To the extent McTizic contests the imposition of the four-level organizer/leader increase under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), she has not established that the district court erred in concluding that the increase was warranted by her recruiting public employees to provide information crucial to the bank-fraud scheme and by her manufacturing fraudulent checks and identification documents. <em>See United States v. Stevenson, </em>126 F.3d 662, 664 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b287-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
