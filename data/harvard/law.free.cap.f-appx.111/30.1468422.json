The District Court <em>sua spowte </em>ordered dismissal of all of Moriarty\u2019s claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) in a memorandum of decision, filed June 3, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">The District Court dismissed Moriarty\u2019s claims against Smith, the Connecticut Claims Commissioner who dismissed Moriarty\u2019s claims in September 2002, on the basis that Smith was entitled to absolute judicial immunity. We vacate the District Court\u2019s order in this respect, and we remand the cause with the instruction to the District Court that it engage in a more thorough absolute judicial immunity determination. In making such a determination, we instruct the District Court to look to <em>Butz v. Economou, </em>438 U.S. 478, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978); <em>Cleavinger v. Saxner, </em>474 U.S. 193, 106 S.Ct. 496, 88 L.Ed.2d 507 (1985); and their progeny to evaluate whether Smith is entitled to absolute judicial immunity according to at least six factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-11\">(a) the need to assure that the individual can perform his functions without harassment or intimidation; (b) the presence of safeguards that reduce the need for private damages actions as a means of controlling unconstitutional conduct; (c) insulation from political influence; (d) the importance of precedent; (e) the adversary nature of the process; and (f) the correctability of error on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-12\"><em>Cleavinger, </em>474 U.S. at 202 (citing <em>Butz, </em>438 U.S. at 512).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">The District Court dismissed Moriarty\u2019s claims against Brooks and Strange on the grounds that Moriarty failed to allege that either had direct or personal involvement in the alleged deprivation of Moriarty\u2019s constitutional rights. With respect to the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Moriarty\u2019s claims against Strange, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-14\">With respect to the District Court\u2019s dismissal \u2014 and refusal to allow leave to amend \u2014 of Moriarty\u2019s claims against Brooks, however, we instruct the District Court to grant leave to Moriarty to amend his complaint so that, if he so wishes, Moriarty might state valid claims against Brooks. We note that Moriarty, in his brief to this Court, specifically asked that he be allowed to file an amended complaint <em>without </em>claims against Brooks. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 6. Nevertheless, Moriarty, in that same brief, also alleged facts that might be sufficient for supervisor responsibility on the part of Brooks if alleged in an amended complaint. <em>Compare </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 2 (\u201cBrooks ... was told of lack of proper equipment ... and ... on his weekly tours of the housing unit ... he was fully aware that empty (5) gallon buckets, chairs and overturned mop buck<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>ets were used as makeshift step ladders [of the sort from which Moriarty fell and injured himself].\u201d), <em>with Wright v. Smith, </em>21 F.3d 496, 501 (2d Cir.1994) (holding that a supervisor may be held personally responsible for the deprivation of constitutional rights if, <em>inter alia, </em>the supervisor (a) is aware of the deprivation and fails to remedy it; or (b) created, or allowed to continue, a policy in which unconstitutional practices occurred).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Although we note Moriarty\u2019s professed desire to file an amended complaint without claims against Brooks, we note also that: (1) <em>pro se </em>complaints are to be given a liberal reading, <em>see, e.g., Branum v. Clark, </em>927 F.2d 698, 705 (2d Cir.1991); (2) this principle is to be \u201capplied with particular strictness when [as here] the plaintiff complains of a civil rights violation,\u201d <em>id.; </em>and (3) Moriarty\u2019s brief on appeal suggests some confusion on his part and that he might be able \u2014 if given the opportunity\u2014 to state potentially valid claims against Brooks. Accordingly, we instruct the District Court to grant Moriarty leave to amend his complaint, in which Moriarty may file claims against Brooks, or anyone else \u2014 except Strange \u2014 he may allege was personally responsible for the alleged deprivation of his constitutionally protected liberty interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Accordingly, the order of the District Court is hereby VACATED in part, REMANDED in part, and AFFIRMED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
