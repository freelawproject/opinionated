Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 199\u2014 202 (5th Cir.1997). Vester alleged in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint that several defendants displayed deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs and that another defendant retaliated against him for filing a grievance concerning the medical claim. The district court dismissed the deliberate indifference claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915A and 1915(e)(2) because they lacked any arguable basis in fact or law. The remaining claim was dismissed by a judgment as a matter of law under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 after Vester failed to present any evidence at trial to support his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-22\">Vester has failed to address the district court\u2019s reason for dismissal. He has thereby waived any issue relevant to his entitlement to IFP status on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-23\">Vester fails to show that he could raise any nonfrivolous issue on appeal. His motion to proceed IFP is therefore DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 and n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-24\">To the extent Vester\u2019s brief may be liberally construed to seek transcripts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>without cost, that motion is DENIED. <em>See Harvey v. Andrist, </em>754 F.2d 569, 571 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">For purposes of the \u201cthree-strikes\u201d provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), the district court\u2019s dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915A and 1915(e)(2) counts as a strike, and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a second strike. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Accordingly, Vester is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; ALL OTHER MOTIONS DENIED; WARNING ISSUED UNDER 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
