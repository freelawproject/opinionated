Following his gambling and money-laundering convictions, the United States sought forfeiture of almost $1 million. The Regular Veterans Association (RVA) and Margaret Ford filed claims to the forfeited money. The district court dismissed RVA\u2019s claim without a hearing because RVA failed to present a prima facie case of entitlement to the forfeited money. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-19\">The details of Donald Ford\u2019s criminal conduct \u2014 summarized in <em>United States v. Ford. </em>Case 64 Fed.Appx. 976 (6th Cir.2003) \u2014 are not relevant to this appeal. After a federal jury found Ford guilty, the district court ordered Ford to forfeit money the United States seized during its investigation. After the United States published notice of the forfeiture, two claimants petitioned the district court asserting claims. RVA \u2014 a now-defunct organization that supported veterans\u2019 causes \u2014 filed a claim through its receiver, Walter Williams. RVA claimed ownership of the funds because Ford operated the bingo games through RVA groups he formed. Margaret Ford, Donald Ford\u2019s wife at the time of his illegal conduct, claimed a marital interest in the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-20\">At a status conference attended by both claimants, the district court ordered the United States and RVA to file a stipulation of facts regarding RVA\u2019s claim to the forfeited funds. The United States attempted to jointly prepare a stipulation with RVA, but RVA failed to cooperate in the process. After the joint-stipulations deadline passed, RVA filed its own unsupported \u201cstipulations,\u201d causing the United States to ask the district court to dismiss RVA\u2019s claim. More than one month later, RVA moved to set a discovery schedule and evidentiary-hearing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-21\">The district court dismissed RVA\u2019s claim because RVA failed to demonstrate a pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>ma facie case that it had a right to the forfeited funds. The district court also found that Margaret Ford established a marital claim to the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">RVA seeks to vindicate its claim on appeal and, if successful, to invalidate Margaret Ford\u2019s competing claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The district court dismissed RVA\u2019s petition without a hearing because RVA failed to establish a prima facie case of an ownership interest in the forfeited funds. To establish a prima facie case, a claimant must demonstrate either that it has a legal right, title, or interest in the forfeited money, or that it is a bona fide purchaser for value. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(n)(6); <em>United States v. Campos, </em>859 F.2d 1233, 1240 (6th Cir.1988). Despite having more than one year to present evidence in support of its claim, RVA failed to offer anything other than its wholly unsupported contention that the defunct organization\u2019s former association with Ford in running the bingo games entitled it to the forfeited proceeds. Without any evidence of RVA\u2019s interest in the forfeited sum, the district court properly dismissed RVA\u2019s claim, and we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\">. In light of our decision, we see no need to review RVA\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s decision upholding Margaret Ford's claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
