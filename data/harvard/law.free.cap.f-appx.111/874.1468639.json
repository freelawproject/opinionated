Rhoades, Sr., Senior United States District Judge for the Southern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b907-10\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">Defendant Armando Rodriguez-Samano appeals his sentence, contending that the district court erred in increasing his offense level by eight levels based on its conclusion that defendant\u2019s Arizona conviction for second degree escape constituted a crime of violence, and therefore an aggravated felony, for purposes of the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">The relevant guideline is U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), not U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. For purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), an \u201caggravated felony\u201d is defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. 3(A). That definition includes a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d in turn defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b) to include \u201cany ... offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b907-16\">Under our categorical approach, we consider the statutory definition of the prior offense of which the defendant was convicted. We must consider whether the \u201cfull range of conduct encompassed by the [state] statute\u201d constitutes a crime of violence and, therefore, an aggravated felony. <em>United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>247 F.3d 905, 909 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc). Second degree escape in Arizona may be committed in a number of different ways. <em>See </em>A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2503. For example, a person commits escape by knowingly leaving the person\u2019s house without permission while under house arrest. <em>See State v. Lane, </em>173 Ariz. 217, 841 P.2d 212, 214 (1992). Leaving one\u2019s house while under house arrest or returning without permission is not conduct that \u201cby its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force\u201d may be used in the course of committing the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-17\">In limited circumstances, we may apply a modified categorical approach to go beyond the statutory elements, but the record in this case does not include \u201c \u2018documentation or judicially noticeable facts that clearly establish that the conviction is a predicate conviction for enhancement purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d at 1203 (quoting <em>Rivera-Sanchez, </em>247 F.3d at 908 (en banc) (quoting <em>United States v. Casarez-Bravo, </em>181 F.3d 1074, 1077 (9th Cir.1999))). Although the indictment suggests that defendant was charged with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>crime of violence, the indictment by itself is insufficient to establish that defendant pled guilty to a crime of violence. <em>See Coronar-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d at 1211 (\u201c[I]f a defendant enters a guilty plea, the sentencing court may consider the charging documents <em>in conjunction with </em>the plea agreement, the transcript of the plea proceeding, or the judgment to determine whether the defendant pled guilty to the elements of the generic crime.\u201d) (emphasis added). Moreover, although the state court criminal judgment indicates that defendant was charged with a felony rather than a misdemeanor, it gives no details regarding the facts surrounding defendant\u2019s escape attempt and, therefore, does not establish that defendant\u2019s conviction was actually of such a nature as to meet the definition of a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Accordingly, we VACATE and REMAND for resentencing. On remand, the district court may consider any other documents appropriate under our modified categorical approach. <em>See Corono-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d at 1211.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b907-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
