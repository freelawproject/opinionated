Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">In her appeal, filed pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), counsel for Court-right asserts there are no non-frivolous issue for appeal but raises first the question of whether Courtright\u2019s plea was made knowingly and voluntarily. We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court\u2019s plea colloquy with Court-right fully complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. Accordingly, we deny this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-16\">Courtright\u2019s remaining issue questions the district court\u2019s application of a career offender enhancement pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2002). Criminal defendants may waive their statutory right to direct appeal as part of a plea agreement with the Government. <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992). Courtright\u2019s plea agreement clearly waives her right to challenge either her sentence or its calculation as long as it does not exceed the maximum sentence provided by law. Because Court-right\u2019s sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum, and because we find that Courtright entered her plea knowingly and voluntarily with full knowledge of the effect of the waiver provision in the plea agreement, we conclude that she is precluded from raising this claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-17\">Finding no meritorious issues upon our review of the record, we affirm the judgment of the district court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We also deny Courtright\u2019s motion to relieve and substitute her attorney. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b728-12\"> Courtright has filed a motion to file a supplemental brief addressing the issues raised by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling in <em>Blakely v. </em>Washington,-U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). We grant her motion and deem it to provide the supplemental argument regarding the effects of <em>Blakely. </em>We have considered the applicability of <em>Blakely </em>to the federal sentencing guidelines and have concluded that their application by a district court comports with the requirements of the Sixth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Hammoud, </em>381 F.3d 316, 353-354 (4th Cir.2004) (No. 03-4253) (en banc); <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.2004) (order), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>73 U.S.L.W. 3121,-U.S.-,-S.Ct.-,-L.Ed. 2d-(U.S. Aug. 6, 2004) (No. 04-193). We therefore deny relief on Courtright\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>claim and deny her motion to hold her appeal in abeyance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
