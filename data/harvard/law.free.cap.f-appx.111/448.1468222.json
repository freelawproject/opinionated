We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Celis-Castellano v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 888, 890-91 (9th Cir.2002). We grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The IJ abused his discretion by denying Chavez\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Jerezano v. INS, </em>169 F.3d 613, 615 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that denying a petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen when he arrived 15 to 20 minutes late was an abuse of discretion). Chavez stated in his motion to reopen that automobile problems caused him to arrive late for his deportation hearing, although his attorney was present when the IJ ordered him deported in absentia. Chavez stated that he arrived while court was still in session, and the IJ informed him, off the record, to talk to his lawyer because he had already been ordered deported in absentia. In light of these facts, the BIA erred in upholding the IJ\u2019s denial of Chavez\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The contention that the BIA\u2019s decision without opinion violates due process is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 851 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"Aluh\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b481-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
