See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2004) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). We will reverse the Board only if the evidence \u201c \u2018was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">Additionally, we uphold the Board\u2019s denial of Mohamed\u2019s application for withholding of removal. The standard for withholding of removal is \u201cmore stringent than that for asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). An applicant for withholding must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). As Mohamed failed to establish refugee status, he cannot satisfy the higher standard necessary for withholding.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">Finally, we conclude substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Mohamed did not establish it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to Sudan, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2) (2004), and thus, that the IJ properly denied Mohamed\u2019s petition for protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">Accordingly, we deny Mohamed\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-15\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
