Citing <em>United States v. Doggett, </em>230 F.3d 160, 164-65 (5th Cir.2000), and for the first time on appeal, Watts contends that his revocation sentence was unlawfully imposed. Specifically, Watts asserts that, because his superseding indictment failed to allege a specific drug quantity, his underlying drug conspiracy conviction carried a 20-year maximum sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), thereby rendering it a Class C felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3). Watts maintains that his revocation sentence could not exceed two years pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Watts secondarily argues that, assuming his case is remanded for resentencing, any additionally imposed supervised release term would result in an <em>ex post facto </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">Watts neither directly appealed from, nor sought collateral review of, his underlying conviction and sentence. He may not do so on appeal from the revocation of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Moody, </em>277 F.3d 719, 720-21 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
