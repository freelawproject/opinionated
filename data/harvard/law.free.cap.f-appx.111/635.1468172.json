In June 2003, Wilder filed an amended complaint, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, against Thompson, Slack, and the Village. She asserted that all three parties were liable for various constitutional torts, including false arrest, excessive force, malicious prosecution, and violations of her First Amendment rights. In October 2003, the district court (Platt, <em>J.) </em>issued an unpublished order granting summary judgment in favor of defendants-appellants on all of Wilder\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">We agree for substantially the reasons given by the district court that the defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the claims set forth in Wilder\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">We have considered all of Wilder\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
