Henry seeks his immediate release from incarceration and damages for the defendants\u2019 actions stemming from his arrest and trial and the forfeiture of his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">In November 2003, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and motion for summary judgment. The court concluded that Henry\u2019s claims arising out of the forfeiture proceeding are barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, <em>see District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 482, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co,, </em>263 U.S. 413, 416, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923), which prohibits federal district courts from considering claims that are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with prior state-court determinations. The district court noted that to the extent that the complaint asserts that the federal criminal charges and the state forfeiture action violate principles of double jeopardy, there is no general constitutional bar to duplicative prosecutions in state and federal court. <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 112, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). The court also concluded that it could not consider Henry\u2019s claims regarding the validity of his criminal conviction until his direct appeals are exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">On an appeal from a dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>Luckett v. Bure, </em>290 F.3d 493, 496 (2d Cir.2002). We also review de novo orders granting motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment. <em>Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir.2002) (motion to dismiss); <em>Mario v. P &amp; C Food Markets, Inc., </em>313 F.3d 758, 763 (2d Cir.2002) (summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">The district court correctly concluded that it was barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine from considering Henry\u2019s claim arising out of the forfeiture proceeding. A review of the complaint would necessitate an inquiry into the propriety of the state court\u2019s judgment declaring Henry\u2019s vehicle to be forfeit. Such an inquiry is precisely the type that <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>precludes. <em>See Moccio v. New York State Office of Court Admin., </em>95 F.3d 195, 197 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">With respect to Henry\u2019s double jeopardy claim, the district court correctly noted that there is no general constitutional bar to duplicative prosecutions in state and federal court. <em>Koon, </em>518 U.S. at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">Finally, Henry\u2019s first and second causes of action assert that the defendants lied to obtain a search warrant, planted evidence, destroyed exculpatory evidence, and violated Henry\u2019s constitutional rights when they did not allow him to use the telephone after his arrest. Henry also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>makes allegations of false arrest and malicious prosecution. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), requires dismissal of these claims. In <em>Heck, </em>the Supreme Court held that in order to recover damages for an allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a section 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to do so, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87. A claim for damages based on a conviction or sentence that has not been so invalidated is not cognizable under section 1983. <em>Id. </em>at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Here, the criminal proceeding in which the challenged actions occurred is pending on appeal. Because Henry has not had his conviction invalidated, pursuant to <em>Heck, </em>his section 1983 claim, if any, has not yet accrued. <em>See Covington v. City of New York, </em>171 F.3d 117, 119, 122 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
