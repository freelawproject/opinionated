We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence and will reverse the BIA\u2019s determination only if the petitioner shows that the evidence compels such a result. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding. The BIA offered specific, cogent reasons for finding petitioner\u2019s testimony vague and lacking in detail regarding his beatings and for finding that his documentary evidence was inconsistent with his testimony. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001). Because these discrepancies went to the heart of petitioner\u2019s asylum claim, substantial evidence supports the denial of asylum. <em>See id. </em>Because petitioner failed to establish eligibility for asylum, it follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In addition, substantial evidence supports the denial of relief under CAT. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b557-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
