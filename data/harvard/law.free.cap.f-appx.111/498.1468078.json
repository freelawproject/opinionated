We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We previously affirmed Booth\u2019s conviction for fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, and money laundering, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956, but vacated Booth\u2019s original sentence and remanded for resentencing. <em>United States v. Booth, </em>309 F.3d 566, 578 (9th Cir.2002). Booth contends that when a case is remanded on an \u201copen record\u201d pursuant to <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>278 F.3d 880 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc), the resentencing court may not consider sentencing issues decided at the original sentencing hearing that went unchallenged during the prior appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\"><em>Matthews </em>did not disturb the general rule that the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine does not preclude a resentencing court from \u201creconsider[ing] the entire sentencing package, including the factual findings regarding the relatedness of prior convictions used in calculating [defendant\u2019s] criminal history.\u201d <em>United States v. Allen, </em>153 F.3d 1037, 1043 (9th Cir.1998); <em>see also United States v. Petty, </em>80 F.3d 1384, 1388 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that a resentencing court may reconsider a defendant\u2019s criminal history category as long as the appellate court did not \u201cexpressly or [implicitly] limit[ ] the remand to only a portion of the sentence\u201d). In fact, in <em>Matthews </em>we reiterated the established principle that \u201c[o]n remand, the district court generally should be free to consider any matters relevant to sentencing, even those that may not have been raised at the first sentencing hearing, as if it were sentencing de novo.\u201d <em>Matthews, </em>278 F.3d at 885-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">In our prior decision, we vacated Booth\u2019s original sentence and remanded the case for resentencing in accordance with <em>Matthews. Booth, </em>309 F.3d at 578. We did not expressly limit the issues to be considered on remand, and did not implicitly preclude the district court from reconsidering Booth\u2019s criminal history category. Therefore, when the district court recalculated Booth\u2019s criminal history category at his resentencing, it did not exceed our mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">In his post-briefing letter submitted pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 28(j), Booth raises several new issues under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), arguing that he was entitled to have a jury determine the amount of money laundered and whether he was an organizer and leader. He also contends that the district court\u2019s upward departure of one criminal history category, from Category IV to Category V, is subject to the constraints of <em>Blakely. Blakely </em>specifically exempts from its reach only \u201cthe fact of a prior conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>2536 (quoting <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000)). Here, in upwardly departing, the district court specifically relied on \u201cpri- or similar misconduct established by a civil adjudication\u201d (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)) and \u201cprior similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in a criminal conviction\u201d (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(e)). By definition, of course, neither of these categories represents \u201ca prior conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Although we have held that <em>Blakely </em>applies at least to certain aspects of the federal guideline sentencing scheme, <em>United States v. Ameline </em>376 F.3d 967 (9th Cir.2004), the Supreme Court has agreed to hear two cases early in the next term to resolve that very issue. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 159 L.Ed.2d 838 (2004); <em>United States v. Fanfan, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 12, 159 L.Ed.2d 838 (2004) (No. 04-105). In <em>Ameline, </em>we also held that, in light of the sea change in sentencing effected by <em>Blakely, </em>we could examine <em>sua sponte </em>the effect of <em>Blakely </em>on the case before us, even though the issues were not raised by the parties. <em>Id. </em>at 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">Because the circumstances in this case are similar to those in <em>United States v. Castro, </em>382 F.3d 927 (9th Cir.2004), with respect to the disparity between a \u201csentence ... based only on the facts that were found by the jury\u201d and the sentence imposed, which was based in part on facts \u201cfound by the judge,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 928-29, we likewise remand Booth\u2019s sentence \u201cfor such further proceedings as the district court deems appropriate under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 929. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b531-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
