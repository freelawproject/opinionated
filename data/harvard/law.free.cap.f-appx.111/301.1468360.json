Holloway alleged that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs when he had a heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-22\">Holloway\u2019s claim has an arguable basis in law. <em>See Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104-06, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976); <em>Stewart v. Murphy, </em>174 F.3d 530, 533-534 (5th Cir.1999). Because Holloway\u2019s claim is not \u201cbased on an indisputably meritless legal theory,\u201d it is not frivolous, although it may ultimately be determined to be without merit. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989); <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of this action as frivolous is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-23\">Additionally, our review of the record shows Holloway indicated in his complaint that he had not exhausted the prison\u2019s grievance procedure. Exhaustion of administrative remedies is a threshold requirement for the filing of a prisoner \u00a7 1983 action. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); <em>Porter v. Nussle, </em>534 U.S. 516, 524-32, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002); <em>Wendell </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number><em>v. Asher, </em>162 F.3d 887, 890-91 (5th Cir.1998). Therefore, on remand, the district court should make a determination whether Holloway has exhausted administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
