We granted Brown a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside or correct his sentence. Brown contends that the district court erred in denying his claim that his trial counsel was ineffective. Brown asserts that a Louisiana court\u2019s authorization for law-enforcement officials to gather evidence using a wiretap was granted in contravention of that state\u2019s law, so the wiretap evidence should have been suppressed before trial. Brown\u2019s counsel erred, he charges, for fading to challenge the admission of the wiretap evidence on this ground and thereby failing to preserve the issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-15\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(2), a state court may authorize a wiretap in conformity with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518 and with the applicable state wiretap authorization statute. The Louisiana Electronic Surveillance Act requires judges to question an informant before granting a wiretap authorization if the application relies on the informant\u2019s statements to establish probable cause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On direct appeal to us, we agreed with Brown\u2019s argument that (1) the Louisiana court failed to examine the confidential informants before granting the wiretap authorization, and (2) the confidential informants\u2019 information was essential to the required finding of probable cause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We did not reverse Brown\u2019s conviction, however, because the wiretap authorization was supported by probable cause and was valid under all federal law except for the provision making the Louisiana statute applicable. In the absence of a timely objection, our review was for plain error, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>which we concluded the district court had not committed in admitting the wiretap evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">To prevail on a \u00a7 2255 claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must demonstrate that his counsel committed errors so grave as to deprive him of his Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial and that his counsel\u2019s deficient performance actually prejudiced the proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Counsel\u2019s deficient performance must fall below the standard for reasonably effective assistance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance is highly deferential; the court must judge the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s performance in light of all the circumstances at the time.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that Brown has not shown that his counsel\u2019s mistake rises to the level of constitutionally deficient assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The attorney whose performance is at issue in this petition was third in a succession of attorneys who represented Brown during his criminal trial and appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court appointed counsel in question approximately seven weeks before Brown\u2019s trial. Before this counsel was appointed, Brown\u2019s second attorney had filed, and the magistrate judge had ruled on, a detailed motion to suppress the wiretap evidence. The motion raised four arguments that the wiretap authorization did not comply with state law and charged that the authorization was unsupported by probable cause. The motion did not, however, specifically allege that the issuing state judge had relied on the statements of confidential informants whom the judge had not examined. The magistrate judge rejected Brown\u2019s arguments and refused to exclude the evidence, noting that, even if the motion was unsupported by probable cause, the officers\u2019 good faith reliance on the wiretap authorization would also justify admitting the evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-15\">Under these circumstances, we cannot agree that Brown\u2019s subsequent counsel provided ineffective assistance. Counsel\u2019s predecessor had made lengthy and detailed arguments for suppressing the wiretap evidence, each of which was rejected by the court. Further, the court offered the separate, additional ground of good faith, on which it would uphold the wiretap evidence regardless of the authorization\u2019s validity. Without any controlling precedent <em>requiring </em>suppression of the evidence because of the state judge\u2019s failure to examine police informants, Brown\u2019s next lawyer was not unreasonable in not filing yet another attack on the wiretap evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, we ruled on direct appeal that \u201cthe error was not apparent on the face of the wiretap authorization\u201d because it was sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>ported by probable cause and was valid under federal law. We do not require <em>appellate </em>counsel to raise every possible nonfrivolous claim on appeal; neither do we second-guess <em>trial </em>counsel\u2019s decision not to revisit an issue previously briefed extensively and decided adversely to the client.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Brown also seeks to raise an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel issue that was not raised in his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. Specifically, he argues that his counsel should have challenged the jurisdiction of the Louisiana state judge who approved the wiretap authorizations, because not all of the phone numbers under surveillance were located within St. Tammany Parish. We will not entertain this claim because our review is restricted to the issue or issues for which a COA was granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(3); <em>Lackey v.
