A certificate of appeal-ability will not issue for claims addressed by a district court absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001); <em>see also Reid, </em>369 F.3d at 370 (applying the certificate of appealability requirement to appeals of denials of motions for reconsideration). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Gregory has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We deny Gregory\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>motions for review of his claim pursuant to <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-18\">. By order filed April 5, 2004, this appeal was placed in abeyance for <em>Jones v. Braxton, </em>No. 03-6891. In view of our recent decision in <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363 (4th Cir.2004), we no longer find it necessary to hold this case in abeyance for <em>Jones.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b204-24\">. To the extent this appeal could be construed as a motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, <em>see United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200 (4th Cir.2003), we deny authorization.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
