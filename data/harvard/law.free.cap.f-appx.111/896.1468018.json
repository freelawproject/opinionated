We review the Commission\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78y(a)(4); <em>Krull v. SEC, </em>248 F.3d 907, 911 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-24\">In his April 21,1997, affidavit, Petitioner swore that he had not \u201ctransferred\u201d the stocks for which he was requesting a replacement certificate. He argues that this statement was true, whereas the Commission found that it was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-25\">Both parties agree that Petitioner transferred his shares to Coleman in satisfaction of his outstanding note, when he executed an irrevocable stock power in favor of Coleman in January 1997. Substantial evidence in the record supports the Commission\u2019s further finding that those shares were never transferred back to Petitioner. For example, Petitioner requested that re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>placement stock certificates be sent directly to Coleman when the originals were lost, and the certificates stayed in Coleman\u2019s possession. Nine days after the supposed transfer back to Petitioner, he insisted that the shares were not his, that they had been \u201cincorrectly journaled\u201d in his account, and that this notation should be removed; Coleman complied with his request. Moreover, the March 27 agreement, which Petitioner signed, provided that \u201cColeman shall retain\u201d the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b928-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
