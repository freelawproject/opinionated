The California Court of Appeal dismissed Tatarinov\u2019s appeal on April 28,1997, the decision became final on May 28,1997,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the one-year limitations period expired on May 29, 1998.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Tatarinov\u2019s federal habeas petition was not filed until October 11, 2002, and is therefore time barred unless he is entitled to tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Tatarinov argues that he is entitled to tolling under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D) because he could not have discovered the factual predicate of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim until either 2000 or 2001. However, Tatarinov\u2019s own declaration stated that he discovered his attorney\u2019s deficient performance no later than mid-to-late 1998. At that point, Tatarinov had a colorable ineffective assistance of counsel claim and the AEDPA statute of limitations clock started ticking. <em>See Hasan v. Galaza, </em>254 F.3d 1150, 1154 n. 3 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cThis is not to say that [petitioner] needed to understand the legal significance of those facts-rather than simply the facts themselves-before the due diligence (and hence the limitations) clock started ticking.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">Tatarinov also argues that the egregious misconduct of his attorney constituted \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d that warrant equitable tolling of AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations. We allow for equitable tolling of AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period when \u201cextraordinary circumstances beyond a prisoner\u2019s control make it impossible to file a petition on time\u201d and \u201cthe extraordinary circumstances were the cause of his untimeliness.\u201d <em>Spitsyn v. Moore, </em>345 F.3d 796, 799 (9th Cir.2003) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Even if we accept that Tatarinov\u2019s attorney\u2019s conduct constituted \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d those circumstances effectively ended when Tatarinov was made aware of the true state of his legal representation in mid-to-late 1998. At that point, any equitable tolling ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">Under either analysis, Tatarinov\u2019s federal habeas petition should have been filed no later than the end of 1999. The district court correctly held that the petition filed in 2002 was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b491-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-10\">.

Tatarinov\u2019s one-year statute of limitations began to run on May 29, 1997, the day after his conviction became final. <em>See Corjasso v.
