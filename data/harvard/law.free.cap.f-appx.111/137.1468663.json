Duff, Jr., appeals from a summary judgment entered in favor of the Commissioner of Social Security. Duff alleges that he has been unable to work since April of 2001 due to chronic physical pain in his right arm resulting from his employment as a data entry coordinator. Between May of 2000 and the conclusion of his hearings before an ALJ in February of 2002, Duff consulted a series of physicians, was the subject of numerous diagnostic studies, and underwent three operations. No consensus emerged as to the precise cause of the pain in Duffs right arm and that pain did not materially diminish as a result of the various treatments he received. The ALJ denied Duffs Supplemental Security Income claim, concluding that Duff retained the residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work with a sit-stand option. The Appeals Court denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-23\">Before us, Duff insists that: (1) the ALJ failed to give appropriate weight to Dr. Hagert and Dr. VanSwearingen, treating physicians, and Ms. Singerman, a licensed physical therapist who treated Duff; (2) the finding that Duff retains the residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work is not supported by substantial evidence; and (3) the ALJ\u2019s rejection of Duffs testimony regarding totally disabling pain is similarly unsupported.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>We have carefully reviewed the opinion of the ALJ and, essentially for the reasons given in the District Court\u2019s thorough opinion, find each of these challenges to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
