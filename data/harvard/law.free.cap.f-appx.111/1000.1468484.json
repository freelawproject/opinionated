On appeal, Moore argues that 1) the district court erred in imposing consecutive sentences for his three firearm convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; and 2) the indictment failed to specify whether Moore was charged as an aider and abettor under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a) or \u00a7 2(b). <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">1. Moore must obtain a COA to pursue this appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). To be entitled to a COA, he must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make this showing, Moore must establish that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved [by the district court] in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted). Moore has failed to make that showing. For substantially the reasons relied upon by the district court, therefore, we DENY Moore a COA and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">. Moore now argues that <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>- U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), supports this claim for relief. The Supreme Court decided <em>Blakely </em>just after the district court denied Moore \u00a7 2255 relief. Because Moore\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>argument was not before the district court when it considered his \u00a7 2255 motion, we will not address it here. <em>See United States v. Mora, </em>293 F.3d 1213, 1218 (10th Cir.2002) (noting, in \u00a7 2255 proceeding, that appellate court ordinarily does not consider issues raised for first time on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1033-20\">. In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Moore asserted additional claims, alleging his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to consecutive sentences for two of Moore\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) convictions, the indictment\u2019s failing to specify whether Moore was charged under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a) or \u00a7 2(b), the government's withholding evidence, a government\u2019s witness\u2019s perjured testimony, and the government\u2019s failing to prove that the banks that were robbed were federally insured. Moore further alleged that the government falsified evidence it presented against him. Moore, however, does not reassert these claims now on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
