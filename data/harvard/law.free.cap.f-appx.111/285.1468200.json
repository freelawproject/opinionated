The district court declined to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over Price\u2019s state law claims, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. 1441(c)(2004); they were dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Price\u2019s 24 September 2008 notice of appeal from the 29 August 2008 final judgment does not include the 29 October 2003 denial of Price\u2019s 8 September 2003 Rule 59(a) \u201cPlaintiffs Motion for Reconsideration (New Trial) and Motion for Leave to Amend Pleadings\u201d. <em>See </em>Fed.
