Pace appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his requests for both a stay of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceedings and the transcript of his grand jury proceedings. Pace contends that the grand jury transcript is necessary for the development and resolution of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceedings, which were still pending when he filed his notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-24\">The district court entered final judgment in Paces\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceedings during the pendency of this appeal. However, Pace\u2019s premature notice of appeal precludes appellate jurisdiction because the district court could not have certified pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) the order appealed as final. <em>See Young v. Equifax Credit Info. Servs., </em>294 F.3d 631, 634 n. 2 (5th Cir.2002); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Additionally, the order appealed is not a nonfinal judgment to which the collateral order exception applies. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292; <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Carp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). Moreover, orders de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>nying discovery requests incident to a pending action are not immediately appeal-able, save certain narrow exceptions inapplicable to the instant case. <em>See Piratello v. Philips Elecs. N. America Corp., </em>360 F.3d 506, 508 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Texaco, Inc. v. Louisiana Land &amp; Exploration Co., </em>995 F.2d 43, 43-44 (5th Cir.1993). We therefore lack jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">MOTION TO DISMISS GRANTED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b800-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
