See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b982-20\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b982-21\">Francisco Olea-Pino appeals the sentence imposed following his guilty plea to unlawful reentry by a deported, removed and/or excluded alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Olea-Pino asserts that the elements of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) must be pled in the indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-22\">The indictment here did not specifically charge that Olea-Pino committed an offense under \u00a7 1326(b)(2); it charged him under \u00a7 1326(a). As the Supreme Court has clearly held, that was proper because \u00a7 1326(b)(2) \u201cis a penalty provision, which simply authorizes a court to increase the sentence for a recidivist. It does not define a separate crime. Consequently, neither the statute not the Constitution requires the Government to charge the factor that it mentions, an earlier conviction, in the indictment.\u201d <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-23\">Olea-Pino argues that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), changes that. It does not. <em>See United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1119, 1127 (9th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 414 (9th Cir.2000). Nor does <em>Ring v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number><em>Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 609, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), for it, too, excepts prior convictions from its strictures. <em>Id. </em>at 597 n. 4, 122 S.Ct. 2428. Nor does <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). <em>See United States v. Quintana-Quintana, </em>No. 03-50254, slip op. 13291, 13292 (9th Cir. Sept. 13, 2004). Finally, as we said in <em>Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d at 414, we cannot \u201cignore controlling Supreme Court authority. Unless and until <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is overruled by the Supreme Court, we must follow it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b982-24\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
