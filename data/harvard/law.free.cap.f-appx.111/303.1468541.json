Johnson has failed to brief his claims arising under the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Accordingly, these issues are deemed abandoned on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Johnson argues that the district court erred in dismissing his failure-to-protect and inadequate-medical-care claims arising under the Eighth Amendment. Johnson\u2019s failure-to-protect allegations do not establish that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to an excessive risk to his safety. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Similarly, Johnson\u2019s inadequate-medical-care claims, at best, demonstrate disagreement with his medical treatment. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Johnson\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Johnson\u2019s complaint as frivolous counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the dismissal of this appeal. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Johnson is CAUTIONED if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes,\u201d he will no longer be allowed to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
