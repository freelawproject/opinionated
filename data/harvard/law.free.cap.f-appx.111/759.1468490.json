Ahorukomeye argues that the BIA erred in determining that he had not established entitlement to asylum and withholding of removal under both the INA and the CAT based on both his own testimony and documentary evidence submitted to the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">This court will uphold the factual findings that an alien is not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal if those findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78-79 (5th Cir.1994). The substantial evidence standard requires that the decision be based on the evidence presented and that the decision be substantially reasonable. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). The BIA\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, and the record does not compel a contrary conclusion as to either Ahorukomeye\u2019s INA claims or his CAT claim. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Ahorukomeye\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b792-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
