We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-21\">Russell first claims that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) failed to properly assess her credibility and lacked an adequate foundation for finding her subjective complaints of pain \u201cnot entirely credible.\u201d One of the reasons the ALJ partially discounted Russell\u2019s testimony was because \u201cshe failed to follow prescribed treatment on a regular basis.\u201d We have examined the record and find substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding of \u201csporadic adherence to prescribed therapy.\u201d A claimant\u2019s failure to follow prescribed medical treatment contradicts subjective complaints of disabling conditions and supports an ALJ\u2019s decision to deny benefits. <em>See Tsarelka v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>842 F.2d 529, 534 (1st Cir.1988) (per curiam) (affirming denial of benefits where claimant did not follow through with securing medical treatment); <em>Dumas v. Schweiker, </em>712 F.2d 1545, 1553 (2d Cir.1983) (affirming denial of benefits where claimant failed to heed doctor\u2019s diet recommendation which would have helped hypertension and headaches).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-22\">Russell next claims that the ALJ erred in determining that she had the residual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>functional capacity to perform light work. The ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity determination has substantial support in the record. We have considered Russell\u2019s various arguments and find them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Finally, Russell claims that the ALJ erred in using the Medical-Vocational Guidelines to determine the range of work that she could perform because her migraine headaches cause non-exertional limitations that called for testimony from a vocational expert. There is substantial support for the ALJ\u2019s finding that Russell\u2019s migraines had no non-exertional impact on her residual functional capacity. Accordingly, the ALJ did not err in applying the Guidelines. <em>Cf. Ortiz v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>890 F.2d 520, 524 (1st Cir.1989) (per curiam) (noting that Guidelines are not applicable where claimant has significant non-exertional impairments).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The judgment of the district court is <em>affirmed. See </em>1st Cir. R. 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
