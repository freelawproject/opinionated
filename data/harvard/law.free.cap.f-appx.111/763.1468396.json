Hulumba has filed a petition for review of the summary dismissal by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) of his appeal from the denial of political asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. Summary dismissal is authorized if, among other things, the appellant indicates on the notice of appeal form \u201cthat he or she will file a brief or statement in support of the appeal and, thereafter, does not file such brief or statement, or reasonably explain his or her failure to do so, within the time set for filing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E) (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Hulumba, represented by counsel, indicated on the notice of appeal form (Form EOIR-26) that he would file a brief, then failed to do so. Further, Hulumba failed to avail himself of the provision for lenity in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E) when he did not explain his failure to file a brief or statement within the time in which he had to file the brief or separate statement. Thus, the BIA was within its \u201cstatutorily designated discretion\u201d to dismiss Hulumba\u2019s appeal summarily. <em>See Rioja v. Ashcroft, </em>317 F.3d 514, 515-16 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, this court need not reach Hulumba\u2019s argument that his notice of appeal otherwise apprised the BIA of the bases of his appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">Hulumba\u2019s argument that his due process rights were violated because he was entitled to \u201ca fully explained decision\u201d is unavailing given that the BIA had statutory authority to dismiss Hulumba\u2019s appeal summarily for failure to file a brief or a separate written statement. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E); <em>Rioja, </em>317 F.3d at 516. Hulumba does not argue, and the record does not indicate, that Hulumba lacked notice of the BIA\u2019s statutory authority to dismiss his appeal summarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">Hulumba\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b796-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
