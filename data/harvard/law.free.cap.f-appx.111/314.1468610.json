He was sentenced as a career offender to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, he argues that the district court failed to comply with Fed. R.CrimP. 32(i)(3)(B) by failing to rule on his objection to the use of two prior convictions to enhance his sentence as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">As an initial matter, we GRANT the Government\u2019s motion to unseal the district court\u2019s Statement of Reasons and to take judicial notice of its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The district court\u2019s compliance with Rule 32 is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>United, States v. Medina, </em>161 F.3d 867, 874 (5th Cir.1998). Rule 32(i)(3)(B) requires a district court to either \u201crule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing.\u201d A defendant generally is provided adequate notice of the district court\u2019s resolution of disputed facts when the court adopts the findings of the presentence report. <em>United States v. Mora, </em>994 F.2d 1129, 1141 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The district court\u2019s statements at the sentencing hearing indicate that the district court was overruling Cotton\u2019s objection and relying on the PSR\u2019s recommendation. Furthermore, the district court specifically adopted the PSR\u2019s factual findings and guideline application in its written Statement of Reasons. Therefore, we conclude that the district court satisfied the requirements of Rule 32. <em>See Mora, </em>994 F.2d at 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
