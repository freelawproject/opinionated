Bakre, Texas inmate #784509, appeals the dismissal of his civil rights suit, filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, after the jury found for the defendant. Bakre challenges the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. Bakre\u2019s substantial rights were not affected by the introduction of his counsel substitute\u2019s notes in lieu of her live testimony. <em>See Brunet v. United Gas Pipeline Co., </em>15 F.3d 500, 505 (5th Cir.1994). Bakre stipulated to the notes in lieu of live testimony, and the district court told the jury that the notes represented what counsel substitute\u2019s remarks were at the disciplinary hearing. Bakre\u2019s argument that the district court unfairly told the district court about other court cases lacks merit inasmuch at the district court referenced those cases outside the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-24\">Bakre\u2019s substantial rights were not affected when his disciplinary record was shown to the jury. <em>See Brunet, </em>15 F.3d at 505. Evidence of his disciplinary record until the August 26, 1998, disciplinary hearing was probative of the appropriateness of the punishment he received after the August 26, 1998, hearing. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 404(b); <em>Hart v. Hairston, </em>343 F.3d 762, 764 (5th Cir.2003). Evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Bakre\u2019s disciplinary record after the August 26, 1998, was not probative. However, the evidence did not affect Bakre\u2019s substantial rights given that the charging officer\u2019s report was evidence that Sulewski did not retaliate against Bakre. <em>See Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir.1995); see <em>also Hudson v. Johnson, </em>242 F.3d 534, 536 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Bakre\u2019s substantial rights were not affected by the district court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of counsel substitute\u2019s notes of the April 8, 1998, disciplinary hearing inasmuch as the fairness of that hearing was not at issue. <em>See Brunet, </em>15 F.3d at 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Bakre\u2019s argument that the jury\u2019s verdict was contrary to the law and evidence lacks merit given that the charging officer\u2019s report was evidence that Sulewski did not retaliate against Bakre. <em>See Flowers v. Southern Regional Physician Services, Inc., </em>247 F.3d 229, 238 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Woods, </em>60 F.3d at 1166; <em>see also, Hudson, </em>242 F.3d at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b741-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
