Mendez and Yadira Mendez, natives and citizens of Mexico, petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) summary affirmance of the immigration judge\u2019s denial of their applications for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-21\">Petitioners contend that the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance does not comport with due process requirements. This contention is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849-52 (9th Cir.2003) (holding the BIA\u2019s streamlining procedure does not violate an alien\u2019s due process rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-22\">Petitioners also contend that no asylum case could ever properly be streamlined by the BIA under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1 because asylum cases invariably involve a \u201cnovel fact situation.\u201d We reject this contention because not every fact-based case is \u201cnovel in the eyes of the law.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 852.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-23\">Petitioners\u2019 request to hold these proceedings in abeyance is denied as moot in light of our decision in <em>Falcon Carriche.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-24\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), petitioners\u2019 motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the stay of removal was continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, to the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b551-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit <em>except as </em>provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
