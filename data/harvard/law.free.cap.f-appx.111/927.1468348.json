We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review <em>de novo, see Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-23\">Wade contends that his federal habeas petition should be equitably tolled because his counsel on direct appeal failed to notify him that his appeal was final and/or to deliver his transcripts. We disagree. Upon review of the record, we conclude that Wade has failed to establish the existence of extraordinary circumstances or that he was incapable of filing a timely petition. <em>See Frye v. Hickman, </em>273 F.3d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1055, 122 S.Ct. 1913, 152 L.Ed.2d 823 (2002). The district court therefore properly found that equitable tolling is not warranted. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-24\">We further conclude that the magistrate judge properly gave Wade the opportunity to file a supplemental declaration and to submit additional evidence in support of his petition. <em>See Whalem/Hunt v. Early, </em>233 F.3d 1146, 1148 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc) (per curiam). Accordingly, we deny Wade\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AT4\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
