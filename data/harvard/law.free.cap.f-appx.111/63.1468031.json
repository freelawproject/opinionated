No. 104-208, \u00a7 309, 110 Stat. 3009-625. Pursuant to these provisions, Endriuliene\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of deportation is governed by the INA as it existed prior to IIRIRA\u2019s 1996 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>amendments. <em>See Henderson v. INS, </em>157 F.3d 106, 117 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b95-23\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b95-24\">UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the order of the Board of Immigration Appeals be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-25\">Petitioner Elena Endriuliene seeks review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) denying her application for asylum and withholding of removal, pursuant to, respectively, former \u00a7\u00a7 208 and 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(a) (amended 1996), 1253(h) (repealed 1996).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>The BIA affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision that Endriuliene did not offer credible testimonial or sufficient documentary evidence in support of her application, and designated the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Where the BIA has adopted the reasoning of the IJ or affirmed without opinion, we may review the IJ opinion directly. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). We review the IJ\u2019s factual findings regarding eligibility for asylum and withholding of deportation under a \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, <em>see id. </em>at 306-07, upholding them where \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole,\u201d <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) (repealed 1996)). Pursuant to this standard, where a petitioner\u2019s challenge is predicated on the sufficiency of the IJ\u2019s factual findings, we will \u201creverse only if no reasonable fact-finder could have failed to find the past persecution or fear of future persecution necessary to sustain the petitioner\u2019s burden.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We accord \u201cparticular deference\u201d to the IJ\u2019s determinations surrounding credibility. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Montero v. INS, </em>124 F.3d 381, 386 (2d Cir.1997)). Having carefully reviewed the record in this case, we conclude that the IJ articulated sufficient reasons for questioning the credibility of Endriuliene\u2019s testimony, and that his decision was supported by substantial evidence. We therefore affirm the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Endriuliene, who seeks to avoid deportation to Lithuania, claims that she experienced past persecution and has a well founded fear of future persecution on account of her Russian nationality. She asserts that before she arrived in the United States from Lithuania in late 1993 she suffered harassment and intimidation at the hands of a Lithuanian nationalist group, the Lithuanian police, and various individuals motivated by anti-Russian animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">In denying Endriuliene\u2019s application, the IJ pointed to, <em>inter alia, </em>several inconsistencies in her asylum application and testimony before the court. Among these were discrepancies in the dates and circumstances surrounding key events, including various alleged interrogations upon which her asylum claim was based, and conflicting accounts regarding the date of a beating and resulting miscarriage she claims to have sustained in 1993. Endriuliene did not resolve these discrepancies by providing corroborating documentary evidence regarding events she described during her testimony. The IJ considered her explanations for the lack of supporting documentation and found them unpersuasive. Moreover, neither the State Department Human Rights Report on Lithuania, nor any other background information cited by Endriuliene, describes anti-Russian persecution akin to that which she claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">We have carefully considered Endriuliene\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Specifically, we reject summarily Endriuliene\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s refusal to withhold deportation, which required that Endriuliene meet an even higher burden of proof than did her asylum claim. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">For the reasons set forth above, the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals is hereby AFFIRMED and the petition for review is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
