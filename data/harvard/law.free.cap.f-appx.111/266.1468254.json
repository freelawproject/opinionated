Counsel has also filed a motion to waive the requirements of Fed. R.App. P. 32(a)(4). Alegr\u00eda pleaded guilty to illegally re-entering the United States after having been deported, and he was sentenced to 79 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">We examine the basis of our jurisdiction on our own motion. <em>See Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). A timely notice of appeal is a prerequisite to the exercise of appellate jurisdiction, and the lack of a timely notice mandates dismissal of the appeal. <em>United States v. Garcia-Machado, </em>845 F.2d 492, 493 (5th Cir.1988). Alegr\u00eda had 10 days from the entry of the judgment on March 24, 2003, that is until April 7, 2003, to file a timely notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). Alegria\u2019s notice of appeal, which was filed after entry of the amended judgment and dated April 28, 2003, was untimely. <em>See United States v. Lewis, </em>921 F.2d 563, 565 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">A district court may grant a defendant an additional 30 days in which to file a notice of appeal upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). Alegria\u2019s notice of appeal, which was filed within this 30-day period, sufficed as a motion for a finding on excusable neglect or good cause. <em>See United States v. Golding, </em>739 F.2d 183, 184 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-15\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motions are held in abeyance and the case is REMANDED to the district court for a finding under Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). <em>Id. </em>Upon making the finding, the district court shall promptly return the case to this court for dismissal or further proceedings, as may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-16\">REMANDED; MOTIONS HELD PENDING REMAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b299-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
