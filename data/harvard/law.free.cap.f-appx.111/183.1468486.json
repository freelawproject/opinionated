See Local Rule 86(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-20\">Cleveland McLean, Jr., seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion as successive. An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims addressed by a district court absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that McClean has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability, deny leave to proceed in for-ma pauperis, grant McLean\u2019s motions to supplement, deny his motion for default, and dismiss the appeal. To the extent that McLean\u2019s notice of appeal and appellate brief could be construed as a motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, we deny authorization. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 995, 124 S.Ct. 496,157 L.Ed.2d 395 (2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-22\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
