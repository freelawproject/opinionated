Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b466-19\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b466-20\">Arlene Otis filed a complaint in district court, alleging that she witnessed racial discrimination at a Target department store on two separate occasions, January 19, 2001, and August 31, 2003. Otis alleges that on both of those dates she observed store security guards ask several black patrons \u2014 but no white patrons \u2014 to show receipts for their purchases before leaving the store. She also alleges that on the earlier date she personally was subjected to discrimination when a clerk at the checkout counter asked to see her credit card after she had swiped it through a reader; she claimed that white patrons were not asked for their cards. Otis claims that this conduct is actionable under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981,1982, and 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-21\">Otis moved to proceed in forma pauper-is in the district court. Upon reviewing her complaint and motion to determine if she qualified, the court determined that her claims were frivolous, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), because she filed her complaint more than two years after the clerk\u2019s alleged discrimination in January 2001, and thus beyond the applicable limi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>tations periods. Although a statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that ordinarily must be raised by the party asserting the defense, Fed. R. Crv. P. 8(c), Otis\u2019s complaint is frivolous for another reason: it fails to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Otis\u2019s complaint conceivably could implicate \u00a7 1982, which prohibits racial discrimination in the purchase or sale of personal property, <em>see Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., </em>392 U.S. 409, 420-22, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189 (1968), or \u00a7 1981, which prohibits discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts, <em>see Runyon v. McCrary, </em>427 U.S. 160, 170-71, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976). But even if Otis\u2019s transaction could be characterized as an attempt to create a contract for the sale of personal property, the only action the store or its employees allegedly took against her \u2014 the clerk\u2019s request to see her credit card \u2014 is far too inconsequential to support a claim. And Otis cannot rely on the security guards\u2019 inspections of receipts from other customers to support her claims under \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1982 because she has standing to challenge only actions that personally caused her injury. <em>Wis. Right to Life, Inc. v. Schober, </em>366 F.3d 485, 489 (7th Cir.2004). Otis\u2019s other purported claims are frivolous. Neither Target nor any of its employees acted under color of state law as required to state a claim under \u00a7 1983, <em>Case v. Milewski, </em>327 F.3d 564, 566 (7th Cir.2003), nor acted as a \u201ccreditor\u201d as required to state a violation of the ECOA, <em>see </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.2(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The district court correctly determined that Otis\u2019s complaint is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
