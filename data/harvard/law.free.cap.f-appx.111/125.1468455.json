Ketut Sumadatha, a native and citizen of Indonesia, seeks review of a final order of removal issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) on August 26, 2003, which summarily affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge (IJ) denying asylum, withholding of removal, and protection from removal under Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">A. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Sumadatha arrived in the United States on June 14, 2000 as a non-immigrant with authorization to remain in the United States on a temporary basis. On April 19, 2001 the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) filed a Notice to Appear (NTA) seeking Sumadatha\u2019s removal as an alien who overstayed his authorization. Sumadatha conceded removability, but applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT. His application was grounded on claims of persecution based on his religion (Hinduism) and minority status as an Indonesian man married to an ethnically Chinese woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">Sumadatha\u2019s application and testimony in support of asylum centers primarily on a single incident that occurred in Dempasar, Indonesia on April 21, 1998. He claims that because of his marriage to an ethnically Chinese woman, he was targeted and apprehended by a mob of Indonesians which attacked shop owners and residents, burned churches, and killed ethnic Chinese residents. Sumadatha was not compelled to engage in any specific acts, but alleges that he was partially bound for four hours and was forced to accompany the mob. He also alleges that his house was marked with red paint signaling it as a target to \u201cburn and kill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">Sumadatha managed to escape the mob uninjured, and later went into hiding in the city of Surabaya on the island of East Java. Sumadatha testified that he lived unharmed in Surabaya from June 1998 to June 2000, and returned to Dempasar only once during that time to obtain a passport.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-14\">Sumadatha further testified that he has had no contact with his wife or son since the April 1998 incident for fear that any communication would make them \u201ctargets\u201d of majoritarian persecution. In addition, he describes a separate incident in June of 1998, where he witnessed ten men assault a woman of Chinese ethnicity. He claims these incidents caused him to suffer a \u201cmental breakdown,\u201d characterized by difficulty sleeping and eating. On June 13, 2000, he left Indonesia for the United States. Despite being out of work for over two years, he had amassed savings from his prior businesses of $600 million Indonesian currency ($ 60,000 U.S.).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-15\">B. <em>The BIA and IJ Decisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-16\">The BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision denying asylum, withholding of removal, and protection from removal under Art. 3 of the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-17\">Although the IJ did not make an express adverse credibility finding, he did indicate some doubts about Sumadatha\u2019s truthfulness, stating, \u201cin the Court\u2019s view, the respondent\u2019s answers were sketchy and not particularly persuasive.\u201d In particular, Sumadatha\u2019s written application for asylum indicating that he was \u201cforced\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>to do \u201cthings\u201d by the Indonesian mob conflicted with his statements during testimony that \u201che was not specifically required to do anything.\u201d In addition, the IJ found Sumadatha\u2019s failure to make any attempt to contact his wife since the April 1998 incident \u201ccurious, unusual and ... disproportionate to any plausible risk that his wife might face simply by receiving a letter from him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The IJ then determined that even with a favorable credibility finding, \u201cthe Court would otherwise not have found that the respondent had met his burden of proof and persuasion.\u201d The four-hour mob apprehension, alleged threats, and damage to property, were not alone sufficient, in the view of the IJ, to establish past persecution. In addition, the IJ noted several factors which mitigated against Sumadatha\u2019s well-founded fear of future persecution: (1) Sumadatha lived in Surabaya, Indonesia for two years without any problems; (2) nothing in the record, including reports from the United States State Department, suggested that Hindus were targeted in any way; (3) Sumadatha did not tender any evidence that he or his family was targeted because of his alleged marriage to a Chinese woman, let alone offer any proof of such marriage; and (4) Sumadatha offered no corroborating or documentary evidence to support his statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">This court has power to review only final orders of removal. When the BIA does not render its own opinion, but rather defers or adopts the opinion of the IJ, a Court of Appeals must review the decision of the IJ. <em>Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 549 n. 2 (3d Cir.2001). The Supreme Court has stated that the scope of such review is extremely narrow. Because of the profound foreign policy implications, \u201cjudicial deference to the Executive Branch is especially appropriate in the immigration context.\u201d <em>INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 425, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">A. <em>Legal Standards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">Because we write only for the parties, who are familiar with the applicable statutes, we need not set them forth here. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(1), 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">Sumadatha argues that the IJ erred when it failed to find that he had shown past persecution. To establish \u201cpast persecution\u201d, the applicant must show: \u201c \u2018(1) an incident, or incidents, that rise to the level of persecution; (2) that is \u2018on account of one of the statutorily-protected grounds; and (3) is committed by the government or forces the government is either \u2018unable or unwilling\u2019 to control.\u201d \u2019 <em>Berishaj v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 314, 322-23 (3d Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Navas v. INS, </em>217 F.3d 646, 655-56 (9th Cir.2000)). An applicant can demonstrate that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution by showing \u201cthat she has a genuine fear, and that a reasonable person in her circumstances would fear persecution if returned to her native country.\u201d <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">The BIA and this court have adopted a narrow definition of persecution, which \u201cinclude[s] threats to life, confinement, torture, and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to life or freedom.\u201d <em>Fatin v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1240 (3d Cir.1993); <em>see also Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 211, 222, 1985 WL 56042 (BIA 1985). By contrast, \u201cpersecution does not encompass all treatment that our society regards as unfair, unjust, or even unlawful or unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Fatin, </em>12 F.3d at 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">To qualify for relief under the CAT, an applicant for relief bears the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>proving through objective evidence that \u201cit is more likely than not\u201d that he would be tortured in the country of removal. <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>368 F.3d 347, 348 (3d Cir.2004) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">B. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Whether an applicant qualifies for asylum, withholding, or relief under the CAT is a factual determination, which this court will review under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477, 483 (3d Cir.2001). As this court stated in <em>Abdille, </em>\u201c[ujnder the substantial evidence standard, the BIA\u2019s finding must be upheld unless the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483-84; <em>see INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Chang v. INS, </em>119 F.3d 1055, 1060 (3d Cir.1997) (\u201cOn questions of fact, we will reverse the BIA\u2019s determination that [an applicant] is not eligible for asylum ... only if a reasonable fact-finder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">C. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">In the present case, Sumadatha has failed to demonstrate that evidence in the record, even if taken as true, \u201ccompels\u201d a finding different from that reached by the IJ. The IJ\u2019s finding that Sumadatha\u2019s four-hour detention, with no attendant physical beatings or torture, does not rise to the level of \u201cpast persecution\u201d is supported by substantial evidence in the record, given this court\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s construction of the term. <em>See Fatin, </em>12 F.3d at 1240; <em>Acosta, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">We will also defer to the IJ\u2019s finding that Sumadatha does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. Because the one incident of harm was not significant enough to qualify as past persecution, it does nothing to bolster his fear of returning to Indonesia. Further, he was able to live unharmed in Surabaya, Indonesia for two years immediately prior to his arrival to the United States, had amassed a sizable wealth in Indonesia, and was able to obtain a passport in person in Dempasar, the city from which he purportedly fled. There is also no indication in the State Department reports that Hindus or Indonesians married to ethnically Chinese persons are targeted in any way. Thus, the IJ\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s decision denying relief under the CAT, as the standard under that treaty is even more stringent. Neither the record, nor Sumadatha\u2019s brief, indicate any probability, much less a probability \u201cmore likely than not,\u201d that Sumadatha will be tortured if he returns to Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">For the above reasons we will deny the Petition for Review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
