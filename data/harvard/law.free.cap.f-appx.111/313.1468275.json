Covarrubias contends for the first time on appeal that he should not have been assessed a criminal history point for a prior conviction for shoplifting because that crime is similar to the crime of writing an insufficient-funds check, which is exempt from inclusion in the criminal history calculation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l). Covarrubias fails to provide any binding authority holding that the two offenses are similar, and he thus fails to show that the district court made any \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cobvious\u201d error. <em>See United States v. Hull, </em>160 F.3d 265, 271-272 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-22\">Covarrubias also has filed a letter pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 28(j) calling our attention to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>- U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). However, we have held that <em>Blakely </em>does not apply to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 473 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b345-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
