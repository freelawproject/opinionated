On December 2, 2003, the district court sentenced Manigault to a term of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, three years\u2019 supervised release, and a $300 special assessment. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-15\">Manigault argues that the district court erred in failing to suppress his post-arrest statements. In evaluating the district court\u2019s denial of Manigault\u2019s motion to suppress, we review the trial court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. United States v. Reyes, </em>353 F.3d 148, 151 (2d Cir.2003). As to Manigault\u2019s initial statement, we conclude that the district court did not err in holding that the remark did not constitute the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of interrogation given the court\u2019s factual findings that Beltre\u2019s remark was not directed to Manigault, was made in the course of a much longer conversation between Beltre and another officer, and was not intended by Beltre to elicit an incriminating response. <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980); <em>see United States v. Guido, </em>704 F.2d 675, 677 (2d Cir.1983) (holding that the officers\u2019 suggestion to the defendant that he should consider cooperating did not constitute the functional equivalent of interrogation); <em>see also United States v. LaPierre, </em>998 F.2d 1460, 1466-67 &amp; n. 6 (9th Cir.1993) (\u201cWhether the questioning constituted interrogation is an objective test, but the officer\u2019s subjective intent in asking the question is relevant.\u201d); <em>United States v. Calisto, </em>838 F.2d 711, 718 (3d Cir.1988) (finding that interrogation did not occur where, <em>inter alia, </em>the officer\u2019s remark was not directed to the defendant and was the kind of remark that an officer would normally make in carrying out his duties under the circumstances). Further, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Manigault\u2019s initial statement was not the product of a <em>Miranda </em>violation, there was no basis for the district court to suppress Manigault\u2019s subsequent statements, made after administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In addition, Manigault argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). \u201c[A] defendant making an insufficiency claim bears a very heavy burden.\u201d <em>United States v. Desena, </em>287 F.3d 170, 177 (2d Cir.2002). \u201cHe is required to show that the essential elements of the crime charged could not be found beyond a reasonable doubt by any rational trier of fact.\u201d <em>United States v. McDermott, </em>277 F.3d 240, 242 (2d Cir.2002). In considering such a challenge, \u201cwe review [the] evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Canady, </em>126 F.3d 352, 356 (2d Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). The standard of review applied \u201cis exactly the same regardless whether the verdict was rendered by a jury or by a judge after a bench trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Pierce, </em>224 F.3d 158, 164 (2d Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">With respect to the \u201ccarrying\u201d prong of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), the government met its burden of showing that Manigault was carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Manigault does not, nor could he successfully, challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his underlying drug trafficking conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. That evidence included the substantial quantity of marijuana found in Manigault\u2019s vehicle, the packaging of the marijuana into different sizes and types of bags, and the large amount of cash stashed near the marijuana. The fact that Manigault was initially arrested for an unrelated crime is therefore irrelevant. There is also no question that Manigault was carrying a firearm at the time of his arrest. Further, a reasonable fact-finder could conclude from the proof, which included the weapon\u2019s close physical proximity to the drugs in Manigault\u2019s vehicle and Ra-lat\u2019s testimony that robberies of street sellers had become common, prompting drug dealers to carry guns for protection, that there was \u201ca nexus between the firearm and the underlying ... crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>143 F.3d 632, 637 n. 5 (2d Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Jackson, </em>300 F.3d 740, 747 (7th Cir.2002) (\u201c[I]f the drugs and the gun are together in the same place, it is nearly an inescapable conclusion that [the firearm was used during and in relation to the drug offense].\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>United States v. Turner, </em>157 F.3d 552, 557 (8th Cir.1998) (holding that a \u201ca jury could reasonably infer [that] the gun served to facilitate the drug trafficking offense\u201d where \u201cthe firearm was found grip up with the crack cocaine in an unfastened bag within arm\u2019s reach of [the defendant]\u201d (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)). For substantially the same reasons, the evidence was sufficient to establish Manigault\u2019s guilt under the possession prong of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED. The mandate in this case will be held pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 11, 159 L.Ed.2d 838 (2004) and <em>United States v. Fanfan, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 12, 159 L.Ed.2d 838 (2004). Should any party believe there is a need for the district court to exercise jurisdiction prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, it may file a motion seeking issuance of the mandate in whole or in part. Although any petition for rehearing should be filed in the normal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>course pursuant to Rule 40 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the court will not consider Manigault\u2019s sentence until after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fcmfan. </em>In that regard, the parties will have until 14 days following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to file supplemental petitions for rehearing in light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fcmfan.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
