Robyn contends that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel when the trial court refused to appoint counsel after a jury had been empaneled and the prosecution put on its first witness. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-25\">Although a criminal defendant has both the right to counsel and the right to self representation, a request for either form of representation must be timely made. <em>See e.g., United States v. Smith, </em>780 F.2d 810, 811 (9th Cir.1986) (stating that a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>mand for self-representation is timely if made before meaningful trial proceedings have begun). The California appellate court\u2019s determination that Robyn\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were not violated by the trial court\u2019s denial of Robyn\u2019s request to revoke his waiver of counsel and have counsel appointed after the trial was underway was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">We have considered the uncertified issues raised by Robyn in his opening brief, which we construe as a motion to expand the Certificate of Appealability. Ninth Cir. R. 22-l(e). We deny this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b479-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
