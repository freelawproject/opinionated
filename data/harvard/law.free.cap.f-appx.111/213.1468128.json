After exhausting his state remedies, Plata filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court raising several grounds for relief. The district court granted the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all issues, denied Plata\u2019s habeas application, and refused to grant a certificate of appealability (COA) on any issue raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Plata now seeks a COA from us on the following issues: (1) whether he is entitled to habeas relief based on the State\u2019s failure to advise him of his right to consular assistance under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and (2) whether the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow evidence of his parole eligibility during sentencing violated his constitutional rights to due process, effective representation by counsel, and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. His remaining claims have been waived. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.Sd 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">A district court shall entertain a \u00a7 2254 application filed by \u201ca person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or law or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). In determining whether to issue a COA, we ask whether an applicant \u201chas made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When a district court rejects a claim on the merits, \u201c[t]he petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Likewise, when a district court finds that a claim is procedurally barred, the applicant must demonstrate that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">When a state court has rejected the applicant\u2019s claims on the merits, the district court reviews the claims \u201cthrough the lens of the deferential scheme laid out in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\u201d <em>Barrientes v. Johnson, </em>221 F.3d 741, 772 (5th Cir.2000). Under that scheme, deference to a state court decision is required unless the decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) and (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">As a general rule, new constitutional rules of criminal procedure are not applied retroactively to cases that became final before that decision was announced. <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 310, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989). <em>Teague </em>remains applicable after the passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). <em>Robertson v. Cockrell, </em>325 F.3d 243, 255 (5th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Horn v. Banks, </em>536 U.S. 266, 272, 122 S.Ct. 2147, 153 L.Ed.2d 301 (2002)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number><em>Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The VCCR is a 79-article, multilateral treaty ratified by the United States in 1969. VCCR, Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U.S.T. 77; <em>see United States v. Jimenez-Nava, </em>243 F.3d 192, 195 (5th Cir.2001). Mexico is a signatory nation. <em>See Jimenez-Nava, </em>243 F.3d at 195. Pursuant to Article 36 of the VCCR, a \u201creceiving State\u201d (here, the United States) shall inform a foreign national who has been arrested or committed to prison or custody pending trial or detained in any other manner of his right to contact the consular post of the \u201csending State\u201d (here, Mexico). VCCR, art. 36, 21 U.S.T. 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The district court determined that (1) Plata had procedurally defaulted his VCCR claim in the state court; (2) alternatively assuming <em>arguendo </em>that his claim was not procedurally defaulted, it was barred by <em>Teague, </em>because recognizing that the VCCR created personally-enforceable rights would create a new rule of law; and (3) even if his VCCR claim had been properly raised and he had a personally-enforceable right under the VCCR, the state court\u2019s rulings \u2014 that Plata needed to show prejudice from the VCCR violation and that he failed to show such prejudice \u2014 were not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established law under \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Plata argues in his COA application that the district court\u2019s denial of his VCCR claim ignored the International Court of Justice\u2019s (ICJ) interpretation of Article 36 of the VCCR in the <em>LaGrand Case </em>(F.R.G.v.U.S.), 2001 I.C.J. Rep. 104 (Judgment of June 27, 2001). Plata did not present the <em>LaGrand </em>case or any argument stemming from that opinion to the district court, so we need not consider it. <em>See Roberts v. Cockrell, </em>319 F.3d 690, 694 (5th Cir.2003). Regardless, because his COA application fails to address the district court\u2019s finding that his VCCR claim is <em>Teague-bsrced, </em>he has not shown that the district court\u2019s denial of his VCCR claim is debatable. <em>See Hughes, </em>191 F.3d at 613; <em>Price v. Roark, </em>256 F.3d 364, 368 n. 2 (5th Cir.2001). We therefore deny COA with respect to Plata\u2019s VCCR claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Furthermore, even if we were to address the <em>Teague </em>arguments raised in Plata\u2019s reply brief, he has not shown that the district court\u2019s denial of his VCCR claim as <em>Teague-b&amp;nced </em>is debatable. <em>See Breard v. Greene, </em>523 U.S. 371, 377, 118 S.Ct. 1352, 140 L.Ed.2d 529 (1998); <em>Flores v. Johnson, </em>210 F.3d 456, 456-57 (5th Cir.2000). In addition, even if Plata\u2019s VCCR claim were not procedurally defaulted and even if it were not barred by <em>Teague, </em>he still would have to show that the VCCR violation had some effect on his trial. <em>See Breard, </em>523 U.S. at 377, 118 S.Ct. 1352; <em>Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mexico v. United </em>States), 2004 I.C.J. Rep. -, 1f 121. Plata asserts that he was prejudiced by the lack of consular assistance because he did not understand why, under the Texas legal system, it would have benefitted him to plead guilty, and because the consul would have litigated the inequality of the prosecution\u2019s grant of favorable plea deals to his co-eonspirators. He insists that consular assistance would have aided him in finding medical documents to show that he was injured at birth and that he was physically abused by his father while he lived in Mexico; that the consul could have obtained Plata\u2019s educational records from Mexico; and that the consul could have traveled to Mexico and conducted interviews with his relatives there, which in turn could have assisted the defense in confirming the diagnosis suggested by Plata\u2019s MMPI scores, i.e., that he suffered from schizophrenia.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Plata\u2019s argument regarding prejudice suffered at trial because he did not understand the benefit of pleading guilty before trial does not make the district court\u2019s denial of his VCCR claim debatable, as trial counsel\u2019s affidavit in the state habeas proceedings stated the he explained to Plata the consequences of pleading guilty before trial and after the State presented its case. Further, Plata\u2019s argument that he was discriminated against because the one of his co-conspirators who told him to fire the fourth, fifth, and sixth shots at the victim received only a life sentence does not make debatable the district court\u2019s finding that Plata\u2019s death sentence was most likely the result of his being the gunman during the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Although he argues that the Mexican consul could have obtained medical records to show that Plata suffered from oxygen deprivation at birth and that he was physically abused as a child, and despite the fact that he now has legal assistance from Mexican consul, Plata does not provide any evidence to support these claims. Regardless, his mother testified that Plata was \u201cborn dead,\u201d that he needed to be revived by doctors after his birth, and that she and Plata were physically abused by Plata\u2019s father. Plata also testified that he was physically abused by his father. Given the cumulative nature of any records regarding Plata\u2019s birth and physical abuse, Plata has not shown that the district court\u2019s alternative denial of his VCCR claim on prejudice grounds is debatable.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Plata also contends that the prosecution argued to the jury that there were no records to support Plata\u2019s physical abuse claims, and that the absence of such records therefore prejudiced him at sentencing. Again, however, as he has not provided any records to support this claim, his assertion regarding those records is speculative and, thus, does not render the district court\u2019s denial of Plata\u2019s VCCR claim debatable. Neither does Plata explain what his educational records from Mexico would have shown that would have mitigated his sentence. Plata moved from Mexico to the United States when he was eleven years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Finally, Plata\u2019s assertion that Mexican consul would have traveled to Mexico and interviewed relatives, which could have assisted the defense in confirming the diagnosis of schizophrenia suggested by the scores on his personality test, is raised for the first time in his COA application and therefore will not be considered. <em>See Roberts, </em>319 F.3d at 694. Moreover, the claim is purely speculative, as Plata has provided us no indication that there is any evidence in Mexico that would support such a diagnosis. Neither is there any indication that the Mexican consul would have been more likely than trial counsel to investigate whether Plata is schizophrenic, given trial counsel\u2019s statement in his affidavit that there was no indication that Plata was suffering from any mental health problem or mental retardation; that Plata was lucid and conversant during their meetings; that counsel had numerous conversations with Plata concerning mitigating evidence for sentencing; that counsel interviewed numerous family members; and that counsel would have checked out other witnesses if Plata had told him about them. Accordingly, even if Plata\u2019s claim were properly raised and before this court, we would conclude that Plata has failed to show that the district court\u2019s alternative denial of his VCCR claim on prejudice grounds is debatable among reasonable jurists. <em>See Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">\n<em>Parole Eligibility</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AJ_\">\n<em>Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Relying on state cases construing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Simmons </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number><em>v. North Carolina, </em>512 U.S. 154, 114 S.Ct. 2187, 129 L.Ed.2d 138 (1994), the state court, on both direct and habeas review, rejected Plata\u2019s claim that he had a due process right to have the jury informed that he would not be eligible for parole for 40 years. The district court noted that, in <em>Simmons, </em>512 U.S. at 169, 114 S.Ct. 2187, the Supreme Court held that a capital defendant who could be sentenced to life <em>without parole, </em>as an alternative to a death sentence, should be allowed to inform the jury of their parole ineligibility; that the Supreme Court, in <em>Ramdass v. Angelone, </em>530 U.S. 156, 166, 120 S.Ct. 2113, 147 L.Ed.2d 125 (2000), declined to extend that rule to prisoners who, like Plata, would ultimately be eligible for parole; and that this court, in <em>Tigner v. Cockrell, </em>264 F.3d 521, 525 (5th Cir.2001), held that extending the rule of <em>Simmons </em>to prisoners who were eligible for parole would be barred by <em>Teague. </em>The district court determined that the state court\u2019s decisions were not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">In <em>Simmons, </em>512 U.S. at 157, 114 S.Ct. 2187, the prosecution had raised the issue of the capital defendant\u2019s future dangerousness to the jury. A plurality of the Court concluded that, by refusing to inform the jury of Simmons\u2019s parole ineligibility, the State had deprived him of his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 171, 114 S.Ct. 2187. In <em>O\u2019Dell v. Netherland, </em>521 U.S. 151, 159-66, 117 S.Ct. 1969, 138 L.Ed.2d 351 (1997), the Court determined that the holding in <em>Simmons </em>was a \u201cnew\u201d rule within the meaning of <em>Teague. See also Ramdass v. Angelone, </em>530 U.S. 156, 169-70, 120 S.Ct. 2113, 147 L.Ed.2d 125 (2000). In the same vein, we have repeatedly held that any extension of the scope of <em>Simmons </em>is barred by <em>Teague. See e.g., Tigner v. Cockrell, </em>264 F.3d 521, 525 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Plata nevertheless insists that his claim is now supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002). <em>Ring </em>held, however, that due process is violated when a judge rather than a jury finds the presence of aggravating circumstances that are necessary for the imposition of a capital sentence. <em>Ring, </em>536 U.S. at 609, 122 S.Ct. 2428. It did not state that a capital defendant\u2019s parole eligibility was required by due process to be presented to the jury, and it did not address whether, as determined by the district court, any extension of <em>Simmons </em>is barred by <em>Teague. </em>As Plata has failed to show that the district court\u2019s denial of his due process claim is debatable based on <em>Ring, </em>COA is DENIED with respect to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\n<em>Right to Effective Legal Representation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Plata urges that State action denied his right to effective representation under the Sixth Amendment because Texas law precluded him from informing the jury that he would not be eligible for parole for 40 years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As he fails to challenge the district court\u2019s determinations that his counsel was not ineffective under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and that any extension of <em>Simmons </em>to the Sixth Amendment context would be barred by <em>Teague, see Hughes, </em>191 F.3d at 613, we deny COA with respect to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>\n<em>Cruel and Unusual Punishment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Plata argues that, based upon <em>Skipper v. South Carolina, </em>476 U.S. 1, 106 S.Ct. 1669, 90 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986), and <em>Jurek v. Texas, </em>428 U.S. 262, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 49 L.Ed.2d 929 (1976), the trial court violated his Eighth Amendment rights because punishment was imposed without his being allowed to introduce evidence that he would not be eligible for parole for 40 years. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected this claim on both direct and habeas review. The district court determined that Plata had failed to show that the state court decisions were contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In <em>Skipper </em>and <em>Jurek, </em>the Supreme Court held that precluding a defendant from introducing relevant mitigating evidence during a sentencing proceeding violates the Eighth Amendment. <em>Skipper, </em>476 U.S. at 4, 106 S.Ct. 1669; <em>Jurek, </em>428 U.S. at 271, 96 S.Ct. 2950. The <em>Simmons </em>Court relied on <em>Skipper </em>to find that the due process clause requires a jury to be told of a capital defendant\u2019s parole ineligibility, but the Court expressly declined to address whether its result was also compelled by the Eighth Amendment. <em>Simmons, </em>512 U.S. at 162 n. 4, 164-65, 114 S.Ct. 2187. As Plata has failed to show that the district court\u2019s denial of his parole eligibility claims is debatable among reasonable jurists, we deny COA with respect to this claim. <em>See Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">COA DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b247-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
