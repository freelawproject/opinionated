We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Avetova-Elisseva v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1192, 1196 (9th Cir.2000), and grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Although Khodaverdyan presented evidence that he and his family were mistreated by the Armenian authorities and the public on account of his wife\u2019s Azeri ethnicity, we cannot say that the past harm <em>compels </em>a finding of past persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1197 (holding that harassment, discrimination and hostility did not rise to the level of past persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">However, the record compels a finding that Khodaverdyan has a subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable fear of future persecution in Armenia. <em>See id. </em>at 1201-02 (holding that petitioner demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution based on her past harm and country conditions evidence). First, the continuous and threatening nature of Khodaverdyan\u2019s past harm, including death threats, life-threatening attacks, harassment, and systemic discrimination, provides objective support for his well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184 (9th Cir.2003). Second, the country conditions evidence in the record regarding the widespread mistreatment of the few remaining ethnic Azeris in Armenia provides further objective support for Khodaverdyan\u2019s reasonable fear. <em>See id. </em>at 1182-83. Third, the IJ erred by discounting Khodaverdyan\u2019s evidence of threats and attacks by non-governmental sources. <em>See Mgoian v. INS, </em>184 F.3d 1029, 1036-37 (9th Cir.1999) (finding eligibility for asylum where the government was unwilling or unable to control elements of society with a generalized hatred of Kurdish-Moslems in Armenia).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">We reject the government\u2019s contention that Khodaverdyan could avoid persecution by relocating to the Nagorno-Karabakh region of neighboring Azerbaijan, because no authority supports the proposition that the possibility of relocation to another country undermines a well-founded fear. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(ii) (\u201cAn applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution if the applicant could avoid persecution by relocating to <em>another part of the applicant\u2019s country of nationality </em>..., if under all the circumstances it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-14\">We vacate the IJ\u2019s alternative discretionary denial of asylum because the IJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>failed to consider and weigh all of the relevant favorable and adverse factors, including the likelihood of future persecution. <em>See Kalubi v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1134, 1141 (9th Cir.2004) (stating that the likelihood of future persecution is a particularly important factor to consider). The IJ also erred by giving dispositive weight to Khodaverdyan\u2019s attempt to enter the United States with a false passport. <em>See id. </em>(stating that \u201cthe BIA must balance <em>all </em>relevant factors and no one factor needs to be determinative\u201d); <em>see also Kaur v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 876, 889 (9th Cir.2004) (noting in the context of a credibility determination that \u201cus[ing] another person\u2019s passport to enter this country is reasonably understood as the act of one seeking refuge in the United States and who is anxious not to be sent back to\u201d the country of feared persecution). Upon remand, the BIA shall reevaluate whether Khodaverdyan merits a favorable exercise of discretion given our determination that he is eligible for asylum on the basis of his well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Kalubi, </em>364 F.3d at 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Because the denial of withholding of removal and CAT relief was premised on the IJ\u2019s erroneous determination that Khodaverdyan was not eligible for asylum, we vacate and remand these claims to the BIA for further consideration. <em>See Jahed v. INS, </em>356 F.3d 991, 1001(9th Cir.2004) (remanding withholding claim to the BIA for renewed consideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b522-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
