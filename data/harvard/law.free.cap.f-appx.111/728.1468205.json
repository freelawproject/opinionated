Hassler filed this <em>pro se, in forma pauperis </em>complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, at a time when he was a Texas prisoner (# 222006) serving a 99-year prison term for a 1970 conviction of malice murder. Hassler, who allegedly has since discharged his sentence, now appeals the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of his complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii). The district court concluded that Hassler\u2019s claims regarding the failure to credit him with jail time served in Carson County were barred by the rule of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), insofar as he sought monetary damages. The court concluded that claims for injunctive relief sounded in habeas and should have been brought in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-20\">Hassler contends that the district court\u2019s application of the <em>Heck </em>bar was improper because the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 remedy was unavailable to him, both because he has completed his prison sentence and because the limitations imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) prevent him from seeking habeas relief. \u201c[I]n order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional ... imprisonment, ... a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such a determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.\u201d <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87. The <em>Heck </em>bar applies even to former prisoners for whom the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 remedy is no longer available, if the plaintiff has failed to establish that other \u201cprocedural vehicle[s]\u201d are lacking. <em>See Randell v. Johnson, </em>227 F.3d 300, 301 (5th Cir.2000). Hassler has not made such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>a showing. Because Hassler\u2019s sentence has not been overturned or otherwise invalidated, his claims were barred by <em>Heck. See Randell, </em>227 F.3d at 301. Similarly, Hassler\u2019s claim for injunctive relief is not actionable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Newby v. Johnson, </em>81 F.3d 567, 569 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1 (5th Cir.1996). Hassler thus has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his complaint as frivolous, <em>see Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 472 (5th Cir.2001), or erred in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> <em>See Hart v. Hairston, </em>343 F.3d 762, 763-64 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">The magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Hassler\u2019s motion for recusal. <em>See United States v. MMR Corp., </em>954 F.2d 1040, 1045-46 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Because Hassler was incarcerated at the time he filed the instant complaint, the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Should Hassler be returned to prison and accumulate three strikes, he would not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he were under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b761-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b762-8\"> Contrary to Hassler\u2019s contentions, a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint both as frivolous and for failure to state a claim is not \"legally inconsistent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
