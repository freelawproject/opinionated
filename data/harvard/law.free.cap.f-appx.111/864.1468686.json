Taylor claimed violations of his civil rights. Taylor seeks to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis (IFP).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-16\">After careful review of the record, we conclude Taylor\u2019s FOIA claim is not cognizable under section 1983 because it implicates only state law. <em>See Walker v. Reed, </em>104 F.3d 156, 157 (8th Cir.1997) (to state cognizable claim under \u00a7 1983, plaintiff must allege defendant, acting under color of state law, deprived plaintiff of right, privilege, or immunity secured by constitution or laws of United States). As to the forgery, to the extent Taylor is advancing more than a state-law claim of forgery per se and is claiming his conviction was obtained fraudulently through forgery, such a claim is barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 483, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) (claims for monetary damages that call into question lawfulness of conviction or confinement are not cognizable under \u00a7 1983 unless conviction or sentence is overturned).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-19\">Accordingly, we grant IFP status on appeal and affirm, but we modify the dismissal to be without prejudice so Taylor may pursue whatever remedies may be available to him in state court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-17\">. The Honorable G. Thomas Eisele, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
