On November 25, 2003, Morales was sentenced to serve 46 months in prison followed by 3 years of supervised release, and to pay a one hundred dollar assessment and a one thousand dollar fine. Morales, through his attorney, filed a timely notice of appeal but has not submitted an opening brief on appeal. His counsel, L. Felipe Restrepo, has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no nonfrivolous issues from which to appeal, and further moving that he be permitted to withdraw as Morales\u2019 counsel. For the reasons set forth below, we agree that any appeal by Morales would be without merit. Accordingly, this Court will grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw, and will affirm the judgment and sentence of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">As we write solely for the parties, our recitation of the facts will be limited to those necessary to our determination. Miguel Morales is a 47-year-old citizen of the Dominican Republic. In or around March 1999, an informant working with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration made contact with Morales\u2019 co-defendant, Justo Frias. The informant arranged to purchase heroin from Frias. After obtaining a sample from Frias, the informant returned to make a larger purchase. Frias told the informant that he received the heroin from Morales. The informant asked Frias for a lower price, and was taken to meet Morales to negotiate. Morales refused to negotiate, and the informant purchased the heroin for the original price. Both Morales and Frias were arrested and indicted for, among other things, distributing heroin and aiding and abetting the distribution of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">On August 25, 2003, Morales pled guilty to count three of the indictment, distributing heroin and aiding and abetting the distribution of heroin. Pursuant to a written plea agreement, the remaining counts were dismissed and Morales was sentenced to a term of 46 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Morales filed a notice of appeal on December 8, 2003. Thereafter, L. Felipe Restrepo, counsel for Morales, filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967) and a Motion to Withdraw as Counsel. Morales has not filed a brief on his own behalf, despite having been informed of his right to file a formal or informal brief. <em>See </em>Clerk\u2019s Office Letter (Feb. 17, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">In <em>Anders, </em>the Supreme Court suggested that \u201cif, after a \u2018conscientious examination\u2019 of the record, counsel found no non-frivolous issues for appeal, he or she could submit a brief \u2018referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Marvin, </em>211 F.3d 778, 779 (3d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744). In <em>Marvin, </em>we expanded upon the <em>Anders </em>requirements, following the Seventh Circuit\u2019s teachings in <em>United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583 (7th Cir.1997), by adopting the notion of \u201cthe dual duties of counsel in the <em>Anders </em>situation.\u201d <em>Marvin, </em>211 F.3d at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">The dual duties are: \u201c(1) to satisfy the court that he or she has thoroughly scoured the record in search of appealable issues; and (2) to explain why the issues are frivolous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, this Court must serve two roles: \u201c(1) whether counsel adequately fulfilled the [Third Circuit Local Appellate Rule 109.2(a)\u2019s] require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>ments;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) whether an independent review of the record presents any nonffivolous issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In arguing that there are no nonfrivolous issues for appeal, counsel points to three areas in which issues possibly may be raised: the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction to accept the guilty plea, the validity of the guilty plea in light of constitutional and statutory standards, and the legality of the actual sentence imposed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After an independent examination of the record, including the transcript of the plea colloquy, the Pre-Sentencing Report and the sentencing, and counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief, it is clear that counsel has satisfied his <em>Anders </em>burden and that no nonfrivolous issues from which to appeal exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">A. Jurisdiction to Accept the Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Counsel easily disposes of any possible jurisdictional defect, noting that the crimes charged and pled to are federal crimes and that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 bestows U.S. district courts with \u201coriginal jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of all offenses against the laws of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">B. Validity of the Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">The Supreme Court set forth some requirements for a valid plea in <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969), the compliance with which establishes a voluntary and knowing waiver of the constitutional rights implicated by a plea. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 incorporates and expands upon these requirements, creating a list of information that a judge must impart to the defendant. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. In essence, the judge must be satisfied that a factual basis exists for the taking of the plea and that the defendant is aware of the nature of the charges against him and the consequences of entering the plea. <em>Id. </em>Here, all of those requirements were satisfied. <em>See </em>App. 19, 22, 28, 30-32, 36-36. Thus, Morales\u2019 plea entry met the relevant constitutional and statutory standards, and is valid, leaving no discernable avenues for appeal with respect to the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">C. The Legality of the Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b701-14\">Counsel explains in his brief that Morales\u2019 sentence complied with the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. The base offense level was 26, given the stipulated to quantity of heroin involved-149.75 grams. Although a 2 point increase was recommended in the pre-sentence report, a defense objection to the increase was sustained. The deduction for the acceptance of responsibility and the elimination of supervisory points resulted in a total deduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>tion of 4 points, giving a final offense level of 21. This yielded a guideline range of 37-46 months incarceration; Morales was sentenced to the upper bound of that range. Given his lack of any prior adult convictions or juvenile adjudications, Morales received no upward adjustment of sentence due to criminal history. The fines and the supervised release are specifically authorized by statute. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013 (mandating the special assessment); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3571 (authorizing the fine); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) (authorizing the supervised release). Although counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief was submitted prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), we find that, regardless of that case\u2019s impact on the Sentencing Guidelines, Morales\u2019 sentence was valid, given that no upward departures were made from the determined range. <em>See United States v. Coplin, </em>106 Fed.Appx. 143, 2004 WL 1790169, at *3 (3d Cir. Aug. 9, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">For the reasons stated above, we agree with counsel that Morales has no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s Motion to Withdraw and affirm Morales\u2019 conviction and sentence. Further, we find that the issues discussed herein lack merit for purposes of counsel filing a petition for writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court. <em>See </em>Third Circuit L.A.R. 109.2(b) and (c); <em>see also Austin v. United States, </em>513 U.S. 5, 115 S.Ct. 380, 130 L.Ed.2d 219 (1994).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-10\">. Local Appellate Rule 109.2(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-11\">Where, upon review of the district court record, trial counsel is persuaded that the appeal presents no issue of even arguable merit, trial counsel may file a motion to withdraw and supporting brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), which shall be served upon the appellant and the United States. The United States shall file a brief in response. Appellant may also file a brief in response pro se. After all briefs have been filed, the clerk will refer the case to a merits panel. If the panel agrees that the appeal is without merit, it will grant trial counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>motion, and dispose of the appeal without appointing new counsel. If the panel finds arguable merit to the appeal, it will discharge current counsel, appoint substitute counsel, restore the case to the calendar, and order supplemental briefing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-16\">Third Circuit L.A.R. 109.2(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b701-17\">. Counsel notes that, unless expressly provided otherwise, all other possible issues for appeal can be waived through a valid plea agreement, and that no exceptions were provided for here. <em>See </em>App. 26-27 (Morales waiving his general right to appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
