Mara\u00f1a argues that the district court clearly erred in refusing to grant her request for a two-level \u201cminor role\u201d reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). She argues that the evidence showed that she was merely a cornier and that a \u201crecruiter\u201d was responsible for her conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-22\">The district court\u2019s refusal to grant Marana a two-level reduction for being a minor participant was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Virgen-Moreno, </em>265 F.3d 276, 296 (5th Cir.2001). The large quantity of heroin that Mara\u00f1a was transporting strongly supports the denial of a reduction for being a minor participant. <em>See United States v. Rojas, </em>868 F.2d 1409, 1409-10 (5th Cir.1989). Furthermore, the district court was not required to accept Marana\u2019s account of her role in the drug trafficking scheme. <em>See United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir.1989). Lastly, this court has held that \u201ccouriers are an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>indispensable part of drug dealing networks.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">For the first time on appeal, Mara\u00f1a maintains that the sentencing schemes of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846 are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As Mara\u00f1a concedes, her argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000). She raises the issue only to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AgP\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
