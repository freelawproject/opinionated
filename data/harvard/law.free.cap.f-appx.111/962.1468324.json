His contention, however, is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Joyce, </em>357 F.3d 921, 923-24 (9th Cir.2004). Because Mendez validly waived his right to appeal any aspect of his sentence, including the district court\u2019s imposition of special conditions of supervised release, we lack jurisdiction to consider this appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b994-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
