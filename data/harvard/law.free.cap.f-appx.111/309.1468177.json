They have filed a motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) on appeal, challenging the district court\u2019s denial of IFP and certification that their appeal would not be taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>24(a)(3). They argue that the district court has subject matter jurisdiction over their claims based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(a) and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">James and Manor alleged that the defendants discriminated against them on the basis of their race. Their allegations were based on adverse judicial rulings rendered by the defendants in the course of the state defamation suit James and Man- or filed against Manor\u2019s ex-husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The claims are barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> <em>See Union Planters Bank Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n v. Salih, </em>369 F.3d 457, 462 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Liedtke v. State Bar of Texas, </em>18 F.3d 315, 317-18 (5th Cir.1994). This appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the IFP motion is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. We caution James and Manor that the filing of frivolous appeals and motions will invite the imposition of a sanction. In light of the disposition of this case, the motions for appointment of counsel are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
