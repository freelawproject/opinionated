They contend that the BIA\u2019s use of streamlined procedures, affirming the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, deprived them of their right to an administrative appeal and amounted to mass-production appellate review; that the BIA erred by affirming the IJ\u2019s decision rejecting their asylum and withholding-of-deportation claims; and that the BIA erred by affirming the IJ\u2019s decision rejecting them relief under the Convention Against Torture. We deny the petition for review for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">First, the BIA\u2019s summary-affirmance procedures \u201cdo not deprive this court of a basis for judicial review and ... do not violate due process.\u201d <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Second, the Gebremeskels have failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution on any ground if they were to return to Ethiopia. <em>See Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994). Third, the Gebremeskels have failed to demonstrate any likelihood of torture were they to return to Ethiopia. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"Ajx\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-11\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
