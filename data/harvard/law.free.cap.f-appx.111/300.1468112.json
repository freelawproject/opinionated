Propes (Propes), Texas prisoner # 1178904, proceeding <em>pro se </em>and <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP), appeals the dismissal of his civil rights suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court dismissed Propes\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action as repetitious because Propes raised a similar claim in a previously-filed civil rights suit, which is currently pending before the district court. Propes argues only that he received inadequate medical care while confined in the Collin County Detention Facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-23\">On appeal, Propes does not challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights suit as repetitious. Rather, he argues the merits of his inadequate medical care claim. Although <em>pro se </em>briefs are afforded liberal construction, even <em>pro se </em>litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). By failing to identify any error in the district court\u2019s judgment, Propes has abandoned the issue on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-24\">Propes\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is DISMISSED as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The dismissal of the instant appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), <em>see Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996), as well as the district court\u2019s dismissal as repetitious. <em>See Bai</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>ley v. Johnson, </em>846 F.2d 1019, 1021 (5th Cir.1988) (repetitious litigation of virtually identical causes of action is subject to dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) as malicious). Propes is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Additionally, Propes\u2019s request for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
