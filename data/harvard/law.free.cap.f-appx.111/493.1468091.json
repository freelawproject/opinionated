Prime, </em>363 F.3d 1028, 1035 (9th Cir.2004).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the facts are familiar to the parties, we do not recite them here except as necessary to understand our disposition. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Vega\u2019s motion for substitution of counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">We must consider at least three factors to determine whether the district court abused its discretion in denying Vega\u2019s motion. They include: (1) timeliness, (2) the adequacy of the district court\u2019s inquiry, and (3) the degree of communication breakdown between Vega and his attorney. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>282 F.3d 758, 763-64 (9th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Corona-Garcia, </em>210 F.3d 973, 976-77 (9th Cir.2000). Vega conceded in his brief to this court that the district court conducted an adequate inquiry; thus, we consider only two factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">Vega did not suffer from a significant \u201ccommunication breakdown,\u201d <em>Prime, </em>363 F.3d at 1036, with his counsel, Price. Determining whether there was such a breakdown requires consideration of the nature and extent of the conflict between a defendant and his attorney. <em>See Smith, </em>282 F.3d at 763; <em>Corona-Garcia, </em>210 F.3d at 977. In particular, we must consider the \u201cappointed counsel\u2019s responses and conduct,\u201d <em>United States v. Adelzo-Gonzalez, </em>268 F.3d 772, 779 (9th Cir.2001), and whether the \u201cappointed counsel was ... acting in [Vega\u2019s] interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Cases in which we have found a significant breakdown in the attorney-client relationship have been marked by, for example, <em>\u201c&amp; </em>complete communications breakdown,\u201d <em>United States v. Nguyen, </em>262 F.3d 998, 1005 (9th Cir.2001), an attorney\u2019s \u201copen opposition\u201d that left the defendant \u201ceffectively unrepresented,\u201d <em>Adelzo-Gonzalez, </em>268 F.3d at 779, and \u201can atmosphere of mistrust, misgivings and irreconcilable differences.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>159 F.3d at 1159.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">As compared to those cases, there is no indication that Vega suffered from an ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>tensive conflict with Price. The only problem that Vega brought to the district court\u2019s attention was Price\u2019s failure to provide him with Spanish translations of relevant discovery materials. Price informed the court, however, that all of the materials had been read to Vega in Spanish, and that he expected the printed versions to be made available to Vega that day. We conclude, therefore, that there was not a complete breakdown of communication between Vega and Price.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Nor does the timeliness analysis favor Vega\u2019s position. This inquiry turns, at least in part, on whether granting the motion for substitution of counsel \u201cwould [have] cause[d] inconvenience and delay, both to the court and the prosecution.\u201d <em>Corona-Garcia, </em>210 F.3d at 977; <em>see also Nguyen, </em>262 F.3d at 1004. A motion submitted on the day trial is to begin is generally untimely, as granting it would undoubtedly cause both inconvenience and delay to the court and prosecution, who have set aside the trial date and prepared to go forward. That fact, however, is not always dispositive in the timeliness analysis as \u201cthe court must make a balancing determination, carefully weighing the resulting inconvenience and delay against the defendant\u2019s important constitutional right to counsel of his choice.\u201d <em>Adelzo-Gonzalez, </em>268 F.3d at 780 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Such balancing does not favor Vega, because of his limited conflict with Price and the indications that his complaints would be remedied shortly. Further, there is no evidence that Vega made an attempt to contact the court before the day trial began, either during previous court appearances with his attorney or through an external method, such as mail, regarding his concern about obtaining translations of the discovery material. We conclude, therefore, that Vega\u2019s motion was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b526-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\">. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>159 F.3d 1154, 1158 (9th Cir.1998), indicates that we review de novo a challenge to the district court\u2019s inquiry into whether \"an irreconcilable conflict\u201d existed between Vega and his counsel. We consider the same factors for the irreconcilable conflict inquiry as for review of a district court's ruling on a motion for substitution of counsel. <em>See id. </em>Any tension on the standard of review question between <em>Moore </em>and substitution of counsel cases such as <em>Prime </em>is of no consequence in this case, as either standard of review yields the same result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b526-12\">. To the extent that Vega's citation to <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975), in his opening brief may be construed as an argument that the district court erroneously denied a request for self-representation, we reject it. In general, \" '[a] criminal defendant\u2019s assertion of his right to self-representation must be timely and not for purposes of delay; it must also be unequivocal, as well as voluntary and intelligent.' \u201d <em>United States v. Kaczynski, </em>239 F.3d 1108, 1116 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>203 F.3d 614, 620 (9th Cir.2000)). Vega never made any statement before the district court expressly indicating that he wanted to represent himself, let alone an unequivocal one.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
