We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the grant of summary judgment, <em>Devereaux v. Abbey, </em>263 F.3d 1070, 1074 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Dorenbos\u2019s access to courts claim because he failed to raise an issue of material fact as to whether the confiscation of his legal materials caused him to suffer actual injury. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351-54, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). We are not persuaded by Dorenbos\u2019s contention that actual injury should be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">Dorenbos\u2019s contention that he should be allowed to amend his complaint is properly a request to file supplemental pleadings. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(d) (allowing \u201ca supplemental pleading setting forth transactions or occurrences or events which have happened since the date of the [original] pleading\u201d). Because Dorenbos did not raise supplementing his complaint with the district court, we decline to address it. <em>See Devereaux, </em>263 F.3d at 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">To the extent Dorenbos contends that the district court erred in denying his request for appointment of counsel, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in doing so. <em>See Rand v. Rowland, </em>113 F.3d 1520, 1525 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"AYe\">Dorenbos\u2019s motions filed August 20, 2003 and November 12, 2003 are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"AC6m\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1001-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
