Attorneys Jablonski and Wecker, co-appellees in this case, represented Ploe. The complaint alleged that Tang-Tang and other organizations not relevant to this litigation \u201care created entities and trusts created by Defendant Tangwall to improperly utilize the assets belonging to Plaintiff.\u201d The extensive list of claims included counts for conversion of assets (Count I), quantum meruit (Count II), and tortious interference with contractual relations (Count III). In addition to claims for money damages, Ploe sought an order appointing a receiver for Goodrich and injunctive relief regarding a motel in Vassar, Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-18\">Tangwall entered an appearance <em>pro se, </em>but none of the other entities that Tang-wall allegedly created for improper purposes, including Tang-Tang, entered an appearance. None filed any responsive pleading. Instead, on January 22, 2002, Tangwall, Mark Ploe, and his wife Linda, and the attorneys entered into an extremely broad Settlement Agreement and Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>eral Release that purported to resolve not only the pending ease, but also any future claims that could again lead to litigation between the parties. The releases extended from \u201cthe beginning of time to the date of entry of a final order in all of the Bankruptcy Trustee\u2019s proceedings<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against any of the parties of this General Release,\u201d a period that includes all of the events relevant to the action before us. Tangwall, \u201cfor himself and each of his predecessors, successors, heirs, assigns, executors, administrators, agents or any other representatives\u201d released and forever discharged the Ploes and Attorneys Jablonski, ... and Wecker \u201cfrom any and all claims, demands, rights, causes of action, judgments, executions, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including attorney fees or court costs) which Tangwall has or <em>might have, </em>which are known or unknown.\u201d (emphasis added). The parties also agreed that \u201cthis Release is to be read as <em>broadly as possible, </em>so as to preclude <em>any farther claims </em>by Tangwall against the Ploes, Michael A. Jablonski, David A. Wecker, and Mark Jendrek.\u201d (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">As a result of the agreement, the Michigan state court dismissed with prejudice Ploe\u2019s suit against Tangwall and the others. Tangwall agreed to dismiss with prejudice the Ploes, Jablonski and Wecker from an adversary proceeding in Bankruptcy Court, the ultimate settlement of which included Tangwall\u2019s release of all claims against Goodrich. Tangwall also agreed to dismiss with prejudice 1) his appeal in a case against the Ploes pending in the Tennessee Court of Appeals; 2) his contempt proceedings against the Ploes in the Bankruptcy Court; 3) to release the Ploes, Jablonski, Wecker and Jendrek \u201cfrom all proceedings in Bankruptcy Court and in any and all other Courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">In spite of these comprehensive settlement agreements, Tangwall now argues that he is the assignee of a \u201cchose of action\u201d that Tang-Tang may properly bring against the appellees because it was not a party to either the January 22, 2002 or the subsequent bankruptcy settlement. Tangwall does not share with us the specifics of the \u201cchose of action\u201d he allegedly received from Tang-Tang. His complaint alleges malfeasance in connection with his removal from Goodrich and the appointment of a receiver, although the fact section and prayer for relief mention that the receiver cancelled a contract with Tang-Tang. As Tangwall is a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff, albeit a very experienced one, we will interpret his complaint as both challenging his dismissal from Goodrich and claiming rights as an assignee to a marketing contract between Tang-Tang and Goodrich that the latter allegedly cancelled on November 29,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">It is not clear from the record how Tang-Tang Marketing could have, <em>ab initio, </em>the right to pursue the current cause of action related to Tangwall\u2019s removal from Goodrich, so we assume that Tang-wall himself assigned his claim to Tang-Tang in an attempt to shield it from both settlement agreements. We have serious doubts as to whether Tang-Tang Marketing exists as a separate entity from Tang-wall himself,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or that the alleged assign<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>ment of rights ever took place: the best evidence Tangwall could produce in the four months between filing his complaint and the grant of summary judgment to the defendants was his own unnotarized and undated affidavit attesting to the transfer. Bald assertions are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(e); <em>Bryant v. Ky., </em>490 F.2d 1273, 1275 (6th Cir.1974) (holding that an opponent to a summary judgment motion \u201cmay not rest merely upon his pleadings but ... [must] show genuine issues of fact. Mere conclusory and unsupported allegations, rooted in speculation, do not meet that burden.\u201d). Accordingly, we are not convinced that Tangwall created a genuine issue of material fact regarding his status as Tang-Tang Marketing\u2019s assignee because he did not provide adequate evidence that Tang-Tang assigned him an ownership interest in a valid contract or employment claim against Goodrich. <em>See </em>6 Am.Jur.2d <em>Assignments </em>\u00a7 113 (1999) (requiring clear and unequivocal indication of intent to transfer rights and description of the subject matter of the assignment). Therefore, it appears that the district court properly found that Tangwall had not presented a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">111 ;</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Tang-wall\u2019s own unsworn affidavit creates an interference of an assignment strong enough to overcome summary judgment, we still affirm the district court\u2019s finding that Tangwall had waived his claims. Tangwall was acting as a representative of Tang-Tang, a named party defendant in Ploe\u2019s action in the Michigan state court, but Tang-Tang failed to file any pleading in that action and was in default. The language of the January 2002 release, which was intended to be \u201cread as broadly as possible,\u201d includes claims that Tangwall \u201cmight have\u201d in the future against the Ploes, Jablonski, and Wecker in whatever capacity Tangwall might assert them. It therefore bars Tangwall\u2019s claims, in an assignee capacity or in any other capacity, against Mark Ploe, Michael Jablonski and David Wecker.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Although the remaining defendant, Goodrich, was not a party to the January 22, 2002 settlement, the complaint in the present case does not state a breach of contract claim against Goodrich because it is based upon the conduct of the company\u2019s court-appointed receiver, Robert Looby, who cancelled the marketing contract between Goodrich and Tang-Tang. It is well established that a court-appointed receiver is not the representative or agent of the corporation, or of any party to the suit in which the receiver is appointed. The receiver is an officer of the court, an agent through whom the court acts. 16 William Meade Fletcher, <em>Fletcher Cyclopedia Corporations </em>\u00a7 7810 (1998). Because a corporation, while its property is in the hands of a receiver, has no control over the receiver, the corporation is not responsible for liabilities arising from negligence or willful torts of the receiver. 65 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Receivers </em>\u00a7 285 (2001). Tangwall therefore has no claim against Goodrich.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">The district court found that Tangwall either failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact to support his claims or that such claims were barred by the August 30, 2002 Order Approving Settlement in the Bankruptcy Court. The judgment of the district court can be affirmed if it is correct for any reason. <em>United States Postal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number><em>Serv. v. National Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers, </em>380 F.3d 747, 750 (6th Cir.2003). Although we are inclined to agree that Tangwall failed to \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e), we resolve this case by holding that Tangwall\u2019s claims are barred by the January 22, 2002 Settlement and General Release and by the fact that Tangwall cannot state a valid cause of action against Goodrich based on the actions of its receiver. Therefore we AFFIRM district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-6\">.
