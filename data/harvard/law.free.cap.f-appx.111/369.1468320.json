Workman, a Tennessee prisoner under a death sentence, appeals from a district court judgment dismissing as meritless his civil rights action filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Upon examination, this panel unanimously concludes that oral argument is not needed. Fed. RApp. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">In 1982, a Tennessee jury convicted Workman of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death. After an unsuccessful direct appeal and post-conviction proceedings in the Tennessee courts, Workman filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court denied the petition as meritless, and this court affirmed that decision. <em>Workman v. Bell, </em>178 F.3d 759 (6th Cir.1998). Workman then petitioned this court to file a second \u00a7 2254 petition or to recall its mandate and reconsider the denial of his first \u00a7 2254 petition. This court initially denied his petition; upon rehearing en banc, the court\u2019s initial order remained in effect after the court equally divided on the resolution of Workman\u2019s claims. <em>Workman v. Bell, </em>227 F.3d 331 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">Following this court\u2019s denial of Workman\u2019s motion to file a successive \u00a7 2254 petition, Workman moved this court to reopen his prior appeal and appoint a special master. Workman argued that the state had committed fraud upon the court, and he alleged that: 1) the Tennessee Attorney General improperly held meetings with the Tennessee Board of Probation and Parole (TBPP) designed to secure his execution; 2) the TBPP was hostile to his witnesses during the clemency proceedings; 3) the State presented fabricated evidence during the clemency proceedings; and 4) a retired police officer falsely testified during the clemency proceedings. This court denied Workman\u2019s motions. <em>Workman v. Bell, </em>245 F.3d 849 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-14\">In March 2001, Workman returned to the district court and filed his \u00a7 1983 complaint, alleging that: 1) the defendants fabricated and presented false evidence during his state clemency proceedings; 2) the Tennessee Attorney General improperly advised the TBPP concerning his clemency request while simultaneously preparing the case against commuting Workman\u2019s sentence; 3) Workman was entitled to heightened protections under the Eighth Amendment because he presented evidence of his innocence; and 4) the defendants conspired to deprive him of a fair clemency hearing in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3). The district court denied Workman\u2019s motion for a temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>restraining order, <em>Workman v. Summers, </em>136 F.Supp.2d 896 (M.D.Tenn.2001), and this court affirmed that decision. <em>Workman v. Summers, </em>8 Fed.Appx. 371 (6th Cir. Mar.29, 2001). The district court subsequently granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>Workman v. Summers, </em>No. 3:01-0290, 2001 WL 1782877 (M.D.Tenn. Oct.31, 2001). Workman has filed a timely appeal from this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Workman\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal of a case for failure to state a claim. <em>Arrow v. Fed. Reserve Bank, </em>358 F.3d 392, 393 (6th Cir.2004). The court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, accept his factual allegations as true, and determine whether he can prove any set of facts in support of his claims that would entitle him to relief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Even if this court accepts Workman\u2019s factual allegations as true, they are not sufficient to entitle him to relief. Death row inmates have no constitutional right to clemency proceedings, <em>Herrera v. Collins, </em>506 U.S. 390, 414, 113 S.Ct. 853, 122 L.Ed.2d 203 (1993); <em>Workman, </em>245 F.3d at 852, or the commutation of a sentence, <em>Ohio Adult Parole Auth. v. Woodard, </em>523 U.S. 272, 280, 118 S.Ct. 1244, 140 L.Ed.2d 387 (1998) (plurality opinion); <em>Connecticut Bd. of Pardons v. Dumschat, </em>452 U.S. 458, 464, 101 S.Ct. 2460, 69 L.Ed.2d 158 (1981), and pardon and commutation decisions are rarely appropriate subjects for judicial review. <em>Woodard, </em>523 U.S. at 280, 118 S.Ct. 1244; <em>Dumschat, </em>452 U.S. at 464,101 S.Ct. 2460; <em>Workman, </em>245 F.3d at 852. While the federal courts do not act as a \u201csuper appeals court\u201d over state commutation proceedings, <em>Workman, </em>245 F.3d at 852, some minimal procedural safeguards do apply to clemency proceedings regardless of whether the power to grant clemency is solely entrusted to the executive. <em>Woodard, </em>523 U.S. at 289, 118 S.Ct. 1244 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring with three other Justices); <em>Workman, </em>245 F.3d at 852. For example, judicial intervention could be necessary if a state official flips a coin to determine whether to grant the prisoner clemency or if the state arbitrarily denies the prisoner access to its clemency process. <em>Woodard, </em>523 U.S. at 289, 118 S.Ct. 1244 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring with three other Justices); <em>Workman, </em>245 F.3d at 852. The federal court is not authorized to review the substantive merits of the state clemency proceeding or the quality of the evidence considered during those proceedings, and the court\u2019s review is limited to determining whether some minimal procedural safeguards existed. <em>Workman, </em>245 F.3d at 852-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">This court has already rejected most of Workman\u2019s arguments. For his first two claims, Workman argues that the defendants fabricated and presented false evidence during his state clemency proceedings and that the Tennessee Attorney General improperly advised the TBPP concerning his clemency request. Workman previously raised these same arguments in his motions to reopen and appoint a special master, and this court rejected the arguments as an insufficient basis to review the state clemency proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 852. Although the Tennessee Governor has denied Workman\u2019s request for clemency since this court\u2019s prior decision, the Governor\u2019s action in adopting the TBPP\u2019s recommendation and denying clemency does not affect Workman\u2019s claims regarding the TBPP\u2019s review of his clemency request and does not alter this court\u2019s previous conclusion that his claims are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Workman also argues that, under the Eighth Amendment, he is entitled to heightened protections and review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>the state clemency proceedings than is provided under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. However, the plurality opinion in <em>Woodard </em>has rejected this argument. 523 U.S. at 279-81, 118 S.Ct. 1244. Lastly, Workman argues that he is entitled to relief under \u00a7 1985(3) because the defendant conspired to violate his constitutional rights. Since \u00a7 1985(3) is only a remedial statute and establishes no substantive rights, <em>see Volunteer Med. Clinic, Inc. v. Operation Rescue, </em>948 F.2d 218, 226 (6th Cir.1991), Workman\u2019s argument is without merit as he has not established a violation of any substantive right.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Accordingly, this court affirms the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
