We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">1. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence based on a determination of reasonable suspicion. <em>United States v. Lopez-Soto, </em>205 F.3d 1101, 1103 (9th Cir.2000). We review the district court\u2019s underlying factual findings for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">2. Reasonable Suspicion</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">A traffic stop conforms with the Fourth Amendment if the officer has reasonable suspicion that the driver committed a traffic violation. <em>Id. </em>at 1104-05. By statute, Arizona drivers making right turns must turn \u201cas close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway.\u201d Ariz. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 28-751(1). The district court found that the driver of the car in which Martinez-DeLoera was a passenger did not turn as close as practicable to the right-hand curb, in violation of the Arizona statute. Martinez-DeLoera fails to show how this finding is clearly erroneous. Thus, the evidence adduced at trial fully supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Officer Ruiz had reasonable suspicion to stop the car in which Martinez-DeLoera was a passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b538-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
