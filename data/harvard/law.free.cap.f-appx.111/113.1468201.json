We conclude that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider Nachtsheim\u2019s contract claim under the Railway Labor Act, and we vacate that part of its order granting Continental Airlines, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Inc. (Continental) summary judgment. In all other respects, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Nachtsheim concedes that a six-month statute of limitations applies to his claim against the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (the Union) for breach of its duty of fair representation. Br. of Appellant at 17. Such a claim accrues \u201cwhen the plaintiff receives notice that the union will proceed no further with the grievance.\u201d <em>Vadino v. A Valey Eng\u2019rs, </em>903 F.2d 253, 260 (3d Cir.1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nachtsheim plainly received such notice in the Union\u2019s letter of November 24, 2000, which stated that \u201cno future appeal will be made\u201d and that \u201cthis matter will be removed from the System Board of Adjustment and considered closed in the District files.\u201d Nachtsheim has not argued that his receipt of the letter was delayed, and even assuming it arrived as late as December 15 of that year, he would have been obligated to bring suit no later than June 15, 2001. His original complaint was thus untimely when filed on September 21, 2001, and the Union was entitled to summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Nachtsheim also argues that the District Court erred in granting Continental\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Summary judgment may be granted if the moving party establishes that \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that [it] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). All inferences drawn from the facts submitted to the District Court must be drawn \u201cin the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d <em>Goodman v. Mead Johnson &amp; Co., </em>534 F.2d 566, 573 (3d Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">Applying these principles, we agree with the District Court that Continental was entitled to summary judgment on Nachtsheim\u2019s state law claims for breach of contract. Section 2 of the Railway Labor Act (RLA), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151a, made applicable to the nation\u2019s airlines by 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 181, preempts state law governing \u201cminor\u201d disputes between employers and employees. <em>See Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. v. Norris, </em>512 U.S. 246, 256, 114 S.Ct. 2239, 129 L.Ed.2d 203 (1994) (citing sources). A dispute is minor if it involves \u201cthe interpretation or application of existing labor agreements,\u201d <em>id., </em>whereas a major dispute involves \u201crights and obligations that exist independent of the CBA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260, 114 S.Ct. 2239. It is tautological that a contract right cannot be independent of a contract and that determining whether Continental breached the CBA and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied therein will involve \u201cinterpretation and application\u201d of the CBA. Nachtsheim\u2019s state law contract claims were thus \u201cminor\u201d disputes and were preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Nachtsheim\u2019s <em>federal </em>contract claim presents a thornier issue. He brought the claim under section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, but that Act does not apply to employers subject to the RLA. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(2). By a 1936 amendment, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 181-185, the coverage of the RLA was extended, with minor exceptions, to \u201cevery common carrier by air engaged in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d Because Continental is a \u201ccommon carrier by air,\u201d it is subject to the RLA, not the Labor Management Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Under the RLA, federal courts generally do not have jurisdiction over \u201cminor\u201d disputes (as defined above), which must be litigated before special arbitral or administrative tribunals. <em>See Childs v. Pa. Fed\u2019n Bhd. of Maint. Way Employees, 831 </em>F.2d 429, 433 (3d Cir.1987). Federal jurisdiction lies for such disputes in only four exceptional situations: (1) when \u201cthe employer repudiates the private grievance machinery\u201d; (2) when \u201cresort to administrative remedies would be futile\u201d; (3) when \u201cthe employer is joined in a DFR claim against the union\u201d; or (4) when \u201cthe union\u2019s DFR breach causes the employee to lose the right to present his or her grievance.\u201d <em>Miklavic v. USAir Inc., </em>21 F.3d 551, 555 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The first two exceptions clearly do not apply here. The third seems promising at first blush, but we have held that it applies only when the plaintiff alleges facts \u201ctying the employer to the events complained of,\u201d such as \u201ccollusion or some similar nexus between the union and the employer,\u201d rather than \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d claims. <em>Masy v. N.J. Transit Rail Operations, Inc., </em>790 F.2d 322, 327 (3d Cir.1986). Nachtsheim alleges that Continental terminated him without cause and that his Union failed to provide him with competent and effective representation. These are separate and distinct claims, and Nachtsheim has not adduced any evidence of \u201ccollusion or some similar nexus\u201d that would warrant joining his employer in his federal suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The fourth and final exception is also unavailing. This Court took pains in <em>Childs </em>to emphasize that the fourth exception \u201cis a narrow one and cannot be interpreted as undermining the general rule of exclusive NRAB jurisdiction for minor disputes.\u201d <em>Childs, </em>831 F.2d at 441. The plaintiff must meet the \u201cheavy burden\u201d of showing that \u201cthe union\u2019s breach of its DFR precluded his recovery from the railroad, and that his reliance on the union was reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nachtsheim has not come close to meeting this standard, even at the summary judgment stage. He has neither disputed that the Union had the power under the CBA to decline to prosecute his claim further, nor claimed that the Union\u2019s representation was the sine qua non to proceeding further. Indeed, he acknowledges that \u201cunder the RLA an employee may bring a grievance to his employer or the NRAB on his own.\u201d Br. of Appellant at 17. In short, Nachtsheim has presented no evidence that he was \u201ccompelled by the actions of his union to turn to the federal courts.\u201d <em>Childs, </em>831 F.2d at 440. The District Court thus lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">We turn at last to the gravamen of Nachtsheim\u2019s complaint, that Continental terminated him because of his age. Our analysis is confined to the indirect evidence of discrimination Nachtsheim presented under the third prong of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test. As we explained in <em>Fuentes v. Perskie, </em>a plaintiff must do more than \u201cshow that the employer\u2019s decision was wrong or mistaken\u201d to avoid summary judgment. 32 F.3d 759, 765 (3d Cir.1994). The plaintiff must adduce evidence that the employer\u2019s proffered reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>was a <em>pretext </em>\u2014 that is, \u201ca post hoc fabrication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 764. A reasonable factfinder may then infer that \u201cthe real motivation is the one that the plaintiff has charged.\u201d <em>Sheridan v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>100 F.3d 1061, 1069 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Nachtsheim\u2019s evidence, which amounts to his own affidavit and criticism of the quality of Continental\u2019s investigation, does not rise to this level. He does not dispute that he was captured on Continental\u2019s security tape removing a garment bag from a closet at about the same time that another employee\u2019s bag went missing. In fact, he insists that the victimized employee\u2019s bag \u201clooked just like his.\u201d Br. of Appellant at 57. This evidence actually tends to show that any mistake by Continental was innocent. It certainly does not show \u201csuch weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Fuentes, </em>32 F.3d at 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Nachtsheim also offers as evidence of Continental\u2019s discriminatory motive a letter from Shirley Minn of Continental to Nachtsheim\u2019s union lawyer, Jeff Oliver. The letter reads in part: \u201cDespite your assertion that Dan did not take someone else\u2019s bag, the fact that this was his second career (meaning he is more mature and credible than the average junior flight attendant) the evidence overwhelmingly supports the charge of theft and being untruthful.\u201d App. II at 172. Although Nachtsheim protests that a triable issue exists as to whether Mr. Oliver or Ms. Minn originally broached the subject of his maturity, any such issue would be immaterial. Regardless of who uttered these words, their syntax makes clear that \u201cmaturity\u201d was considered, if anything, one of Mr. Nachtsheim\u2019s assets, not a liability. He was terminated \u201c[djespite\u201d his maturity, not because of it. Because Nachtsheim has failed to adduce evidence that Continental\u2019s reason for discharging him was a pretext for unlawful discrimination, Continental was entitled to summary judgment on his state and federal antidiscrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">We have considered all of the appellant\u2019s arguments and see no basis for reversal. The judgment of the District Court is therefore affirmed, except that part of its order of May 8, 2003, granting Continental summary judgment on Nachtsheim\u2019s contract claim under the RLA. That part of the order is vacated, and the matter is remanded with instructions to dismiss Nachtsheim\u2019s claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-10\">. While the District Court correctly determined that Nachtsheim's claim accrued when he received the November 24 letter, neither Nachtsheim\u2019s complaint nor the Union's answer averred this or any other date as the time of accrual. Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s decision to dismiss Nachtsheim's complaint rested on \"matters outside the pleading ... presented to and not excluded by the court,\u201d Fed.RCiv.P. 12(b), and the Union\u2019s motion should have been \"treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But since it appears from the parties\u2019 briefs on the motion that they had a \u201creasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56,\u201d <em>id., </em>and since no one presses the point on appeal, we conclude that the parties had implied notice of the conversion and that any trial error was harmless. <em>See Rose v. Bartle, </em>871 F.2d 331, 340-42 (3d Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
