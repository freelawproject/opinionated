Gutierrez was sentenced to concurrent 30-month prison terms and three-year supervised-release terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-17\">Gutierrez argues that the district court erred in denying him a two-level offense-level reduction for being a \u201cminor participant,\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), as his only involvement in the offense had been to transport a single load of marijuana from Mexico into the United States. The district court did not clearly err in determining that a drug courier\u2019s role in transporting a relatively large quantity of drugs, even if only on a single occasion, did not warrant a minor-role adjustment. <em>See United States v. Leal-Mendoza, </em>281 F.3d 473, 477 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Rojas, </em>868 F.2d 1409, 1410 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-18\">Gutierrez also contends that the district court erred in denying him a reduction based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)\u2019s \u201csafety valve\u201d criteria, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6). Because Gutierrez\u2019s version of his offense conduct still contained inconsistencies at the time of sentencing, and because his story was also in conflict with statements given by his codefendant (who was also his wife), the district court did not clearly err in concluding that Gutierrez had not truthfully provided all relevant information about the offense, as required by \u00a7 501.2(a)(5). <em>See United States v. Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d 143, 145 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-19\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b763-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
