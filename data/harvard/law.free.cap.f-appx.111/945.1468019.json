We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion, <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-30\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Torres Torres\u2019 motion for recon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>sideration because she failed to raise a cognizable error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s earlier dismissal of her appeal, which was based on her waiver of her right to appeal to the BIA. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1) (\u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d). Even if Torres Torres had provided the BIA with a legal or factual basis for concluding that the repeated and explicit waiver of her appeal rights was not considered and knowing, she did not establish that she was prejudiced as a result. <em>See Cano-Merida, </em>311 F.3d at 965 (requiring showing of prejudice as a result of alleged due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Torres Torres\u2019 remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b977-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
