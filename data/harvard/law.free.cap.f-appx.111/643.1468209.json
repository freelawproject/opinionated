For the reasons stated by the District Court in its Ruling on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment of November 27, 2002, we hold that none of these challenges rise to the level of reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-23\">We have considered all of plaintiff\u2019s claims on appeal and found them to be without merit. We hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
