Lord, </em>275 F.Supp.2d 352 (E.D.N.Y.2003). Covington asserts that she was denied a public trial because the state trial court barred her six-year-old son from the courtroom. She contends that she was denied the effective assistance of appellate counsel because her lawyer on the direct appeal failed to challenge the effectiveness of her trial counsel who, Covington argues, improperly waived her right to appear at her <em>Sandoval </em>hearing and ten bench or chambers conferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-21\">Reviewing <em>de novo </em>the denial of Covington\u2019s petition, <em>Coleman v. United States, </em>329 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir.2003), we find no \u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), suggesting that the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial requires that a defendant\u2019s young child be admitted to the courtroom. Covington seeks to bring her case within the framework of <em>Waller v. Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31 (1984), in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>which the Supreme Court held that a criminal proceeding may be closed to the public over the defendant\u2019s objection only upon satisfaction of a four-part test, <em>id. </em>at 48, 104 S.Ct. 2210. But <em>Waller, </em>which involved the closure of a hearing to the <em>entire </em>public, <em>id. </em>at 42, 104 S.Ct. 2210, is inapposite here, where the court excluded <em>only </em>Covington\u2019s son. And while the <em>Waller </em>Court noted that the public trial guarantee is \u201cfor the benefit of the defendant,\u201d the \u201cbenefit\u201d it referred to is the insurance public access provides of a fair trial. <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 46, 104 S.Ct. 2210 (citation and internal quotations omitted). Covington does not suggest that the integrity of her trial was tainted by the trial court\u2019s action. In short, the closure here \u2014 assuming that term is apt \u2014 was \u201ctoo trivial\u201d to warrant the relief Covington seeks. <em>See Peterson v. Williams, </em>85 F.3d 39, 42 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">As for Covington\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, it is far from clear as a matter of federal law that a defendant has an absolute right to be present at every stage of her trial. <em>See Kentucky v. Stincer, </em>482 U.S. 730, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2658, 96 L.Ed.2d 631 (1987). Covington relies on <em>People v. Dokes, </em>79 N.Y.2d 656, 584 N.Y.S.2d 761, 595 N.E.2d 836 (N.Y.1992), for the proposition that she had a right to be present at her <em>Sandoval </em>hearing as a matter of New York state law. As she concedes, however, <em>Dokes </em>was decided six years after her conviction and nearly three years after she was denied leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals. And while that case may not have \u201cbroke[n] any new legal ground,\u201d <em>People v. Favor, </em>82 N.Y.2d 254, 264, 604 N.Y.S.2d 494, 624 N.E.2d 631 (N.Y.1993), it created an explicit exception for situations such as this, \u201cwhere the nature of the defendant\u2019s criminal history and the issues to be resolved at the <em>Sandoval </em>hearing render the defendant\u2019s presence superfluous,\u201d <em>Dokes, </em>79 N.Y.2d at 662, 584 N.Y.S.2d 761, 595 N.E.2d 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Accordingly, Covington has failed to demonstrate that her trial attorney made an error of law or of judgment by choosing to waive her presence at the <em>Sandoval </em>hearing and at the various bench or chambers conferences. By extension, it cannot have been error for her appellate attorney not to have raised this issue on appeal, nor can Covington have been unfairly prejudiced thereby. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
