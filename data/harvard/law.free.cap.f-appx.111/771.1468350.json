The Government\u2019s unopposed motion to file a corrected brief is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-23\">Torres argues that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress because Texas Department of Public Safety Trooper Toby Schaef violated the Fourth Amendment by interrogating him and his co-defendant David Alberto Avila-Coronado (\u201cAvila\u201d) about matters exceeding the scope of the justification for the traffic stop without reasonable suspicion that a crime other than the traffic violation had been or was being committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-24\">Torres does not challenge the district court\u2019s factual finding that Trooper Schaef asked for and received consent to search the vehicle contemporaneously with his issuance of a citation to Avila. As the issuance of a citation is a permissible part of a valid traffic stop, the district court did not err in determining that Trooper Schaef did not extend the detention beyond the valid traffic stop. <em>See United States v. Shabazz, </em>993 F.2d 431, 437 (5th Cir.1993). Although Trooper Schaefs interrogation of Torres and Avila exceeded the scope of the justification for the traffic stop, this did not violate the Fourth Amendment as we have rejected \u201cany notion that a police officer\u2019s questioning, <em>even on a subject unrelated to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number><em>the purpose of a routine traffic stop, </em>is itself a Fourth Amendment violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Brigham, </em>382 F.3d 500, 508 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc) (quoting <em>Shabazz, </em>993 F.2d at 436). Accordingly, Torres\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b803-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
