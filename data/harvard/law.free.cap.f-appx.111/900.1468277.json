Teeples challenges the finding that his prior conviction under CaLPenal Code \u00a7 288(a) (2003) is a crime of violence within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">We must affirm because Teeples\u2019 argument would require us to interpret the phrase \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in that guideline differently from the use of the same term in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Medina-Maella, </em>351 F.3d 944 (9th Cir.2003). We recently held in <em>United States v. Granbois, </em>376 F.3d 993 (9th Cir.2004), that the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d has the same meaning regardless of where it appears in the Guidelines. Thus, Teeples\u2019 California conviction of a crime which we held is a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, must also be a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b933-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
