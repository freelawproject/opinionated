Because Bazilio\u2019s motion for reconsideration attacks his conviction and sentence rather than any alleged defect in the collateral review process, it constitutes a successive \u00a7 2255 application, over which the district court lacked jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 207 (4th Cir.2003), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>540 U.S. 995, 124 S.Ct. 496, 157 L.Ed.2d 395 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-21\">In accordance with <em>Winestock, </em>however, we will construe Bazilio\u2019s notice of appeal and appellate brief as a motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 application. <em>Id. </em>at 208. We have reviewed the record and conclude that Bazilio fails to meet the requirements for authorization to file such a successive application. In order to obtain authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 application, a movant must assert claims based on either: (1) newly discovered evidence sufficient to establish that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty; or (2) a new rule of constitutional law, previously unavailable, made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 118 (2000). Bazilio does not satisfy either of these conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-22\">For these reasons, we vacate the order of the district court denying Bazilio\u2019s motion for reconsideration and remand with instructions to dismiss that motion for lack of jurisdiction. To the extent Bazilio ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>plies to us for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, we deny such authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED; AUTHORIZATION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
