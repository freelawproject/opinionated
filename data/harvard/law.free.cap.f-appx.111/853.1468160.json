We grant Egal\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, and after carefully reviewing the record, we deny his petition. <em>See Menendez-Donis v. Ashcroft, </em>360 F.3d 915, 917-19 (8th Cir.2004) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-26\">Specifically, the BIA\u2019s finding of no past persecution is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Hagi-Salad v. Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 1044, 1045 (8th Cir.2004) (defining persecution). Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Egal did not establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Kondakova v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 792, 798 (8th Cir.2004) (applicant must genuinely fear persecution and offer credible, specific evidence that a reasonable person in his position would fear persecution if returned); <em>Navarijo-Barrios v. Ashcroft, </em>322 F.3d 561, 564 (8th Cir.2003) (BIA may reasonably rely on State Department\u2019s assessment of current country conditions as they relate to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>likelihood of future persecution); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(3)(i) (2004) (in cases where applicant has not established past persecution, he has burden of showing that it would not be reasonable for him to relocate, unless persecution is by a government or is government-sponsored).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Because we find that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of Egal\u2019s request for asylum, his application for withholding of removal necessarily fails as well. <em>See Regalado-Garda v. INS, </em>305 F.3d 784, 788 (8th Cir.2002) (standard for withholding of removal is more rigorous than standard for granting asylum). To the extent Egal is challenging the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief, we find no basis in the record for such a claim. <em>See Habtemicael v. Ashcroft, </em>370 F.3d 774, 780-82 (8th Cir.2004) (explaining qualification requirements for relief under CAT).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Accordingly, we deny Egal\u2019s petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
