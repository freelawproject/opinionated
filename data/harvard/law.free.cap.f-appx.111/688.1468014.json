We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Luginbyhl v. American Correctional Ass\u2019n., </em>No. CA-03-3364-AW (D.Md. Feb. 13, 2004). Further, we deny Luginbyhl\u2019s motion for emergency injunction because he did not first present that motion to the district court, and did not allege that it would have been impracticable to do so. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 8(a)(2)(A)(i). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
