We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Johnson v. Verisign, Inc., </em>No. CA-01-765A, 2002 WL 1887527 (E.D.Va. Aug. 15, 2002). We further dismiss Johnson\u2019s \u201cprotective cross-appeal\u201d (No. 03-2340) for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">No. 03-2165 <em>AFFIRMED</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">No. 03-2340 <em>DISMISSED</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
