Porter was sentenced to fifty-one months imprisonment and a consecutive eighty-four-month sentence for the \u00a7 924(c) offense. Porter\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising as a potentially meritorious issue the district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward based on Porter\u2019s assertion that she participated in the offenses in an attempt to avoid a greater harm, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K2.11, p.s. (2002), and coercion and duress, USSG \u00a7 5K2.12, p.s., but as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>serting that in her view there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Porter has been informed of her right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not filed a brief. We affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We find that the issue presented in the <em>Anders </em>brief is without merit. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>313 F.3d 219, 222 (4th Cir.2002) (appellate court lacks jurisdiction to review district court\u2019s refusal to depart unless the decision was based on a mistaken belief that the court lacked legal authority to depart). Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record for reversible error and found none. We therefore affirm the conviction and sentence. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw at this time. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
