At trial, evidence indicated that Garneau had been sexually abusing his girlfriend\u2019s eight-year-old daughter for several years. The trial court sentenced Garneau to prison terms of twenty, twenty-five and ten years to run consecutively. On appeal, Garneau now asserts his appellate attorney was constitutionally ineffective in failing to raise, on direct appeal, three claims challenging trial counsel\u2019s representation: trial counsel failed 1) to investigate adequately the State\u2019s medical evidence, and its admissibility; 2) to present mitigating witnesses and evidence in Garneau\u2019s defense; and 3) to demur to the State\u2019s evidence at the close of the State\u2019s case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-8\">We grant Garneau\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1). But to pursue this appeal, he must also obtain a certificate of appeal-ability (COA). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1). And to be entitled to a COA, Garneau must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make this showing, he must establish that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved [by the district court] in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted). Garneau has failed to make that showing. For substantially the reasons relied upon by the district court, therefore, we DENY Garneau a COA and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">. Before the district court, Garneau raised a number of other claims, alleging the State denied him trial transcripts and a fair post-conviction proceeding; his appellate attorney was ineffective for failing to raise, on direct appeal, claims challenging the prosecutor's conduct in asking the victim leading questions and presenting perjured testimony, arguing Garneau\u2019s convictions were based on \u201cimproper influence/motive to fabricate,\u201d and hearsay, and asserting Garneau is actually innocent; Garneau's trial counsel was ineffective in failing to investigate adequately the State's medical evidence, and its admissibility, and to present \"any reasonable line of defense;\u201d the prosecutor improperly asked the victim leading questions and allowed the State\u2019s witnesses to commit perjury; the evidence was insufficient to support the second rape conviction; Garneau was denied due process because \"of improper influence/motive to fabricate,\u201d and hearsay; and he is actually innocent. Dist. Ct. R. Doc. 1 at 24, 26, 31. Garneau, however, does not reassert these claims now on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
