McKeague, United States District Judge for the Western District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>MEMORANDUM OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b874-4\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Plaintiff, United States, appeals from the district court\u2019s refusal to apply the cross-reference provision of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG) under \u00a7 2K2.1, where defendant-appellee admitted to possessing a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking offense. Defendant pled guilty to possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. At sentencing, the government argued that defendant\u2019s conviction should be cross-referenced under \u00a7 2K2.1. Relying on <em>United States v. Stubbs, </em>279 F.3d 402 (6th Cir.2002) the district court concluded that applying the cross-reference would raise a constitutional problem under the Sixth Amendment. The district court sentenced defendant to 34 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding application of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Newell, </em>309 F.3d 396, 400 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">The district court refused to apply the cross-reference provision of \u00a7 2K2.1(c), based on its interpretation of and reliance on this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Stubbs. </em>However, it is now clear that <em>Stubbs </em>is no longer good law. <em>See Hams v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 558-60, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002)(holding that the constitutional mandates of <em>Apprendi, </em>do not apply to the Guidelines when the defendant\u2019s sentence remains below the maximum sentence authorized by the statute); <em>see also United States v. Helton, </em>349 F.3d 295, 300 (6th Cir.2003)(holding that <em>Stubbs </em>and the decisions upon which <em>Stubbs </em>relied did not survive <em>Harris). </em>Therefore, because the district court erred when it relied on <em>Stubbs </em>and refused to apply the cross-reference provision of the Guidelines its judgment must be vacated and the matter remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">We note that in this appeal defendantappellee raised a challenge to the constitutionality of his sentence citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), a case decided after the district court judgment was entered. We find no merit to this claim. <em>See United States v. Koch, </em>383 F.3d 436 (6th Cir.2004)(en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">The district court erred when it refused to apply the cross-reference provision of \u00a7 2K2.1. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is VACATED and this case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
