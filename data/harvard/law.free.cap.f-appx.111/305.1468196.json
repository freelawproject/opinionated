City Jail (\u201cJail\u201d), filed this <em>pro se, in forma pauperis </em>complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that he had been falsely imprisoned at the Jail in 1996 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>and 1997. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), concluding that Lewis\u2019s claims were barred by the <em>res judicata </em>doctrine as the result of the judgment in favor of most of the same defendants in Lewis\u2019s prior civil rights action, <em>Lewis v. Smith, </em>No. 97-CV-1420 (W.D.La. Sept. 11, 2000), and that the claims were barred by the applicable one-year Louisiana limitations statute for personal injury actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">All of Lewis\u2019s claims involving conditions of confinement are indeed barred by the <em>res judicata </em>doctrine, because the judgment in Lewis\u2019s prior civil rights action involved the same cause of action. <em>See Schmueser v. Burkburnett Bank, </em>937 F.2d 1025, 1031 (5th Cir.1991); <em>Nagle v. Lee, </em>807 F.2d 435, 439 (5th Cir.1987). Lewis\u2019s claims, which accrued at the latest by 1997, were also barred by the one-year limitations provision applicable to Louisiana personal injury actions. <em>See Owens v. Okure, </em>488 U.S. 235, 250, 109 S.Ct. 573, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989); <em>Jacobsen v. Osborne, </em>133 F.3d 315, 319 (5th Cir.1998). Finally, Lewis\u2019s false imprisonment claims are barred by the doctrine of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364,129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). <em>See Randell v. Johnson, </em>227 F.3d 300, 301 (5th Cir.2000) <em>(Heck </em>doctrine applies to former prisoners). The district court did not err in granting the motions to dismiss. <em>See Vulcan Materials Co. v. City of Tehuacana, </em>238 F.3d 382, 387 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Lewis\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983), and it is DISMISSED as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Lewis is warned that any future frivolous filings will subject him to sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Lewis\u2019s motion urging this court to waive \u201ccorrections and additions\u201d to his brief and to waive the record-excerpts requirement is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; MOTION DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
