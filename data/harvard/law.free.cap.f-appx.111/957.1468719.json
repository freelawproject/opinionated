To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1155 (9th Cir.2002). We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, <em>de Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 759, 761 (9th Cir.2004). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-24\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Davila-Davila\u2019s motion to reopen. Because Davila-Davila\u2019s motion to reopen was not timely filed pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion was not \u201carbitrary, irrational or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Singh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1050, 1052 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-25\">To the extent that Davila-Davila contends due process required the BIA to accept his untimely motion to reopen so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>that its decision could be based on the most current evidence, his contention fails. The decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen is within the discretion of the BIA. <em>See Ramirez-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>695 F.2d 1208 (9th Cir.1983) (holding that the motion to reopen regulations provide the BIA with discretion to determine the circumstances in which proceedings should be reopened.)</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">We lack jurisdiction to review Davila-Davila\u2019s contention that the BIA should have sua sponte reopened the proceedings to allow him to present new evidence. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d at 1156-60 (holding that the Court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s refusal to exercise its authority to reopen sua sponte).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b989-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
