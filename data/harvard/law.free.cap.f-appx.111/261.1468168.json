Anthony\u2019s motion for bail pending appeal is DENIED. <em>See Calley v. Callaway, </em>496 F.2d 701, 702 (5th Cir.1974). Anthony seeks to challenge his 2000 conviction for conspiracy, possession of stolen ma\u00fc, and bank fraud. The district court determined that although the certificate of service for the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion indicated that it was filed within the one-year limitations period set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d), Anthony had failed to submit further proof that his motion was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">To obtain a COA, Anthony must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). When, as here, a district court dismisses a \u00a7 2255 motion on procedural grounds, a COA may not issue unless the prisoner shows that \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)(\u00a7 2254 case).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-15\">\u201cA prisoner\u2019s habeas application is considered \u2018filed\u2019 when delivered to the prison authorities for mailing to the district court.\u201d <em>Sonnier v. Johnson, </em>161 F.3d 941, 945 n. 2 (5th Cir.1998)(quoting <em>Spotville v. Cain, </em>149 F.3d 374, 378 (5th Cir.1998)). \u201cTimely filing may be shown by a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(e)(1) (prisoner appeal); <em>see also Coleman v. Johnson, </em>184 F.3d 398, 401 (5th Cir.1999)(noting that the rules regarding the timeliness of a notice of appeal have been extended to the filing of habeas petitions). The certificate of service for Anthony\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, which was given in compliance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, reflects that the motion was timely. Accordingly, we grant Anthony\u2019s motion for a COA, VACATE the order dismissing the motion as untimely, and REMAND the case to the district court for further proceedings. <em>See Whitehead v. Johnson, </em>157 F.3d 384, 388 (5th Cir.1998). Anthony\u2019s motion to amend his motion for a COA is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-16\">COA GRANTED; VACATE AND REMAND; OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b294-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
