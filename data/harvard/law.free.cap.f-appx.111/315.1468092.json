He contends that the district court should have awarded him a two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). He has not established that the district court clearly erred in denying the reduction because he has not shown that he was \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d <em>United States v. Lokey, </em>945 F.2d 825, 840 (5th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Gallegos, </em>868 F.2d 711, 713 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Perez also complains about the district court\u2019s consideration of the Government\u2019s motion for a downward departure based upon Perez\u2019s substantial assistance, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. To the extent Perez asserts that he was not awarded a departure, he is incorrect. To the extent that Perez is arguing that the 55-month reduction he received was insufficient, he has not established that the district court abused its discretion in the extent of the departure. <em>See United, States v. Bell, </em>371 F.3d 239, 243 (5th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied </em>(U.S. Oct. 4, 2004) (No. 04-5954). The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
