Due to a miscommunication between Diem and the DCC physician who examined him, the DCC physician mistakenly concluded that Diem suffered from a hip injury that limited his ability to bend. As a result, DCC withdrew the job offer. Diem then filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which sued DCC under the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq. </em>The district court granted summary judgment in favor of DCC, ruling that the EEOC had not created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether DCC withdrew its job offer because it \u201cregarded\u201d Diem as disabled or because of Diem\u2019s \u201crecord\u201d of disability. Because the EEOC has not created a jury question as to whether DCC \u201cregarded\u201d Diem as \u201csubstantially limited\u201d in the major life activities of moving or working, or as to whether DCC based its rescission of the job offer on Diem\u2019s \u201crecord\u201d of disability, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b427-17\">Thomas Diem is a mechanic. From 1972 until 1996, Diem worked as a mobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>equipment mechanic for McLouth Steel in Trenton, Michigan, repairing generators, bulldozers, gasoline tankers, trucks, and jitneys (also known as hi-lows).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At this job, Diem routinely climbed large vehicles such as gasoline tankers and bulldozers, and his position also required bending, stooping, squatting, and twisting of his body. According to his supervisor, Diem was a good worker who performed every job assigned to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">In 1976, at age 29, Diem began experiencing pain in his left hip. The pain grew progressively worse. By 1981, Diem was in constant pain, and he could not sit for longer than 15 or 20 minutes, could stand for only two or three hours, and could walk for only 100 yards. Because of this condition, Diem took a medical leave of absence from McLouth Steel in March 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Diem was diagnosed with severe aseptic necrosis \u2014 a non-infeetious breakdown and degeneration of the bone. In April 1982, Diem had hip replacement surgery. He returned to his job at McLouth Steel in July 1983, following a long recovery. Though he experienced mild pain in his left hip area, Diem was able to perform all of his job duties without accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">In March 1996, McLouth Steel closed. Diem joined Friendly Ford as an auto mechanic, and he performed his job without any restrictions, even though the job required bending, stooping, and twisting. In February 1996, prior to McLouth Steel\u2019s closure, Diem had applied for employment with DCC. In July 1996, he interviewed with Stephen Venglarcik, Maintenance Area Manager at DDC\u2019s Detroit Axle Plant, and another supervisor for a position as a jitney repair mechanic. Diem was offered the job contingent upon his passing a physical examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Prior to the examination, Diem completed a \u201cSelf-Administered Medical History\u201d form. On the form, Diem disclosed, among other things, that he had undergone hip replacement surgery and that, either presently or in the past, he suffered \u201chip, knee, ankle, or foot trouble or injury,\u201d \u201chip, knee, ankle, or foot operation,\u201d and \u201c[p]ainful or swollen joints.\u201d Additionally, a DCC employee prepared a \u201cPreplacement Examination Insert\u201d form, which stated that Diem had \u201cleft hip replacement due to arthritis in 1982\u201d and walked \u201cwith limp due to hip replacement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Dr. Ajit Ray, then Plant .Physician for the Detroit Axle Plant, examined Diem. According to Diem, Ray performed \u201ca normal physical.\u201d However, Diem had difficulty understanding Ray because of Ray\u2019s heavy accent, and he did not comply with what he later learned were Ray\u2019s requests that he perform \u201cphysical tests,\u201d including bending, stooping, and squatting. According to Diem, had he understood Ray\u2019s instructions, he could have successfully completed the tests. Diem did understand Ray\u2019s inquiry about a scar on his hip, and he informed Ray that the mark was from hip replacement surgery. Diem claims that he told Ray that he \u201cdid not understand what [Ray] was saying\u201d two or three times. At his deposition, Ray testified that he could not remember the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">To Diem\u2019s surprise, approximately 15 minutes after he left Ray\u2019s office, a receptionist informed him that he had \u201cfailed\u201d the examination. Ray completed an assessment form designating Diem as \u201cPhysically Qualified with [] specific restriction[s].\u201d Specifically, Ray marked the following \u201cPhysical Qualification Codes\u201d on the form: (1) \u201cPQX 40\u201d \u2014 \u201cNo Climbing. Permits ground level or platform work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>and ordinary stair climbing\u201d; and (2) \u201cPQX 60\u201d \u2014 \u201cMinimal stooping, squatting, bending, or twisting of body.\u201d Additionally, Ray wrote on the form, \u201cNo Squatting,\u201d \u201cNo Climbing,\u201d and \u201cNo Flexing of [Left] Hip [Greater Than] 90 .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Ray forwarded his assessment to Christine Soukup, employment supervisor at the Detroit Axle Plant, and the pair discussed Ray\u2019s conclusions. According to Soukup, Ray advised that, because of \u201csomething with the hip,\u201d Diem could not \u201cbend over into the jitney\u201d without a risk of \u201csignificant harm.\u201d Soukup then had several conversations with \u201coperating management,\u201d that is, Diem\u2019s potential supervisors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Soukup explained the physical restrictions identified by Ray to the supervisors, and inquired whether they had a position available for Diem given his limitations. Soukup and the supervisors determined that Diem could not function as a jitney repair mechanic, a position requiring regular bending, but could perform \u201cbench work.\u201d Because a suitable position was not open at the Detroit Axle Plant, DCC rescinded its offer of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The next month, Diem filed a charge with the EEOC. Approximately a year later, in the summer of 1997, DCC offered Diem a job at a different facility, which Diem declined based on the location and because he had scheduled a second hip replacement surgery for later that year. Finally, in January 1998, DCC hired Diem as a jitney repair mechanic at a third facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The EEOC filed suit against DCC in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, charging that DCC \u201chad failed to hire Diem as a Jitney Repairman at its Detroit Axle Plant on the basis of his disability (mobility impairment)\u201d in violation of the ADA. The EEOC conceded that Diem was not actually disabled, but contended that DCC refused to hire Diem because it \u201cregarded\u201d him as disabled and because of Diem\u2019s \u201crecord of\u2019 disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">The district court granted DCC\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court rejected the EEOC\u2019s argument that DCC \u201cregarded\u201d Diem as having a \u201cmobility\u201d disability, reasoning that DCC simply believed that Diem lacked the mobility to perform a particular job rather than believing that Diem\u2019s mobility was severely restricted in comparison to an average person in the general population. Further, the court dismissed the EEOC\u2019s contention that DCC \u201cregarded\u201d Diem as having a \u201cworking\u201d disability. It explained that, although DCC believed that Diem\u2019s condition substantially limited his ability to work, this belief did not give rise to liability because it was based on Diem\u2019s failure to perform the tests \u2014 itself the product of \u201cmiscommunication\u201d \u2014 and not on \u201cbiases, ignorance, or unfounded fears\u201d about Diem\u2019s impairments. Finally, the court determined that the evidence did not permit a finding that DCC was aware of Diem\u2019s \u201crecord of a disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">The district court later denied the EEOC\u2019s motion for reconsideration. The court rejected the EEOC\u2019s argument that an employer \u201cregards\u201d an employee as \u201cdisabled\u201d regardless of whether its misperception of the individual\u2019s abilities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>stems from bias or from a miscommunication. The court reiterated its ruling that \u201c[b]eeause Dr. Ray\u2019s assessment of Diem followed an individualized examination and there is no evidence that Dr. Ray\u2019s determination was infected with stereotypes or prejudice, [DCC\u2019s] assessment of Diem should be excepted from liability under the ADA.\u201d Additionally, the court identified another bar to a finding that DCC \u201cregarded\u201d Diem as \u201cdisabled,\u201d concluding that, contrary to its earlier ruling, the EEOC had not created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether DCC believed that Diem was \u201csubstantially limited\u201d in the major life activity of \u201cworking.\u201d The court found that the evidence merely indicated that DCC deemed Diem incapable of performing a particular job rather than a range of jobs. The EEOC timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\n<em>1. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Williams v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>187 F.3d 553, 560 (6th Cir.1999). Summary judgment will be granted where there exists no genuine issue of material fact. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). No genuine issue of material fact exists when \u201cthe record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). The court views the evidence, all facts, and any inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Skousen v. Brighton High Sch., </em>305 F.3d 520, 526 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">\n<em>2. The ADA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A9q\">The ADA provides</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">No covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (2001). To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must show (1) that he is \u201cdisabled\u201d within the meaning of the ADA, (2) that he is otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of his job with or without reasonable accommodation, and (3) that he suffered an adverse employment action because of the disability. <em>Henderson v. Ardco, Inc., </em>247 F.3d 645, 649 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">An individual is \u201cdisabled\u201d within the meaning of the ADA if he (a) has \u201ca physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual,\u201d (b) has \u201ca record of such impairment,\u201d or (c) is \u201cregarded as having such an impairment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2). An individual is \u201cregarded as\u201d having a disability if \u201c(1) a covered entity mistakenly believes that a person has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, or (2) a covered entity mistakenly believes that an actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities.\u201d <em>Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 471, 489, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\"><em>S. \u201cRegarded </em>As \u201d <em>Disabled</em></p>\n<p id=\"AUb\">The district court properly concluded that the EEOC has not created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether DCC \u201cregarded\u201d Diem as \u201csubstantially limited\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>in the \u201cmajor life activities\u201d of \u201cmoving\u201d and \u201cworking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\n<em>a. The Major Life Activity of \u201cMoving\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The EEOC had not created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether DCC believed that Diem\u2019s hip injury \u201csubstantially limited\u201d him in the major life activity of \u201cmoving.\u201d In granting DCC summary judgment, the district court recognized \u201cmoving\u201d \u2014 in particular, bending, twisting, stooping, and squatting \u2014 as a \u201cmajor life activity.\u201d However, the court determined that the EEOC had not created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether DCC believed that Diem\u2019s hip condition \u201csubstantially limited\u201d his \u201cmovement.\u201d The court determined that Dr. Ray\u2019s examination measured Diem\u2019s ability to \u201cperform a job that required more than minimal bending, stooping, squatting, or twisting of the body or climbing\u201d rather than his \u201cability to perform these major life activities in general.\u201d J.A. at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">EEOC regulations define \u201csubstantially limits\u201d as (1) \u201cUnable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform,\u201d or ri(2) \u201cSignificant!y restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major activity.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2GX1) (2003). The regulations identify the following factors as relevant in determining whether an individual meets this definition: (i) \u201cThe nature and severity of the impairment\u201d; (ii) \u201cThe duration or expected duration of the impairment\u201d; and (iii) \u201cThe permanent or long term impact, or the expected permanent or long term impact of or resulting from the impairment.\u201d 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(j)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">The Supreme Court has stressed that the term \u201csubstantial limits\u201d creates a \u201cdemanding standard.\u201d <em>Toyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, </em>534 U.S. 184, 197, 122 S.Ct. 681, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002). To rise to the level of a \u201csubstantial limitation,\u201d an impairment must \u201cprevent[] or severely restrict[ ] an individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people\u2019s daily lives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 122 S.Ct. 681. An ADA claimant cannot rely solely on a medical diagnosis, but instead must offer \u201cevidence that the extent of the limitation caused by their impairment in terms of their own experience is substantial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 122 S.Ct. 681 (quoting <em>Albertson\u2019s, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, </em>527 U.S. 555, 567, 119 S.Ct. 2162, 144 L.Ed.2d 518 (1999)) (internal punctuation omitted). Additionally, the inquiry must focus on the effect of the impairment on the individual\u2019s daily life, not on its effect on the individual\u2019s ability to perform a specific job. <em>Id. </em>at 200-01, 122 S.Ct. 681. The Supreme Court squarely rejected the idea that \u201cthe question of whether an impairment constitutes a disability is to be answered only by analyzing the effect of the impairment in the workplace.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201, 122 S.Ct. 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">As the district court concluded, the EEOC cannot establish \u201csubstantiality\u201d with respect to Diem\u2019s ability to \u201cmove\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>because its evidence relates solely to Diem\u2019s ability to move in the workplace. The EEOC relies primarily on the \u201cPQX 40\u201d and \u201cPQX 60\u201d codes that Dr. Ray assigned to Diem. As defined in DCC documents, \u201cPQX\u201d means \u201cPhysically Qualified with the specific restriction number listed,\u201d and the numbers \u201c40\u201d and \u201c60\u201d mean \u201cNo climbing. Permits ground level or platform work and ordinary stair climbing,\u201d and \u201cMinimal stooping, squatting, bending, or twisting of the body,\u201d respectively. J.A. at 99. On their face, then, the codes simply identify limitations applicable at the workplace and do not speak to an individual\u2019s ability to function in daily life.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The other evidence relied on by the EEOC also does not show that DCC viewed Diem as substantially restricted in his ability to \u201cmove\u201d in daily life. Ray wrote \u201cNo Flexing of [Left] Hip [Greater than] 90 \u201d on the form he completed following Diem\u2019s examination. J.A. at 55. Soukup testified that Ray informed her that Diem risked \u201csignificant harm\u201d if he \u201cbent over into the jitney.\u201d J.A. at 69. Steven Venglarcik, who interviewed Diem for the position of jitney repair mechanic, stated that he was told \u201cthat Mr. Diem had job restrictions that prevented him from performing the normal duties of a jitney repair mechanic. As I recall there was concern that his hip might \u2018popout.\u2019 \u201d J.A. at 40. This evidence establishes that DCC doubted whether Diem\u2019s hip could withstand the rigors of the job of jitney repair mechanic, but sheds little light on the impact that DCC believed that Diem\u2019s condition would have on his everyday activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The EEOC argues that Ray\u2019s assessment \u201cwas not tied to any job\u201d and that \u201cthe evidence strongly suggests that Dr. Ray believed that Diem\u2019s perceived limitations would affect him outside the workplace as well as on the job.\u201d EEOC Br. at 17-18. We agree that Ray did not evaluate Diem for a particular position at the Detroit Axle Plant and that a reasonable jury could find that DCC believed that Diem\u2019s limitations \u201caffected\u201d him outside the workplace, but this does not create a jury issue as to the \u201csubstantiality\u201d of the perceived limitation. To prevail, the EEOC must show that DCC perceived Diem\u2019s impairment as \u201cconsiderably and profoundly\u201d limiting his ability to \u201cmove\u201d as compared to the average person in the general population. <em>Mahon v. Crowell, </em>295 F.3d 585, 591 (6th Cir.2002). The evidence adduced by the EEOC arguably shows that DCC believed that Diem\u2019s hip condition significantly restricted his ability to function as a jitney repair mechanic at the Detroit Axle Plant, but leaves the jury to speculate as to the severity of the \u201caffect\u201d of the perceived limitation on Diem\u2019s daily life. Without evidence showing that DCC translated these job restrictions into significantly restrictive impediments to daily living, the EEOC\u2019s claim cannot survive summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">\n<em>b. The Major Life Activity of \u2018Working\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">The district court also correctly concluded that the EEOC has not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether DCC believed that Diem\u2019s hip injury was a \u201csubstantial limitation\u201d on the major life activity of \u201cworking.\u201d \u2018Working\u201d qualifies as a \u201cmajor life activity.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Mahon, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>295 F.3d at 590. \u201cHowever, the inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. River Valley Sch. Dist., </em>197 F.3d 804, 811 (6th Cir.1999). With respect to \u201cworking,\u201d \u201c[t]he term <em>substantially limits </em>means significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(3)(i) (emphasis in original). The EEOC regulations identify the following factors as material to the determination of whether an individual is \u201csubstantially limited\u201d in the major life activity of working:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">(A) The geographical area to which the individual has reasonable access;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">(B) The job from which the individual has been disqualified because of an impairment, and the number and types of jobs utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities, within that geographical area, from which the individual is also disqualified because of the impairment (class of jobs); and/or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">(C) The job from which the individual has been disqualified because of an impairment, and the number and types of other jobs not utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities, within that geographical area, from which the individual is also disqualified because of the impairment (broad range of jobs in various classes).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(3)(ii). The Supreme Court has summarized,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-12\">If jobs utilizing an individual\u2019s skills (but perhaps not his or her unique talents) are available, one is not precluded from a substantial class of jobs. Similarly, if a host of different types of jobs are available, one is not precluded from a broad range of jobs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-13\"><em>Sutton v.

A plaintiff has an \u201cextraordinarily difficult\u201d case because \u201c[n]ot only must a plaintiff demonstrate that an employer thought he was disabled, he must also show that the employer thought that his disability would prevent him from performing a broad class of jobs.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn employer does not nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>essarily regard an employee as disabled simply by finding the employee to be incapable of satisfying the singular demands of a particular job.\u201d <em>Cotter v.

According to Soukup, she explained Diem\u2019s limitations, as identified by Dr. Ray, to operating management, who in turn advised her that Diem could not fulfill the duties of a jitney repair mechanic because the position required \u201cbending into the jitneys.\u201d J.A. at 71-73. Operating management also informed Soukup that Diem \u201cwas able to do bench work\u201d but that \u201cthe type of work we had available within the Detroit Axle facility was the bending into the jitneys.\u201d J.A. at 72. Therefore, Soukup and operating management decided to rescind Diem\u2019s offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Contrary to the EEOC\u2019s position, Souk-up\u2019s testimony does not permit a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that Soukup and operating management regarded Diem\u2019s capacity for \u201cwork\u201d as \u201csubstantially limited.\u201d The EEOC claims that DCC viewed Diem as significantly restricted in his ability to find employment as a mechanic generally,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but Soukup\u2019s testimony only establishes that Diem was considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>unfit for the position of jitney repair mechanic at the Detroit Axle Plant. In fact, Soukup thought enough of Diem\u2019s capacities to inquire whether other positions were available at the facility, and DCC later offered Diem positions at two other facilities. Both of these facts support the conclusion that DCC did not regard Diem as \u201csubstantially limited\u201d in working. In <em>Cotter, </em>287 F.3d at 600-01, for instance, we stated that the fact that the defendant attempted to find another position for the plaintiff militated against a finding that the defendant regarded the plaintiff as substantially limited in working. And in <em>Swanson v. University of Cincinnati, </em>268 F.3d 307, 318 (6th Cir.2001), we relied on the fact that the defendant encouraged the plaintiff to pursue another speciality after the plaintiff was expelled from a surgical residency program, in concluding that the defendant did not perceive the plaintiffs impairment as significantly restrictive of his work as a physician.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">The EEOC also points to the testimony of John Kelley, the former Human Resources Manager at the Detroit Axle Plant, and the affidavit of Sherry Browning, a vocational rehabilitation counselor apparently employed as an expert by the EEOC. Kelley described the PQX 40 and PQX 60 codes as \u201crestrictive\u201d (J.A. at 107-OS), but, as the district court observed, it does not appear that Kelley had any involvement in DCC\u2019s hiring decision with respect to Diem. Browning stated that, in her opinion, based on the restrictions imposed on Diem by Dr. Ray, Diem \u201cwould have lost access to 40.6% of the skilled and semi-skilled job titles for which he has directly, closely, or generally transferable skills. He would have also lost access to 21.6% of unskilled occupations.\u201d J.A. at 110-11. However, the EEOC has not demonstrated that Soukup or operating management possessed this level of knowledge.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The testimony of individuals uninvolved in DCC\u2019s decision to rescind Diem\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>job offer does not show that DCC viewed Diem as significantly restricted in his ability to work. <em>See Rakity v. Dillon Cos., Inc., </em>302 F.3d 1152, 1163 (10th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">In sum, because the evidence demonstrates only that DCC regarded Diem as unable to perform the particular job of jitney repair mechanic, the EEOC has not created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether DCC regarded Diem as \u201csubstantially limited\u201d in working.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\n<em>4. \u201cRecord Of\u2019 Disability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The district court properly concluded that the EEOC has not created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether DCC withdrew its job offer because of Diem\u2019s \u201crecord of\u2019 disability. An individual has a \u201crecord of\u2019 disability if he \u201chas a history of, or has been misclassified as having, a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(k). The EEOC\u2019s Interpretative Guidance explains,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">This part of the definition is satisfied if a record relied on by an employer indicates that the individual has or has had a substantially limiting impairment. The impairment indicated in the record must be an impairment that would substantially limit one or more of the individual\u2019s major life activities. There are many types of records that could potentially contain this information, including but not limited to, education, medical, or employment records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. \u00a7 1630.2(k). This provision protects \u201cpeople who have recovered from previously disabling conditions (cancer or coronary disease, for example) but who remain vulnerable to the fears and stereotypes of their employers.\u201d <em>Davidson v. Midelfort Clinic, Ltd., </em>133 F.3d 499, 509 (7th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">The EEOC relies on three pieces of evidence to establish that DCC denied Diem employment based on a \u201crecord of\u2019 disability. First, on the \u201cSelf-Administered Medical History\u201d form, Diem disclosed that he had undergone hip replacement surgery and that, either presently or in the past, he suffered \u201chip, knee, ankle, or foot trouble or injury,\u201d \u201chip, knee, ankle, or foot operation,\u201d and \u201c[pjainful or swollen joints.\u201d J.A. at 101. Second, on a \u201cPreplacement Examination Insert\u201d form, a DCC employee noted \u201cleft hip replacement due to arthritis in 1982.\u201d J.A. at 49, 52, 102. Third, according to Diem\u2019s testimony, Dr. Ray \u201cpointed to my leg and wanted to know what the scar on my hip was, and I told him.\u201d J.A. at 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">As the district court concluded, this evidence does not produce a genuine issue of material fact as to whether DCC rescinded its offer <em>because of </em>a record of disability. <em>Hedrick v. W. Reserve Care Sys., </em>355 F.3d 444, 452 (6th Cir.2004) (stating that, to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, an ADA claimant must prove, among other elements, that he was not hired \u201csolely by reason of\u2019 his disability). Soukup and operating management made the decision to withdraw the offer because they believed, incorrectly as it turns out, that Diem\u2019s current physical condition prevented him from performing the job of jitney repair mechanic. Soukup testified that she did not see a copy of the \u201cSelf-Administered Medical History,\u201d and the EEOC has not identified any evidence indicating that Soukup or operating management received the Preplacement Examination Insert form or any other documentation of Diem\u2019s hip replacement surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The EEOC responds that Ray testified that he bases his evaluations on a patient\u2019s medical history as well as on his examination.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Apparently, the EEOC means to argue that (1) from this testimony, a reasonable trier of fact could infer that Ray assigned the limitations to Diem based on his hip replacement surgery in 1982, not based on his physical examination of Diem, (2) Soukup and operating management revoked the offer based on Ray\u2019s evaluation, and (3) hence Soukup and operating management revoked the offer <em>because of </em>Diem\u2019s hip replacement surgery. However, only speculation permits the conclusion that Ray assigned the limitations to Diem because Diem had hip replacement surgery in 1982 rather than because he mistakenly believed that Diem\u2019s current physical condition prevented him from bending, twisting, stooping, and squatting.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In sum, the EEOC has not presented evidence permitting a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that DCC based its decision to withdraw its job offer on any \u201crecord\u201d of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-7\">. According to Diem, a hi-low, or jitney, \"[m]oves pallets. They had electric hi-lows, gas hi-lows, diesel hi-lows, [and] propane hi-lows.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b429-8\">. Soukup could not recall the identities of the supervisors with whom she discussed Diem. Venglarcik, one of the managers who interviewed Diem, stated that he never discussed Diem's medical condition with Ray or with anyone from DCC's human resources department. However, he \"was later told that Mr. Diem told the doctor he had a hip replacement, and that Mr. Diem had job restrictions that prevented him from performing the normal duties of a jitney repair mechanic. As [Venglarcik recalled] there was concern that his hip might 'pop-out.' \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b431-8\">. The ADA does not define the term \"substantially limits.\u201d However, because DCC does not challenge the validity of the EEOC regulations, we apply them in the present case. <em>See Toyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, </em>534 U.S. 184, 194, 122 S.Ct. 681, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002) (\"Because both parties accept the EEOC regulations as reasonable, we assume without deciding that they are, and we have no occasion to decide what level of deference, if any, they are due.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b431-16\">. We assume without deciding that \"moving,\u201d as defined by the EEOC in this case, constitutes a major life activity. <em>See Hoskins v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number><em>Oakland County Sheriff\u2019s Dep\u2019t, </em>227 F.3d 719, 724 (6th Cir.2000) (identifying \"moving\u201d as one of several major life activities in a list that included breathing and performing manual tasks such as doing laundary).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b432-10\">. The Supreme Court has questioned whether \"working\u201d qualifies as a major life activity. <em>See Toyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, </em>534 U.S. 184, 200, 122 S.Ct. 681, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002) (\"Because of the conceptual difficulties inherent in the argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>that working could be a major life activity, we have been hesitant to hold as much, and we need not resolve this difficult question today.\u201d); <em>Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 471, 492, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999) (identifying \"some conceptual difficulty in defining 'major life activities\u2019 to include work\u201d but assuming without deciding that working is a major life activity). However, in accordance with the EEOC regulations, this court has recognized \"working\" as a major life activity, <em>Mahon v. Crowell, </em>295 F.3d 585, 590 (6th Cir.2002), and DCC has conceded this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b433-9\">. The EEOC contends that an ADA claimant alleging that he was \u201cregarded as\u201d substantially limited in his capacity for \"work\u201d need only show that \"the limitations the employer subjectively perceived the individual as having would, if true, significantly restrict the individual\u2019s ability to do a class or broad range of jobs.\u201d EEOC Reply Br. at 14. This position is contrary to the law in this circuit and other circuits, which requires an ADA claimant to demonstrate that the employer thought that the perceived limitation would prevent the claimant from performing a class or broad range of jobs. <em>See, e.g., Sullivan v. The Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., </em>358 F.3d 110, 118 (1st Cir.2004); <em>Carruthers v. BSA Adver., Inc., </em>357 F.3d 1213, 1216 (11th Cir.2004); <em>EEOC v. J.B. Hunt Transp., Inc., </em>321 F.3d 69, 75 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Ross v. Campbell Soup Co., </em>237 F.3d 701, 709 (6th Cir.2001); <em>Moore v. J.B. Hunt Transp., Inc., </em>221 F.3d 944, 954-55 (7th Cir.2000). We must apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>this standard even in the presence of criticism by the EEOC and academics that the standard makes it \"virtually impossible\" for a claimant to sustain a \"regarded as\u201d claim of the \"working\u201d stripe. <em>Sullivan, </em>358 F.3d at 118 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The EEOC argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Murphy v. United Parcel Service, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 516, 119 S.Ct. 2133, 144 L.Ed.2d 484 (1999), supports its interpretation. To the contrary, in <em>Murphy </em>the Court confirmed that \"to be regarded as substantially limited in the major life activity of working, one must be regarded as precluded from more than a particular job.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523, 119 S.Ct. 2133. In that case, United Parcel Service, Inc. (\"UPS) fired the plaintiff from his position as mechanic, which required that he drive commercial motor vehicles, because hypertension prevented him from being certified to drive commercial vehicles from the Department of Transportation. <em>Id. </em>at 519, 119 S.Ct. 2133. The Court concluded that, at most, UPS regarded the plaintiff \"as unable to perform the job of mechanic only when that job requires driving a commercial motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524, 119 S.Ct. 2133. According to the EEOC, \"the Court did not ask whether UPS subjectively believed that plaintiff was unqualified to be a mechanic only for UPS or for other employers as well,\u201d but rather \"considered only whether the limitation, as perceived, would preclude him from working as a mechanic.\u201d EEOC Reply Br. at 15. But a review of the text of the decision belies the EEOC\u2019s assertion. <em>See, e.g., Murphy, </em>527 U.S. at 525, 119 S.Ct. 2133 (\"[Pjetitioner has failed to show that he is regarded as unable to perform a class of jobs\u201d), 525 (\u201d[T]he undisputed record evidence demonstrates that petitioner is, at most, regarded as unable to perform only a particular job.\u201d), 524 (\"Petitioner has put forward no evidence that he is regarded as unable to perform any mechanic job that does not call for driving a commercial vehicle and thus does not require DOT certification\u201d). In holding that UPS at most regarded the plaintiff as unable to perform the single job of UPS mechanic, it appears that the Court reasoned that, because of UPS\u2019s unique requirement that its mechanics obtain DOT certification, UPS did not view the plaintiff as generally unemployable as a mechanic. <em>Id. </em>at 524-25, 119 S.Ct. 2133.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b434-10\">. We assume without deciding that the position of mechanic constitutes a \"class of jobs.\" <em>See Murphy v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>527 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>U.S. 516, 524-25, 119 S.Ct. 2133, 144 L.Ed.2d 484 (1999) (arguably assuming that \"mechanic\u201d constitutes a class of jobs); <em>cf. Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 471, 493, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999) (arguably assuming that \"airline pilot\u201d constitutes a class of jobs); <em>Black v.

However, the EEOC provides no legal support for its position that jobs requiring more than minimal \"movement\u201d constitute a \"class of jobs\u201d or broad range of jobs.\u201d <em>See McKay v. Toyota Motor Mfg., U.S.A., Inc., </em>110 F.3d 369, (6th Cir.1997) (holding that manufacturing jobs requiring repetitive motion or frequent lifting of more than ten pounds do not constitute a class of jobs).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b435-7\">. <em>See also McGeshick v.

Moreover, it is questionable whether Browning\u2019s opinion could support a finding of a \u201csubstantial limitation\u201d on Diem\u2019s ability to work. In <em>Mahon v. Crowell, </em>295 F.3d 585 (6th Cir.2002), this court held that an employee who suffered a back injury was not substantially limited in the major life activity of work even though an expert found that the employee \"suffered a 47% loss of access to his job market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 591. The court reasoned, \"We would be using a less-than-demanding standard were we to find [the employee] substantially limited in working when he is still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>qualified for over half the jobs he was qualified for before his injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 592.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b437-5\">. Ray testified that he does not recall his examination of Diem. However, he further testified that, pursuant to his general practice, he would have considered Diem's medical history in making his evaluation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b437-6\">. Additionally, the EEOC has not shown that the \"records\u201d allegedly relied upon by DCC indicate that the hip replacement surgery \"substantially limited\" Diem in any major life activity in 1982. The forms merely report that Diem had surgery and had hip \"trouble.\u201d The EEOC argues that the \"records\u201d need only \"reflect!] the kind of impairment that <em>could </em>substantially limit one or more major life activities.\u201d EEOC Br. at 37 (emphasis added). However, the cases cited by the EEOC in support of its position do not address the issue. <em>Sch. Bd. of Nassau County, Florida v. Arline, </em>480 U.S. 273, 281, 107 S.Ct. 1123, 94 L.Ed.2d 307 (1987); <em>Duda v. Bd. of Educ. of Franklin Park Pub. Sch. Dist. No. 84, </em>133 F.3d 1054, 1059 (7th Cir.1998); <em>Davidson v. Midelfort Clinic, Ltd., </em>133 F.3d 499, 510 n. 8 (7th Cir.1998). And other decisions, as well as an EEOC regulation, arguably stand for the proposition that an ADA plaintiff must demonstrate that the \u201crecord\u201d relied upon by the defendant indicated that the past impairment <em>in fact </em>\"substantially limited\u201d the plaintiff in a major life activity. <em>See, e.g., Dupre v.

In my view, the Commission created the triable issue of whether Daimler Chrysler mistakenly believed that Diem had a physical impairment that substantially limited his ability to work. It showed that the employer thought that Diem\u2019s \u201cperceived limitation would prevent him for performing a class or broad range of jobs,\u201d the plaintiffs standard correctly cited by the majority as the law in our circuit. <em>See Ross v. Campbell Soup Co., </em>237 F.3d 701, 709 (6th Cir.2001). First, the Commission presented the testimony of Steven Venglarcik, who interviewed Diem for the jitney repair mechanic job, stating that he was told \u201cthat Diem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>had job restrictions that prevented him from performing the normal duties of a jitney repair mechanic. As I recall there was concern that his hip might pop-out.\u201d As the majority acknowledges, from this evidence we may infer that his hip could not withstand the rigors of the job class\u2014 i.e., mechanic \u2014 for which he applied. Second, the Commission provides the affidavit testimony of Sherry Browning, a vocational rehabilitation counselor, who described Daimler Chrysler\u2019s perceived limitation as \u201crestrictive,\u201d and one that barred Diem\u2019s access \u201cto 40.6% of the skilled and semiskilled job titled for which he has directly, closely, or generally transferable skills.\u201d She also explained that Diem \u201clost access to 21.6% of unskilled occupations.\u201d This evidence, in my view, is enough to withstand summary judgment. Therefore, I would reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
