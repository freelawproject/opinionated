We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history and specification of appellate issues and hold as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-27\">Appellants have abandoned all relevant issues on appeal because they failed to direct any arguments toward the substance of the district court\u2019s order. <em>See Cruz v. Gomez, </em>202 F.3d 593, 596 n. 3 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Cir.2000) (\u201cWhen a litigant \u2014 including a <em>pro se </em>litigant \u2014 raises an issue before the district court but does not raise it on appeal, the issue is abandoned.\u201d). While we have the ability to consider an abandoned argument we ordinarily decline to do so unless a \u201cmanifest injustice otherwise would result.\u201d <em>See United States v. Babwah, </em>972 F.2d 30, 35 (2d Cir.1992); <em>Anderson v. Branen, </em>27 F.3d 29, 30 (2d Cir.1994). After examining the case law and relevant portions of the record we conclude that there is no need to consider abandoned arguments in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
