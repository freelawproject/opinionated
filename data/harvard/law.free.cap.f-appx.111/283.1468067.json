He appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in applying a 16-level increase to his offense level on the ground that he had been previously convicted of a drug trafficking offense. Madrazo-Constante contends that in his prior criminal case, the Georgia indictment charged him with possessing cocaine with intent to distribute and the lesser included offense of simple possession of cocaine. He asserts that he could have been convicted under Georgia criminal procedure rules of the lesser charge of simple possession, which does not constitute a drug trafficking offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-23\">He also asserts that this conviction for \u201csimple possession\u201d does not constitute an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), and therefore, an eight-level increase is not warranted. He contends that the district court should have increased his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(D), because his prior conviction constitutes \u201cany other felony\u201d under the United States Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>The indictment and judgment relied upon by the district court reflected that Madrazo-Constante pleaded guilty to Count 2 of the Georgia indictment which charged him with possession \u201cwith the intent to distribute and have under their control, cocaine.\u201d In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the preponderance of the evidence supported the assessment of the sentencing adjustment. <em>See United States v. Alfaro, </em>919 F.2d 962, 965 (5th Cir.1990). The district court did not err in imposing a 16-level adjustment for a felony drug trafficking offense. Madrazo-Constante\u2019s argument that his prior conviction does not constitute an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for an eight-level adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) is foreclosed by this court\u2019s binding decisions. <em>See United States v. Caicedo-Cuero, </em>312 F.3d 697 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 1021, 123 S.Ct. 1948,155 L.Ed.2d 864 (2003); <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">As conceded by Madrazo-Constante, his argument that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
