This enhancement was based on a comment Gooden made to a police officer after a pre-trial hearing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Although Gooden concedes that he made an \u201cinappropriate\u201d remark, he argues that it was not made with the intent to obstruct justice. Whether a threat was made with the intent to obstruct or impede the administration of justice is a fact question reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Greer, </em>158 F.3d 228, 233 (5th Cir.1998). \u201cAs long as a factual finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Huerta, </em>182 F.3d 361, 364 (5th Cir.1999). Based upon our review of the record and the circumstances under which the comment was made, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Gooden\u2019s comment was a threat intended to obstruct the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Gooden also argues that the district court erred by enhancing his offense level by an additional two levels based on his high-speed flight from the police. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2. Gooden argues that his flight was brief and did not rise to the level of reckless endangerment. Whether a defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes reckless endangerment during flight under \u00a7 3C1.2 also is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Lugman, </em>130 F.3d 113, 115-16 (5th Cir.1997). We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Gooden\u2019s brief high-speed flight amounted to reckless endangerment. <em>See United States v. Jimenez, </em>323 F.3d 320, 321-24 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 847, 124 S.Ct. 124, 157 L.Ed.2d 86 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
