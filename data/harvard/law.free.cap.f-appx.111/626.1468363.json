R.Civ.P. 37 for failure to comply with court orders and discovery requests, and the district court\u2019s denial of Strong\u2019s motion for summary judgment as moot. The parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts is assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-17\">We review an appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 37 for abuse of discretion. <em>See Valentine v. Museum of Modem Art, </em>29 F.3d 47, 49 (2d Cir.1994). The district court\u2019s findings of fact underlying such a sanction are accepted as true, unless clearly erroneous. <em>See Thomas E. Hoar, Inc. v. Sara Lee Corp., </em>900 F.2d 522, 525 (2d Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-18\">The district court properly found that Strong\u2019s complaint should be dismissed for failure to comply with court orders. An independent review of the record and relevant case law reveals no errors in the district court\u2019s decision, and that Strong\u2019s arguments on appeal are without merit. Strong openly and repeatedly flouted the magistrate judge\u2019s orders after being warned numerous times that doing so would result in a sanction of dismissal; nevertheless, he continued to challenge the court\u2019s authority by refusing to appear for depositions, refusing to cooperate in unsealing documents, and refusing to comply with discovery orders, going so far as to affront the dignity of the court by accusing it of racism and favoritism without a shred of evidence. The district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-19\">The dismissal with prejudice rendered Strong\u2019s summary judgment motion moot, and therefore, there is no need to discuss it here.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
