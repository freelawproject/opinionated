He argues that the district court clearly erred in calculating the drug quantities attributable to him under the Sentencing Guidelines. Because he has not shown that the information in the Presentence Report (PSR) concerning the drug quantities involved in the offense was \u201cmaterially untrue, inaccurate, or unreliable,\u201d he has not shown that the district court clearly erred in adopting the information in the PSR concerning the drug quantities. <em>United States v. Puig-Infante, </em>19 F.3d 929, 943 (5th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Angulo, </em>927 F.2d 202, 205 (5th Cir.1991). His argument that the district court erred in relying on the uncorroborated hearsay statements of his coconspirators lacks merit. <em>See United States v. Cooper, </em>274 F.3d 230, 240 (5th Cir.2001). He failed to show that he did not intend or was not reasonably capable of purchasing 50 kilograms of cocaine in the Florida transaction; therefore, the district court did not clearly err in including this quantity in the drug calculations for sentencing purposes. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>76 F.3d 82, 85 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">For the first time on appeal, Murietta Maldonado argues that the drug quantities should not have been aggregated because the Government did not establish that they were all in furtherance of the same conspiracy. This claim is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). He was held responsible for the marijuana and cocaine that he imported, bought, or sold during the course of the conspiracy as alleged in the indictment. He stipulated that he was involved in a single conspiracy which continued during the period alleged in the indictment. He did not establish that the district court erred in finding that he should be held responsible for the drug quantities imported throughout the ongoing conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>334 F.3d 406, 414 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">Murietta Maldonado has filed a letter pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 28(j) calling our attention to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). We have held that <em>Blakely </em>does not apply to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, \u2014 S.Ct. -, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (U.S. July 14, 2004). He acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Pineiro, </em>but he states that he is raising this issue to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review. A panel of this court cannot overrule a prior panel\u2019s decision in the absence of an intervening contrary or superseding decision by this court sitting en banc or by the United States Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 n. 34 (5th Cir.2002).
