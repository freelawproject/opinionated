Montalvo-Nunez was among a group of persons carrying bundles of marijuana into the United States from Mexico. He contends that he should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>sentenced on the basis of the marijuana he carried only.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(3), the base offense level for a defendant convicted of a drug offense is determined based on the quantity of drugs involved. <em>United States v. Hernandez-Coronado, </em>39 F.3d 573, 574 (5th Cir.1994). Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l), \u201c[t]his quantity includes both drugs with which the defendant was directly involved <em>and </em>drugs that can be attributed to the defendant in a conspiracy as part of his relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court did not clearly err in finding that Montalvo-Nunez was responsible for the drugs carried by the others because he was engaged with them in a jointly undertaken criminal activity. <em>Hernandez-Coronado, </em>39 F.3d at 574-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Montalvo-Nunez contends that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) &amp; (b) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He acknowledges that this issue is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000). He raises the issue to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b811-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
