On October 26, 1992, Apoldo pleaded guilty under California Penal Code \u00a7 288(c) to committing lewd and lascivious acts upon a child. In 2001, he was charged under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) as being deportable by reason of his conviction of an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d Apoldo admitted the charges, and the immigration judge (IJ) denied his request for relief under former INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (repealed in 1996). Apoldo now petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (BIA) order summarily affirming the IJ\u2019s order of removal. We dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">We have no jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s order of removal if Apoldo was, in fact, removable for his conviction of an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) (\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed [an \u2018aggravated felony\u2019].\u201d). We do have jurisdiction, however, to determine our own jurisdiction or lack thereof. <em>Cedano-Viera v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1062, 1065 (9th Cir.2003). Thus, we have jurisdiction to determine whether Apoldo\u2019s conviction under California Penal Code \u00a7 288(c) is a conviction for an aggravated felony. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, we must decide whether a violation of \u00a7 288(c) qualifies as \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) (defining \u201caggravated felony\u201d to include \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">The phrase \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d is not ambiguous and must be given its \u201cordinary, contemporary, and common reading.\u201d <em>Cedano-Viera, </em>324 F.3d at 1066 (citation omitted). California Penal Code \u00a7 288(c) criminalizes a lewd or lascivious act on a child between the ages of 14 and 15, where the perpetrator is at least 10 years older than the child. Interpreting a related statute, California Penal Code \u00a7 288(a), we held in <em>United States v. Baron-Medina, </em>187 F.3d 1144, 1147 (9th Cir.1999), that a conviction for committing a lewd or lascivious act on a child under the age of 14 is \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d as defined in \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) and therefore an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Although the age of the child involved differs slightly, there is no principled distinction between \u00a7 288(a) and \u00a7 288(c) for the purposes of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A), particularly in light of the ten-year age difference requirement. Because a child who is between 14 and 15 is a \u201cminor\u201d under the \u201cordinary, contemporary, and common reading\u201d of that term, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>we conclude that a violation of \u00a7 288(c) qualifies as \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d and therefore is an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Because Apoldo\u2019s conviction under California Penal Code \u00a7 288(c) is an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d we dismiss his petition for lack of jurisdiction. The parties\u2019 assertion that we retain jurisdiction to consider Apoldo\u2019s constitutional claims has been foreclosed by our decision in <em>Cedano-Viera. See </em>324 F.3d at 1064, 1067-70 (\u201c[Cjonstitutional claims by aliens who are subject to removal as aggravated felons must be raised in the district court through habeas corpus proceedings.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b489-16\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
