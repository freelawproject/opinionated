He pled guilty on October 8, 2002. Subsequently, he was sentenced to 78 months imprisonment to be followed by four years of supervised release. Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), requesting permission to withdraw because after a conscientious review of the record he is unable to find any nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Clarke was given notice of his counsel\u2019s intent to withdraw and has not filed a <em>pro se </em>brief. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). For the reasons stated below, we will grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">Evaluation of an <em>Anders </em>brief requires a two-fold inquiry: (1) whether counsel has thoroughly examined the record for appealable issues and has explained why any such issues are frivolous; and (2) whether an independent review of the record presents any nonfrivolous issues. <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2001). Where the <em>Anders </em>brief appears adequate on its face, our review is limited to the portions of the record identified in the brief, along with any issues raised by an appellant in a <em>pro se </em>brief. <em>See id. </em>at 301. We conclude that the brief in this ease is adequate and, in the absence of a <em>pro se </em>brief by the appellant, it will guide our independent review of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">Pursuant to his obligation under the first prong of our analysis, counsel has identified a single issue that could arguably support an appeal: whether the District Court erred in not applying a downward adjustment to Clarke\u2019s 78-month sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) based on his minor role in the offense. Because counsel did not raise this issue at sentencing, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">Under \u00a7 3B1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant\u2019s offense level may be decreased by four levels where the defendant is \u201ca minimal participant,\u201d by two levels where the defendant is a \u201cminor participant,\u201d or by three levels where the defendant\u2019s participation is somewhere in-between. In determining whether a defendant was a minimal or minor participant in the offense, a district court must consider the defendant\u2019s relative culpability as compared with the other participants. <em>United States v. Isaza-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d 236, 242 (3d Cir.1998). According to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>comments of the Sentencing Guidelines, a minor participant is \u201cany participant who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 5 (2001). A minimal participant is one \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at cmt. n. 4 (noting the downward adjustment for a minimal participant is intended to be used infrequently). Furthermore, under our case law, we consider the following factors in determining whether the defendant was a minor participant: \u201c(1) the defendant\u2019s awareness of the nature and scope of the criminal enterprise; (2) the nature of the defendant\u2019s relationship to the other participants; and (3) the importance of the defendant\u2019s actions to the success of the venture.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>250 F.3d 811, 819 (3d Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Headley, </em>923 F.2d 1079, 1084 (3d Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Here, for essentially all the reasons counsel points out, we agree that Clarke was simply not a minor participant. The record clearly shows that Clarke actively recruited and engaged another in the conspiracy and that he was fully aware of the nature and scope of the criminal enterprise insofar as he knew what he was transporting, where the narcotics had come from, and to whom he was to deliver the package. Further, his role as a mule was essential to the ultimate success of the conspiracy. For all the above reasons, failure to apply a downward adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines was not plain error and would not support an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Our independent review of the record yields no other non-frivolous arguments that could possibly support an appeal and we are satisfied that all the requirements of <em>Anders </em>have been met. Accordingly, we will AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court and, in a separate order, GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
