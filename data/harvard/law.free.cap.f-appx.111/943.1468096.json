Elias argues that (1) his indictment was deficient because it failed to state a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>criminal offense, (2) the federal government\u2019s ability to enforce RCRA in states with authorized programs is unconstitutional, (3) the federal prosecution was unauthorized because there was no violation of state hazardous waste regulations and (4) the general false statements statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, is preempted by the Occupational Safety and Health Act\u2019s false statement provision, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(g). We do not consider these arguments, which either were already raised and disposed of or could have been raised in Elias\u2019s previous appeal. <em>See United States v. Elias, </em>269 F.3d 1003 (9th Cir.2001) (affirming Elias\u2019s conviction and remanding to the district court for the limited purpose of resentencing); <em>see also United States v. Nagra, </em>147 F.3d 875, 882 (9th Cir.1998) (\u2018When a party could have raised an issue in a prior appeal but did not, a court later hearing the same case need not consider the matter.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">2. Elias also argues that the district court\u2019s restitution order is not authorized because \u201cfull restitution has been made\u201d through workers\u2019 compensation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5El.l(b)(l). We do not consider this argument, which Elias did not make to the district court. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b975-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>tion and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
