R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b932-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">California state prisoner Ernesto Chaidez appeals <em>pro se </em>the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for writ of habeas corpus. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">Chaidez contends that the state trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel by denying retained counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and by denying his motion to substitute counsel on the eve of trial on account of an alleged attorney conflict of interest. This contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">Nothing in the record suggests that any tension in the attorney-client relationship between Chaidez and trial counsel \u201cresulted in a total lack of communication or other significant impediment.\u201d <em>See Schell v. Witek, </em>218 F.3d 1017, 1026 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc). Moreover, Chaidez has failed to demonstrate that trial counsel labored under an actual conflict of interest. <em>See Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 350, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980) (holding that \u201ca defendant must establish that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance\u201d in order to show a violation of his Sixth Amendment rights); <em>see also Belmontes v. Woodford, </em>350 F.3d 861, 885 (9th Cir.2003) (noting that \u201cthe simple possibility of conflict is insufficient to impugn a criminal conviction\u201d and concluding that counsel\u2019s \u201calleged failings are too speculative to sustain a conflict of interest claim\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">Appellant\u2019s \u201cRequest and Motion to Expand Issues on Appeal; Request to Issue COA on Claim Two,\u201d filed on September 4, 2003, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b932-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
