The Board ruled that Arsad failed to present sufficient corroborative evidence in support of his claim. Arsad contends that his testimony was credible and corroborated and was therefore sufficient. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Arsad fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-21\">Nor can Arsad show that he was entitled to withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) (2000). \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-22\">We reject Arsad\u2019s arguments that he was denied due process at the hearing before the immigration judge. \u201cIn order to prevail on a due process challenge to a deportation or asylum hearing, an alien must demonstrate that he was prejudiced by any such violation.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 320 (4th Cir.2002). The asylum applicant must show \u201cthat better procedures are likely to have made a difference in the outcome of his hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324. Arsad fails to show such prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-23\">We deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-24\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
