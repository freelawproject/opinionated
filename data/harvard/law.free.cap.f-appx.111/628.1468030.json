Clarke appeals his conviction for conspiring to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute more than fifty grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A) and 846. Defendant asserts that he was denied his right to a fair trial when the prosecutor, during rebuttal summation, made improper and prejudicial remarks. Specifically, defendant complains that the prosecutor openly admonished defense counsel \u2014 \u201cshame on you for inferring that [the government] did something underhanded in this case\u201d \u2014 and then compounded the error by asking the jury to send a message, through their verdict, that \u201cthe people of the United States ... have the right to try and eradicate and discourage drugs in the streets.\u201d [SPA at 207 &amp; 219] For the first time on appeal, defendant also claims that the \u201cdual testimony\u201d given by law enforcement officers in their capacity as both factual and expert witnesses compromised his right to a fair trial. [Blue at 35] Finally, in a supplemental brief, defendant challenges the constitutionality of the District Court\u2019s enhancement of his sentence based upon the District Court\u2019s finding that defendant used a firearm in connection with the charged offense. In accordance with <em>United States v. Mincey, </em>380 F.3d 102, 105-06 (2d Cir.2004), defendant\u2019s challenge to the District Court\u2019s enhancement of his sentence is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-14\">In adjudging whether the prosecutorial misconduct was so great as to amount to a denial of due process, this Court considers \u201cthe severity of the misconduct, the measures adopted to cure it, and the certainty of conviction in the absence of the misconduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Melendez, </em>57 F.3d 238, 241 (2d Cir.1995). While the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in the instant case were plainly improper, (1) defense counsel failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks contemporaneously, [SPA at 235](2) an appropriate curative instruction was given to the jury, at defense counsel\u2019s request, to disre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>gard the offending remarks, [SPA at 243] and, (3) as the District Court observed in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, \u201cthe overwhelming evidence [against defendant and his co-defendants] indicate[d] a certainty of conviction notwithstanding [the prosecutor\u2019s] comments.\u201d [GA at 196] On balance, therefore, we are not persuaded that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Darden v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Nor do we believe that the \u201cdual testimony\u201d was so plainly erroneous or prejudicial as to require reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>See United States v. Cruz, </em>363 F.3d 187, 194 (2d Cir.2004) (noting that though \u201c[district courts must be especially vigilant in evaluating the admissibility of expert testimony where ... a law enforcement official is called on to testify as a fact witness but also functions as an expert for the government, ... this type of \u2018dual testimony is not objectionable in principle.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Feliciano, </em>223 F.3d 102, 121 (2d Cir.2000)). To be sure, it would have been preferable had one of the investigating agents not testified that, on the basis of his experience, he had concluded that defendant and two of his co-defendants were \u201cspokes\u201d in a massive drug conspiracy. [GA at 69] <em>See United States v. Boissoneault, </em>926 F.2d 230, 233 (2d Cir.1991) (reversing conviction due to insufficiency of the evidence where government agent, over defense counsel\u2019s objections, made \u201cconclusory statements\u201d as to the significance of the evidence that jury could have drawn for itself). Defense counsel, however, did not object to the testimony at the time, and, in light of the weight of the evidence, defendant cannot now demonstrate that his substantial rights were affected. <em>See United States v. Desena, </em>260 F.3d 150, 159 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201cTo meet the plain error standard, [defendant] is required to demonstrate that the alleged errors affected his substantial rights resulting in manifest injustice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\"><em>* </em>* * \u2756 sf\u00ed #</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">We have considered all of defendant\u2019s arguments and have found each of them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED. The mandate in this case will be held pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 11, 159 L.Ed.2d 838 (2004) (mem.), and <em>United States v. Fanfan, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 12, 159 L.Ed.2d 838 (2004) (mem.). Should any party believe there is a special need for the District Court to exercise jurisdiction prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, it may file a motion seeking issuance of the mandate in whole or in part. Although any petition for rehearing should be filed in the normal course pursuant to Rule 40 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the court will not reconsider those portions of its opinion that address the defendant\u2019s sentence until after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan. </em>In that regard, the parties will have until 14 days following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to file supplemental petitions for rehearing in light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
