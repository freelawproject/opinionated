The argue that the district court erred in denying their motions to suppress. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-25\">Pursuant to <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 19, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), the arresting officers possessed the requisite \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d to stop the vehicle that Gonzalez was driving. The officers\u2019 actions thereafter, including the questioning of Gonzalez, were reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the stop in the first place. The district court did not clearly err when it found that (1) Gonzalez had consented to the officer\u2019s request to search the vehicle; (2) as Gonzales was driving the vehicle with Segura\u2019s permission, Gonzalez had authority to consent, <em>see United States v. Randall, </em>887 F.2d 1262, 1265 (5th Cir.1989), <em>United States v. Crain, </em>33 F.3d 480, 484 (5th Cir.1994); and (3) Gonzalez\u2019s consent to the search was voluntarily given. <em>See United States v. Zueco, </em>71 F.3d 188, 191 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b801-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
