Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Counsel were concerned about the inconsistent story he had previously told his parents and the police, which could have been the subject of cross-examination had he testified. Moreover, at least one of petitioner\u2019s counsel was worried about potential cross-examination on petitioner\u2019s prior convictions. That counsel also believed that the state did not prove its case and that petitioner\u2019s own testimony would fill the gaps, providing a motive for the killings and conclusively placing him at the murder scene. Petitioner\u2019s other counsel thought it was a close call whether petitioner should testify, but ultimately agreed with his co-counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">In view of these tactical considerations, petitioner has not shown that the state courts \u201capplied <em>Strickland </em>to the facts of his case in an objectively unreasonable manner.\u201d <em>Woodford v. Visciotti, </em>537 U.S. 19, 25, 123 S.Ct. 357, 154 L.Ed.2d 279 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b501-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
