See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b981-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">Germain Golo, a native and citizen of the Ivory Coast, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order affirming an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of his application for suspension of deportation. Because the transitional rules apply, <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), partial jurisdiction is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review de novo questions of law and due process claims in deportation proceedings. Rod<em>riguez-Lariz v. INS, </em>282 F.3d 1218, 1222 (9th Cir.2002). We dismiss in part, and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">Petitioner\u2019s contention that the IJ applied the incorrect standard for \u201cextreme hardship\u201d fails because he does not raise a colorable due process challenge on these facts, <em>see Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1270-71 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cTo be colorable ... the claim must have some possible validity\u201d). To the extent Petitioner seeks to directly challenge the IJ\u2019s hardship finding, we lack jurisdiction over his claim because the IJ\u2019s determination involves an exercise of discretion not subject to judicial review. <em>See Kalaw, </em>133 F.3d at 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-13\">Petitioner\u2019s contention that the IJ violated his due process rights by failing to properly advise him of his rights at his hearing was not raised before the BIA. Because \u201cwe may not entertain due process claims based on correctable procedural errors unless the alien raised them below,\u201d we lack jurisdiction to consider this legal claim. <em>See Agyeman v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 871, 877 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-14\">Petitioner\u2019s contention that the IJ violated his due process rights by failing to question him with regard to his eligibility for asylum relief also lacks merit, because he freely testified before the IJ that the political situation in his country was \u201cokay,\u201d and that he was \u201cno longer afraid of back home.\u201d <em>See Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d </em>1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that Petitioner must demonstrate that the alleged violation affected the outcome of the proceedings to prevail on a due process challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-15\">Petitioner\u2019s contention that the BIA violated his due process rights by failing to discuss the IJ\u2019s opinion is without merit. <em>See Alaelua v. INS, </em>45 F.3d 1379, 1382 (9th Cir.1995) (approving the BIA\u2019s practice of adopting IJ\u2019s decision without issuing a separate opinion where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>IJ\u2019s reasoning is sufficient to support BIA\u2019s conclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">Finally, the BIA did not violate Petitioner\u2019s due process rights by declining to consider the evidence he sought to append to the record, because the new evidence was not properly submitted to the BIA as a motion to reopen. Absent the appropriate motion, the BIA is precluded from considering new evidence on appeal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (\u201c... the Board will not engage in factfinding in the course of deciding appeals. A party asserting that the Board cannot properly resolve an appeal without further factfinding must file a motion for remand\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">Pursuant to <em>Elian v. Ashcroft, </em>370 F.3d 897 (9th Cir.2004) (order), Petitioner\u2019s voluntary departure period will begin to run upon issuance of this Court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b981-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
