We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">Because a \u00a7 3582 motion is criminal in nature, Wooden had ten days from the entry of the district court\u2019s judgment to note a timely appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A); <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000). The district court can extend the appeal period under Rule 4(b)(4) upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. <em>See United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985). However, the district court may not extend the appeal period beyond the forty days provided in Rule 4(b). Fed. R.App. P. 26(b)(1); <em>see United States v. Raynor, </em>939 F.2d 191, 196 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">The district court entered its order on February 23, 2004. Accordingly, the ten-day appeal period expired on March 8, 2004, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(2) (excluding intermediate Saturdays and Sundays from 10-day period), and the thirty-day excusable neglect period expired on April 5, 2004. Because Wooden did not file his notice of appeal until April 9, 2004, at the earliest,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> we do not have jurisdiction to consider the merits of the appeal. We therefore deny Wooden\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel and dismiss the appeal as untimely. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"A5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b198-12\"> Wooden's notice of appeal is dated April 9, 2004, and was filed by the district court clerk on April 16, 2004. Thus, even according Wooden the benefit of the earlier date, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1), his notice of appeal was untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
