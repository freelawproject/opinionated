California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), on the ground that the appeal presents no issue of even arguable merit. Orlando has submitted a pro se brief which, in essence, simply requests greater leniency in the sentence imposed upon her.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, Orlando was in fact sentenced at the very bottom of the Guideline range for the crime for which she pled guilty. App. at 3, 6; <em>see also id. </em>at 20 (District Court granting the \u201cmost lenient sentence available to [Orlando] under the law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-21\">Moreover, in her plea agreement (which Orlando does not claim was unknowing or involuntary or otherwise invalid), Orlando explicitly stipulates that there is no basis in her case for downward departure or adjustment, other than those bases stated in the plea agreement itself (for which Orlando has already received full credit). <em>See </em>App. at 60-61. Accordingly, notwithstanding Orlando\u2019s references in her brief to relatives with health problems (as well as her own health problems), see Pro Se Brief at 2, 4-5, these could not possibly constitute grounds for a discretionary reduction of her sentence under the plain terms of her plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-22\">The <em>Anders </em>brief submitted to this Court demonstrates that Orlando\u2019s attorney has \u201cthoroughly examined the record in search of appealable issues,\u201d and has explained why any issues arguably supporting the appeal are frivolous. <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2001). Moreover, an independent review of \u201cthose portions of the record identified by [the] <em>Anders </em>brief\u2019 as well as \u201cthose issues raised in Appellant\u2019s pro se brief\u2019 reveal no nonfrivolous issues Orlando might profitably raise on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 301. Accordingly, we grant the <em>Anders </em>motion and dismiss the case without appointing new counsel. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 109.2. We also note that \u201cthe issues presented in the appeal lack legal merit\u201d and thus do not require the filing of a petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-23\">. Orlando concedes that the District Court correctly determined the facts of her case, and applied the correct law. <em>See </em>Pro Se Brief at 4-5.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
