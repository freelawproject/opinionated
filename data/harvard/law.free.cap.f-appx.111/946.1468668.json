We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-21\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding because the BIA identified material inconsistencies between Sharif\u2019s declaration, his supporting documentation and the hearing testimony that go to the heart of his asylum claim. <em>See de Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 393-94 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-22\">Sharif abandoned his claims for withholding of removal and relief under CAT by failing to raise them in his opening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>brief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">We reject Sharif s contention that translation problems and disruptions by the government\u2019s counsel violated his due process right to a fair hearing because Sharif has failed to show prejudice. <em>See Cuadras v. INS, </em>910 F.2d 567, 573, (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b978-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
