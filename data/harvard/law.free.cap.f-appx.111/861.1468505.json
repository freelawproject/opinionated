Having carefully reviewed the record, we affirm. <em>See Cooper v. Schriro, </em>189 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1999) (per curiam) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">A prisoner cannot bring a section 1983 prison-conditions lawsuit before exhausting available administrative remedies. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). After the magistrate directed Boyles to provide proof of exhaustion, Boyles submitted over 100 exhausted and unexhausted grievances, but the exhausted grievances did not cover the multitude of claims raised in his complaint. Further, while there was some evidence in the record below about problems with the grievance process, the evidence was not specific enough to show that prison officials had prevented Boyles from administratively exhausting the issues he raised in the instant lawsuit. <em>Cf. Sergent v. Norris, </em>330 F.3d 1084, 1085-86 (8th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (prison official\u2019s failure timely to respond to grievance could show prisoner exhausted \u201cavailable\u201d remedies; remedy that prison official prevents inmate from using is not available) (citing <em>Miller v. Norris, </em>247 F.3d 736, 740 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-18\">Thus, the district court was required to dismiss Boyles\u2019s complaint without prejudice. <em>See Johnson v. Jones, </em>340 F.3d 624, 627 (8th Cir.2003) (dismissal required when inmate has not administratively exhausted remedies before filing lawsuit); <em>Kozohorsky v. Harmon, </em>332 F.3d 1141, 1143 (8th Cir.2003) (when multiple prison-conditions claims have been joined, section 1997e(a)\u2019s plain language requires that available administrative remedies be exhausted as to all claims); <em>Chelette v. Harris, </em>229 F.3d 684, 688 (8th Cir.2000) (remanding with directions to dismiss complaint without prejudice where record showed failure to exhaust), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1156, 121 S.Ct. 1106, 148 L.Ed.2d 977 (2001). The dismissal should not, however, count as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), because Boyles alleged exhaustion in his initial complaint; and we revise the judgment accordingly. <em>Cf. Porter v. Fox, </em>99 F.3d 271, 274 (8th Cir.1996) (plaintiff who did not allege exhaustion of administrative remedies failed to state claim).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-14\">.

Jones, Jr., United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
