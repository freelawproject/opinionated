Garcia-Beltran asserts that the evidence did not establish that he possessed a weapon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>and inflicted puncture wounds to an inmate. Garcia explains that he engaged in a \u201cfrontal fist fight assault\u201d and could not have caused the inmate\u2019s stab wounds. Garcia argues that the weapon was found on the prison yard and could have been thrown there by any one of the many inmates who witnessed the fight. Garcia also asserts that any inmate in the yard could have caused the stab wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">We view \u201cthe evidence and the inferences that may be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the verdict,\u201d and we determine whether \u201ca rational jury could have found the essential elements of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Pruneda-Gonzalez, </em>953 F.2d 190, 193 (5th Cir.1992). We will not substitute our credibility determination for that of the jury. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>132 F.3d 1055, 1059 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Section 1791(a)(2), 18 U.S.C., proscribes a prison inmate from making, possessing, obtaining, or attempting to obtain a \u201cprohibited object.\u201d A \u201cprohibited object\u201d includes a weapon or an object that is designed or intended to be used as a weapon. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(d)(1)(B). Trial testimony established that Garcia-Beltran possessed a \u201cshank,\u201d which is a weapon and a prohibited object as that term is defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791. The evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that Garcia-Beltran was guilty of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(a)(2). <em>See Williams, </em>132 F.3d at 1059; <em>Estrada-Fernandez, </em>150 F.3d at 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">A violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(3) requires proof that the defendant assaulted the victim with a dangerous weapon and with the intent to do bodily harm; an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(3) violation does not require proof of any physical contact. <em>United States v. Estrado-Fernandez, </em>150 F.3d 491, 494-95 (5th Cir.1998). The trial testimony establishes that Garcia-Beltran committed the essential elements of an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(3) violation. <em>See Williams, </em>132 F.3d at 1059; <em>Estrada-Fernandez, </em>150 F.3d at 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Garcia asserts that the district court sentenced him in violation of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), by imposing a sentence based on facts that were neither admitted nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Garcia\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 466 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263). <em>See United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 n. 34 (5th Cir.2002). Accordingly, Garcia\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">We REMAND to the district court for correction of the judgment pursuant to Fed.R.CrimP. 36 to reflect that Garcia was convicted in Count Two of a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">AFFIRMED and REMANDED with instruction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
