We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-24\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of habeas corpus relief de novo. <em>Luna v. Cambra, </em>306 F.3d 954, 959 (9th Cir.), <em>amended by </em>311 F.3d 928 (9th Cir.2002). Because Willard filed his petition after April 24, 1996, it is governed by the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214. <em>See Luna, </em>306 F.3d at 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-25\">Willard claims that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate the existence of Alan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Peters and subpoena him for trial constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Willard must show that (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In the last reasoned state court decision, the California Fourth District Court of Appeal held that Willard had not shown that the absence of the alleged alibi testimony prejudiced his defense. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">Mr. Peters\u2019 testimony would have only called into question Ms. Holt\u2019s memory of the specific time that she heard petitioner at the scene of the burglary, not whether she heard him there at all. Even assuming Ms. Holt was mistaken as to the time she heard petitioner, the evidence, including the unoffered testimony of Mr. Peters, was not inconsistent with petitioner being present moments after the time recollected by Ms. Holt and before the return of the victims. Petitioner has failed to demonstrate any prejudice as a result of counsel\u2019s failure to interview and subpoena Mr. Peters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The AEDPA mandates a \u201chighly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings,\u201d <em>Lindh v. Murphy, </em>521 U.S. 320, 333 n. 7, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997). It is not enough for this Court to find that the state court decision was incorrect, <em>Woodford v. Visciotti, </em>537 U.S. 19, 24-25, 123 S.Ct. 357, 154 L.Ed.2d 279 (2002) (per curiam), or even that the state court committed clear error, <em>Clark v. Murphy, </em>331 F.3d 1062, 1068 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 968, 124 S.Ct. 446, 157 L.Ed.2d 313 (2003). Rather, the state court decision must be \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 75, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">We conclude that the state court\u2019s holding that Willard failed to establish prejudice under <em>Strickland </em>was not objectively unreasonable and its factual findings were not unreasonable. First, Peters\u2019s potential testimony was weak because it did not preclude Willard\u2019s participation in the burglary. Peters\u2019s declaration stated that he would testify to seeing Willard at Fiesta Billiards between 8:00 and 8:30. Peters noted that \u201cFiesta Billiards is a large place ... I can\u2019t say when Mr. Willard and Ms. Keefe arrived or when they left Fiesta Billiards. All I can say is I saw them in the dart board area for about 15 minutes, and they were definately [sic] there at 8:15 PM.\u201d Even assuming the jury would have fully believed Peters\u2019s testimony, it would have given Willard an alibi only until 8:15 p.m. The only evidence at trial regarding the traveling time between the bar and the cottages indicated a trip of twenty minutes, which could have put Willard at the scene of the crime at 8:35, or a mere five minutes after Holt\u2019s time frame. It also would fit his presence at the cottages within the time of the burglary, which occurred sometime between 7:30 and 9:00 p.m.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">Moreover, the likelihood of prejudice is substantially diminished by the strong evidence of Willard\u2019s guilt. <em>See Hart v. Gomez, </em>174 F.3d 1067, 1072 (9th Cir.1999) (citing <em>Eggleston v. United States, </em>798 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>F.2d 374, 376 (9th Cir.1986)). The prosecution\u2019s strongest evidence against Willard was his possession of the property stolen in the burglary. Under California law, possession of stolen property alone is insufficient to support a burglary conviction; however, the additional evidence of guilt need only be slight. <em>People v. Citrino, </em>46 Cal.2d 284, 294 P.2d 32, 35 (Cal.1956). Even without Holt\u2019s testimony, there is circumstantial evidence tending to show Willard\u2019s guilt, such as his implausible story of discovering the stolen property, his proximity to and familiarity with the victims\u2019 home, his use of the false \u201cHensley\u201d license to sell some of the stolen property, and his misrepresentation to the victim that he did not know anyone named Hensley. Because the burglary case against Willard was strongly supported by the record, it is less likely that the omission of Peters\u2019s testimony was prejudicial. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 696, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Finally, we acknowledge the possibility that Peters\u2019s testimony could have had some positive impact on the jury\u2019s determination of Willard\u2019s credibility. However, the state court\u2019s implicit determination that the deprivation of weak corroborative testimony is not sufficient prejudice under <em>Strickland </em>is not objectively unreasonable under Supreme Court precedent. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Moreover, the likelihood of prejudice is further diminished by the fact that Willard\u2019s defense was not supported solely by his own testimony. Keefe took the stand and corroborated Willard\u2019s alibi. Because Peters\u2019s testimony would have been redundant of Keefe\u2019s, this case is unlike <em>Brown v. Myers, </em>137 F.3d 1154, 1158 (9th Cir.1998), where \u201cwithout any corroborating witnesses, [petitioner\u2019s] bare testimony left him without any effective defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Because the state court\u2019s denial of post conviction relief was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law or based on an unreasonable determination of the facts, the habeas relief Willard requests is not permissible under \u00a7 2254(d). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"A4r\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-8\">. At oral argument, Willard took issue with the state court\u2019s statement that the burglary occurred between 7:30 and 9:00, arguing that the victim\u2019s testimony suggested that he returned home at 8:45 or 8:50, not 9:00. However, there is evidence in the record to support the state court's determination, as the victim\u2019s subsequent testimony suggested that he returned between 9:00 and 9:15. Thus, the state court\u2019s determination was not objectively unreasonable. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
