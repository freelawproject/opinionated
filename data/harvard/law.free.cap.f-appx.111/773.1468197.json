Wynn filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion that was dismissed in the district court as untimely. This court, in appeal No. 02-11274, granted Wynn a certificate of appealability on the issue of equitable tolling. While Wynn\u2019s appeal in No. 02-11274 was pending before this court, he filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 in the district court seeking to compel the Government and its agents to produce a document that pertains to the merits of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. The district court denied Wynn\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 motion, and he now appeals that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">After Wynn\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 motion was denied, we affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely. <em>United States v. Wynn, </em>100 Fed.Appx. 325 (5th Cir.2004). We also denied Wynn\u2019s request for rehearing in that case, and the deadline for filing a certiorari petition has now expired. Wynn\u2019s current appeal is thus moot. <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>193 F.3d 845, 847-48 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Rocky v. King, </em>900 F.2d 864, 867 (5th Cir.1990). Hence, we have no jurisdiction over this appeal. <em>Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., </em>494 U.S. 472, 477, 110 S.Ct. 1249, 108 L.Ed.2d 400 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">In lieu of filing an appellee\u2019s brief, the Government has filed a motion asking this court to dismiss this appeal or, alternatively, to summarily affirm the district court\u2019s judgment or grant an extension of time for filing an appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"Arl\">IT IS ORDERED that the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED, this appeal is DISMISSED, and all other outstanding motions are DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
