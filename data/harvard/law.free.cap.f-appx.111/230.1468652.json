The district court dismissed Butler\u2019s claims under \u00a7 1981 for failure to state a claim. She has not appealed that decision. The case went to trial and, after the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, the district court granted MBNA\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law on Butler\u2019s Title VII hostile work environment claim. The court held that Butler could not rely on a \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d theory to extend the three hundred day statute of limitations for hostile work environment claims, and that the single incident within the statute of limitations period was insufficient as a matter of law to establish a hostile work environment. As to the retaliatory discrimination claim, the jury returned a verdict against Butler, concluding that she had not suffered an \u201cadverse employment decision\u201d. Butler appeals the court\u2019s ruling and the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b263-16\">Butler is of Iranian descent and is a practicing Muslim. She has been employed by MBNA since 1993, and has worked in several different departments under various supervisors. The record is unclear as to precisely how and when the alleged discriminatory treatment began. It appears that the first incident occurred in 1995 or 1996, when Don Little, a supervisor, allegedly remarked to Butler that Iranians are \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201csmell bad\u201d. In March 1997, her then-supervisor, Mike Sullivan, allegedly commented to her that Iranians are \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cput dirty laundry on their heads\u201d. Butler testified that after she reported this comment to a superior, Sullivan \u201cbegan yelling and cursing at\u201d her in a vacant office and blocked the door when she tried to leave. In April 2000, Mary Thompson, Butler\u2019s project leader, allegedly told Butler that the two could not communicate due to cultural dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>ferences and that \u201cAmerican people don\u2019t forget that Iranians take hostages.\u201d In May 2000, Kim Murphy, an employee in MBNA\u2019s Human Resources Department, allegedly referred to Middle Easterners as \u201ccamel jockeys\u201d or \u201cCJ\u201d. Finally, Butler claims to have been subjected to harassment in October 2001, when the aforementioned Don Little posted a picture of Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar in his cubicle. The picture featured a quotation of Omar using the term \u201cjihad\u201d, which Butler says she found offensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Butler further claims to have been subjected to retaliatory discrimination as a result of her complaints to management about the above events. In March 2001, Butler, who had been a \u201cTier 3\u201d software engineer, was reassigned to the lower \u201cTier 2\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She alleges that this change was made because she \u201cbegan to complain on a regular basis to her supervisors and the HR department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">We review the district court\u2019s order granting judgment as a matter of law <em>de novo. Stevenson v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours &amp; Co., </em>327 F.3d 400, 404-05 (5th Cir.2003). Judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only if \u201cthere is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for\u201d the non-movant. Fed. R.CivP. 50(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">We review the jury\u2019s verdict for MBNA only to determine whether it is \u201csupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Snyder v. Trepagnier, </em>142 F.3d 791, 795 (5th Cir.1998). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is evidence \u201cof such weight and quality that reasonable and fair minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365, 374 (5th Cir.1969) (en banc), <em>overruled on other grounds by Gautreaux v. Scurlock Marine, Inc., </em>107 F.3d 331 (5th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">We look first to Butler\u2019s hostile work environment claim. We begin by determining whether the district court erred in rejecting Butler\u2019s \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d theory with respect to her hostile work environment claim. We must then decide whether the district court erred in granting MBNA\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law on the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">In order to rely on a continuing violation theory, a plaintiff must show that the harassment within the limitations period and the harassment outside the limitations period constituted \u201ca series of related acts\u201d and that \u201can organized scheme led to and included the present violation.\u201d <em>See Pegram v. Honeywell, Inc., </em>361 F.3d 272, 279 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Felton v. Polles, </em>315 F.3d 470, 485 (5th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Celestine v. Petroleos de Venezuella SA, </em>266 F.3d 343, 352 (5th Cir.2001)). This court has looked to at least three factors in determining whether acts are sufficiently related to constitute a continuing violation: (1) whether the alleged acts involve the same type of discrimination, tending to connect them in a continuing violation; (2) whether the acts are in the nature of recurring events, or are more in the nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>of isolated events; and (3) whether the act or acts have the degree of permanence that should alert an employee to assert his rights. <em>Huckabay v. Moore, </em>142 F.3d 233, 239 (5th Cir.1998). When we examine the facts here in the light of these legal considerations, we find that the district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">First, we will assume, notwithstanding a difference in character, that the alleged events are sufficiently similar in type to the event within the statutory period to permit a showing that they are part of a continuing violation. Butler filed her initial complaint with the EEOC on November 5, 2001. As such, the only events that the district court could consider in ruling on her hostile work environment claim were those that occurred within the three hundred days preceding November 5 \u2014 i.e., events that took place on or after January 10, 2001. <em>See National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 105-05, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002); <em>Huckabay, </em>142 F.3d at 238 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1)). Butler alleges only one act of harassment within that period \u2014 the posted picture of Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar in October 2001.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Butler contends that the picture offended her because it included a quotation in which Omar used the term \u201cjihad.\u201d Butler testified that she found the association of the term \u201cjihad\u201d with the war in Afghanistan offensive because, \u201cJihad has nothing to do with war. Jihad is a religious thing that people pray and sacrifice their lives and meditate.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">We believe that Butler\u2019s claims concerning the Mullah Omar picture are best described as allegations of religious discrimination. Butler admits that she is not of Afghani national origin and that she is not in any way affiliated with the Taliban. Further, her arguments relating to the use of the term \u201cjihad\u201d make it clear that the source of her displeasure was the misuse of an important tenet of the Muslim religion. By contrast, none of the events that occurred prior to the statute of limitations period were religious in nature. Instead, each of the prior incidents involved discrimination based specifically on Butler\u2019s Iranian national origin or, in one case, on her being of Middle Eastern descent.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Nevertheless, we will assume that Islam is the dominant religion of Iran and the Middle East in general, and that the religion is often closely associated with the region in American popular perception. Thus, we will assume that, on these particular facts, the alleged harassment based on nationality and the alleged harassment based on religion could be shown to be sufficiently similar to be connected in an \u201corganized scheme\u201d. As we note below, however, Butler fails to make such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">Second, Butler has not shown that the alleged acts occurred with sufficient frequency to support a continuing violation theory. She alleges five incidents of harassment over the course of approximately five years. Further, only one event outside the limitations period \u2014 the alleged comments by Don Little in 1995 or 1996 \u2014 involved harassment by the same person as the Mullah Omar incident in October 2001. More than five years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>passed between the two incidents. This court has held that a \u201cthree year break\u201d will defeat any attempt to establish a continuing violation. <em>Felton, </em>815 F.3d at 486. As such, we conclude that Butler\u2019s allegations are more in the nature of isolated work incidents than a continuing violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Third, as to the question of the permanence of the harassment, we find that the four alleged incidents outside the statute of limitations period were significantly more likely to put Butler on notice that the harassment was an ongoing thing and that her rights had been violated, than the one incident within the period. The four alleged incidents were all directed specifically toward Butler and all involved derogatory comments about her Iranian national origin or Middle Eastern descent. This court has previously said that \u201cwhere a pattern of harassment spreads out over years, and it is evident long before the plaintiff sues that she was a victim of actionable harassment, she cannot reach back and base her suit on conduct that occurred outside the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Celestine, </em>266 F.3d at 344 (quoting <em>Hardin v. S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc., </em>167 F.3d 340, 344 (7th Cir.1999)). The several directly offensive comments made outside the statute of limitations period would seem far more likely to alert an employee to the existence of a hostile work environment than the posting of an indirectly offensive quote within a co-worker\u2019s cubicle. As a result, we hold that Butler had sufficient notice of a basis for violation of her rights, long before the single incident within the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">As a matter of further analysis, we should observe that Butler fails to offer any coherent explanation linking the separate alleged incidents into an \u201corganized scheme\u201d. Her only argument that even remotely touches on this point is that all four of the individuals who allegedly harassed her had access to her \u201cworking file\u201d; therefore, they should have been aware of her prior complaints of discriminatory conduct. This suggests that Butler is alleging a systemic failure of MBNA managers to keep up to date on the contents of the working files of their subordinates. Butler\u2019s theory, however, is purely speculative; she offers no evidentiary support for her contention that there was any such failure or that the alleged harassment against her had a causal connection with such failure. As such, she fails to \u201cshow that there has been a pattern or policy of discrimination\u201d connecting the alleged acts into a \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d. <em>Celestine, </em>266 F.3d at 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">We now turn to the specific question of whether the district court erred in granting MBNA\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law. To sustain a hostile work environment claim under Title VTI, a plaintiff must show, <em>inter alia, </em>that the alleged harassment affected a \u201cterm, condition, or privilege of employment.\u201d <em>Celestine, </em>266 F.3d at 353. For harassment to affect a \u201cterm, condition, or privilege of employment,\u201d it must be \u201csufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Without a continuing violation, Butler\u2019s hostile work environment claim consists of only one alleged incident \u2014 -the Mullah Omar picture and quote posted by Don Little. We think it almost impossible that a single alleged incident of harassment could be considered \u201cpervasive.\u201d <em>Compare, e.g., Shepherd v. Comptroller of Public Accounts, </em>168 F.3d 871, 875 (5th Cir.1999) (finding that four sexual comments and several instances of touching over a two-year period were not sufficient to create a material issue of fact as to severe or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>pervasive harassment); <em>Celestine, </em>266 F.3d at 354 (finding that the plaintiff could not establish severe or pervasive harassment based on eight incidents of alleged racial harassment during a two-year period).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Likewise, we conclude that the conduct alleged here was not particularly \u201csevere.\u201d The essence of the alleged harassment was Butler\u2019s disapproval of a quotation that she felt took a tenet of her religion out of context. There is no evidence in the record that Little intended the posting to serve as a commentary on the Muslim religion; construed in the most favorable light for the plaintiff, it might be seen as an expression of Little\u2019s dislike of the Taliban, with which, however, Butler is not affiliated. Further, when Butler complained that the Mullah Omar picture offended her, MBNA\u2019s personnel department promptly investigated and had the picture removed. For these reasons, we find that Butler did not show that the alleged harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to sustain a hostile work environment claim under Title VII. Thus, the district court did not err in granting MBNA\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law on the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">We turn now to the significantly simpler matter of reviewing the jury verdict that rejected Butler\u2019s Title VII discrimination claim. The jury, pursuant to a specific interrogatory, found that Butler had not suffered an \u201cadverse employment decision\u201d. As noted before, we review the jury\u2019s verdict for MBNA only to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Snyder, </em>142 F.3d at 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">To assert a prima facie claim of retaliatory discrimination, Butler must show (1) that she engaged in protected activity under Title VII; (2) that she suffered an adverse employment decision; and (3) that there is a causal link between the protected activity and the employment decision. <em>See Burger v. Central Apartment Management, Inc., </em>168 F.3d 875, 878 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Anderson v. Douglas &amp; Lomason Co., Inc., </em>26 F.3d 1277, 1300 (5th Cir.1994). The parties do not dispute that Butler engaged in activities protected under Title VII. Thus, the only issue before us is the jury\u2019s finding that Butler\u2019s reassignment was not an \u201cadverse employment decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">This court has determined that an employment action that \u201cdoes not affect job duties, compensation or benefits\u201d is not an adverse employment action. <em>Banks v. East Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., </em>320 F.3d 570, 575 (5th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Hunt v. Rapides Healthcare Sys., LLC, </em>277 F.3d 757, 769 (5th Cir.2001)). It is undisputed that Butler presented no evidence at trial that her compensation, responsibilities, or benefits were reduced as a result of her complaints to management. Further, the jury heard testimony from Butler and other MBNA employees that, in fact, her compensation and responsibilities remained unchanged after her complaints and reassignment as a \u201cTier 2\u201d software engineer. As a result, it is clear that the jury\u2019s verdict was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">Having held (1) that the district court properly granted MBNA\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law and (2) that the jury\u2019s verdict for MBNA was supported by substantial evidence, we conclude that the judgment of the district court is in all respects</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b263-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
