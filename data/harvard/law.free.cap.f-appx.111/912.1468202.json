We grant the petition and remand with instructions to vacate the order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b). Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 855 (9th Cir.2003). Fang argues that his conviction for misdemeanor assault under Montana law does not constitute a conviction for a \u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d rendering him removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E). Whether a state law conviction constitutes a removable offense is a question of law we reviewe de novo. <em>Coronado-Durazo v. INS, </em>123 F.3d 1322, 1324 (9th Cir.1997). Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b945-16\">The IJ erroneously concluded that a conviction for misdemeanor assault under Mont.Code Ann. \u00a7 45-5-201 categorically qualified as a crime of domestic violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. Fang was ordered removed under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i), which provides that \u201c[any] alien who ... is convicted of a crime of domestic violence ... is deportable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A \u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d is a crime of violence committed against a protected person, such as a spouse. <em>Id. </em>A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is \u201can offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-17\">To determine whether a conviction constitutes a predicate offense for deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E), we apply the categorical and modified categorical approach laid out in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). <em>See also Tokatly v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 613, 620 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Rusz v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 1182, 1185 (9th Cir.2004). Under this analysis, we look first \u201cto the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 602. If the statute criminalizes conduct that would not constitute the predicate offense under federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>law, then the offense does not categorically qualify. <em>United States v. Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d 1201, 1203 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc). The IJ did not conduct this analysis; rather, the IJ examined different elements from different subsections and concluded, taking the mixed and matched provisions together, that the statute categorically qualified as a crime of domestic violence. Both the IJ\u2019s analytical method and conclusions were incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">The Montana misdemeanor assault statute allows a conviction for negligent conduct. <em>See </em>Mont.Code Ann. \u00a7 45-5-201(b). Negligent conduct cannot constitute a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>United States v. Trinidad-Aquino, </em>259 F.3d 1140, 1145 (9th Cir.2001). Because the Montana misdemeanor assault statute criminalizes conduct that would not constitute a crime of domestic violence under federal law, the offense does not categorically qualify as a predicate offense and it cannot be used by itself as the basis for removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">If an offense does not categorically qualify as a proper predicate offense under federal law, then we employ the modified categorical approach under <em>Taylor. </em>Under the modified categorical analysis, we examine the judicially noticeable facts to determine whether they \u201cclearly establish\u201d that the conviction qualifies as a proper predicate conviction. <em>Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d at 1203 (quoting <em>United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>247 F.3d 905, 908 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc)). Using the modified categorical approach, a court may look to a narrow, specified set of documents within the record of conviction, including \u201cthe indictment, the judgment of conviction, jury instructions, a signed guilty plea, or the transcript from the plea proceedings.\u201d <em>Tokatly, </em>371 F.3d at 620 (citing <em>Rivera-Sanchez, </em>247 F.3d at 908).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">In this case, the judicially noticeable document is the written plea. In the plea, the defendant pled guilty to Mont.Code Ann. \u00a7 45-5-201 \u201cwhen I caused reasonable apprehension of bodily injury in another .... \u201d Specifically, he admits that \u201cbecame very angry, threw a shirt at [her], and otherwise made threatening gestures directed at her.\u201d The nature of the threatening gestures is not explained in the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">The fact that Fang\u2019s wife may have experienced \u201creasonable apprehension of bodily injury\u201d does not \u201cclearly establish,\u201d as required by <em>Corona-Sanchez, </em>that Fang\u2019s offense involved the threatened use of physical force. As the BIA noted in <em>In re Sweetster, </em>22 I &amp; N Dec. 709, 716, 1999 WL 311950 (1999), \u201c \u2018the use of physical force\u2019 is an act committed by a criminal defendant, while the \u2018risk of physical injury\u2019 is a consequence of the defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 709. Likewise, the apprehension of bodily injury is a consequence, which may be,j but is not necessarily, caused by the use or threatened use of force. The Second Circuit, in <em>Chrzanoski v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 188 (2nd Cir.2003), held that the actual causation of physical injury is not a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d and noted \u201cthe logical fallacy inherent in reasoning that simply because all conduct involving a risk of the use of physical force also involves a risk of injury then the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>converse must also be true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">In sum, although one can make a plausible argument that threatening gestures can qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under some circumstances, the judiciably noticeable facts in this case do not satisfy the high standard of \u201cclearly establishing\u201d that the conduct qualifies as a federal \u201ccrime of domestic violence.\u201d Therefore, Fang is not removable on the basis of his conviction. Given this resolution, we need not reach another other issue urged by <em>Fang. </em>We accordingly remand to the Immigration Judge to vacate the order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">PETITION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b945-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b946-7\">. Even if the IJ had confined the analysis to Mont.Code Ann. \u00a7 45-5-201(d) (the apparent subsection under which the petitioner entered a plea), rather than inappropriately mixing subsections, the result would not differ. As we discuss, <em>infra, </em>it is possible to cause reasonable apprehension of bodily injury without committing acts that would qualify under federal law as a \"crime of domestic violence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b947-11\">. Further, finding Fang\u2019s conviction a \"crime of violence\u201d mandates a logically absurd reading of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. While Fang's conviction arguably conforms to the definition of violent crime outlined in \u00a7 16(a) \u2014 the misdemeanor subsection \u2014 it would fall short of the definition of felony violent crime in \u00a7 16(b). Under section 16(b), a \"crime of violence\u201d is \"a felony ... that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Oliveros-Orosco, </em>942 F.2d 644, 647 (9th Cir.1991). Fang\u2019s conduct \u2014 making threatening gestures and throwing a shirt\u2014 does not clearly establish a \"substantial risk that physical force\u201d may be used <em>(Id.), </em>nor the \u201clikely use of violent force as a means to an end.\" <em>Chery v. Ashcroft, </em>347 F.3d 404, 407-08 (2nd Cir.2003). Thus, Fang's conviction would not qualify as a violent crime under \u00a7 16(b). Classifying Fang's conviction as a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(a), when it would not meet the \u00a7 16(b) definition, would cause the absurd result of making the misdemeanor subsection include a broader range of crimes than the felony subsection.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
