He argues that the district court erred in considering his prior, uncounseled misdemeanor convictions in assessing his criminal history points. Specifically, Rios contends that he had a right to counsel in his January and May 2000 federal misdemean- or cases under <em>Alabama v. Shelton, </em>535 U.S. 654, 122 S.Ct. 1764, 152 L.Ed.2d 888 (2002). He acknowledges that this court, in <em>United States v. Perez-Macias, </em>335 F.3d 421, 427-28 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 495, 157 L.Ed.2d 394 (2003), held that an individual convicted of a federal misdemeanor who receives a probationary sentence, not coupled with a suspended sentence, does not have a right to counsel. Rios urges that <em>Perez-Macias </em>misread <em>Alabama v. Shelton </em>in determining that a defendant sentenced to \u201cfreestanding\u201d probation has no right to counsel. He contends that he had the right to counsel in his prior misdemeanor cases because he was potentially subject to imprisonment if his probation was revoked and because he actually received a term of imprisonment upon revocation of his probation in both cases. Rios argues that his case is distinguishable from <em>Perez-Macias </em>because Perez-Macias\u2019s probation was never actually revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Rios\u2019s argument is unpersuasive. Nothing in <em>Perez-Macias </em>\u201csuggests that the plea and the conviction based on that guilty plea should be retroactively vacated because the defendant violated the terms of his probation and the court found it necessary to revoke the probation.\u201d <em>United States v. Rios-Cruz, </em>376 F.3d 303, 305 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>(Aug. 2, 2004). Rios thus had no Sixth Amendment right to counsel in connection with his prior misdemeanor illegal reentry guilty-plea convictions for which he received a sentence of probation, irrespective of the fact that his probation was later revoked. <em>See id.; Perez-Macias, </em>335 F.3d at 428-29. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
