On appeal, Griffith claims that trial counsel rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ineffective assistance. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Ineffective assistance claims are not generally addressed on direct appeal unless it appears conclusively from the record that Appellant received ineffective assistance <em>of </em>counsel. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir. 1999). Such claims generally should be raised by motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>Id. </em>We conclude Griffith has not shown conclusively from the face of the record that counsel provided ineffective representation. Accordingly, we affirm Griffith\u2019s conviction without prejudice to his assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel claims in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
