Gutierrez contends that the evidence was insufficient to support either of her convictions. After re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>viewing the record and the arguments of counsel, we hold that a rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence established the essential elements of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Gutierrez and Hernandez also contend that the district court erred in denying their challenge to the jury panel, which was made pursuant to <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). Their conclusional assertion that the Government\u2019s proffered race-neutral reasons for striking minority jurors were pretextual is insufficient to overcome the deference given to the district court\u2019s decision to accept those explanations. <em>See United States v. De La Rosa, </em>911 F.2d 985, 991 (5th Cir.1990). The judgments of conviction are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
