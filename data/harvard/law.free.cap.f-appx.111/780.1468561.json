Young appeals his conditional guilty-plea conviction for conspiracy to distribute 500 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of powder cocaine. He avers that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence a result of a search of his residence. Young argues that the district court\u2019s finding, that exigent circumstances not manufactured by the Government existed supporting the warrantless entry into his home, is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>The district court\u2019s determination that exigent circumstances supported the warrantless entry is not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Blount, </em>123 F.3d 831, 837, 839 (5th Cir.1997) (en banc). The court\u2019s finding that officers did not manufacture the exigency also is supported by the evidence introduced at the suppression hearing. <em>See United States v. Rico, </em>51 F.3d 495, 502-03 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b812-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
