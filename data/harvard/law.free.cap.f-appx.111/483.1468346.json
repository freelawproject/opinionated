We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s Order of February 25, 2003 (\u201cOrder\u201d). We add only the following to the careful and well-reasoned decision of the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Muriekes\u2019 complaint alleged that Boeing had \u201cinterfered\u201d with her rights under the FMLA. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615(a)(1) (\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under this subchapter.\u201d). As the district court\u2019s Order demonstrates, however, Boeing complied with every requirement placed on an employer under these circumstances. Boeing not only sent Muriekes the 15-day notice required by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.305(b), it went beyond its FMLA obligation and also sent her a follow-up notice. Although Muriekes denies receiving this second notice, this was unknown to Boeing. Under these circumstances, there is nothing more that reasonably could be required of Boeing in terms of fulfilling its obligations under the FMLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">Muriekes contends that she should be entitled to the exception in \u00a7 825.305(b) from the 15-day rule because it was \u201cnot practicable under the particular circumstances\u201d for her to comply with it due to her doctor\u2019s oversight. The regulatory exception, however, is directed to known and objective circumstances (such as the employee being hospitalized for the 15-day period) which make compliance impracticable \u2014 not to circumstances where notice is timely received and (insofar as the record shows) noncompliance with the 15-day requirement is due to some oversight, such as clerical error.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">Finally, plaintiff also contends that her non-compliance with the 15-day requirement should be excused because she provided the FMLA certification \u201cas soon as reasonably possible under the particular facts and circumstances,\u201d as provided in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.311(b). We are not persuaded. Even assuming that \u00a7 825.311(b) was intended to apply to circumstances like this case, certainly, by the date of her termination, July 17, 2001, plaintiff knew that Boeing had not received her FMLA certification. In the best light, plaintiff waited until October 12 before providing any certification. Under even the most generous reading of \u201cas soon as reasonably possible,\u201d waiting nearly three months cannot be construed as meeting plaintiffs own FMLA obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">For the reasons set forth above, as well as in Judge Coughenour\u2019s Order, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"AL3\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b516-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Asu\">. The facts are fully set forth in the district court's Order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
