Mr. Criswell also seeks to proceed in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d). We deny his request for a COA, deny his request to proceed IFP and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b608-18\">Mr. Criswell pleaded guilty in March 1993 to one count of second-degree murder and was sentenced to forty-eight years\u2019 imprisonment. Though the petitioner did not directly appeal his judgment of conviction, he filed several motions from 1996 to 2002 for post-conviction relief in state court; all were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-20\">In October 2002, Mr. Criswell filed his \u00a7 2254 petition in federal district court and asserted four claims for relief. In Claim One, he alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights, because his counsel did not interview the chief medical examiner who performed the victim\u2019s autopsy. Mr. Criswell alleged in Claims Two and Three that his conviction and sentence violated his due process rights because he was not separately charged with a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and did not plead guilty to a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d in violation of his Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The petitioner asserted in Claim Four that his conviction violated his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel because his counsel was not aware of the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-21\">The magistrate judge concluded in May 2003 that Mr. Criswell had not exhausted Claim Four and recommended that all claims be dismissed. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation in part, dismissing Claims Two, Three and Four. The district court, however, rejected the recommendation in part and remanded to the magistrate judge to make factual findings about Claim One under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). After additional review, the magistrate judge recommended dismissal of Claim One, and the district court adopted the supplemental recommendation in March 2004. Mr. Criswell now seeks a COA so he may appeal the district court\u2019s ruling on the first three claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-23\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b608-24\">We may issue a COA and entertain Mr. Criswell\u2019s appeal only if he \u201chas made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>To make a substantial showing, Mr. Criswell \u201cmust show that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Colorado state courts have already adjudicated Mr. Criswell\u2019s habeas claims on the merits. We may therefore grant habeas relief only where a state court decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\u201d or was \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Furthermore, \u201ca determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct. The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2254(e)(1). We have also recently held that this \u201cdeferential treatment of state court decisions must be incorporated into our consideration of a habeas petitioner\u2019s request for COA.\u201d <em>Dockins v. Hines, </em>374 F.3d 935, 938 (10th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Applying this deferential standard, we have reviewed the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and supplemental recommendation, the two district court orders, the petitioner\u2019s brief and the entire record on appeal. For substantially the same reasons set out in the magistrate judge\u2019s thorough recommendation and supplemental recommendation, and the district court\u2019s orders addressing objections to the recommendations, we conclude that Mr. Criswell has not made a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Colorado courts reasonably applied Sixth Amendment law to Claim One when ruling that counsel\u2019s failure to interview the medical examiner did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Concerning Claims Two and Three, the petitioner admitted the elements of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d by pleading to second-degree murder, and no separate charge was required to support the sentence enhancement. <em>See </em>Colo.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 16-ll-309(2)(a)(II)(B) (relocated to \u00a7 18-1.3~406(2)(a)(II)(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">We therefore DENY Mr. Criswell\u2019s application for a COA. We also DENY his motion to proceed IFP and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
