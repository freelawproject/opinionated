For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">Roland underwent surgery for a herniated disk in April 2000. She later sought disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income, claiming she could no longer work, primarily because of residual back and left-leg pain. Following a hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) found that Roland \u2014 who was 45 years old on her alleged onset date, and had a high school education \u2014 was able to perform light work and thus was not disabled. The ALJ relied on the Medical-Vocational Guidelines (Grids). <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1569, 416.969, and Subpt. P, App. 2, Rule 202.14 (2004). After the Appeals Council denied Roland\u2019s request for review, she sought review in federal court, and the district court entered judgment in favor of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">Following careful review, we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. <em>See Harris v. Barnhart, </em>356 F.3d 926, 928 (8th Cir.2004) (standard of review). Specifically, the ALJ was entitled to rely on the Grids, because the record supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Roland\u2019s nonexertional impairments do not significantly diminish her residual functional capacity (RFC) to perform light work. <em>See Thompson v. Bowen, </em>850 F.2d 346, 349-50 (8th Cir.1988) (if ALJ determines that claimant\u2019s nonexertional limitations do not affect her RFC, then ALJ may rely on Grids to direct conclusion of disabled or not disabled without resorting to vocational expert\u2019s testimony). In addition, the ALJ partially discounted for legally sufficient reasons Roland\u2019s complaints of pain. See <em>Reynolds v. Chater, </em>82 F.3d 254, 258-59 (8th Cir.1996) (when complaints of pain are explicitly discredited for legally sufficient reasons, Grids may be used); <em>Lowe v. Apfel, </em>226 F.3d 969, 972 (8th Cir.2000) (if adequately explained and supported, credibility findings are for ALJ to make). Further, the award of disability benefits by the insurer of Roland\u2019s former employer, while relevant, was nonbinding on the ALJ, and the ALJ\u2019s failure to discuss the award is not a basis for reversal. <em>See Montgomery v. Chater, </em>69 F.3d 273, 275 (8th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b898-11\">. The Honorable J. Thomas Ray, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas, to whom the case was referred for final disposition by consent of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
