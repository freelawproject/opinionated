The bankruptcy court held that the contract was not executory, and Stonehill Financial, L.L.C., a creditor of The Credit Store, appealed to the district court. The district court reversed, holding that the contract was executory under \u00a7 365, and remanded for further proceedings. Thornton then appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-22\">In contrast to the district court\u2019s interlocutory jurisdiction for bankruptcy appeals, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a), this court\u2019s jurisdiction extends only to \u201cappeals from all final decisions, judgments, orders, and decrees\u201d of the district court. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 158(d). A district court\u2019s remand order is not final for purposes of \u00a7 158(d) if it \u201c \u2018anticipates further judicial activity that is likely to affect the merits of the controversy.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Woods Farmers Coop. Elevator Co., </em>983 F.2d 125, 127 (8th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>In re Vekco, Inc., </em>792 F.2d 744, 745 (8th Cir.1986)). The contract at issue here is subject to further proceedings in the bankruptcy court, a fact made clear by Thornton\u2019s assertion of alternative theories upon which it urged this court to affirm the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-23\">Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
