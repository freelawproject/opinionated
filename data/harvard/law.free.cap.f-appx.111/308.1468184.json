Powell, Texas prisoner # 650087, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous. He argues that the district court abused its discretion by: (1) amending an order related to the production of records in connection with the <em>Spears</em><footnotemark><em>**</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing; (2) not suspending the <em>Spears </em>hearing because the medical records were incomplete; (3) dismissing his complaint as frivolous; and (4) failing to rule on his motion for appointment of counsel prior to dismissing his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Powell has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion by amending the order concerning the production of records related to the <em>Spears </em>hearing or by failing to suspend the hearing. <em>See Richardson v. Henry, </em>902 F.2d 414, 417 (5th Cir.1990); <em>Wesson v. Oglesby, </em>910 F.2d 278, 281 (5th Cir.1990). Powell\u2019s factual allegations do not rise to the level of deliberate indifference to medical needs. At most, he has stated a claim for disagreement with medical treatment, which is not actionable in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit. <em>See Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 292 (5th Cir.1997). In light of the fact that Powell\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel was not filed until after his case was dismissed, his argument is without merit. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Powell\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20. The district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous each count as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Powell is cautioned that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
