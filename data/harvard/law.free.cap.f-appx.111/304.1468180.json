She was sentenced to a 57-month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Bonilla contends that the district court erred in refusing to depart downward on grounds of cultural assimilation. The record reflects that the downward departure was denied because the district court believed it was unwarranted. We lack jurisdiction to review this ruling. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Montelongo, </em>263 F.3d 429, 431 (5th Cir.2001). The appeal is dismissed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Bonilla argues that the district court failed to properly implement a downward departure granted on the basis of an overrepresented criminal history category. Her assertion that the district court intended to grant two separate departures is belied by the proceedings at Bonilla\u2019s sentencing hearing. The sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED IN PART; and the appeal is DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-30\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
