After exhausting his state remedies, Martinez applied for federal habeas relief. The district court denied Martinez\u2019s application for a writ of habeas corpus, but it granted Martinez a certificate of appealability for his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. After considering that claim on appeal, this court vacates the portion of the district court\u2019s judgment that rejects Martinez\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim and remands the case for development of the record on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Background for this Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">A jury convicted Martinez of murdering his ex-girlfriend, Veronica Fuentes; Veronica\u2019s two children, five-year-old Joshua and three-year-old Cassandra; and bystander John Gomez. During the sentencing portion of Martinez\u2019s trial, the State of Texas presented the testimony of several witnesses to establish Martinez\u2019s future dangerousness. Martinez\u2019s lawyers, however, called only one witness, Dr. Anand Mehendale. Dr. Mehendale, a neurologist from Kerrville State Hospital, testified that Martinez\u2019s EEG indicated an epileptic focus in the right temporal lobe of Martinez\u2019s brain and that epilepsy can cause amnesia during a seizure. Dr. Mehendale indicated that a person having a seizure cannot engage in planned activity. After hearing this evidence, the jury determined a probability existed that Martinez would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society and that insufficient mitigating circumstances existed to warrant a sentence of life imprisonment rather than death.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the state trial court entered a judgment sentencing Martinez to death by lethal injection.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">During his state habeas proceeding, Martinez argued that his trial attorneys were ineffective because they did not fully investigate his epilepsy as a mitigating factor. Martinez contended that evidence of his condition \u201cwould have rebutted the State\u2019s case of future dangerousness, provided the jury with a vehicle to spare his life, both in terms of future dangerousness and mitigation, and provided an explanation for [his] behavior and violent crime.\u201d Without conducting a hearing, the state habeas judge determined that the attorneys\u2019 performance did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness. After reviewing the record and the habeas judge\u2019s findings, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied Martinez\u2019s application for habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">Considering the same claim, the district court agreed that trial counsel\u2019s performance during the punishment phase of Martinez\u2019s trial did not fall below professional norms and denied Martinez\u2019s application for federal habeas relief. Although not explicitly stated in its order, the district court implicitly determined the state court\u2019s disposition of the claim was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. The district court did not conduct a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b257-14\">In a habeas corpus appeal, this court reviews the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo, applying the same standards to the state court\u2019s decision as did the district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This court may not grant relief on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>a claim that a state court has adjudicated on the merits \u201cunless the adjudication of the claim ... resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cA state court\u2019s decision is deemed \u2018contrary to\u2019 clearly established federal law if it relies on legal rules that directly conflict with prior holdings of the Supreme Court or if it reaches a different conclusion than the Supreme Court on materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cA state court\u2019s decision constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if it is objectively unreasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This court presumes the state court\u2019s findings of fact are correct, and the petitioner has the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Martinez\u2019s Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">On appeal, Martinez maintains that the decisions of the state habeas court and the district court were unreasonable applications of <em>Strickland v. </em>Washington<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> because the decisions assumed that the strategy of defense counsel was reasonable even though that strategy was based on unreasonably inadequate investigation. Martinez contends that his trial attorneys were ineffective during the punishment phase of his trial because they failed to investigate his disease, temporal lobe epilepsy. Martinez maintains that if his attorneys had investigated the nature of temporal lobe epilepsy, they would have learned about its impact on aggression and violence. According to Martinez, a reasonable probability exists that at least one juror would have considered the disease as a mitigating circumstance warranting a sentence of life imprisonment rather than death. Martinez contends that his lawyers simply gave up on the punishment phase of trial without considering the impact of his disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-14\">To establish ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland, </em>a criminal defendant must show that his attorney\u2019s assistance was deficient and that the deficiency prejudiced him.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cTo establish deficient performance, a petitioner must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s representation \u2018fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This court\u2019s primary concern in deciding whether defense counsel exercised reasonable professional judgment is not whether counsel should have presented a mitigation case, but rather whether the investigation supporting counsel\u2019s decision not to introduce mitigating evidence of the defendant\u2019s background was itself reasonable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cIn any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>ments.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> After applying these principles to Martinez\u2019s claim, this court concludes that the record is not sufficiently developed regarding the adequacy of the investigation into Martinez\u2019s epilepsy to resolve Martinez\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">To support his complaint that his attorneys did not fully investigate his condition, Martinez relies, in part, on an affidavit by Dr. Theodore Pearlman which Martinez first presented to the state habeas judge. One of Martinez\u2019s trial attorneys, Jeri Yenne, sought Dr. Pearlman\u2019s assistance in determining Martinez\u2019s competency to stand trial, the viability of an insanity defense, and Martinez\u2019s potential for future dangerousness. In his affidavit, Dr. Pearl-man attests that \u201cnever have I been presented with such tangible evidence supporting a diagnosis of Epilepsy related to criminal behavior.\u201d Dr. Pearlman explained that if he had testified during the punishment phase of Martinez\u2019s trial, he would have explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIp\">individuals with [temporal lobe epilepsy], even individuals who seem to behave seemingly deliberately, are pathologically driven by seizure activity occurring in the brain.... An attack of [temporal lobe epilepsy] does not necessarily cause total lack of consciousness. There might be a narrowing of full awareness during an attack, impairing the ability to think and act normally. While an episode of [temporal lobe epilepsy] is not exclusive of some degree of willful behavior, [temporal lobe epilepsy] diminishes capacity for full responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">This information could be important mitigation evidence because it suggests that Martinez may have acted with diminished capacity and could have provided the jury with an explanation for why he committed his crime. The record, however, does not confirm how much of this information Yenne learned in her investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Although Martinez\u2019s habeas attorney stated in the state habeas application that Dr. Pearlman reported to Yenne that Martinez suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy, Dr. Pearlman\u2019s report is not part of the record. Instead of indicating that Dr. Pearlman reported that Martinez suffers from temporal lobe epilepsy, Yenne\u2019s notes state that: Dr. Pearlman found that Martinez was competent to stand trial, but insane at the time of the murders; Dr. Pearlman explained that the outreach center had been correct in its initial finding that Martinez did not use drugs; Dr. Pearlman believed that Kerrville Hospital mis-diagnosed Martinez and gave him a medication which aggravated his seizures; and Dr. Pearlman opined that future dangerousness was highly unlikely. But Yenne\u2019s notes do not include Dr. Pearlman\u2019s diagnosis. Thus, it is impossible to confirm whether Dr. Pearlman advised Yenne that Martinez suffers from temporal lobe epilepsy or whether Dr. Pearlman\u2019s report should have triggered further investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">Martinez also relies on a habeas affidavit by Dr. Mehendale, the neurologist who testified during the punishment phase of trial. Martinez presented the affidavit to the state habeas judge. Although his trial testimony did not address this aspect of Martinez\u2019s epilepsy, Dr. Mehendale attested in his affidavit that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aud\">while [Martinez] may not have been experiencing a seizure while he was allegedly committing acts of murder, [temporal lobe epilepsy] definitely played a role in [Martinez\u2019s] aggression. Patients with [temporal lobe epilepsy] are odd, bizarre patients and there are significant intercital abnormalities of a psychiatric nature in these patients. If [Martinez] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>had been diagnosed and treated as epileptic while he was still a child, [Martinez] would have had stable brain functioning. This would have reduced his chances of progressive personality deterioration that can occasionally occur in patients with [temporal lobe epilepsy]. With proper diagnosis and management ..., [Martinez\u2019s] propensity for committing acts of murder would be somewhat diminished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">This information could be important mitigation evidence because it suggests that Martinez suffers from personality deterioration and may not have committed his crime if he had been treated as a child. It also suggests that Martinez might not commit future acts of violence if he received treatment. But as with Dr. Pearl-man\u2019s affidavit, the record does not confirm how much of this information Yenne learned in her investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Instead of indicating that Dr. Mehendale believed temporal lobe epilepsy caused Martinez to act aggressively, Yenne\u2019s interview notes reflect that Dr. Mehendale advised her that an EEG indicated Martinez suffered from a seizure disorder and that Martinez\u2019s drug test did not indicate drug use. Yenne\u2019s notes, however, do not indicate whether Dr. Mehendale told her that Martinez suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy or about its potential for causing aggressive behavior. Although it is clear that Yenne knew Martinez suffered from some type of seizure disorder, it is impossible to determine whether Dr. Mehendale told Yenne that Martinez suffers from temporal lobe epilepsy or about its effect on aggressive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Martinez further relies on his educational records. These records reflect that Martinez experienced learning difficulties in school that may have resulted from mental problems, that Martinez had average intelligence, and that he was often disruptive in class. This information could be important mitigation evidence because it supports Dr. Pearlman\u2019s assessment of an impaired ability to act normally and Dr. Mehendale\u2019s description of a progressive personality disorder. Yenne\u2019s notes, however, do not indicate whether she read the school records and considered how Martinez\u2019s behavioral problems might be related to what she learned from Dr. Pearlman and Dr. Mehendale, or whether she simply forwarded the records to Dr. Pearlman for evaluation. Because the record reflects only that Yenne obtained the records and forwarded them to Dr. Pearlman, it is impossible to determine whether Yenne investigated how the records might serve as mitigation evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Martinez also relies on the affidavits that his trial attorneys submitted to the state habeas judge. The state habeas judge instructed the attorneys to file affidavits that responded to Martinez\u2019s allegation that they \u201c[flailed to recognize Complex Partial Seizure Disorder and/or Temporal Lobe Epilepsy as a mitigating factor.\u201d Despite this specific instruction, Yenne explained little in her affidavit. In regard to mitigation, Yenne explained that she and co-counsel, Stan McGee, concluded that \u201cif we forwarded any information concerning other good acts performed by the defendant or character [sic] this would open the door to other witnesses as to his bad character and it was not worth the same.\u201d Yenne did not address whether she learned that Martinez suffers from temporal lobe epilepsy or whether she considered using Martinez\u2019s epilepsy as mitigation evidence during the punishment phase of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">McGee\u2019s affidavit is somewhat more detailed, but nevertheless unhelpful. McGee attested that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-10\">it appeared to me that we were pursuing a defense of mistaken identity, among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>others, that [Martinez\u2019s] statements to the court appointed experts may have been admissible as a result of the introduction of evidence concerning issues of learning problems, mental disabilities, and a claim of mitigation. As to a failure to develop a defense to the State\u2019s arguments for future dangerousness, I cannot say that we did not do that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHG\">Notably, McGee does not indicate what he and Yenne knew about Martinez\u2019s epilepsy or whether they considered the condition as mitigating evidence. As a result, it is impossible to ascertain whether the attorneys investigated Martinez\u2019s epilepsy condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Without having some indication of what Yenne and McGee knew about Martinez\u2019s condition, and what they did to investigate the condition, the district court lacked the evidence needed to determine whether the investigation supporting the decision not to use evidence of Martinez\u2019s condition during the punishment phase of trial was reasonable,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or whether the decision not to investigate further was reasonable.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To make those determinations, the district court needed evidence that is beyond the present record. Where the petitioner\u2019s allegations cannot be resolved without examining evidence beyond the record, the district court should conduct a hearing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> An evidentiary hearing is required where a state habeas petitioner did not receive a state court hearing and alleges facts which, if proved, would entitle him to relief, and the record reveals a genuine factual dispute as to the alleged facts.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">In his application for federal habeas relief, Martinez alleged that Dr. Pearlman\u2019s report \u201cbrimmed with mitigating information,\u201d but that \u201c[t]here is no evidence in the attorney\u2019s files that the mitigating evidence provided by [Dr.] Pearlman was recognized by either trial attorney.\u201d Martinez further asserted that although testimony was available from both Dr. Pearl-man and Dr. Mehendale that he suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy, and that both doctors agreed that temporal lobe epilepsy caused some of his aggression, his attorneys failed to recognize, develop and introduce the mitigating evidence these doctors offered. These allegations, if proved, would entitle Martinez to relief because it would have given the jury an explanation for Martinez\u2019s crime. In addition, the record reveals a genuine factual dispute as to the allegations \u2014 that is, did Martinez\u2019s attorneys know about his condition; if so, what did they do to investigate the nature of his condition and to develop it as mitigating evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">The district court should have conducted an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Martinez\u2019s attorneys undertook any strategic calculation or informed balancing about presenting temporal lobe epilepsy as mitigating evidence. Because the district court did not conduct a hearing, this court VACATES that portion of the district court\u2019s judgment that addresses Martinez\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on the failure of his attorneys to investigate temporal lobe epilepsy as mitigating evidence, and REMANDS the case to the district court with instructions to conduct an evidentiary hearing on that issue. Following the hearing, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>court should consider whether counsel\u2019s investigation of Martinez\u2019s temporal lobe epilepsy was unreasonably deficient and, if so, whether counsel\u2019s failure to investigate this condition and produce evidence relating to it amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b257-8\">. <em>See </em>Tex.Code Crim.
