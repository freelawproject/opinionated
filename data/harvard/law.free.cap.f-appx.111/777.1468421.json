Landry was convicted following a guilty plea of possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(1) and sentenced to 71-month concurrent terms of imprisonment. As the Government argues, Landry executed a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal his sentence, with limited exceptions, and thus is barred from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>challenging his sentence on appeal. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, we do not address Landry\u2019s waived sentencing guidelines argument. <em>See United States v. Portillo, </em>18 F.3d 290, 292-93 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\">Landry appeals the district court\u2019s denial for lack of jurisdiction of his motion to reconsider sentence. The district court may modify the imposed term of imprisonment under limited circumstances. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). Landry argues that his motion to reconsider sentence was not filed under the authority of Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 but, rather, was a \u201ccommon law\u201d motion to reconsider over which the district court had jurisdiction. The district court did not err in denying Landry\u2019s motion to reconsider sentence. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 141-42 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order denying Landry\u2019s motion to reconsider sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b809-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
