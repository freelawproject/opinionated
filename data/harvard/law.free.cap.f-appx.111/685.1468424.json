Herbin seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion filed in his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) action. The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000); <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 368-69 (4th Cir.2004) (holding that appeal from the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion in a habeas action requires a certificate of appealability). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Her-bin has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny Herbin\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, deny a certificate of appealability, and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">To the extent Herbin\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief could be construed as a motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2254 petition, we deny such authorization. <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 496, 157 L.Ed.2d 395 (2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
