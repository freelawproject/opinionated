Our review of the record shows that Lee did not timely notice his appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his suit. A timely notice of appeal is a prerequisite for the exercise of jurisdiction by this court. <em>Dison v. Whitley, </em>20 F.3d 185, 186 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, to the extent that Lee seeks to challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of his suit, his appeal is DISMISSED FOR WANT OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Lee did timely notice his appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to proceed IFP in that court. However, Lee has waived the issues whether the district court erred in denying his motion for authorization to proceed IFP in that court and whether he should be permitted to proceed IFP on appeal by failing to properly brief them. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Consequently, Lee\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS to the extent that he seeks to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to proceed IFP in that court. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. We caution Lee that the filing of frivolous appeals and motions will invite the imposition of a sanction. Lee\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART FOR WANT OF JURISDICTION AND DISMISSED IN PART AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
