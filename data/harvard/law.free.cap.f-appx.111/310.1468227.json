Williams had alleged that the prison doctor was deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs. In his appellate brief, Williams does not address the district court\u2019s conclusion that he failed to exhaust administrative remedies by filing prison grievances. He neither denies failing to pursue such remedies nor argues that he has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>valid defense to the exhaustion requirement. Failure to identify an error in the district court\u2019s analysis is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the judgment. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>818 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Because Williams has failed to contest the district court\u2019s conclusion that he failed to satisfy the exhaustion requirement, he has waived the only issue relevant to his appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993) (issues not briefed are deemed abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Williams\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED. 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Williams that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b342-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
