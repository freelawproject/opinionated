As an initial matter, Matute-Galdamez argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Matute-Galdamez concedes that this issue is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve it for further review. This court must follow the precedent in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Hopwood v. State of Tex., </em>84 F.3d 720, 722 (5th Cir.1996). Matute-Galdamez\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">Matute-Galdamez argues that the district court incorrectly increased his base offense level by 16 levels on the basis of his prior conviction for aggravated sexual battery, an offense the court deemed to be a crime of violence within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. Because Matute-Galdamez raises this argument for the first time on appeal, the sentence imposed by the district court, based on the enhancement, should be reviewed under the plain error standard. <em>See United States v. Gracia-Cantu, </em>302 F.3d 308, 310 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">Matute-Galdamez argues that Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 21-3518 (2000), aggravated sexual battery, is not a crime of violence. A crime of violence is defined as (I) \u201can offense ... that has an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; and (II) includes ... forcible sex offenses.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. l(B)(ii)(I) and (II)). The use of force \u201crequires that a defendant intentionally avail himself of that force.\u201d <em>United States v. Vargas-Duran, </em>356 F.3d 598, 599 (5th Cir.2004). The question presented by this case is whether a sexual touching when accompanied by an act of coercion or the knowledge that the victim did not have the capacity to consent to the sexual act is a crime of violence. In interpreting a similar Missouri sexual assault statute, this court held that such an act does not require the use of physical force against the victim as required under <em>Vargas-Duran. United States v. Sarmiento-Funes, </em>374 F.3d 336, 339-42 (5th Cir.2004). The reasoning of <em>Sarmiento-Funes </em>is binding in this case because the Kansas statute also allows for conviction for sexual intercourse \u201cto which the victim assents, though that assent is a legal nulli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>ty, such as when it is the product of deception or a judgment impaired by intoxication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">There is no foundation for the imposition of a 16-level enhancement because Matute-Galdamez\u2019s prior offense does not fall within the sentencing guidelines\u2019 definition of a crime of violence. The error is plain and must be corrected because the erroneous sentence affects Matute-Galdamez\u2019s substantial rights and impugns the fairness and integrity of judicial proceedings. <em>See Gracia-Cantu, </em>302 F.3d at 313. Accordingly, Matute-Galdamez\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the case is REMANDED to the district court for resentencing in conformity with <em>Sarmiento-Funes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED and REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
