We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">Bravo-Sosa contends that the district court erred in denying him a 2-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). Contrary to Bravo-Sosa\u2019s suggestion, the district court did not refuse to grant defendant the 2-point downward adjustment because he exercised his right to go to trial. Instead, the district court found that Bravo-Sosa had not completely admitted his participation in the illegal conduct for which the jury found him guilty, and that he continued to blame others for his conduct. These findings are not clearly erroneous; therefore, we affirm. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Martinez, </em>369 F.3d 1076, 1088-90 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AcA\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
