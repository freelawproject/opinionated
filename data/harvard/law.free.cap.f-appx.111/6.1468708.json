BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">Baehir is a native and citizen of Lebanon. On November 13, 1998, he arrived via airplane in the United States and immediately requested asylum. Through an interpreter, he provided a sworn statement to an INS officer saying that he came to the United States to live in a free country and to escape police brutality in Lebanon. Baehir also stated the following: he had been forced to continue to serve in the Lebanese Army after completing his required year of service. On one occasion, he was \u201carrested by the Lebanon military to obtain military secrets from the Christian Lebanon army.\u201d He came to the U.S. via Cyprus and London; he did not seek asylum there because the U.S. was his ultimate destination. He stated that \u201cAmerica will help everyone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-14\">In response to the INS officer\u2019s questioning, Baehir stated that at one time, he was ordered (presumably by the Lebanese Army) to put bombs in cars and would have been in trouble had he disobeyed the order. He said that he had problems in Lebanon because of his religion \u2014 \u201cChristian Morony\u201d \u2014 and that \u201cthey want me to be in the Christian army to fight against the Israelis.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also mentioned to the immigration officer that he had traveled to the U.S. in the company of two friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-15\">On November 27, the INS filed a Notice to Appear in immigration court, charging him with removability pursuant to section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, as an immigrant not in possession of a valid entry, travel, or identity and nationality document. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(A)(7)(A)(i)(I). Following a hearing, petitioner admitted he was subject to removal from the United States and filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-16\">Baehir testified before the Immigration Judge as follows: before he left Lebanon, he lived in Amsheet with his mother and his two brothers. He worked as a truck driver for a private company. In November 1995, at the time that Lebanon\u2019s president announced that his term would be extended and that elections would be can-celled, Baehir participated in a protest. Later that night, soldiers knocked on his door and pushed his mother aside. When he identified himself, soldiers punched him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>and hit him with a rifle butt. They then tied his hands and put him in the trunk of a car. He was taken to a building where he was held for sixteen days. During that time, Bachir claimed, he was hit for refusing to divulge the identities of other protestors, doused with cold water, fed only bread, and denied toilet facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Bachir also testified that during municipal elections in 1996, soldiers came to his home, took him away and detained him for five days. During the period he was detained, he was not beaten. In 1998, again during municipal elections, soldiers also detained him in order to prevent him from voting.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">On November 10, 1998, Bachir was asked by \u201cSyrians\u201d and \u201cmembers of Hezbollah\u201d to deliver boxes of what he assumed to be munitions to southern Lebanon. Lebanese army soldiers dressed in Syrian uniforms, aided by his employer, loaded boxes onto his truck; when Bachir protested, he was struck with a rifle butt and accused of being a traitor who deserved to be killed. Although afraid, he drove his truck to an Israeli army checkpoint, followed by an Army jeep. Bachir testified that he had been told that he would receive a cell phone call when he reached a place called Marjyoun to arrange for the delivery of the boxes. After successfully passing through the Israeli checkpoint, with the soldiers no longer able to see him, he dumped the boxes off a mountain road and fled to Beirut. He said he did so because delivering the boxes was against his principles; he wanted Lebanon to be free of Hezbollah and the Syrians.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">Next, Bachir called a cousin, who was an army commandant, and told him what had happened. He testified that his cousin directed him to meet him at the Beirut airport, where he gave him his passport and cash, along with instructions to go to Cyprus.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When Bachir reached Cyprus, his cousin told him via telephone that the army wished to kill Bachir.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">On November 11,1998, while Bachir was in Cyprus, a man named Abou George purchased an airline ticket for Bachir to travel from Cyprus to London.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Bachir\u2019s passport contained a visa for travel to Panama, also obtained on November 11. Bachir stated that he does not know how he obtained the visa; he stated that George had his passport for several hours on that day. George also purchased an airline ticket for Bachir to travel from Panama to Miami, Florida.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Bachir further testified that he intended to remain in London, but his request for amnesty was not understood and he was placed on a plane to Miami.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">At the time of the hearing before the IJ, Bachir\u2019s mother and brothers continued to reside in Amsheet without incident. Bachir had purchased a home in Amsheet four or five months before leaving Lebanon and had never attempted to relocate after any of his encounters with the authorities. He further stated that he served in the army from November 1996 to November 1997, and was not ordered to serve again after his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">Walid Phares, a professor of political science and Middle East Studies at Florida <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Atlantic University testified on Bachir\u2019s behalf as an expert witness. By way of background, Phares explained that since 1990, Syria has been present in Lebanon, and that Syrian intelligence is authorized to operate in Lebanon, to make arrests there, and to transfer detainees to Syria.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Significantly, Phares stated that he did not know Bachir before the instant case. He had no independent information corroborating the specifics of Bachir\u2019s contentions, and based his opinion solely on what Bachir told him. Phares testified that if Bachir\u2019s account was true, it would be consistent with conditions in Lebanon. He also opined that Bachir would be likely to be arrested upon returning to Lebanon and be accused of being a traitor or collaborator.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There have been reports of the torture of detainees by both Syrian and Lebanese intelligence services.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The IJ denied the petition, finding that Bachir was not a credible witness and had failed to meet his burden of demonstrating a well-founded fear of persecution. Bachir appealed from the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA. On October <em>31, 2002, </em>the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without a separate opinion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">We review the Board\u2019s findings of fact and credibility under a \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard. <em>Mediouni v. INS, </em>814 F.3d 24, 26 (1st Cir.2002) (citing <em>Yatskin v. INS, 255 </em>F.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir.2001)). \u201cBoard determinations of statutory eligibility for relief from deportation, whether via asylum or withholding of deportation, are conclusive if \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26-27 (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 480, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). Unless the applicant puts forth evidence \u201cso compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution,\u201d we will uphold a denial of asylum. <em>Elias-Zacarias, 502 </em>U.S. at 483-84. When the Board affirms without opinion, as it did here, we review the decision of the Immigration Judge. <em>Quevedo v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 39, 43 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">An asylum applicant bears the burden of proving either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b). To establish past persecution, an applicant must demonstrate that he or she has suffered persecution on account of one or more of several enumerated statutory grounds: race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group, or political opinion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). A determination of past persecution triggers a presumption that the applicant has a well-founded fear of future persecution and provisionally establishes his or her eligibility for asylum. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). The burden then shifts to the Attorney General to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence either 1) that \u201c[t]here has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution in the applicant\u2019s country of nationality,\u201d or 2) that \u201c[tjhe applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country of nationality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(A)-(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-14\">Accordingly, to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, the applicant can either claim the benefit of a regulatory presumption based on proof of past perse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>cution or prove \u201cboth a genuine subjective fear and an objectively reasonable fear of persecution\u201d on one or more of the statutory grounds. <em>Quevedo v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 39, 44 (1st Cir.2003); <em>see also Mediouni, </em>314 F.3d at 27. An objectively reasonable fear \u201crequires a showing \u2018by credible, direct, and specific evidence ... facts that would support a reasonable fear that the petitioner faces persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Civil v. INS, </em>140 F.3d 52, 55 (1st Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Ravindran v. INS, </em>976 F.2d 754, 758 (1st Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">The standard for withholding deportation is stricter than that for asylum, thus \u201ca petitioner unable to satisfy the asylum standard fails, <em>a fortiori, </em>to satisfy the former.\u201d <em>Mediouni, </em>314 F.3d at 27 (quoting <em>Velasquez v. Ashcroft, </em>305 F.3d 62, 64 n. 2 (1st Cir.2002)). Accordingly, we address Bachir\u2019s asylum claim first.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">A finding of credibility is paramount in asylum cases. <em>Gailius v. INS, </em>147 F.3d 34, 45 (1st Cir.1998). In determining credibility, applicable regulations direct that we weigh the applicant\u2019s account of specific-incidents \u201cin light of general conditions in the applicant\u2019s country of nationality or last habitual residence\u201d to determine if the applicant\u2019s testimony is plausible. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a) (1997); <em>see Cordero-Trejo v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 482, 491 (1994). If the IJ chooses to reject a petitioner\u2019s testimony as lacking credibility, he must \u201coffer a specific, cogent reason for [the IJ\u2019s] disbelief\u2019 with support in the record. <em>El Moraghy v. Ashcroft, </em>331 F.3d 195, 205 (1st Cir.2003) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Here, the IJ questioned Bachir\u2019s credibility on the grounds of inconsistencies and unexplained elements in the record evidence: the discrepancies in his statements to the immigration inspector versus his hearing testimony; the conflicting accounts of the relevant dates; how the Panamanian visa came into Bachir\u2019s possession; whether Bachir\u2019s true destination was the U.S. or Panama; and the presence and significance of Bachir\u2019s traveling companions. Given our deferential standard of review of credibility determinations, <em>Mendes v. INS, </em>197 F.3d 6,13 (1st Cir.1999), we perceive no legitimate basis for reversing the IJ\u2019s ruling that Bachir\u2019s testimony lacked the \u201cring of truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">In light of the IJ\u2019s credibility finding, we affirm his conclusion that the incident in which Bachir was asked to deliver boxes just before he left Lebanon does not establish persecution. The IJ found that the authorities\u2019 interest in Bachir \u201cwas that he was able to travel to a particular area and they saw his usage in delivering the material they wanted delivered,\u201d rather than to single him out based on political animus. The record provides sufficient support for that finding such that we will not disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">The IJ did not specifically take issue with the credibility of Bachir\u2019s account of his episodes of detention from 1995 to 1998.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Given that at least one episode followed immediately on the heels of Bachir\u2019s participation in a political protest and included physical abuse, such evidence conceivably could, under some circumstances, support a finding of past persecution. <em>See, e.g., Gailius v. INS, </em>147 F.3d at 43 (petitioner, a native of Lithuania, was active in the protests against Soviet rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Nonetheless, under the specific facts of this case, the detentions do not form the basis for an asylum case. As the IJ points out, Bachir did not mention the detentions in his application for asylum. Moreover, in his appellate brief, Bachir explicitly disavowed any reliance on those incidents as motivation for his decision to flee Lebanon. Even if we take the detentions into account, it is not clear that, together with the truck incident, they form a common pattern that was motivated by persecution on account of Bachir\u2019s political opinion. Because we do not conclude that Bachir\u2019s evidence was \u201cso compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution,\u201d we will uphold the denial of asylum. <em>Elias-Zacarias, 502 </em>U.S. at 488-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Bachir contends that the IJ erred in analyzing his claim as one of religious persecution rather than persecution based on political opinion. Although the IJ noted in passing that Bachir did not experience religious persecution while serving in the military or suffer more than the same risks than others of his religious beliefs residing in Lebanon, he additionally analyzed Bachir\u2019s asylum claim under the rubric of political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we <em>AFFIRM </em>the denial of Bachir\u2019s petition for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-11\">. On appeal, Baehir presses only his asylum claim. Consequently, we treat his withholding and CAT claims as waived. See, <em>e.g., Mulero-Rodriguez v. Ponte, Inc., </em>98 F.3d 670, 679 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b39-12\">. Later, at the hearing before the immigration judge, Baehir said that he had not understood the interpreter at the initial immigration interview. He denied making the statements that \u201cAmerica will help everyone\u201d; that he was wanted for service in a Christian army to fight Israel; and that he was forced to continue to serve in the Lebanese army after his service was completed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b40-6\">. Bachir had applied for and obtained a passport some time after his detentions and before November, 1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b40-7\">. He asked George to help him file a refugee application in Cyprus, but, after consulting with an attorney, George told him that Cyprus does not accept such applications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b40-13\">. Contrary to Bachir\u2019s testimony, the tickets were dated November 9, 1998, the day <em>before </em>Bachir claims the incident involving the boxes took place. At the hearing, Bachir could not explain this discrepancy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b41-9\">. Phares testified that the Syrian intelligence service would be aware that Bachir had applied for asylum in the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b42-10\">. Rather, it appears that the IJ concluded that the detentions did not constitute past persecution, citing the authorities\u2019 lack of interest in Bachir\u2019s day-to-day business or family activities, Bachir\u2019s successful military service following the first detention, and his ability to obtain a passport and travel freely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
