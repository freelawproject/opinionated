Melton v. Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity Ass\u2019n of America, </em>114 F.3d 557, 559 (5th Cir.1997). Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with any affidavits filed in support of the motion, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In reviewing the record, we do so in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and the non-moving party is entitled to all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-18\">Mosley alleges hostile work environment and race discrimination claiming he was subjected to verbal harassment, physical threats, and attempted conspiracy to plant illegal drugs in his possession. In order to prove a prima facie hostile work environment claim, Mosley must establish five essential elements: (1) the employee belongs to the protected group; (2) the employee was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment complained of was based on race; (4) the harassment complained of affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment; (5) the employer knew or should have known of the harassment in question and failed to take prompt remedial action. <em>See Watts v. Kroger Co., </em>170 F.3d 505, 509 (5th Cir.1999). In order for harassment to affect a term, condition or privilege of employment, it must be \u201csufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-19\">Mosley identified eight incidents that he contends \u2014 considered together\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>created a hostile work environment. After reviewing the record and briefs submitted by the parties, we agree with the district court\u2019s analysis and finding that there is no admissible evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact in support of the plaintiffs claims. Mosley\u2019s claims are either supported by no admissible evidence, no evidence to refute that offered by the defendant, or no evidence offered to demonstrate that defendants\u2019 actions were racially motivated. Mosley has, however, offered evidence of three incidents involving the use of racial slurs. We agree, however, with the district court\u2019s conclusion that these claims alone are insufficient to establishing a general issue of material fact for Mosley\u2019s hostile work environment claim under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Mosley also alleges that his pay was docked as retaliation for having filed a complaint with the EEOC, charging that he was not paid for accumulated, unused compensatory leave for the pay period ending February 15, 2001. When Mosley returned to work his pay resumed at its normal rate for the last seven months of his employment. \u201cIn order to prove a prima facie case in a retaliation claim the employee must show: (1) that the employee engaged in activity protected by Title VII; (2) the employer took adverse employment action against the employee; and (3) a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Haynes v. Pennzoil Company, </em>207 F.3d 296, 299 (5th Cir.2000). In order to prevail on his retaliation claim, Mosley thus had to demonstrate that Appellees had no justification for reducing his pay for the period ending February 15, 2001. As the district court noted, there is no evidence in the record to contradict Catherine Williamson\u2019s affidavit stating that Mosley\u2019s accumulated compensation time was exhausted, thus establishing a non-discriminatory and non-retaliatory reason for the decrease in Mosley\u2019s pay for the pay period ending February 15, 2001. The EEOC determination alone is not sufficient to contradict Appellee\u2019s non-discriminatory reason for Mosley\u2019s decrease in pay. Price <em>v. Federal Express Corp., </em>283 F.3d 715, 725 (5th Cir.2002). Thus, we affirm the District Court\u2019s determination that there is no genuine issue of material fact in support of plaintiffs retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b759-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
