Malhotra argues that the Immigration Judge (IJ) and the BIA erred in determining that there were discrepancies in the record and erred in denying his application due to a lack of corroborative evidence. Malhotra argues that he has established a clear probability of persecution or torture upon his return to India based on his political activities of writing newspaper articles critical of the Indian government. The IJ found that Malhotra was not a credible witness based on inconsistencies between his written statement, his testimony, and his brother\u2019s testimony. The IJ found that due to the inconsistencies, corroborative evidence was necessary and that Malhotra had failed to provide any corroborative evidence to support his claims. The IJ denied his request for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. We will not substitute our judgment of Malhotra\u2019s credibility for that of the IJ and BIA. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 905 (5th Cir.2002). Malhotra has not shown that the evidence in the record compels a conclusion contrary to the decision of the IJ and BIA that Malhotra\u2019s testimony was not credible particularly in light of his failure to present readily available corroborative evidence to establish his eligibility for withholding of removal or relief under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See Lopez De Jesus v. INS, </em>312 F.3d 155, 161 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"A0U\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b790-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
