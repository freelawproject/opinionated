The district court ruled that an insurance policy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>Lees had with First Financial Insurance Company provided coverage, and later directed a verdict in the Lees\u2019 favor on the issue of liability. Before this Court ruled on appeal, the Lees settled with the plaintiff and then cross-claimed against First Financial for reimbursement of the settlement sum. The district court granted summary judgment to First Financial, and the Lees appeal. For essentially the reasons given by the district court, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b782-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
