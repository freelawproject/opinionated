For the reasons substantially stated by the district court, we conclude that there is no preemption. Moreover, since the US-DOT regulations cited by CSX do not apply to the particular truck type involved here, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to exclude the regulation from evidence. <em>See Sobering Corp. v. Pfizer, Inc., </em>189 F.3d 218, 224 (2d Cir.1999). As to damages, we will not upset a jury verdict unless \u201cthe verdict is irrational or so high as to shock the judicial conscience.\u201d Nai<em>rn v. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>837 F.2d 565, 566-67 (2d Cir.1988) <em>quoting Batchkowsky v. Penn Cent. Co., </em>525 F.2d 1121, 1124 (2d Cir.1975). Given the serious surgery plaintiff has undergone, and the expert testimony of more to come, the damages here do not rise to this level.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
