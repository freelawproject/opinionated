Coleman appeals his conviction following his guilty plea to making a false statement to a federal agency, in violation 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (2000). Coleman was sentenced to a two-year term of probation. Because Coleman pleaded guilty and waived his right to appeal his sentence, he is foreclosed from appealing any non-jurisdictional issue. <em>See United States v. Willis, </em>992 F.2d 489, 490 (4th Cir.1993). Coleman argues that the district court was without subject matter jurisdiction because his conduct fell within the \u201cjudicial function\u201d exception to making a false statement set forth in \u00a7 1001(b). Because Coleman was charged with, and convicted of, making a false statement to a federal agency, it is clear his conduct was not insulated from criminal liability by \u00a7 1001(b). Therefore, the district court properly possessed subject matter jurisdiction over Coleman\u2019s offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1001(a). Accordingly, we affirm Coleman\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
