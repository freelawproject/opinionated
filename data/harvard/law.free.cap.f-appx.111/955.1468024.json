We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). We review the IJ\u2019s determination for substantial evidence, <em>Ge v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir.2004), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-23\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that even if Petitioner\u2019s testimony were taken as true, she failed to estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>lish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of imputed political opinion. The record is devoid of any suggestion that the Ethiopian government imputed to the Petitioner her father\u2019s or brother\u2019s political views, or that their past political activity would lead to her persecution in the future. Thus, there is no \u201cevidentiary nexus\u201d between Petitioner\u2019s family members\u2019 past persecution, and her fear of future persecution. <em>See Belayaneh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 488, 491 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">To the extent Petitioner claims fear of persecution on account of her Oromo ethnicity, she fails to show a particularized risk of persecution. Instead, Petitioner merely cites general conditions of discrimination in Ethiopia, which is not enough to satisfy her burden of proving eligibility for asylum. <em>See Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 339 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">The IJ\u2019s conclusion that Petitioner failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution is further supported by the fact that Petitioner\u2019s mother and uncles remain in Ethiopia unharmed. <em>See Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cAn applicant\u2019s claim of persecution upon return is weakened ... when similarly-situated family members continue to live in the country without incident.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">Because Petitioner did not establish eligibility for asylum, it follows that she did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Belayaneh, </em>213 F.3d at 491. Furthermore, Petitioner is not eligible for relief under the CAT because she failed to show that \u201cit is more likely than not\u201d that she would be tortured if removed to Ethiopia. <em>See Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 1186, 1194 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b987-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
