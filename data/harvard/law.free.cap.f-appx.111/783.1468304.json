Austin argues that the district court clearly erred in finding that his sentence should be enhanced by three levels because police officers were deemed to be official victims of his possession of the firearm under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(b). In particular, he argues that the district court erroneously found that Austin knew it was the police and not a burglar when he fired the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>The district court did not clearly err when it applied the three-level enhancement. <em>See United States v. Polk, </em>118 F.3d 286, 297 (5th Cir.1997). Two officers testified that all of the officers present \u201cyelled\u201d to announce their presence as they were battering Austin\u2019s door down. Although Austin argued that he could not have been expected to hear the officers\u2019 announcement because a television was on in the back bedroom, the district court chose instead to credit the officers\u2019 testimony regarding the loudness of their announcement. To do so was not clear error. <em>See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., </em>470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Austin also argues that the district court committed plain error in enhancing his sentence based on findings not alleged in the indictment, proven to a jury, or proven beyond a reasonable doubt in violation of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). As Austin acknowledges, this issue is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004), in which this court held \u201cthat <em>Blakely </em>does not extend to the federal Guidelines.\u201d The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b815-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
