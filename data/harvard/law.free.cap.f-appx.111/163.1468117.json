We dismiss the appeal from the \u00a7 2255 motion for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed. We also deny a certificate of appeal-ability and dismiss the appeal from the denial of the motion for an extension of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-24\">When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-25\">The district court\u2019s order dismissing Pacheco\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was entered on the docket on February 3, 2004. By notice of appeal postmarked June 2, 2004, Pacheco filed a notice of appeal and motion for an extension of the appeal period.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The district court properly denied the motion for an extension of time. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), (6). Accordingly, the June 2, 2004, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>notice of appeal was untimely filed, and we lack jurisdiction to consider the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">With respect to No. 04-6977, we dismiss the appeal. With respect to No. 04-7268, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b195-19\"> For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the postmark for the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court. <em>See </em>Fed.
