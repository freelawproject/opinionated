We assume that the parties are familiar with the facts, the procedural context, and specification of the appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-19\">Su challenges the denial of his proposed jury instruction. \u201cA jury instruction is erroneous if it misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard or does not adequately inform the jury on the law.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Branen, </em>17 F.3d 552, 556 (2d Cir.1994). Here, however, the district court\u2019s instructions properly stated New York law as it pertains to negligence and recklessness. As to Su\u2019s evidentiary claims, the district court\u2019s decision to exclude various evidence based on plaintiffs discovery violations was completely within the court\u2019s discretion, <em>Manley v. Ambase Corp., </em>337 F.3d 237, 247 (2d Cir.2003) (district court\u2019s rulings on presentation of evidence are reviewed for abuse of discretion). Also proper were decisions to exclude medical testimony from the liability phase of a bifurcated trial and to exclude testimony by plaintiff himself as to principles of mathematics or physics. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, the district judge\u2019s ruling that she need not disqualify herself based on stock-holdings in the plaintiffs insurance carrier was correct for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a); <em>Pashaian v. Eccelston Properties, Ltd., </em>88 F.3d 77, 83-84 (2d Cir.1996). All of Su\u2019s remaining claims are similarly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-20\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
