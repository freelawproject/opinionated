We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-18\">Claimant first argues that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) failed to properly assess her credibility and did not sufficiently support his finding that the claimant\u2019s subjective complaints of pain were \u201cnot totally credible.\u201d One of the reasons the ALJ partially discounted the claimant\u2019s testimony was because \u201cthe claimant\u2019s description of her limitations impresses as inconsistent with the record when considered in its entirety.\u201d We have examined the record and find substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding of discrepancies between the claimant\u2019s testimony and the objective medical evidence. These discrepancies amply support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the claimant was not totally credible in respect to her subjective complaints of pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-20\">Claimant next argues that the ALJ did not properly consider the medical evidence and substituted his opinion for those of the physicians on record. We find claimant\u2019s argument without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-21\">Finally, claimant argues that the ALJ did not account for the non-exertional limitations caused by her herniated discs, carpal tunnel syndrome, and mental disorder. The ALJ, however, did take her non-exertional limitations into account in finding that she was limited to a \u201cnarrow range\u201d of light work. Moreover, these findings have substantial support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-22\">The judgment of the district court is <em>affirmed. See </em>1st Cir. R. 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
