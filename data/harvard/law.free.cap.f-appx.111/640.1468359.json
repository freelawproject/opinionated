That arbitration award dismissed various claims filed by Tobjy against Citibank and Citibank Investment Services (collectively, \u201cCitibank\u201d). We assume that the parties are familiar with the facts, the procedural context, and specification of the appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Arbitration awards are subject to \u201cseverely limited\u201d review by the courts. <em>Willemijn Houdstermaatschappij, BV v. Standard Microsystems Corp., </em>103 F.3d 9, 12 (2d Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Amicizia Societa Navegazione v. Chilean Nitrate &amp; Iodine Sales Corp., </em>274 F.2d 805, 808 (2d Cir. I960)). This Court \u201creview[s] a district court\u2019s decision to confirm an arbitration award <em>de novo </em>to the extent it turns on legal questions, and ... review[s] any findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Duferco Intern. Steel Trading v. T. Klaveness Shipping AJS, </em>333 F.3d 383, 388 (2d Cir.2003). \u201cA party petitioning a federal court to vacate an arbitral award bears the heavy burden of showing that the award falls within a very narrow set of circumstances delineated by statute and case law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Under the Federal Arbitration Act, a district court may vacate an arbitration award:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\">(1) where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means; (2) where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of them; (3) where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or (4) where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(l)-(4). In addition, \u201ca district court may vacate arbitration awards when the arbitrators acted in manifest disregard of the law.\u201d <em>Houdstermaatschappij, </em>103 F.3d at 12. Before vacating an arbitration award for \u201cmanifest disregard of the law,\u201d a court must find that: (i) \u201cthe arbitrators knew of a governing legal principle yet refused to apply it or ignored it altogether\u201d; and (ii) \u201cthe law ignored by the arbitrators was well defined, explicit, and clearly applicable to the case.\u201d <em>Greenberg v. Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., </em>220 F.3d 22, 28 (2d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>DiRussa v. Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., </em>121 F.3d 818, 821 (2d Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">Tobjy makes conclusory allegations regarding the arbitrators\u2019 review of his claims, the arbitrability of securities fraud claims, and Citibank\u2019s alleged fraud in procuring the arbitration agreement. Tobjy fails to submit any evidence in support of these allegations. Instead, Tobjy submits various financial records without asserting how they apply to his case. As such, Tobjy has failed to carry his \u201cheavy burden\u201d on this appeal. <em>Duferco, </em>333 F.3d at 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
