The order denying Miller\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appeal-ability.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Miller has not made the requisite showing. Aecordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"Ano\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b192-10\"> We have recently held that a certificate of appealability is required when appealing from the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 action. <em>See Reid. v.
