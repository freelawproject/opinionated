In No. 04-1605, he appeals from the denial of a second motion for reconsideration and a motion for leave to supplement his filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-19\">After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 arguments, we affirm the judgments below, concluding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Dasey\u2019s motions. We agree substantially with the reasoning in the district court\u2019s Memorandum of Decision dated January 29, 2004, and its March 2, 2004 endorsed order denying reconsideration. In addition, as appellees contend, Dasey may not use a Rule 60(b) motion to relitigate issues already decided by this court, <em>Dasey v. Anderson, </em>304 F.3d 148, 151 (1st Cir.2002), or to raise issues that might have been, but were not, asserted in prior court proceedings. 12 <em>Moore\u2019s Fed. Prac. </em>\u00a7 60.48[3][c], at 60-174.1 (3d ed.2003) (confirming that a party\u2019s \u201c[f]ailure to take advantage of an opportunity to litigate an issue precludes use of that issue to secure\u201d Rule 60(b)(6) relief). Finally, Dasey\u2019s motions failed to establish the alleged \u201cfraud on the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-21\">\n<em>The judgments in the above appeals are affirmed. 1st Cir. Loe. R. 27(c).</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
