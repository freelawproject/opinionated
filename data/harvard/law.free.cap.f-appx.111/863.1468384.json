The district court sentenced Guitron to consecutive prison terms of 120 months on the drug count and 60 months on the firearm count, and two concurrent 5-year supervised release terms. Counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing for reversal that Guitron\u2019s sentence is unconstitutional because it is cruel and unusual punishment and is based on the quantity of drugs Guitron possessed without regard to the quality or purity of the drugs, and because the district court lacked the authority to depart from the mandatory minimum statutory sentence. In his pro se supplemental brief, Guitron argues that he did not receive the help he had expected from his counsel and that his firearm possession conviction is invalid. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-20\">The arguments in the <em>Anders </em>brief are foreclosed by binding precedent. <em>See Chapman v. United States, </em>500 U.S. 453, 467, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991) (in noncapital cases, \u201cCongress has the power to define criminal punishments without giving the courts any sentencing discretion\u201d); <em>United States v. Collins, </em>340 F.3d 672, 679-80 (8th Cir.2003) (mandatory minimum penalties for drug offenses do not violate Eighth Amendment); <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>876 F.2d 639, 641 (8th Cir.1989) (mandatory minimum penalties based on quantity of drugs without regard to purity satisfy due process). The pro se challenge to the firearm charge fails because the district court established a factual basis for the offense, <em>see United States v. Cuervo, </em>354 F.3d 969, 990-91 (8th Cir.) (elements of \u00a7 924(c) offense), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 199, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2004), and Guitron admitted that he committed the offense, <em>see Adkins v. United States, </em>298 F.2d 842, 844 (8th Cir.) (per curiam) (plea of guilty is admission of all essential elements of indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>ment), <em>cert. denied, </em>370 U.S. 954, 82 S.Ct. 1604, 8 L.Ed.2d 819 (1962). We decline to address Guitron\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, which would be more appropriately raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding where a record can be fully developed. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>378 F.3d 754, 755 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Following our independent review of the record, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonftivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b895-18\">. The Honorable Thomas M. Shanahan, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
