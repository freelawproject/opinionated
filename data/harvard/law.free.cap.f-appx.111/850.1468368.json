Minter appeals from the final judgment entered by the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> upon his guilty plea to possessing with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>intent to distribute 5 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B) (Count 1), and with carrying or possessing a firearm in connection with a drug-trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (Count 2). On appeal, his counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court should not have accepted Minter\u2019s guilty plea to Count 2. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Minter testified at his plea hearing that, on April 15, 2003, he was pulled over by a Kansas City, Missouri police officer for a traffic violation, and that he had at least 5 grams of crack cocaine, which he knew was illegal to have and which he intended to give or sell to other people. He testified further that he had possessed a firearm, which he had with him in the vehicle to protect and defend himself. We find that a factual basis was amply established for the guilty plea on Count 2 based on Minter\u2019s plea-hearing statements. <em>See United States v. Cuervo, </em>354 F.3d 969, 990-991 (8th Cir.2004) (elements of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) offense), <em>petitions for cert. filed, </em>(June 08, 2004) (No. 03-10813), (June 10, 2004) (No. 03-10836), and (Sept. 29, 2004) (No. 03-11034).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Having found no nonfrivolous issues after reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we affirm. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-17\">. The Honorable Fernando J. Gaitan, Jr., United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
