Robinson claims that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress. Finding no error, we affirm.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>We review legal conclusions de novo, while reviewing factual findings for clear error. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). When a suppression motion has been denied, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>See United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Robinson first claims that the district court erred in finding that he was advised of his constitutional rights pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Detective L.T. Seals testified that he recited the <em>Miranda </em>warnings twice to Robinson, first on a neighbor\u2019s porch and then in Robinson\u2019s living room. Moreover, Detective Seals, Detective Matt Knight, and Sergeant A. J. Bickauskus testified that Robinson was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings inside the living room, and that he acknowledged his understanding of those warnings. Further, Robinson\u2019s witnesses, Stacie Nelson and Wendell Woodard, Jr., provided contradictory testimony as to whether the officers advised Robinson of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The district court found the officers\u2019 testimony credible, and such credibility findings are not generally reviewable. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989). Therefore, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Robinson received the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Next, Robinson claims that even if he was provided with the <em>Miranda </em>rights, his statements following the warnings were coerced because he did not freely and voluntarily waive his right to silence. We have reviewed the record and conclude that under the totality of the circumstances the incriminating statements Robinson made after waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights were voluntary. <em>See United States v. Cristobal, </em>293 F.3d 134, 139-40 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 963, 123 S.Ct. 396, 154 L.Ed.2d 319 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Robinson\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b186-15\"> Counsel for Robinson has filed a motion seeking permission to provide supplemental argument to challenge certain aspects of Robinson\u2019s sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>- U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The motion is hereby granted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>and the motion to file supplemental argument is deemed to provide the supplemental argument regarding the effects of <em>Blakely. </em>After consideration of the order issued by the en bane court in <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.2004) (order), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>73 U.S.L.W. 3121, U.S. -, - S.Ct. -, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - 2004 WL 2153053 (U.S. Aug. 6, 2004) (No. 04-193), we find no error in Robinson's sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
