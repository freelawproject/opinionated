Luna asserts that the IJ erred by ruling that his ex-wife\u2019s extra-marital affair and resultant pregnancy did not constitute extreme cruelty under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(2)(A)(i)(I). Respondent argues that this court does not have jurisdiction to review extreme cruelty determinations and that the IJ\u2019s ruling was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-25\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), we do not have jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, but retain jurisdiction over purely legal and non-discretionary questions. <em>Mireles-Valdez v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 213, 216 (5th Cir.2003). While we have never had occasion to determine whether extreme cruelty decisions are discretionary, we have held that extreme hardship decisions are discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>tionary because the phrase extreme hardship \u201cwas not self-explanatory, and reasonable men could easily differ as to their construction.\u201d <em>Moosa v. INS, </em>171 F.3d 994, 1013 (5th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>INS v. Jong Ha Wang, </em>450 U.S. 139, 144, 101 S.Ct. 1027, 67 L.Ed.2d 123 (1981)). Respondent urges us to hold that the phrase extreme cruelty, like extreme hardship, is not self-explanatory, and that extreme cruelty decisions, therefore, are discretionary. On the other hand, the only circuit to address this issue held that extreme cruelty was an objective standard to evaluate domestic violence and that extreme cruelty decisions were non-discretionary, factual determinations subject to judicial review. <em>See Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>345 F.3d 824, 833-35 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">However, we need not resolve the jurisdictional question in this case as Luna is not entitled to relief. <em>See Hernandez-Rodriguez v. Pasquarell, </em>118 F.3d 1034, 1045-6 &amp; n. 16 (5th Cir.1997). If the extreme cruelty standard is broad enough to include extra-marital affairs and resultant pregnancies, as Luna argues, then the phrase extreme cruelty is \u201cnot self-explanatory, and reasonable men could easily differ as to their construction.\u201d <em>Moosa, </em>171 F.3d at 1013 (quoting <em>Jong Ha Wang, </em>450 U.S. at 144). Consequently, extreme cruelty decisions would be discretionary determinations, and we would not have jurisdiction to consider Luna\u2019s petition. <em>See id. </em>On the other hand, if, as determined in <em>Hernandez, </em>345 F.3d at 833-35, extreme cruelty is an objective measure of domestic violence, then the IJ did not err by denying Luna\u2019s application because Luna did not make any showing that he was a victim of domestic violence constituting extreme cruelty. Accordingly, Luna\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b769-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
