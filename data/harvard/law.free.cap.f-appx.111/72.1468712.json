He contends (1) that the Government, in rebutting Park\u2019s entrapment defense, failed to prove predisposition; (2) that the district court erred in allowing excessive and inflammatory evidence to be admitted; (3) that the district court committed clear error in failing to grant Park a mitigating-role adjustment; and finally, (4) that the district court clearly erred in not lowering Park\u2019s sentence below the mandatory minimum on the basis of sentencing manipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-21\">With respect to the entrapment claim, we find ample support in the record for a jury to conclude that Park was predisposed to criminal behavior of the sort that led to his arrest and conviction. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Salerno, </em>66 F.3d 544, 547 (2d Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Valencia, </em>645 F.2d 1158, 1167 (2d Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-22\">We also find no merit to Park\u2019s second contention, that the court erred in admitting excessive and inflammatory evidence. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Pascarella, </em>84 F.3d 61, 72-73 (2d Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>991 F.2d 981, 994 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Third, given Park\u2019s extensive involvement in the underlying crimes, the court below did not err, let alone clearly err, in failing to grant a mitigating-role adjustment. <em>See United States v. Jeffers, </em>329 F.3d 94, 103 (2d Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Imtiaz, </em>81 F.3d 262, 264-65 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Finally, there is again no error, and certainly no clear error, associated with the district court\u2019s refusal to lower Park\u2019s sentence below the mandatory minimum. <em>See, e.g., United States v. De La Pava, </em>268 F.3d 157, 166 (2d Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Martin, </em>78 F.3d 808, 814-15 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">We have considered all of Park\u2019s claims and find them to be without merit. The district court\u2019s judgment is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The mandate in this case will be held pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 11, 159 L.Ed.2d 838 (2004), and <em>United States v. Fanfan, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 12, 159 L.Ed.2d 838 (2004). Should any party believe there is a need for the district court to exercise jurisdiction prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, it may file a motion seeking issuance of the mandate in whole or in part. Although any petition for rehearing should be filed in the normal course pursuant to Rule 40 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the Court will not reconsider those portions of its opinion that address Park\u2019s sentence until after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan. </em>In that regard, the parties will have until fourteen days following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to file supplemental petitions for rehearing in light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
