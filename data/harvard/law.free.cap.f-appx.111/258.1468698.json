The plan administrator concluded that Gilmer did not die as a result of an accident as defined in the policy and thus, denied Brown\u2019s claim for benefits under the policy. Brown appeals the district court\u2019s holding that the plan administrator did not abuse its discretion in denying her the benefits. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">Gilmer was an employee of Nolen Sis-trunk, Inc. (\u201cSistrunk\u201d), a Mississippi trucking company. At the beginning of his employment, Gilmer accepted an accidental death insurance policy offered by Sis-trunk. PFL Life Insurance Company (\u201cPFL\u201d) administered and financed the policy. Gilmer designated his daughter, Brown, as the policy\u2019s beneficiary. She would receive $1,000 per month, for life, guaranteed for twenty years, upon proof that the insured\u2019s death resulted directly from an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-14\">On June 22, 1999, Gilmer died following a traffic accident. The accident occurred while he was driving his employer\u2019s truck east on Interstate 20 in Louisiana. According to witnesses, Gilmer\u2019s truck swerved and crashed into the back of another truck. The police report stated that at the time of the accident the road conditions were good, the weather was clear, and there were no visual obscurities. In addition, the truck Gilmer was driving, as well as the other truck, had no known defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">Brown timely submitted a claim to PFL under the accidental death insurance policy. PFL denied Brown\u2019s claim after an investigation in which it concluded that Gilmer\u2019s death did not fall within the terms of the policy. PFL found that Gilmer suffered a cardiac event while he was driving and that caused the collision. PFL therefore concluded that Gilmer\u2019s heart attack contributed to his death and thus, that his death was not the result of an accident as defined in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-16\">Brown subsequently brought an action against PFL asserting a claim for bad faith denial of benefits in the Circuit Court of Attala County, Mississippi. PFL removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi. After a non-jury trial, the district court entered judgment for PFL holding that PFL\u2019s decision to deny the accidental death benefits was not an abuse of discretion because, inter aha, its decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-17\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"Aq9\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b291-18\">The Employee Retirement Income Security Act provides the district courts with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>the authority to review a plan administrator\u2019s denial of plan benefits. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) (2004). The district court reviews a plan administrator\u2019s factual determinations for an abuse of discretion when it has denied benefits under a plan. <em>Vercher v. Alexander &amp; Alexander, Inc., </em>379 F.3d 222, 226 (5th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989)); <em>Pierre v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins., </em>932 F.2d 1552 (5th Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 973, 112 S.Ct. 453, 116 L.Ed.2d 470 (1991). In applying the abuse of discretion standard, the district court analyzes whether the plan administrator acted arbitrarily or capriciously. <em>Bellaire Gen. Hosp. v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mich., </em>97 F.3d 822, 829 (5th Cir.1996). A plan administrator\u2019s decision is deemed arbitrary if it is made \u201cwithout a rational connection between the known facts and the decision or between the found facts and the evidence.\u201d <em>Lain v. Unum Life Ins. of Am., </em>279 F.3d 337, 342 (5th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Bellaire Gen. Hosp., </em>97 F.3d at 828). An administrator\u2019s decision must be based on evidence, even if disputable, that clearly supports the basis for denial, and there must be some concrete evidence in the record to support the plan administrator\u2019s decision. <em>Vega v. Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Servs., Inc., </em>188 F.3d 287, 299 (5th Cir.1999). The district court, in reviewing the plan administrator\u2019s decision, can only consider the evidence that was before the plan administrator. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">We in turn review de novo the district court\u2019s legal conclusion that the plan administrator abused its discretion. <em>Hammack v. Baroid Corp., </em>142 F.3d 266, 270 (5th Cir.1998) (citing <em>Sunbeam-Oster Co. Group Benefits Plan v. Whitehurst, </em>102 F.3d 1368, 1373 (5th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">We first examine the terms of the accidental death insurance policy. The relevant terms of the policy provide that the benefits would be payable upon proof that the \u201cinsured\u2019s death resulted directly from accidental bodily injury and independently of disease or bodily infirmity or any other cause.\u201d The terms of the policy further provide that the benefits would not \u201cbe payable if death results, directly or indirectly ... or is contributed to, wholly or in part, by ... disease or medical or surgical treatment of disease.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">We now turn to the relevant evidence before PFL, which consisted of Gilmer\u2019s death certificate, an autopsy report, the statements of the doctor who performed the autopsy, Gilmer\u2019s medical records, the police report, and the investigating officer\u2019s statements. The death certificate provided that acute and ongoing myocardial infarction, i.e, a heart attack, was a significant cause of Gilmer\u2019s death. The autopsy report provided that Gilmer\u2019s death \u201cwas due to multiple traumatic injuries\u201d and that \u201c[tjhere was no evidence of recent abuse of ethanol or other common drugs.\u201d The autopsy report also stated that Gilmer \u201chad ongoing myocardial infarction, with recent thrombosis of the left coronary artery\u201d that \u201cmay have caused the accident.\u201d Upon questioning, the doctor who performed the autopsy, Dr. Young, stated that Gilmer was having a heart attack for some time. Dr. Young, however, maintained only that the heart attack \u201cmay have caused\u201d the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Gilmer\u2019s medical records revealed that he suffered from high blood pressure, which was poorly controlled, complained of shortness of breath and dizziness, and was a smoker. Moreover, as previously discussed, the police report indicated that the weather and road conditions were good when Gilmer\u2019s truck swerved and hit the other truck. Further, the accident invest\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>gator, after referring to the autopsy report, attributed the accident to the fact that Gilmer was suffering a cardiac event, or, less likely, fell asleep at the wheel.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Brown\u2019s argues on appeal that PFL could deny the benefits only if the heart attack was the probable cause of Gilmer\u2019s death. This argument is unavailing. Under the abuse of the discretion standard, PFL\u2019s decision need only evince a \u201crational connection between the known facts and the decision.\u201d <em>Lain, </em>279 F.3d at 342 (quoting <em>Bellaire Gen. Hosp., </em>97 F.3d at 828). Considering all the evidence before PFL, it could have rationally concluded that Gilmer\u2019s heart attack contributed to his death. Specifically, the undisputed evidence shows that Gilmer\u2019s health was poor, that he was having a heart attack while he was driving, that nothing about the road conditions or the weather could be said to have contributed to the accident, and that in the opinion of two experienced professionals \u2014 Dr. Young and the investigator \u2014 the heart attack may have caused the accident. A rational conclusion from this evidence is that Gilmer was suffering a heart attack that impaired his ability to drive and caused him to swerve into the other truck. As such, PFL\u2019s conclusion was not arbitrary or capricious, and PFL had a sound basis for denying Brown\u2019s claim for benefits under the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the district court that PFL did not abuse its discretion when it denied Brown the benefits under the accidental death insurance policy. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
