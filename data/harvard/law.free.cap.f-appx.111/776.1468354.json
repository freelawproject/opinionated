This court gives great deference to an immigration judge\u2019s (IJ\u2019s) decision concerning an alien\u2019s credibility, and such determination may not be overturned unless the record compels it. <em>Lopez De Jesus v. I.N.S., </em>812 F.3d 155, 161 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Accordingly, a credibility determination will be upheld if it is based upon a reasonable interpretation of the record and supported by substantial evidence. <em>Chun v. I.N.S., </em>40 F.3d 76, 78-79 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The finding that Yanto was not credible is based on a reasonable interpretation of the record and is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 78-79. Yanto\u2019s assertion that the IJ and the BIA failed to address certain \u201cissues\u201d raised by him is without merit. The BIA \u201cdoes not have to write an exegesis on every contention [made by a petitioner]. What is required is merely that it consider the issues raised, and announce its decision in terms sufficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that it has heard and thought and not merely reacted.\u201d <em>Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 907 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b809-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
