Ahmed, a native and citizen of Sudan, seeks review of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) affirming without opinion the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) denial of her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">We first reject Ahmed\u2019s claim that she established eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Ahmed fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Ahmed thus cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal. <em>See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">Ahmed next claims that the Board\u2019s summary affirmance of her specific case violated her right to due process because the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal was in error and because he failed to fully address her claims. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7) (2004). We have reviewed the administrative record and the IJ\u2019s decision and conclude that Ahmed\u2019s claim is without merit. <em>See Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272, 281, 283 (4th Cir.2004); <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324-25 (4th Cir.2002); 8 C.F.R \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(ii) (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-14\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-15\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A2-\"> Ahmed does not dispute the denial of CAT relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
