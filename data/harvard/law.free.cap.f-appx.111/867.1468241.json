The dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>trict court sentenced appellant to 240 months imprisonment and 10 years supervised release. For reversal, counsel for appellant argues the district court abused its discretion in denying a motion for downward departure based on family hardship. Appellant has moved pro se to file a supplemental brief based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">After carefully reviewing the record, and in particular the written and oral remarks of the district court, we conclude that the court was fully aware of its authority to depart downward but declined to do so based on the facts of this case. Thus, we hold that the district court made a discretionary decision not to depart downward, which is unreviewable. <em>See United States v. Walterman, </em>343 F.3d 938, 942 (8th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">Given that appellant received the statutory minimum sentence, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), with no enhancements based on judicially found facts, we conclude that supplemental briefing based on <em>Blakely </em>is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">Accordingly, we deny the pending motion, and we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-36\">.
