The managing editor interviewed Wright, but hired a candidate who, unlike Wright, had newspaper editing experience and was familiar with the software used by the paper. Wright brought this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 action, claiming Nonpareil refused to hire her because of her race. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted Nonpareil\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and Wright appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-19\">Assuming without deciding that Wright established a prima facie case of discrimination, we agree with the district court that she failed to show Nonpareil\u2019s articulated nondiscriminatory reason for not hiring her was a pretext for race discrimination. <em>See Kincaid v. City of Omaha, </em>878 F.3d 799, 803-06 (8th Cir.2004). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-20\">.
