(sued as \u201cBear Sterns Securities Corp.\u201d), Valetin Manglapus, and Bear Stearns &amp; Co., Inc. (collectively, \u201cBear Stearns\u201d). Malak contends that the district court erred in concluding that Malak\u2019s dispute with Bear Stearns was not arbitrable under National Association of Securities Dealers Dispute Resolution Code Section 10301(a) (\u201cRule 10301(a)\u201d). We assume that the parties are familiar with the facts, the procedural context, and specification of the appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-19\">To compel arbitration under Rule 10301(a), Malak must establish: (i) that he is a \u201ccustomer\u201d of Bear Stearns (or some person \u201cassociated\u201d with Bear Stearns); and (ii) that his claims arise in connection with Bear Stearns\u2019 (or the associated person\u2019s) activities. <em>John Hancock Life Ins. Co. v. Wilson, </em>254 F.3d 48, 58 (2d Cir. 2001). \u201c[Wjhere investors pool their funds and relinquish all investment authority to a third party who deals with an NASD broker, that third-party, not the investors, will normally be the broker\u2019s customer.\u201d <em>Bensadoun v. Jobe-Riat, </em>316 F.3d 171, 178 (2d Cir.2003). Malak concedes that he pooled his investments in a fund to be managed by a third party, who retained complete control over Malak\u2019s investments throughout the relevant time period. She, therefore, not Malak, was Bear Stearns\u2019 \u201ccustomer\u201d for purposes of Rule 10301(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
