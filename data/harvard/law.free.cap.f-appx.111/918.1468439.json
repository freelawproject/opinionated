R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b950-23\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-24\">Surinder Singh, a native and citizen of India, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 summary affirmance of the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of his application for asylum and withholding of removal. We have jurisdiction pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Singh challenges the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum based on an adverse credibility determination. Because the IJ offered specific, cogent reasons for questioning Singh\u2019s credibility, and because Singh has not shown that the evidence compels a conclusion to the contrary, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">By failing to qualify for asylum, Singh necessarily fails to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), petitioner\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the stay of removal was continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, to the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">Petitioner\u2019s late-filed motion for stay of voluntary departure is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b950-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
