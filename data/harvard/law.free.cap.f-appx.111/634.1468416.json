The district court (Larimer, /.), reviewing the grievances in great detail, granted Delphi\u2019s request for summary judgment. Anderson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">On appeal from a grant of summary judgment, we view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party (i.e., Anderson). <em>See De la Cruz v. New York City Human Res. Admin. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>82 F.3d 16, 18 (2d Cir.1996). And, we review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. See Bicker-staff v. Vassar College, </em>196 F.3d 435, 445 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">We agree with the court below that most of Anderson\u2019s claims are time-barred. In light of <em>Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 111-14, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002), we reject Anderson\u2019s contention that, under a continuing-violation theory, all of his related grievances are timely. <em>See also Elmenayer v. ABF Freight Sys., </em>318 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">As to his timely discrimination grievances and his claims of retaliation, we also agree with the judgment of the court below. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Anderson made <em>prima facie </em>cases for his claims, which is dubious, and even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Anderson\u2019s characterization of Delphi\u2019s rebuttal explanations might, as to some of these claims, raise enough factual issues to justify submission to a jury, which is yet more dubious, Anderson still did not present enough evidence of discrimination or retaliation in any of these claims so that a reasonable jury could find for him. <em>See Lizardo v. Denny\u2019s, Inc., </em>270 F.3d 94, 103 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201cEvidence of pretext, however, even combined with the minimal showing necessary to establish a prima facie case ..., does not mandate a denial of summary judgment.\u201d); <em>Slattery v. Smss Reinsurance Am. Corp., </em>248 F.3d 87, 94-95 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">We have considered all of Anderson\u2019s claims and find them to be without merit. The district court\u2019s judgment is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
