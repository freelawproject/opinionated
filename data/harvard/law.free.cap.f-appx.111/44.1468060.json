Co., Ltd. (\u201cNamsan\u201d) and Korea Asset Management Corporation (\u201cKAMCO\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs alleged various claims arising from the failure of Defendant Namsan to \u201creconcile\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and purchase certain loans tendered in the context of a buy-out of the foreign (i.e., non-Korean) debt of the Korean conglomerate Daewoo. In their complaint, Plaintiffs argued that Defendant Namsan breached its contract with the tendering institutions, and that Defendant KAMCO \u2014 a non-signatory to the contract, to whom Namsan had assigned the power to reconcile the debt \u2014 should be held liable for tortious interference or pursuant to alter ego liability. Plaintiffs appeal from the decision of the District Court, granting summary judgment to the Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-15\">We agree with the Plaintiffs that Defendant Namsan was obligated to endeavor in good faith to reconcile and purchase the contested debt. <em>See, e.g., 511 West 232nd Owners Corp. v. Jennifer Realty Co., </em>98 N.Y.2d 144, 746 N.Y.S.2d 131, 773 N.E.2d 496, 500-01 (2002). But, we also conclude that whatever requirements of good faith existed under the contract or, more generally, under New York law were met here as a matter of law. KAMCO, to whom Namsan had assigned the right to make reconciliation decisions, was acting on advice of counsel, and in response to serious potential legal defects when it decided not to reconcile the tendered debt. Under these circumstances, the Plaintiffs have failed to create a material issue of fact as to whether the decision not to reconcile was made in good faith. <em>Cf. Dalton v. Educational Testing Service, </em>87 N.Y.2d 384, 639 N.Y.S.2d 977, 663 N.E.2d 289, 291 (1995) (discussing the requirements of good faith under New York law).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-16\">Because Defendant Namsan did not breach its contract with the Plaintiffs, the Plaintiffs, as a matter of law, cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>make out their claims against Defendant KAMCO.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">We have considered all of the Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments, including the claim that the debt was automatically reconciled as a result of some statements of Namsan\u2019s counsel, and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of, the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-12\">. In their complaint, Plaintiffs alleged jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1330(a), 1603(a). KAMCO has admitted that it is a foreign \"government agency,\u201d which suffices for jurisdiction under the FSIA, and we see no reason to doubt that pendent party jurisdiction was properly exercised with respect to Namsan. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b77-17\">. The word \"reconcile\u201d is used as a term of art in the contract between Plaintiffs and Defendant Namsan. Under the contract, tendered debt was \"reconciled\u201d once its legal and financial suitability for purchase was verified and confirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
