We have reviewed the administrative record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision, designated by the Board as the final agency determination, and find that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Scott failed to establish the past persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2003) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). We will reverse the Board only if the evidence \u201c \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>EliasZacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812). We have reviewed the immigration judge\u2019s credibility determinations and find them supported by specific, cogent reasoning and therefore entitled to substantial deference. <em>See Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). Thus, the administrative record supports the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Scott failed to establish his eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-19\">We deny Scott\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
