Because the order did not dispose of the claims against two other defendants, it was not a final appealable order. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (courts of appeals have jurisdiction over appeals from final decisions of district courts); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) (in absence of an express direction for entry of final judgment as to fewer than all parties, an order adjudicating fewer than all claims or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>rights and liabilities of fewer than all parties shall not terminate action as to any claims or parties); <em>Bullock v. Baptist Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>817 F.2d 58, 59 (8th Cir. 1987) (order dismissing complaint as to fewer than all defendants is not final order within meaning of \u00a7 1291). Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-10\">. The Honorable David S.
