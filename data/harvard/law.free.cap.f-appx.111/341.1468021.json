Martinez argues that the district court erred in finding that he possessed a firearm during the commission of the offense and, as a result, in imposing a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) and denying a safety-valve adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-27\">Section 2Dl.l(b)(l) calls for a two-level increase in the offense level for a drug trafficking offense \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). Because the confidential informant saw, on at least one occasion, Martinez wearing a weapon during the offense and a weapon was found in the same location where a number of offenses occurred, we find that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>did not clearly err in finding that Martinez possessed a firearm during the commission of the offense. <em>See United States v. Jacquinot, </em>258 F.3d 423, 430 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Additionally, the district court\u2019s finding that Martinez possessed a firearm for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) also \u201cdisqualified [him] from being eligible for the \u2018safety valve\u2019 provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2.\u201d <em>United States v. Flucas, </em>99 F.3d 177, 178-79 (5th Cir.1996). Because Martinez has failed to show that the district court erred in imposing the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement, he consequently has also failed to show that the district court erred in determining that he was ineligible under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>See id.; Vasquez, </em>161 F.3d 909, 912-13 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
