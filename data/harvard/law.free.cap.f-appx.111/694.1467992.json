In 1998, this court affirmed IsmePs conviction. Ismel filed a motion to set aside his conviction in the district court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). The district court granted the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied IsmePs \u00a7 2255 motion. However, upon reconsideration, the court granted IsmePs request for a certificate of appealability on his claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the admission of co-conspirator testimony detailing IsmePs confession to having Jones killed. It is this claim that is now before this court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">To establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment due to ineffective assistance of counsel, Ismel must demonstrate that (1) counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness; and (2) there is a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result would have been different. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Assuming, as the district court did, that counsel\u2019s failure to object fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, we agree with the district court that Ismel has not demonstrated that but for counsel\u2019s actions, the result would have been different. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of IsmePs \u00a7 2255 motion on the reasoning of the district court. <em>United States v. Ismel, </em>Nos. CR-94-8; CA-99-924-7 (W.D.Va. June 10, 2003). We deny IsmePs motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b727-14\"> On May 14, 2004, we denied Ismel's motion to expand the certificate of appealability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
