We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence and will uphold the findings unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>Taha v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 623, 626 (9th Cir.2004). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-20\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding because there were material discrepancies between Sidhu\u2019s asylum affidavit and his testimony. <em>See Taha, </em>362 F.3d at 627-28. Accordingly, Sidhu failed to establish his eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 628 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-21\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the petitioner failed to show that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured upon returning to India, and therefore was not entitled to CAT relief. <em>See Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1283 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-22\">The BIA\u2019s decision to streamline Sidhu\u2019s case was appropriate because the issues it raised were clearly controlled by existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>precedent. <em>Cf. Chong Shin Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 1081, 1086 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 749 (9th Cir.2004), Sidhu\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the stay of removal was not opposed by the government, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, to the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b505-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
