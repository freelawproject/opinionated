Ramirez contends that the district court erred by characterizing his state felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. However, this issue is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Caicedo-Cuero, </em>312 F.3d 697, 706-11 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 1021, 123 S.Ct. 1948, 155 L.Ed.2d 864 (2003); <em>United States v. Hinojosar-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Ramirez also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b) are unconstitutional. He acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed, but he seeks to preserve the issue for possible Supreme Court review in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As Ramirez concedes, this issue is foreclosed. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 </em>U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
