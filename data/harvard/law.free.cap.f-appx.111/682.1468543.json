See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">Dwayne Marcellus Odom appeals the judgment order of the district court sentencing him to sixty-four months of imprisonment following his guilty plea to possession of a firearm as a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2) (2000). In his appeal, filed pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), counsel claims to have found no non-frivolous issues for appeal but questions whether Odom\u2019s sentence is unduly harsh. Odom has been advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has elected not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">We have performed an independent review of the record and likewise find no meritorious issues. The district court complied with the mandates of Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Odom\u2019s guilty plea, and Odom\u2019s challenge to a sentence within the properly calculated guideline range is not reviewable on appeal. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>18 F.3d 1145, 1151 (4th Cir.1994). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We also deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
