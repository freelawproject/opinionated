McBrayer, federal prisoner # 05985-043, moves in this court for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of her 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct her sentence. McBrayer argues, in pertinent part, that her trial attorneys were ineffective for fading to timely disclose and designate accountant Jan Miller as an expert witness. She argues that, as a result, she was prejudiced because the trial court excluded the testimony of Miller, whose testimony in state court resulted in a directed verdict in McBrayer\u2019s favor, and whose testimony in federal court would have led to a different result. McBrayer argues that the district court\u2019s failure to hold an evidentiary hearing on this issue was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">A COA motion may be granted only if the movant makes a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). This requires the movant to demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-15\">The district court, without conducting an evidentiary hearing, found that the attorneys\u2019 failure to timely designate Miller as an expert was McBrayer\u2019s fault because she did not timely provide to Miller the documents necessary to prepare her report. The court focused on McBrayer\u2019s statement that she had some difficulty obtaining those documents. The court thus concluded that McBrayer\u2019s attorneys were not negligent in failing to timely designate Miller as an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-16\">\u201c[Cjontested fact issues [in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 case] ordinarily may not be decided on affidavits alone, unless the affidavits are supported by other evidence in the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>635 F.2d 449, 451 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981). The record does not conclusively show that McBrayer is entitled to no relief. <em>See United States v. Bartholomew, </em>974 F.2d 39, 41 (5th Cir.1992). The affidavits presented by McBrayer, those presented by her attorneys, and the record as a whole show that there are contested facts regarding whether McBrayer timely provided the necessary information to Miller, and despite any delays by McBrayer, whether the attorneys received Miller\u2019s report and supporting documents in time to comply with the trial court\u2019s discovery order.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-17\">McBrayer has stated a facially valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right regarding her contention that her attorneys were ineffective for failing to timely disclose and designate accountant Jan Miller as an expert witness. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Accordingly, we GRANT McBrayer a COA on this issue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>VACATE the district court\u2019s denial of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 relief, and REMAND to the district court for an evidentiary hearing regarding this issue. <em>See Dickinson v. Wainwright, </em>626 F.2d 1184, 1186 (5th Cir.1980). This order is in no way intended to express any intimation as to the ultimate outcome of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">McBrayer does not argue, and thus has waived, her claims raised in the district court that these attorneys were ineffective because there was a conflict of interest in their representing both her and her husband and because they failed to designate Kenneth Parker as an expert witness and to prepare adequately for trial. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">COA GRANTED; VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b756-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
