Jordan appeals from a judgment of conviction and a sentence principally of 120 months of imprisonment entered in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York (Telesca, J.), following his plea of guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the background of this case and its procedural context. On this appeal, Jordan challenges the district court\u2019s decision to deny him a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 3E1.1<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the district court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 pursuant to the cross-reference contained in \u00a7 2G2.4(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">\n<em>1. Denial of Downward Adjustment for Acceptance of Responsibility</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">A defendant qualifies for a downward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 \u201c[i]f the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d Because \u201c[t]he sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility .... the determination of the sentencing judge is entitied to great deference on review.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, app. n. 5. \u201c[W]e will not disturb the district court\u2019s factual determination regarding whether a defendant has accepted responsibility unless it is \u2018without foundation.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Guzman, </em>282 F.3d 177, 184 (2d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Austin, </em>17 F.3d 27, 30 (2d Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-14\">Jordan argues that he is entitled to the downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility because he pled guilty to the information and expressed remorse in a letter to the court, promising \u201cnever to sexually-exploit [sic] children ever again.\u201d The fact that a defendant enters a guilty plea does not entitle the defendant to an adjustment downward for acceptance of responsibility as of right; this evidence, while \u201csignificant,\u201d \u201cmay be outweighed by conduct of the defendant that is inconsistent with such acceptance of responsibility.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, app. n. 3. Here the district court cited two instances of such conduct: (i) Jordan\u2019s failure to sign a waiver granting the Probation Office access to details of mental health treatment he was receiving as a result of a May 2003 state conviction and of similar counseling he had received after a 1987 conviction, and (ii) his failure to register under his legal name as a sex offender pursuant to New York State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-15\">Jordan declined to grant the Probation Office access to his current and past mental health treatment history on advice of counsel because such therapy could include discussion of unprosecuted criminal conduct. The waiver forms that Jordan refused to sign would have granted the Probation Office access to \u201c[psychological and [p]sychiatric records\u201d and would have di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>rected the treating therapists to release information including attendance records, response to treatment, and \u201ceffectiveness of therapy.\u201d The Guidelines and our own cases prohibit a district court from conditioning a downward adjustment under \u00a7 8E1.1 on admission of unprosecuted crimes. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, app. n. 1(a) (\u201c[A] defendant is not required to volunteer, or affirmatively admit, relevant conduct beyond the offense of conviction in order to obtain a reduction.\u201d); <em>United States v. Woods, </em>927 F.2d 735, 736 (2d Cir.1991) (\u201c[A] court may not ..., consistent with the Fifth Amendment, ... require a defendant to <em>admit </em>to [unprosecuted] criminal behavior as a condition of obtaining a reduction in punishment.\u201d). It is not clear that the waivers Jordan was requested to sign would have likely resulted in such disclosure. We need not resolve this issue, however, because even supposing <em>arguendo </em>that it would have been improper to deny the downward adjustment on the basis of Jordan\u2019s failure to sign the waivers, the other conduct relied upon by the district court to deny the downward adjustment furnishes an adequate basis for the court\u2019s determination. <em>See United States v. Zhuang, </em>270 F.3d 107, 110 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201c[W]e will not assume that the district court has erred in [denying downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility based on the defendant\u2019s refusal to acknowledge uncharged conduct] if an alternative permissible ground for denying the adjustment can be deduced from the record.\u201d); <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>96 F.3d 41, 43 (2d Cir.1996) (\u201cEven when the District Court has articulated impermissible reasons for the denial of a section 3E1.1 reduction, the sentence may nonetheless be affirmed if permissible reasons were also articulated.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">When Jordan registered as a sex offender in May of 2003 pursuant to his state conviction he did not list among his names and aliases Robert D. Jordan, his true legal name at the time of conviction and registration. <em>See generally </em>N.Y. Correct. Law \u00a7\u00a7 168-b, 168-f(l) (McKinney 2003) (requiring persons convicted of specified offenses to register and requiring the state to ascertain and record the offender\u2019s \u201cname ... [and] all aliases used\u201d). The defendant\u2019s failure to register his actual name while giving a former name and other aliases furnishes ample basis for the district court\u2019s decision not to credit his assertion that he accepted responsibility for the instant offense and meant no further harm to children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Rivera, </em>96 F.3d at 43 (affirming denial of \u00a7 3E1.1 adjustment where defendant did not demonstrate \u201ccontrition and candor\u201d). Because the district court\u2019s determination was not \u201cwithout foundation,\u201d we do not disturb it. <em>Guzman, </em>282 F.3d at 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">2. <em>Application of \u00a7 2G2.2</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings made in the course of imposing a sentence under the Guidelines for clear error, but review <em>de novo </em>the court\u2019s legal interpretation of the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Ravelo, </em>370 F.3d 266, 269 (2d Cir.2004). Where, as here, the offense of conviction is mere possession of child por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>nography, Guideline \u00a7 2G2.4 (captioned \u201cPossession of Materials Depicting a Minor Engaged in Sexually Explicit Conduct\u201d) generally supplies the starting point. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>221 F.3d 83, 87, 97 (2d Cir.2000). Section 2G2.4(c)(2) directs, however, that \u201c[i]f the offense involved trafficking in material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor (including receiving, transporting, shipping, advertising, or possessing [such] material ... with intent to traffic),\u201d the sentencing court should instead apply \u00a7 2G2.2, which governs trafficking. The district court, citing <em>Johnson, </em>221 F.3d at 97 \u2014 98, held that where a defendant pled guilty only to possession of child pornography but the preponderance of the evidence establishes that the offense involved trafficking in material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor, the court is required by the cross-reference contained in \u00a7 2G2.4(c)(2) to apply \u00a7 2G2.2. Applying this standard, the court found that Jordan\u2019s admission to agents that he had traded pornography over the internet and the evidence that he had sent explicit photographs to another individual and had agreed to exchange videos with an undercover FBI agent were sufficient to support by a preponderance of the evidence a finding that he possessed the still images that formed the basis for the instant conviction as a result of trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Jordan contends that \u00a7 2G2.2 may only be applied via the cross-reference in \u00a7 2G2.4(e)(2) where the government can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant has engaged in trafficking. The district court correctly rejected this argument, interpreting the cross-reference as requiring proof of trafficking or possession with intent to traffic only by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>Nos. 97-CR-206, 98-CR-160, 1999 WL 395381, *11 n. 3 (N.D.N.Y.1999), <em>affd, </em>221 F.3d at 98; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3 cmt. background. Jordan further contends that because he admitted only to knowing possession of the images in question, the district court erred in considering evidence that he had trafficked in other child pornography before his arrest. This argument lacks merit. Jordan\u2019s past behavior and his admission that he previously trafficked in other child pornography were relevant to the intent with which he possessed the images that were the subject of the indictment. <em>Cf. United States v. Von Foelkel, </em>136 F.3d 339, 341 (2d Cir. 1998) (per curiam) (holding, on a criminal appeal, that prior bad acts evidence is admissible to prove intent to commit the charged crime). The district court did not clearly err in drawing an inference of intent to traffic the images for which Jordan was convicted from Jordan\u2019s admission and his prior trafficking. <em>Cf. Johnson, </em>221 F.3d at 98 (affirming trial court\u2019s similar inference based on admission in plea agreement that defendant \u201ctraded or exchanged child pornography\u201d in general).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the sentencing determination of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED. Because our holding implicates issues currently pending before the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 11 159 L.Ed.2d 838 (2004), and <em>United States v. Fanfan, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 12, 159 L.Ed.2d 838 (2004), the mandate in this case will be held pending decisions in those cases. Should any party believe there is a need for the district court to exercise jurisdiction prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions, it may file a motion seeking issuance of the mandate in whole or in part. Although any petition for rehearing should be filed in the normal course pursuant to Rule 40 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the court will not consider the substance of any issue concerning defendant\u2019s sentence until after the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan. </em>In that regard, the parties will have until fourteen days following the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions to file supplemental petitions for rehearing in light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Fanfan.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-10\">. The parties, the Probation Office and the district court all proceeded under the 2002 Guidelines Manual in use at the time of sentencing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(B). This and all future references to the Guidelines are to the 2002 Manual.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b99-5\">. It is not clear from the district court's comments at sentencing whether the court believed that Jordan was required to register pursuant to his plea of guilty to the instant federal offense or instead faulted his failure to register under his true legal name pursuant to his May 2003 state conviction. We note that New York law does not require registration prior to imposition of sentence. N.Y. Correct. L. \u00a7 168 \u2014 f(l). Because the record fairly supports the conclusion that the court based its decision on Jordan's failure to register under his true name for his state offense, however, we affirm on that ground. <em>Zhuang, </em>270 F.3d at 110.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
