Mr. Barron also seeks to proceed in forma pauperis. We deny his request for a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-18\">In August 2001, Mr. Barron pleaded guilty in Oklahoma state court to one count of possession of a controlled dangerous substance within 1,000 feet of a school and one count of manufacturing a controlled dangerous substance. Mr. Barron was sentenced to consecutive terms of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment for each count and fined $50,000. The trial court denied his motion to withdraw his plea in October 2001, and the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d) later denied certiorari. In April 2002, Mr. Barron filed his \u00a7 2254 petition in federal district court. He alleged (1) involuntariness of his guilty plea in violation of the right to a fair trial under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, (2) ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment, and (3) erroneous denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea in violation of the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Following the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations, the district court denied Mr. Barron\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition in April 2004. He now seeks a COA so he may appeal the district court\u2019s ruling on the same three grounds rejected by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-20\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-21\">We may issue a COA and entertain Mr. Barron\u2019s appeal only if he \u201chas made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(e)(2). To make a substantial showing, Mr. Barron \u201cmust show that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-22\">In addition, an Oklahoma state court has already adjudicated Mr. Barron\u2019s habeas claims on the merits. In cases like this, we may grant habeas relief only where the state court decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\u201d or was \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). We have also recently held that this \u201cdeferential treatment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>state court decisions must be incorporated into our consideration of a habeas petitioner\u2019s request for COA.\u201d <em>Dockins v. Hines, </em>374 F.3d 935, 938 (10th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">Applying this deferential standard, we have reviewed the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, the district court\u2019s order and the entire record and brief on appeal. For substantially the same reasons set out in the magistrate judge\u2019s thorough report and recommendation, and the district court\u2019s order addressing objections to the report and recommendation, we conclude that Mr. Barron has not made a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). First, the OCCA did not unreasonably apply federal law when it ruled that the trial court sufficiently informed the petitioner of his sentencing range and that he adequately understood the consequences of his plea. Second, we conclude that the OCCA did not err when it found no \u201cactual conflict,\u201d at the plea hearing or the hearing to withdraw Mr. Barron\u2019s plea of guilty, that adversely affected his counsel\u2019s performance. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it did not allow the petitioner to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">We therefore DENY Mr. Barron\u2019s application for a COA. We GRANT his motion to proceed in forma pauperis and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
