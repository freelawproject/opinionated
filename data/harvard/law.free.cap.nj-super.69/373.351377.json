J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A0cr\">Lillian Clawans, an attorney of this State, filed appeals from two judgments of contempt committed in the face of the court (Assignment Judge Waugh of Essex County). We consolidated the appeals for briefing and argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The first contempt occurred December 5, 1960. Judge Waugh called the civil and criminal appeal list at 9:30 A. it. Miss Clawans was defense attorney in <em>State v. </em>Bell, and when the case was called the State announced it was ready. The assignment clerk informed the court that Miss Clawans had telephoned that she would be 15 or 20 minutes late. Judge Waugh then said, \u2018'\u2018All right, mark it \u2018ready.\u2019 \u201d The following occurred shortly after 10 a. m. :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">\u201cThe Court: Miss Clawans, you have an appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">Miss Clawans: I am looking for my client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">The Court: Will you please come back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">Miss Clawans: I will have something to say to you when I come back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-11\">The Court: Will you please come back, Miss Clawans ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-12\">Miss Clawans: <em>No, </em>I will <em>not.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-13\">The Court: Miss Clawans, you will please come back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-14\">Miss Clawans: I will not. I am looking for my client. I have had enough from you. You are a conspirator. I went before the Senate Judicial Committee on a complaint I made against you that you weren\u2019t qualified for a judicial position, and they held up your appointment. Then you conspired when I was in Europe on an emergency flight to see my sick aunt, you conspired against me, and you know it is not a lie. I have been trying, since I have been indicted by the Grand Jury, to appear before the Grand Jury, and I am reliably informed, and I want the world to know, that you said I can\u2019t appear before the Grand Jury until I make an application before you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-15\">I am <em>not </em>going to- take this stuff any <em>more. </em>I have suffered from you for thirteen years. This is not a new thing. It is going on for thirteen years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-16\">The Court: Miss Clawans, are you ready on your appeal ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-17\">Miss Clawans: I have to look for my client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-18\">The Court: Miss Clawans, are you ready on the appeal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-19\">Miss Clawans: I don\u2019t know until I look for my client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-20\">The Court: Miss Clawans, I am going to hold you in contempt of court for your language before me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>The certification and order for sentence filed by Judge Waugh (see <em>R. R. </em>3:8-1 and 4:87-1), recites that this conduct was observed and heard by numerous members of the bar who were present to answer the call, as well as by court attendants and spectators. Miss Clawans was summarily convicted of criminal contempt and, after repeated adjournments, fined $100, which she paid under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The second contempt occurred February 21, 1961. Miss Clawans had pending in the Essex County Court three appeals from municipal court convictions in <em>State v. Frazier, East Orange v. Frazier </em>and <em>State v. Garfinkel. </em>At the daily call held just before 10 a. m., the prosecuting attorney informed the court that the State had had its witnesses in court on a number of occasions but that they had not been brought in that morning because the prosecutor\u2019s office had been unable to get word as to whether the defense was ready. Garfinkel, one of the defendants-appellants, then informed the court that Miss Clawans was representing him and Frazier, that she had been called away on urgent business and that she requested the cases be marked ready for 2 p. m. The cases were so marked.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">February 21 was also the adjourned date for sentencing Miss Clawans for the December <em>5 </em>contempt. Judge Waugh noted on the record that he had received a telephone call from her attorney, who said she could not appear because of illness and that he would send the judge a doctor\u2019s certificate. Such a certificate had arrived stating that Miss Clawans was under the doctor\u2019s care for shock and nervousness since November 21, 1960; her physical condition had been aggravated on December 5, 1960, and so far no improvement had been noted. The judge further said he had been informed of Miss Clawans\u2019 appearance before the Domestic Relations Court the preceding day, and that she would appear there again that day. He said he had telephoned her attorney and told him he was not satisfied with the doctor\u2019s certificate, and that if Miss Clawans was well enough to try cases, she was well enough to be in court on the contempt matter. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>judge continued the contempt proceedings to February 23. The prosecutor then advised the court that Miss Clawans had been to the prosecutor\u2019s office the day before at 4 p. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">At 2 p. m. the prosecuting attorney informed the court that Miss Clawans had appeared in the prosecutor\u2019s office at about 1:50 p. m. and been told her cases were set down for 2 o\u2019clock. She said she had an emergent matter to take care of and would be back at 2:15. Miss Clawans not having appeared by 2:30 p. M., Judge Waugh telephoned the Domestic Eelations Court and found she was there. He was informed she would be sent over to the County Court as soon as possible. The following occurred at 2 :55 p. m. :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">\u201cThe Court: Call Miss Clawans in, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">Court Officer Ernest Zoppi: She won\u2019t come in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">The Court: Let the record show that at quarter to three I received a call from Judge Lindeman\u2019s court stating that they had given Miss Clawans a message that I was awaiting her, and that she was on her way over. Call the two defendants in. Mr. Buckley, did you ask Miss Clawans if she will come in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-10\">Mr. Vincent Buckley: I will now. One of the officers did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-11\">(Miss Clawans enters the court room.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-12\">The Court: Sit up at counsel table, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-13\">Miss Clawans: What is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-14\">The Court: Please come up to the counsel table. These two appeals were ready at ten o\u2019clock this morning. I received word from one of the two gentlemen, the one on the left, is that Mr. Garfinkel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-16\">Mr. Garfinkel: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-17\">The Court: That you said you had an emergent matter and you would be here at two o\u2019clock. May I ask what the emergent matter was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-18\">Miss Clawans: No, I refuse to tell you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-19\">The Court: And at two o\u2019clock we called the ease and were told then by the Prosecutor you stopped down there at ten minutes to two and said you had an emergent matter but would be back at quarter past two. I found out that you were over at Judge Lindeman\u2019s. I called and you were there. Are these cases ready?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-20\">Miss Clawans: The only one that would be ready would be the Garfinkel case. The other ease I am not ready on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-21\">The Court: Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-22\">Miss Clawans: I am just not ready. That\u2019s all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-23\">The Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Miss Clawans: I have been sick, and these people have been trying to get me, and I haven\u2019t been able to physically handle it for them, but I am ready on the Garfinkel ease. And I am sick at this moment too.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">After adjourning Frazier\u2019s appeals to March 6, 1961 so that he might obtain another attorney, and assigning the Garfinkel case for immediate trial, Judge Waugh held Miss Clawans in contempt in the face of the court and fined her $100 \u201cfor your refusal to appear on time this morning, and because you will not tell me when I asked why you weren\u2019t here this morning.\u201d The certification and order for sentence filed by Judge Waugh the same day recites the further reason that when Miss Clawans advised she was ready to proceed with only one of her cases and was asked why she was not prepared as to the others, she declined to give any reason therefor and retorted, \u201cI am just not ready. That\u2019s all.\u201d The fine was paid under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The power of a court to punish summarily for contempt committed in the actual presence of the court has long been recognized. <em>R. R. </em>3:8-1 and 4:87-1, similar to <em>Rule </em>42(a) of the <em>Federal Rules of Criminal </em>Procedure, substantially restated the existing procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">\u201cA criminal contempt may be punished summarily if the judge certifies that he saw or heard the conduct constituting the contempt and that it was committed in the actual presence of the court. The order of contempt shall recite the facts and shall be signed by the judge and entered of record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">See also, <em>N. J. S. 2A</em>:10-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Summary convictions for contempt are reviewable on appeal both upon the law and the facts, the appellate court being directed to give such judgment \u201cas it shall deem to be lawful and just under all the circumstances of the case and shall enforce the same as it shall order.\u201d <em>R. R. </em>1:5-2, 2:5; see also <em>N. J. S. 2A</em>:10-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">The power summarily to punish contempts committed in the face of the court, \u201calthough arbitrary in its nature and liable to abuse, is absolutely essential to the protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>of the courts in the discharge of their functions.\u201d <em>Ex parte Terry, </em>128 <em>U. S. </em>289, 313, 9 <em>S. Ct. </em>77, 83, 32 <em>L. Ed. </em>405 (1888). To deny courts this \u201cright of self-preservation\u201d <em>(Marshall v. Gordon, </em>243 <em>U. S. </em>521, 544, 37 <em>S. Ct. </em>448, 61 <em>L. Ed. </em>881 (1917)) would, as was said in <em>Board of Health, Weehawken Tp. v. N. Y. Central R. R. Co., </em>10 <em>N. J. </em>284, 290 (1952), \u201clargely nullify their status and ability to function properly as an essential part of our judicial structure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Appellant does not dispute this inherent power to punish summarily for contempt in the face of the court, but claims that (1) she was deprived of due process under the United States Constitution and the Constitution and laws of the State of New Jersey; and (2) Judge Waugh violated the <em>Canons of Judicial Ethics, </em>particularly <em>Canons </em>3, 4, 11, 15 and 29, when he summarily adjudged her in contempt. Her arguments reduce themselves to a single contention: she was entitled to be judged by an impartial tribunal, and Judge Waugh was not and could not be impartial because of ill feeling which existed between them. In support of this claim, she recites the following, which she says may be \u201cgleaned\u201d from the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">1. Her belief that she had been unfairly discriminated against by Judge Waugh over a 13-year period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">2. Her belief that she had unfairly been prevented from appearing and testifying before the grand jury in connection with a pending indictment against her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">3. Her belief that she had been subjected to a form of conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">4. Her belief that she was unfairly forced into trials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">5. Her proceedings against Judge Waugh in 1950 when she sought his general disqualification as a judge in all future cases in which she appeared as attorney. The reference here is to <em>Clawans v. Waugh, </em>10 <em>N. J. Super. </em>605, an Essex County District Court case heard by a special tribunal which dismissed the challenge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">6. Her appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee in March 1956 to oppose Judge Waugh\u2019s reappointment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">Appellant argues that under the existing circumstances the proper procedure would have been to certify the matter to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>another judge for a full hearing under proper safeguards. Eailure to do so was prejudicial. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Appellant places heavy reliance on <em>Offutt v. United States, </em>348 <em>U. S. </em>11, <em>75 S. Ct. </em>11, 99 <em>L. Ed. </em>11 (1954). The case is not apposite. There judge and counsel engaged in continuous wrangling, marked by personal attacks and bitterness on both sides. The judge committed the attorney for criminal contempt in the face of the court. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded for a hearing before another judge. But see <em>Sacher v. United States, </em>343 <em>U. S. </em>1, <em>72 S. Ct. </em>451, 96 <em>L. Ed. 717 </em>(1952), rehearing denied 343 <em>U. S. </em>931, 72 <em>S. Ct. </em>756, 96 <em>L. Ed. </em>1341 (1952), referred to in <em>Offutt, </em>and Annotation, 64 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>600, 614-623 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The record does not bear out appellant\u2019s contention that counsel and the judge were personally embroiled with each other. Hone of the half-dozen reasons cited as indicating Judge Waugh\u2019s ill feeling toward Miss Clawans is supported by fact. At best, they indicate a unilateral ill feeling on <em>her </em>part toward the judge. Eour of them reflect no more than her beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Other cases cited by appellant for the proposition that she was entitled to be tried before an impartial .tribunal, have no pertinent application in the circumstances here under consideration. They dealt with criminal contempts not in the face of the court. Such cases are covered by <em>R. R. </em>3:8-2 and 4:87\u20142. See <em>Oscar Barnett Foundry Co. v. Crowe, </em>80 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>109 <em>(Ch. </em>1909), affirmed o. b. 80 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>258 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1912); <em>In re Verdon, </em>91 <em>N. J. L. </em>491 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1918); <em>Larken v. Local No. </em>560, <em>etc., </em>103 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>195 <em>(Ch. </em>1928); <em>Van Sweringen v. Van Sweringen, </em>22 <em>N. J. </em>440 (1956), reversing 34 <em>N. J. Super. </em>394 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955). See also, <em>State v. Muraski, </em>6 <em>N. J. Super. </em>36 <em>(App. Div. </em>1949); <em>Swanson v. Swanson, </em>10 <em>N. J. Super. </em>513 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960); <em>State v. Deutsch, </em>34 <em>N. J. </em>190 (1961), cited by appellant. The court\u2019s reasoning in those cases cannot be applied in the present instance since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>the situation before us is <em>sui generis: </em>the case is tried summarily by the judge in whose presence the offense was committed, and this is in strict conformity with our requirements of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The proceedings of December 5, 1960 demonstrate the remarkable patience and restraint shown by Judge Waugh. Considering the charges leveled at him by appellant at the time, and the fact that numerous persons were within hearing, there was no path open to him except to exercise his summary power. The office, if not the man himself, deserved more respect than was shown by Miss Clawans\u2019 intemperate comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\"> The February 1961 offense also constituted a direct contempt. Miss Clawans\u2019 failure to appear at 10 a. m. to answer the call, or at the adjourned hour of <em>2 </em>p. m., and her flat refusal to give the court any explanation for her tardiness or for not being ready to proceed with the Frazier cases, constituted contempt in the face of the court. See 59 A. <em>L. R. </em>1272 (1929). In <em>State v. Zarafu, </em>35 <em>N. J. Super. </em>177, 180 (1955), we pointed out that our cases have uniformly held that any act or conduct which obstructs or tends to obstruct the course of justice, constitutes a contempt. <em>In re Caruba, </em>139 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>404 <em>(Ch. </em>1947), affirmed 140 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>563 <em>(E. &amp; </em>A. 1947); <em>certiorari </em>denied 335 <em>U. S. </em>846, 69 <em>S. Ct. </em>69, 93 <em>L. Ed. </em>396 (1948); and see <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:10-1(a) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Appellant pursued a course of contumacious conduct which invited the summary treatment finally visited upon her. We find no denial of due process nor any trespass upon the <em>Canons of Judicial Ethics.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
