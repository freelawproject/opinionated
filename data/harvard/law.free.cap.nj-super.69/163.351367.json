The jury returned a special verdict for plaintiff in the sum of $8,500, and the trial judge credited defendant with 50% of that sum, representing the <em>fro rata </em>share of Hartgrove (the joint tortfeasor who actually inflicted the injuries), pursuant to the Joint Tortfeasors Contribution Law, <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:53A-1 <em>et seq. </em>The accordant $4,250 judgment was then entered. Plaintiff cross-appeals from that part of the judgment crediting defendant with a 50% <em>fro rata </em>share and contends that defendant is liable for $6,000. This is the difference between the $8,500 verdict and $2,500 which, it was established at the trial, plaintiff received by way of settlement from Hartgrove, the joint tortfeasor. Plaintiff\u2019s argument is that defendant made no claim for contribution against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Hartgrove, and so was entitled to an allowance of only the amount Hartgrove paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The trial court\u2019s granting of a 50% credit was clearly correct, since it followed the formula laid down by the Supreme Coitrt in <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Westfield, </em>17 <em>N. J. </em>67, 92-93 (1954). See also, <em>Oliver v. Russo, </em>29 <em>N. J. </em>418, 420 (1959); <em>Smootz v. Ienni, </em>37 <em>N. J. Super. </em>529 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1955). Plaintiff does not challenge the <em>Judson </em>formulation, but insists that it should not have been applied because defendant failed to assert a claim for contribution against Hartgrove. Plaintiff cites us to no authorities for this proposition, nor does he cite any section of the Joint Tortfeasors Contribution Act or of our rules of court which require defendant to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">We might note, incidentally, that the amount of plaintiff\u2019s settlement with Hartgrove did not come out until cross-examination of plaintiff at the trial, despite the fact that one of the interrogatories propounded to him by defendant, if fully answered, would have given defendant this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\"> Defendant\u2019s point on the main appeal is that plaintiff\u2019s proofs did not present a 'jury question. The proofs touching defendant\u2019s alleged negligence were in clear conflict. The trial judge properly submitted to the jury the determination of the fact issues relating to the conduct of the parties, and whether such conduct under the existing circumstances created an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of harm to plaintiff. See <em>Reilly v. </em>180 <em>Club, Inc., </em>14 <em>N. J. Super. </em>420, 424 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951). In appraising the validity of a ruling on a motion for judgment, all of plaintiff\u2019s evidence must be taken as true and he must be given the benefit of all reasonable inferences to bo drawn therefrom. If reasonable men could differ as to whether negligence had been shown, the case should be submitted to the jury for determination. <em>Cafone v. Spiniello Construction Co., </em>42 <em>N. J. Super. </em>590, 598-599 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
