A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A9N\">Petitioner Clinton Dixon obtained a workmen\u2019s compensation award, which was affirmed by the County Court. The employer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Petitioner was employed by the respondent as a helper on trucks delivering coal, and for general work in respondent\u2019s coal yard. Part of his duties included the loading of trucks. This (his brief says and respondent denies) was done <em>\u201cby </em>standing in the body of the truck next to the bin overhead where the coal was stored, and then pulling the lever which would release the coal through a chute some 10 or 12 feet above the floor of the truck * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Stated succinctly, petitioner\u2019s claim is that he developed an \u201cincipient\u201d ingrown toenail on the large toe of the left foot some time in January 1958; coal from the chute struck the \u201csoft\u201d toe of his work shoe (an alleged sample of his shoe was introduced in evidence); this exerted pressure on the toenail sufficient to cause the nail to make a microscopic puncture in the skin of \u201cthe nail groove * * * of the great toe\u201d; staphylococcus entered through the puncture, causing infection; this in turn caused gangrene, which necessitated amputation of the leg in November 1958. The employer, on the other hand, contends that there was no such \u201caccident\u201d or injury, and that the gangrene was merely the end result of petitioner\u2019s admittedly far advanced arteriosclerosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">The petitioner described the manner in which he claimed the coal struck his foot as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-12\">\u201cQ. Well, do you stand on any part of the truck when you pull the lever? A. Xou stand in the truck body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Q. That is lower than if you were standing on the edge of the truck? A. Yes, way lower.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">Q. Now, you say that the chute opening was about four feet over your bead. Is that right? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">Q. The chute opening. A. Yes, where the coal came out of the wall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">Q. And do you stand under the chute? A. Oh, no. Oh, no. I don\u2019t stand under the chute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">Q. The coal does not come down and hit you on the head, does it? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">Q. It doesn\u2019t hit you on the face? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">Q. It doesn\u2019t hit you on the shoulders? A. Sometimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-11\">Q. On the shoulders? A. Sometimes, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-12\">Q. On your arms? A. Oh, yes, sometimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-13\">Q. On your chest? A. No, it don\u2019t come there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-14\">Q. On your back? A. No. You pull like that. It comes down, bounces all over your arm, down on your feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-15\">Q. Ever hit the back of your feet? A. No. It hit the front.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-16\">Q. Ever hit the front of the right foot? A. It hit both of them, but this is the nearest one to it. I am left-handed. When I stand, I have to stand to that side. It goes right down on my foot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-17\">Q. Ever hit your left shoulder? A. Oh, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-18\">* * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-19\">Q. How long would it take to load a truck from the chute? A. Well, according how much you are going to put in the truck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-20\">Q. Well, how much do you usually put in it? A. Some four tons, three tons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-21\">Q. How long would it take to load four tons from the chute? A. I can load it in about six or seven minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-22\">Q. Six or seven minutes? A. That\u2019s right. That is four tons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-23\">The employer\u2019s witnesses testified that one who opened the chute would not and could not stand in the bed of the truck, for he would then be unable to reach the chute; he would have to stand on the side wall of the truck, and there he would not be struck by coal.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-24\">The largest size coal loaded was \u201cstove,\u201d but petitioner admits that smaller sizes were handled. The employer\u2019s office manager, Miss Walley, testified that most of the coal was \u201cnut.\u201d We examined the shoe which petitioner introduced in evidence. Petitioner doubtless wore socks as well, especially since the accident allegedly happened in January. Obviously very little of the coal which came from the chute could have struck petitioner\u2019s shoe. We found it difficult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>to comprehend how coal, falling as described by petitioner, conld have delivered a blow or exerted pressure through the shoe and the sock sufficiently strong to force the toenail into the skin and cause a puncture. However, since the Division and the County Court had ruled in favor of petitioner, we examined and re-examined the evidence with great care to determine whether any reasonable basis for affirming existed. We find that, even after giving due regard to all of the consequences flowing from the fact that the Deputy saw and heard the witnesses, we are unable to accept petitioner\u2019s uncorroborated testimony that he suffered the \u201caccident\u201d which he described. We find further that, even if the coal did strike his foot, it was not the cause of the gangrene or of the amputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Petitioner testified that he first felt pain when coal fell on his shoe in January 1958. He asserted that he had loaded coal in the same fashion for 15 years without pain. It is the employer\u2019s position that if contact of coal with the shoe did then cause pain it was because Dixon\u2019s toe had become sensitive due to the advance of his arteriosclerosis, and the pain was not indicative of a substantial blow or pressure. Respondent\u2019s doctors described the possible pain from peripheral arteriosclerosis as exquisite and ex-crutiating.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Petitioner admits that he continued to work without seeking medical attention until February 21. There is no testimony that during that period he did anything to protect his feet from falling coal, or to change his shoes. On February 21 he went to Dr. Davis, a chiropodist. He claimed that before he went to Dr. Davis he told Miss Walley that he \u201chad to go to the doctor because my toe was sore from the coal falling on it.\u201d Petitioner admitted that he mentioned this to Miss Walley only once. There is no evidence that petitioner ever asked the employer for treatment before he went to Doctors Davis, Zingler or Greenfield, or that he asked to be given other duties or to be otherwise protected from the falling coal.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Miss Walley denied he ever said anything to her about falling coal. She testified that \u201cHe came in one morning * * * he just mentioned that he had an ingrown toenail and it was giving him a lot of trouble and he thought he was going to go to the doctor about it.\u201d She testified that on a later date petitioner \u201csaid that he had been to the doctor and that the doctor removed his toenail and it was giving him a great deal of pain, and he also mentioned that he was not going back to that doctor, he was going to some other doctor.\u201d This, as we shall see, coincides with an important part of Dr. Davis\u2019 testimony. Dr. Davis testified for petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Petitioner testified that when he \u201cfirst felt pain\u201d he looked at his toe and saw it was \u201cbruised,\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s why I went to the doctor with it.\u201d However, Dr. Davis\u2019 testimony was to the contrary. The doctor was emphatic that Dixon complained \u201che had an ingrown nail.\u201d. Deferring to his record, Dr. Davis testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">\u201cQ. In answer to this question \u2018Nature of complaint\u2019 there is something in quotes that I can\u2019t make out. What is that? A. That says ingrown nail. It is in quotes simply because it is what he said. This is what the patient said. This was not my finding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Dr. Davis himself diagnosed it as \u201ca condition that was approaching the point where it would become an ingrown toenail.\u201d He said \u201cThe ingrown nail itself would be constituted by having the nail penetrate the flesh. In this case the nail had not penetrated the flesh. <em>It was more or less pressure along the nail groove </em>* * *\u201d (Emphasis added.) To relieve this pressure he \u201cpacked\u201d the nail. The packing, he said, \u201cacts as a slide, the nail sliding over the packing,\u201d to prevent its penetrating the flesh.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">On the two occasions Dr. Davis saw Dixon (February 21 and 24) he saw no infection and only a \u201cvery slight redness,\u201d but more pain than he expected from the \u201cincipient\u201d ingrown nail. Petitioner\u2019s own Dr. Greenfield admitted the redness could have been caused by the arteriosclerosis. Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Davis\u2019 observation of unusual pain in the absence of infection supported the opinion of the employer\u2019s medical experts that petitioner\u2019s condition was due to the arteriosclerosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">However, Dr. Davis claimed he remembered (although it was not noted in his records) that Dixon told him \u201cthis pressure * * * [along the nail groove] was due to the fact that coal was beating down on his toe.\u201d He added \u201cThis may have been. I cannot attest to that. But it is the same picture that you would get from having the nail pressed along the nail groove.\u201d It is difficult to determine just what Dr. Davis meant by that. He could not have meant the <em>temporary </em>pressure of the coal caused the permanent pressure which he saw, and which he relieved by packing. At most, it would appear he meant that an object falling on the toe would momentarily exert the same pressure that the nail was constantly exerting when he saw it on the 21st. In any event it is, to say the least, odd that the doctor would note in his records the petitioner\u2019s own diagnosis of \u201cingrown toenail\u201d\u2014a diagnosis with which he did not agree and which could be of no aid or importance to him in his treatment\u2014and yet would fail to note, if Dixon had said it, that \u201cthis pressure * * * was due to the fact that coal was beating down on his toe.\u201d Eurthermore, taken literally, this was a medical judgment which Dixon could not have uttered, since he was not competent to form it. On the other hand, if it was a conclusion that Davis had formed on the basis of a history given him by Dixon, why was there not that history, or at least some reference to falling coal, in the doctor\u2019s record? More important, why is it that he did not direct Dixon to avoid falling coal, or to protect his toe from it with heavier shoes or socks, or by bandaging or otherwise? Admittedly, he gave no such instructions, even though he gave Dixon specific instructions to avoid coal <em>dust. </em>Eor example, he told him to wear \u201can extra pair of socks, if necessary, to keep the dust away from the skin.\u201d The witnesses Wade and McIntyre, repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>sentatives of the employer\u2019s insurance company, testified that, when they interviewed Dr. Davis, he gave them no history of falling coal.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Petitioner testified his toe still pained him after Dr. Davis\u2019 treatments but that he continued to work with the coal hitting his feet as before until \u201cMarch or April\u201d when the company went out of business. Eespondent\u2019s proofs were that petitioner\u2019s employment ended February 28. Whatever the period of employment, not only was there no proof that petitioner did anything to protect his foot but, on the contrary, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">\u201cQ. Did you do anything yourself about the shoes you were wearing? A. Yes, I did. I split the top of my shoe. I split it up so T could get my foot in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">Q Did you go back to work? <em>A. </em>Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">Q. Did you go back to unloading\u2014to loading tire truck with coal? <em>A. </em>Oh, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">The Deputy Director: Load?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-10\">The Witness: Load and unload.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-11\">Q. And you loaded the same way you described earlier? A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-12\">Q. And was the coal beating on this sore toe? A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-13\">Q. Now, referring to P-1 for identification, Mr. Dixon, can you demonstrate to us where you cut this shoe? A. Well, I just cut the shoe here (indicating). I made a cut.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-14\">The Deputy Director: Let Mr. Phares see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-15\">Mr. Klaessig: Indicating the right side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-16\">The Witness: I cut this here, and I cut this side down like that, to kind of give it a \u2018V\u2019, so this would have a cover over the toe. It would not be exactly open on top of the toe. So I just cut it this way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-17\">Mr. Klaessig: I still don\u2019t understand. Do you, Mr. Phares?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-18\">Mr. Phares: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-19\">The Witness: Well, I will show you. See this is my toe. I split it, cut down like that, to here. Well, that loosens this top up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-20\">Mr. Klaessig: I see. So that would be loose. That would relieve pressure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-21\">The Witness: Relieve pressure on top of the toe. But this part of leather would rest on top.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-22\">If it were tlie coal that was hurting him, as he said, we find it incomprehensible that Dixon would not only take no steps to avoid the infliction of that pain in some fashion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>but would, on the contrary, cut open the shoe! The normal human reaction, even without medical advice, would be to cover and protect the toe, and since it did not happen here, it casts great doubt upon whether coal was the cause of the pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Eor about five weeks after his last visit to Dr. Davis on February 24, Dixon had no medical attention. Then, on April 3, he went to Dr. Zingler, another chiropodist. Dr. Zingler found that the toenail <em>was </em>then ingrown and the toe <em>was </em>infected. Since the toenail was not ingrown when Dr. Davis saw Dixon, and the toe not infected, the toenail must have become ingrown and the toe infected during the five weeks <em>after </em>February 24. This is significant, because petitioner\u2019s own Dr. Yaguda testified that while \u201cthe falling of any object\u201d on an \u201cincipient\u201d ingrown toenail with sufficient force to \u201cimpress it into the flesh underneath it might produce the microscopic break that would introduce the infection,\u201d an actual ingrown toenail, such as Dr. Zingler found, could itself introduce infection.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Dr. Zingler had no record or recollection of any mention of falling coal. On the contrary, he found Dixon\u2019s shoes too short, and he found no bruise. He treated Dixon a number of times and saw him for the last time on April 28. He was not asked his opinion as to the cause of petitioner\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Again Dixon went without medical attention for a long time\u2014April 28 to July 1, when he first saw Dr. Greenfield. Dixon did not give Dr. Greenfield a history of falling coal. Dr. Greenfield apparently did not find anything that urgently needed attention, as, for example, the degree of infection one would expect to find if, as Dr. Yaguda said, staphylococcus had entered the toe prior to February 21, when Dixon first saw Dr. Davis. On the contrary, Dr. Greenfield told Dixon to come back in 6 weeks\u2014on August 12. On that date Dr. Greenfield advised Dixon to enter the hospital, which he did on September 3 with an admitting diagnosis of gangrene. He did not respond to conservative measures, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>and on November 7, 1958 his leg was amputated by Dr. Webb. This was about 10 months after the alleged \u201caccident\u201d in January 1958 and almost nine months after Dixon\u2019s first visit to Dr. Davis, when, according to Yaguda\u2019s assumption, the infection had already set in.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In a hypothetical question Dr. Greenfield was asked by counsel for petitioner to assume that \u201clarge masses of coal of various sizes\u201d fell on Dixon\u2019s toe. There was no such testimony. Indeed, Miss Walley testified that respondent corporation was dissolved in September 1957 and made its last delivery of coal in October 1957. It then made arrangements with Bouknight, one of its former employees, to get rid of the balance of the coal in the hoppers and lying about the yard. In anticipation of dissolution, respondent had stopped purchasing coal some time before September 1957. During January and February the total sales of coal amounted to 105 tons, mostly nut.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Dr. Greenfield testified that in his opinion the blow of. the coal \u201cstarted off the infection and caused deterioration of the tissue and the other conditions * * * and ultimate amputation.\u201d He gave as the \u201cone big reason\u201d for this opinion \u201cthe fact that his arterial tests at the hospital showed that there was no real occlusion of his blood supply to his big toe.\u201d Dr. Greenfield is a general practitioner. Dr1, Webb, the surgeon who amputated the leg, and Dr. Deibert* a specialist in surgery with 40 years experience in treating* operating and teaching in the field of hypertensive arterial vascular disease, said (as we shall see) that there definitely was occlusion. Furthermore, on cross-examination, Dr. Greenfield gave this testimony, which we find quite remarkable :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">\u2018\u2022Q. * * * will you tell me when did the coal fall on his foot? A. T don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-10\">Q. Would it make any difference when it fell on his foot, having in mind that he was in the hospital in November of 1958? A. Yes, it would make a difference\u2014the time element.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-11\">Q. Now, what kind of coal fell on his foot? A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Q. Would that make a difference? A. I imagine the size of the coal and the height which it fell would make a difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\">Q. The height from which it fell? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">Q. And the quantity of it that fell? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">Q. You don\u2019t know any of these things? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">The Deputy Director: You say it would make a difference, Doctor. What difference?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">The Witness: Well, the size of the coal to me would be how much injury a man would get from a small lump or a big lump, and the distance it fell, depending how much damage it would do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">The Deputy Director: Would it make a difference in your opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-10\">The Witness: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-11\">The Deputy Director: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-12\">Q. It would not make any difference in your opinion? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-13\">Q. You mean if coal fell on Mr. Dixon\u2019s foot five years before November of 1958, that you would still say that his amputation was related to that coal falling on his foot five years ago? A. I thought we are talking about the size of the coal and the distance it fell, not the time element.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-14\">Q. The time element would make a difference? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-15\">Q. And you say the size of the coal would not make a difference? A. It would make a difference, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-16\">Q. As to your opinion of causal relationship? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-17\">Q. It would not make a difference? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-18\">Q. Do you know what rice coal is, Doctor? A. What what is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-19\">Q. Do you know what rice coal is? A. Never heard of rice coal, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-20\">Q. Well, it is coal about the size of a grain of rice. Do you think that would cause this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-21\">A. Yes, I feel it could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-22\">Q. It could? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-23\">Q. Well, how much rice coal would have to fall on his foot for you to say that in your opinion as a doctor that was the causative factor in this case? A. I suppose a pailful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-26\">Q. A pailful? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-27\">Q. You mean in the pail? A. Or out of the pail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-28\">Q. You mean just pouring a pailful out on your foot? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-29\">Q. With the shoe on? A. I think it is possible, depending on the height it was falling from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-31\">Q. Well, how high are you assuming that this coal fell from? A. Maybe four or five feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-32\">Q. Where did you get that? A. You are asking me to assume.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-33\">Q. I am not asking you to assume anything, Doctor. You were given a question with facts that you were asked to assume. Now, you are saying maybe four or five feet. I want to know where you got four or five feet. A. I am judging that probably from the height of the chute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Q. Did you see the chute? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-4\"><em>Q. Was </em>anything told you in the question about the chute? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">Q. What are you doing\u2014guessing? A. 1 like to have you proceed with the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">Q. My question right now, Doctor, is: Are you guessing? A. Yes, I am guessing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">On cross-examination Dr. Greenfield admitted that Dixon\u2019s hypertension and arteriosclerosis could have created internal pressure in the toe and caused it to swell and \u201cthat in itself, causing the toe to swell, would create pressure between the too and the shoe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">It then developed that Dr. Greenfield had with him, when he testified on direct examination, a summary of the testimony of Dr. Yaguda and the other witnesses who had testified two weeks earlier. The cross-examination as to this paper was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-10\">\u201cQ. And reading this typewritten paper here, it says\u2014I am quoting from it: \u2018Patient had never had complaint of pain in big toe before January or February 1958, and the continuity of a complaint of pain after trauma from that date, with infection increasing, makes the bruising of the toe by coal the most probable source of the infection.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-11\">That was given to you by the lawyer in this case, wasn\u2019t it? A. That was sent to me, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-12\">Q. And that was the language you used in your testimony here, \u2018the most probable source of the infection,\u2019 wasn\u2019t it? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">Petitioner\u2019s counsel said this was a summary of Dr. Yagnda\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">Dr. Yaguda was petitioner\u2019s principal medical witness on causation. In spite of Dr. Davis\u2019 testimony that there was no infection when he saw Dixon, Dr. Yaguda testified that the slight redness which Dr. Davis saw indicated infection. \u201cPain and redness are two of the cardinal symptoms of inflammation, and with the two of them there, even though there was no swelling, and we don\u2019t know whether there was any increased heat, it is reasonable to assume that at that time even there had already been infection in the toe.\u201d We pause to point out that if pain is evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>of infection, then if the coal fell and caused pain in January the infection must have existed in the toe already, or the blow from the coal was so powerful as to cause pain through shoe and sock.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The assumption of infection was the sole support of Dr. Yaguda\u2019s opinion that the falling coal was responsible for the amputation. We find no basis in the evidence for this assumption. As we have said, petitioner\u2019s Dr. Davis said there was no infection; petitioner\u2019s Dr. Greenfield admitted that the redness could have been due to the arteriosclerosis; and respondent\u2019s doctors, including the surgeon who amputated the leg, were certain the redness was due to arteriosclerosis. ETo one other than Dr. Yaguda testified to the infection assumed by him, nor did anyone give any evidence which justified such an assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">We give way to the Deputy\u2019s finding of credibility, where he makes such findings. See Sahm, \u201cDemeanor Evidence,\u201d 47 <em>A. B. A. J. </em>580 (June 1961). Here the Deputy made no express findings as to Dr. Yaguda\u2019s credibility. On the contrary he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">\u201cOne thing must be said for Dr. Yaguda: No matter which side he may be on, he is always quite positive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">This is not praise of the credibility of a medical witness. Yet, in the case at bar, Dr. Yaguda had in fact stated his conclusion of causation in this rather equivocal fashion, quite odd for an experienced witness who gave the impression which the Deputy noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">\u201cQ. And can you state, Doctor, with reasonable medical certainty, that this infection probably originated from this trauma assumed in the hypothetical question? A. Yes. I believe that, seeing that this is a competent producing cause and that it does occur, I think that it would be very difficult to exclude this as the cause of the infection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">However he was positive that \u201cthere was no obliteration [of the blood vessels], there was no thrombosis or blockage of the vessels to produce the gangrene and there was definite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>evidence of infection which produced the gangrene. There was no occlusion there that was shown by the arteriogram taken at the hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Dr. Webb, the surgeon who amputated the leg, said that Dixon had far advanced peripheral arteriosclerosis; \u201cthe ultimate result of this disease is gangrene * * * with loss of extremities * * *\u201d He was certain that neither trauma nor infection had anything to do with the amputation because if there had been trauma or infection in January the gangrene would have developed in a matter of days or weeks. Furthermore, infection would have caused \u201cwet\u201d gangrene, which Dixon did not have. Dr. Webb said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">\u201cA. * * * you have what we call or what is known medically as dry gangrene. In the presence of bad infection it becomes what is known as wet gangrene. This is a much more serious situation, that is, the patient becomes quite toxic and, as I say, more serious. Therefore, in any gangrenous extremity we do not like to see infection get a good foothold. As 1 remember Mr. Dixon\u2019s situation, I wasn\u2019t worried about wet gangrene; I was worried about how much dry gangrene he had, which is basically arteriosclerotic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">On cross-examination he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-11\">\u201cQ. Why can\u2019t that infection last for nine months? A. Because in the presence of arteriosclerosis to the extent this petitioner unfortunately has it, it would not last nine months; he would have been in trouble long before nine months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">Kespondent\u2019s Dr. Irwin E. Deibert testified that he specialized in surgery and was a member of the Board of Examiners of the American Board of Surgery. He was on the faculty of the School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, consultant surgeon to various hospitals, and past president of the Society of Surgeons of New Jersey. He had had 40 years experience with conditions such as Dixon\u2019s \u201cin treating, operating and teaching.\u201d He testified that the trauma in January could not be related to the amputation in November; that \u201cpain out of all proportion * * * is one of the classical symptoms of peripheral vascular disease; * * * infection results sooner or later in all instances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>where tissues break down due to poor circulation,\u201d and whatever infection existed here was due to the progress of the disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">The opinion of Dr. Yaguda that there was no occlusion was based on the hospital X-Ray report which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">\u201cFemoral arteriographic study of this patient on the left side shows the femoral artery is well visualized. There appears to he some dilation in it\u2019s upper end and poor filling at it\u2019s distal end with some irregularity suggesting the presence of atheromatous changes. No definite evidence of obstruction can be demonstrated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Dr. Deibert testified that \u201cdilation at its upper end and poor filling at its distal end * * * means that circulation is bad from that point on down.\u201d The femoral artery is the major artery in the lower extremity. Both Dr. Webb and Dr. Deibert testified that in this disease the smaller arteries would occlude prior to the femoral artery. Dr. Deibert said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\">\u201cQ. * * * You do not know whether or not in the left toe there was any occlusion of the blood vessels, do you, sufficient to cause the spontaneous origin of this condition found in the left toe? A. Yes, I do. There would have to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-10\">Q. Why would there have to be? A. You couldn\u2019t have this condition otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">Dr. Webb testified, under cross-examination, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-12\">\u201cQ. In this x-ray of the vascular system, reading the last sentence of it, \u2018No definite evidence of obstruction could be demonstrated.\u2019 You do know from the information that there was no obstruction of any important vessel, did you? A. Indeed we did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-13\">Q. Where would that be indicated? A. The arteriogram. That report, for instance, indicates that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-14\">Q. Which one are you talking about? A. The one you are reading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-15\">Q. That is September 22, 1958? A. That\u2019s right. That indicates the state of the femoral artery. This is the main artery coming down into the lower extremity. This indicated a partial, certainly obstruction to flow, and the important thing in the interpretation of that is what goes beyond, what is the state of the vessel below the knee. This simply gives you a picture of the artery confined to the knee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Q. Yes. <em>A. jAow, </em>we have clinical evidence by physical examination that the circulation is insufficient below the knee. As I recall, and if I could get the time to look through the record, I could probably pick it up specifically. But as I recall, there was absence in pulsation of the posterior tibial artery and the dorsalis pedis artery and T believe the popliteal. And this indicates an obstruction at that level, which is lower. And this is quite typical of a patient with arteriosclerosis. You don\u2019t get a blocking off of a major vessel in the thigh until a later stage of the disease. It does happen, but as the disease progresses it usually moves away listally from a proximal position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">Q. This notation of \u2018no obstruction can be demonstrated\u2019 is a pretty good index of the general system in the nature of obstruction to the total limb, left foot, left leg? A. Definitely not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-6\">Q. Your statement is, then, it is only an entry significant for future treatment? A. It is only an entry of circulation in the thigh. It has nothing to do with the circulation below the knee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">!STo purpose would be served by analyzing any more of the over 200 pages of testimony. Suffice it to say that on the basis of all of it we find that the petitioner has failed to sustain his burden to prove that the amputation was due to an \u201caccident\u201d which arose out of his employment. The judgment in favor of petitioner is therefore reversed and judgment is entered for respondent.

I recognize that this court must weigh the evidence and determine whether petitioner has sustained the burden of proof and I must concede that there are weaknesses in petitioner\u2019s case. However, in weighing the petitioner\u2019s proofs as against the employer\u2019s proofs, \u201cthere must be thrown into the scales the general tendency of the law to apply the Compensation Act in the employee\u2019s favor when in doubt.\u201d <em>Aromando v.
