WALTER S. NERWINSKI, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b255-8\">Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b255-9\">Argued September 25, 1961</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AK0\">Decided October 5, 1961.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b256-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Before Judges Price, Sullivan and Leonard.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-7\"><em>Mr. Peter </em>Murray, Assistant Prosecutor, argued the cause for respondent <em>(Mr. Brendan T. </em>Byrne, County Prosecutor of Essex County, attorney; <em>Mr. Maurice J. McKeown, </em>Assistant Prosecutor, of counsel on the brief).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-8\"><em>Mr. Howard G. Wachenfeld </em>argued the cause for appellant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b256-10\">Sullivan, J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AY\">Defendant was convicted of carrying a rifle concealed on or about his person, contrary to the provisions of <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:151-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">At defendant\u2019s trial, which was by jury, the State produced proof that defendant was apprehended on Halsey Street, Newark, while carrying a loaded rifle under the topcoat which he was wearing. Defendant, testifying in his own behalf, admitted carrying the rifle, but denied that it was under his coat and, on the contrary, claimed that it was in clear and open view. The jury returned a verdict of \u201cGuilty as Charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">Defendant\u2019s explanation of the circumstances surrounding his carrying of the rifle is not material to the present appeal which is limited to defendant\u2019s contention that the weapon he was carrying at the time of his arrest is not encompassed by the concealed weapons statute <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:151-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">It has been stipulated for the purpose of this appeal that the rifle carried by defendant at the time of his arrest was a .22 caliber rifle 40 inches in length.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>In order to understand defendant\u2019s legal argument it is necessary to set forth the pertinent provisions of <em>Title </em>2A, <em>chapter </em>351, <em>section </em>41, which defendant was convicted of violating, and also the definition of \"pistol\u201d and \"revolver\u201d as set forth in <em>section </em>1 of the same title and chapter.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">\u201c2A:15f-41. Carrying concealed weapons; penalty; license to carry pistol or revolver</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">Except as hereinafter provided, any person who carries * * * concealed on or about his clothes or person, or otherwise concealed in his possession:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">a. A pistol, revolver or other firearm without first having obtained a permit to carry the same in accordance with the provisions of this chapter; * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">sfc sfc &gt;;? s-: jfc #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">Is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-11\">\u201c2A:151\u20141. \u2018Pistol\u2019 and \u2018revolver\u2019 defined</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-12\">The words \u2018pistol\u2019 or \u2018revolver\u2019 as used in this chapter include a shotgun, rifle or other firearm with over-all length less than 26 inches.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">It is defendant\u2019s contention that the phrase \"or other firearm\u201d used in <em>section </em>41, since it follows the words \"pistol\u201d and \"revolver,\u201d should be given a restricted meaning limited to firearms similar in nature to those particularly enumerated. Since \u201cpistol\u201d and \"revolver\u201d are defined in <em>section </em>1 to include a rifle or other firearm with over-all length less than 26 inches, defendant argues that the mandate in <em>section </em>41 against carrying a firearm only applies to a firearm less than 26 inches in over-all length.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-14\">Defendant\u2019s argument is without merit. The rifle he was carrying was unquestionably a firearm. It would be unrealistic to hold that the Legislature, in enacting and revising the statutory provisions dealing with the carrying of concealed weapons, intended to prohibit only the carrying \"concealed\u201d of a firearm less than 26 inches in over-all length and to permit a person, as here, to carry a loaded rifle concealed under his topcoat. The sense of the statute is manifest. It clearly inhibits the carrying \u201cConcealed\u201d of any firearm. Defendant\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
