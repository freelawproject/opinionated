J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Abc\">In a workmen\u2019s compensation case petitioner seeks to reverse a judgment of the County Court, denying him compensation under <em>R. S. </em>34:15-7 <em>et seq., </em>and dismissing his petition. lie had been awarded temporary and partial permanent disability compensation against respondent by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Division on that tribunal\u2019s determination that he had suffered \u201can attack of cardiac insufficiency.\u201d Petitioner contends that the proofs justify a finding that he suffered \u201ca coronary incident causally related to strain and effort arising out of and in the course of his employment\u201d with respondent. The latter contends that the County Court, on appeal to it pursuant to <em>R. R. </em>5:2-5, properly dismissed the claim of petitioner because (a) petitioner failed to \u201cestablish by a preponderance of believable evidence\u201d that a heart attack, suffered by him at work, arose out of his emplojcment, and (b) the \u201cmedical proof offered by the petitioner failed to establish by a preponderance of probability that any employment connected effort either contributed to or caused his heart attack.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\"> This case, as do many of the compensation \u201cheart\u201d cases decided by this court and the Supreme Court, illustrates the necessity of recognizing the principle enunciated in the opinion of Mr. Justice Olipliant in <em>Mergel v. New Jersey </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number><em>Conveyors Corp., </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>609, 613.

It is to he noted that decisions in numerous compensation \u201cheart\u201d cases in this court, following the principles stated by the Supreme Court in <em>Ciuba v. Irvington Varnish &amp; Insulator Co., </em>27 <em>N. J. </em>127 (1958), have rested solely on the evaluation of the proofs adduced and have reemphasized the necessity of adhering with fidelity to the mandate pronounced in <em>Yeomans v. Jersey City, </em>27 <em>N. J. </em>496, 511 (1958), that we \u201cindependently weigh the evidence and determine whether the claimant has sustained the burden of proof.\u201d Furthermore, mindful of the opportunity afforded the judge in compensation to observe the appearance and demeanor of the witnesses, we are to give due regard to his advantage in judging their credibility and give \u201cfull and respectful consideration of the views expressed, on both fact and law,\u201d by the Division and the County Court. <em>Russo v.

J., </em>at <em>p. </em>509; <em>Ciuba, supra, </em>27 <em>N.

International Paper Co., supra, </em>24 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>235.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">In his petition filed approximately three months after February 5, 1958, the date on which he suffered the heart attack on which his compensation claim is based, petitioner, then 52 years of age, asserted that he suffered an \u201cinjured heart\u201d and \u201cstrained chest\u201d by reason of \u201cunusual work circumstances and conditions in trying to install pipe in outlet.\u201d He had been employed for approximately 35 years as a plumber, pipe fitter and steam fitter and had been in respondent\u2019s employ for about seven months prior to the aforesaid heart episode. As initially related by petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>on direct examination at the Division hearing, he was working for respondent on February 5, 1958 as a pipe fitter, \u201chooking up fin radiators\u201d on the first floor of an office building under construction at Newark; his hours were from 8 A. M. to 12 noon and, following \u201ca half hour for lunch,\u201d from 12:30 to 4:30. On the day in question, petitioner and another employee were \u201cworking on that floor.\u201d At the hearing before the judge in compensation petitioner gave the following further recital of the events upon which he based his claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-4\">\u201cQ. Tell tlie Court what you were doing? A. Well, after I had come baqk from lunch, I went back to my work to hook up the radiators; and in doing so, the connection that was coming up from the cellar, I had to make my connection from the cellar up to the radiator with a piece of pipe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">Q. How high was that? What was the distance? A. The distance was about a piece of pipe coming up from the basement to the radiator, about 27, 28 inches, somewheres around there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">Well, while bending over to see where the outlet was downstairs for me to be able to catch my pipe, as I couldn\u2019t see it because it was dark down in the basement, and many a times I had to go down into the basement to straighten out the outlet to catch the piece of pipe on the floor above, to be able to hook up the radiator, that I had done throughout the day\u2014throughout the morning many a times, going down in this dark area to straighten out my outlets. But at this time while bending over to see where the outlet\u2014whether it was coming up straight for me to be able to catch my pipe on the floor above, I felt\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">Q. What were you doing before you felt anything? Tell the court exactly what you had in your hands? A. A piece of pipe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">Q. Tell the Court what you were doing? A. I was hooking up the fin radiator. I was trying to hook up the radiator. I had a piece of pipe in my hands, and I couldn\u2019t see to catch the outlet downstairs. I had to go down to straighten out the outlet. . Coming back upstairs, I tried to catch the pipe to hook it up; and by doing so, I felt ill. My partner saw me. I fell over forward, he grabbed me and he pulled me back, and at that time I was\u2014I couldn\u2019t see or do anything whatsoever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Petitioner further stated that the pipe he was handling at the time of the episode was \u201c27 or 28 inches in length,\u201d three-quarters of an inch in diameter and weighed two pounds; that he was kneeling in a small, confined area and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>was sweating. He added: \u201cI felt that the strain was too much for me at the time, of running around so much, and in this confined area where I didn\u2019t have too much room to work in, that it was a strain on my nerves throughout.\u201d He stated: \u201cI had no spell except * * * at the moment * * * I was kneeling on my knees * * * trying to make that hookup, I felt the pressure, the sweat coming down from my body and losing my balance * * * I fell forward on my hands.\u201d He added: \u201cI did not faint\u201d and a co-worker \u201cnoticed the condition\u201d and \u201cpicked me up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A59\">Petitioner then related that the aforesaid co-worker helped him to a nearby construction shanty and from there he was taken to St. Michael\u2019s Hospital where he was confined for 17 days. While there he was under the care of Dr. Otto Brandman, then chief of service at that institution, and to whom reference is hereinafter made. After petitioner\u2019s discharge from the hospital he came under the care of his family physician, Dr. Benjamin Eosenberg, of Brooklyn, and so remained during the entire period of his convalescence. Petitioner received no medication after June 1958, and returned to work as a plumber the \u201clatter part of August\u201d of the same year. He has since continued working as a plumber and pipe fitter mainly on various construction jobs. In response to his counsel\u2019s interrogation, petitioner testified at the hearing in the Division on January 4, 1960 that he still had \u201cheadaches,\u201d had \u201ca double vision at times,\u201d suffered \u201cpain running down from the shoulders, * * * shortness of breath,\u201d requiring him to \u201crest for a few minutes until it passes away.\u201d He further testified that while under treatment by Dr. Eosenberg he was referred by the latter to Dr. Joseph Weinstein, a cardiologist of Brooklyn, who took electrocardiograms. On August 26, 1958 he was examined by Dr. Saul Lieb as a basis for the doctor\u2019s prospective appearance as a witness for petitioner at the Division hearing. Eeference to Dr. Lieb\u2019s testimony is hereinafter made.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>On cross-examination petitioner stated that over the aforesaid period of his employment by respondent he had been working as a \u201cpipe fitter\u201d for the \u201cheating\u201d and \u201cventilation\u201d of the building, installing the \u201crough work\u201d and later \u201chooking up\u201d the radiators, in which task he was engaged on the day in question. Describing the latter work performed by him on the morning of February 5, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\">\u201c* * * When I was working at that particular time I was working on the first floor to hook-up the radiators and I had to go down in the basement to straighten out the line so as I could catch my riser for the hook-up of the radiator. Going down in that basement a number of times throughout the morning in the darkness and up and down the ladder and straightening out my fittings below so as I could catch it below for the hooking up of the radiator because I had to catch it from the floor above\u2014\u2022* *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">In response to interrogation by respondent\u2019s counsel as to \u201chow long after lunch\u201d the heart episode occurred, petitioner testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">\u201cI had come back from lunch and started in to work on the radiators which I was doing at that particular time. While bending over for the hooking up in that spot which was so dark down below, looking down through the hole to see if my fitting is coming up to catch the piece of pipe for the hook-up, X fell over with a sweat on me and I had pain running down the side of my chest and my body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">Q. This period of 10 minutes after you came back from lunch when you broke out into a sweat and fell over, was the first indication that you had that anything was wrong? Did you have any complaints or trouble before that? A. No complaints whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">Q. Did you have any indication before you actually broke out into a sweat and fell over that you were getting sick or anything was wrong with you? A. No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">On further cross-examination petitioner testified that he had two sandwiches and two bottles of beer for lunch on the day in question and, on redirect examination, asserted that it was a \u201chalf hour to three-quarters of an hour after lunch\u201d before he experienced the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>In our assessment of the evidence in this case <em>we </em>observe initially that petitioner\u2019s own testimony was the sole factual evidence presented on his behalf. Although not a controlling factor, it is to be noted that because of contradictory statements in various portions of his testimony it is difficult to determine how soon after the lunch period petitioner claims the cardiac episode occurred\u2014whether ten minutes after his return from lunch, as might be inferred from his initial description of the attack, or a half to three-quarters of an hour thereafter, as he later asserted. It is also difficult to determine from his testimony whether, in connection with his work, he had made more than one trip to the basement after the lunch period and before the attack, or whether his alleged frequent use of the stairs between the first floor and basement, on which use he leans heavily in support of his claim of work-connected strain, was confined to the morning hours on the day in question. It is clear, however, that at the time of the attack petitioner was simply engaged in bending over a small hole trying to adjust a pipe connection between the first floor and basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Although many pages of the record and extensive arguments by counsel are devoted to comparing petitioner\u2019s work efforts before and after the lunch period as bearing on the issue whether the coronary episode was or was not work-connected, there is no doubt from the proofs that much of the work petitioner had done in the course of the particular construction job was far heavier and more arduous than the work involved in \u201chooking up\u201d the radiators. Our own review of the evidence also persuades us, as it did the County Court, that the work effort in which petitioner was actually engaged at the time of the coronary episode was of a slight nature when compared with his activity during the preceding months on the aforesaid construction job, and of minimal character when compared with the strenuous work which in his trade he had been accustomed to perform for over three decades. It was undisputed that petitioner had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>experienced no adverse physical reaction during his morning work on the day in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The County Court, relying in part on the principles enunciated in <em>Loew v. Borough of Union Beach, </em>56 <em>N. J. Super. </em>93, 106 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959), certification denied 31 <em>N. J. </em>75 (1959), held that, although by reason of <em>duba, supra, </em>27 <em>N. J. </em>127, \u201cthe petitioner no longer has the burden of proving that the coronary episode resulted from an unusual strain, it is of probative significance to ascertain whether what the petitioner \u00a3was doing at the time of the attack was something to which he was not accustomed or was of greater strain or burden than that to which he was accustomed.\u2019 \u201d The County Court noted that the diagnosis by Dr. Brandman was that petitioner suffered a \u201ccoronary insufficiency secondary to arteriosclerotic heart disease\u201d; that Dr. Lieb testified that although he had \u201cno evidence\u201d that Bayer \u201chad any particular disability\u201d therefrom it was \u201cvery likely\u201d that Bayer had \u201ccoronary sclerosis that a man in his early fifties may have\u201d; and that Dr. Sanford M. Lewis, appearing for respondent, had testified that petitioner suffered a \u201c* * * coronary insufficiency resulting from coronary heart disease or arteriosclerotic heart disease\u201d and that \u201cthis is a slow insidious process that goes on for many years\u201d and \u201cmay occur any time, anywhere, and it does.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The county judge stated that the \u201cfact that there was no clinical evidence of this pre-existing arteriosclerosis does not negate the opinions of all the experts who uniformly declared that such an infirmity existed.\u201d The court cited <em>Jacobs v. Kaplan, </em>56 <em>N. J. Super. </em>157 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959), to the effect that \u201ca claimant has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of probabilities that the work-effort preceding the occurrence or the failure entailed a stress or strain which was greater than the ordinary stresses and strains of living and so was an event or happening beyond the mere employment itself.\u201d Stating that petitioner \u201cwas not exerting himself at the time of the accident\u201d but \u201cwas merely manipulating a two pound pipe,\u201d the court, in view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>of all of the proofs adduced, hold that the attack was not work-connected.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We are in accord with the result reached by the County Court but are convinced that beyond the factual analysis made by it and apart from the asserted similarity (disputed by appellant) between the case at bar and <em>Loew, supra, </em>and <em>Jacobs, supra, </em>lies a much more significant factor. The instant case not only furnishes striking illustration of the imperative necessity of an exhaustive analysis of the proofs presented in each workmen\u2019s compensation case <em>(Yeomans, supra, </em>27 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>511), but, where revealed, the importance of assessing the significance of a petitioner\u2019s act in leaving crucial available evidence unpresented. In the case at bar not only do the proofs which petitioner elected to produce lack the persuasive quality to lead us to conclude, by a \u201cpreponderance of probabilities,\u201d that petitioner has shown that his employment was a contributing cause of his disability, but, in addition, and materially influencing our conclusion, is petitioner\u2019s failure (a) to present decisive evidence through the medium of testimony <em>on that issue </em>by petitioner\u2019s treating physicians, Doctors Brandman and Bosenberg, or to offer any explanation for its omission, and (b) to refrain from calling his co-worker to whom reference is hereinafter made.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">With this in mind we turn to a critical analysis of the medical proofs bearing on petitioner\u2019s contention that his heart attack was work-connected. Generally in cases of this type the most significant, dependable and informative medical proofs bearing on that issue come from the physician or physicians who attend a stricken person following his attack and who care for him during the ensuing critical days of treatment. In the instant case Dr. Brandman occupied such a relationship with petitioner. He was petitioner\u2019s treating physician at the hospital. Petitioner came under that doctor\u2019s specific care immediately following the attack and continued as his patient during the entire period of confinement at St. Michael\u2019s Hospital. It was Dr. Brand-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>man who authorized petitioner\u2019s discharge from that institution after the passage of 17 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Moreover, it is to be recognized that frequently the testimony of a family physician is of the utmost importance in litigation involving a petitioner\u2019s claim of an alleged work-connected accident. Indeed, the testimony of such family physician in a case of that type may, under certain circumstances, be pivotal. Particularly is this so when, as here, the family doctor is also a treating physician. As above noted, petitioner turned immediately to Dr. Rosenberg after being released from the hospital. He remained under that doctor\u2019s case during the entire period of convalescence. The fact that Dr. Rosenberg was the Bayer family doctor and also that petitioner sought and received medical care from him for the post-hospitalization period speaks eloquently of the faith petitioner had in his skill and ability. Moreover, it is reasonable to assume that such family doctor status gave Dr. Rosenberg added valuable knowledge as to petitioner\u2019s prior physical condition\u2014knowledge which the doctor could and undoubtedly did employ in the medical treatment of petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Despite the foregoing intimate professional relationship between the petitioner and Doctors Brandman and Rosenberg, the record is barren of any testimonial support from them that petitioner suffered a work-connected accident. Although Dr. Brandman was called by petitioner as a witness, the physician\u2019s testimony was in substance limited to a statement that the initial diagnosis of petitioner\u2019s condition on admission to the hospital was \u201cpossible coronary infarction,\u201d which, he said, \u201cwas subsequently changed to coronary insufficiency, secondary to arteriosclerotic heart disease.\u201d At no time during the course of Dr. Brandman\u2019s testimony did petitioner\u2019s counsel seek the doctor\u2019s opinion as to the claimed causal connection between petitioner\u2019s work and the attack for which petitioner seeks compensation benefits. Under the circumstances here present, such omission is of great significance. Possibly of even greater significance is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>fact that Dr. Rosenberg gave no testimony whatever. As a result, on the crucial issue of the instant case, we are deprived of the views of the two physicians most intimately connected with the petitioner\u2019s treatment, the two doctors whose testimony would be of the greatest aid in resolving that issue. Considering the vital role which they occupied, testimony from them might well have been conclusive on the sole issue presented\u2014the claim that petitioner\u2019s work induced or contributed to the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Urging that the differences between the case at bar and <em>Loew, supra, </em>and <em>Jacobs, supra, </em>support their contention that the County Court erred in deeming those cases controlling, petitioner contends that the decisions of this Court in <em>Joy v. Florence Pipe Foundry Co., </em>64 <em>N. J. Super. </em>13 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960), certification denied, 34 <em>N. J. </em>67 (1961); <em>Di Petrillo v. Borough of Leonia, </em>65 <em>N. J. Super. </em>336 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959); and <em>Burkley v. City of Atlantic City, </em>68 <em>N. J. Super. </em>160 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961), certification denied 36 <em>N. J. </em>130 (1961), justify recovery in the instant case. The opinions in the cases last above cited recognize the propriety of the basic legal principles enunciated in <em>Loew </em>and <em>Jacobs </em>but emphasize that the cases are factually inapposite. The necessity that each case be resolved on its own facts in the light of the pertinent legal principles, hereinabove recited, is implicit in the detailed analyses contained in <em>Joy, De Petrillo </em>and <em>Burkley, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">In the case at bar there exists the aforesaid important added element which, in our opinion, considered in conjunction with the proofs adduced, plays a vital role in resolving the issue of an alleged work-connected injury, <em>i. e., </em>the unexplained failure to present under oath the opinions of the aforesaid doctors who had the most intimate connection with the ease. Testimony by Dr. Lieb, who examined petitioner only once and then solely in preparation for Ms appearance as a witness in the latter\u2019s behalf, cannot be a satisfactory substitute for the views of Doctors Brandman and Rosenberg based on their, actual treatment of petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>In response to a long hypothetical question, which included a detailed recital of petitioner\u2019s description of his work, the frequent use of the stairs between the first floor and basement in connection with \u201chooking up the radiators,\u201d and which described the aforesaid collapse as having \u201coccurred at about 1:00 or 1:20 p. m. in the afternoon, shortly after the petitioner came back from lunch,\u201d Dr. Lieb expressed the opinion that there was a \u201ccausal relationship\u201d between the work Bayer did on February 5 and the attack of \u201cacute coronary insufficiency.\u201d He stated the resultant disability was \u201c20 per cent of total\u201d and when asked: \u201cIs that just for that episode or does that take in the entire cardiac condition,\u201d said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">\u201cIn my opinion they are the same. He may have had the usual amount of coronary sclerosis that a man in his early fifties may have, but I had no evidence he had any particular disability from it and I am estimating the disability as I found it for the residuals of an attack of an acute coronary insufficiency in which there is a certain amount of pre-existing sclerosis which was asymptomatic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Under cross-examination, in which Dr. Lieb was interrogated as to the extent of petitioner\u2019s disability prior to February 5, 1958 due to arteriosclerosis, he answered: \u201cWell, it would have to be speculative. I am assuming he had no disability based on the facts I have no evidence that he did have.\u201d He then amplified his statement under further interrogation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">\u201cQ. Was this arteriosclerosis affected in any way? A. Well; I have no evidence that it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">Q. What disability do you give for the arteriosclerosis at the present time? A. I don\u2019t give any disability for pre-existing arteriosclerosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">Q. No disability at all? A. Not unless I have evidence he had a disability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">Still later in the doctor\u2019s testimony he added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-11\">\u201cA. If the circumstances were such that he was working stooped over after lunch it would be significant because the type of lunch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>of two sandwiches and two bottles of beer\u2014any effort anyone does after a full meal. The digestion is a burden upon the coronary circulation. If everything were the same, the exertion that morning and this meal and then he was engaged in trying to connect the couplings 1 would say this could have done it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Pursuing the latter declaration, the record shows that petitioner\u2019s counsel, on redirect examination, further explored the subject with the following result:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">\u201cQ. Doctor, the testimony is that he was trying to get this pipe into this small aperture or hole and he was sweating in trying to do it and he met with the attack. Assuming he had this meal of the sandwiches and beer and that he was required to come back to work and assuming that all he did was to bend over to look and see what could be done, as to the manner in which the pipe could reach the coupling without having any pipe or coupling in his hand\u2014but in the act of bending over. Can you, with some reasonable degree of medical certainty, tell us whether or not, under those circumstances, the heart episode was precipitated, one, by the fact that he had the heavy lunch which added an extra burden on his heart and two, the other burden of bending over and trying to determine if he would catch the pipe and the coupling\u2014even with those facts, eliminating the other situation? A. X would say that if you would add this fact that he was trying to determine how to fit the coupling, which in my mind, is associated with some degree of emotional strain, and that this added factor of bending over and after a heavy meal and these circumstances were preceded by running up and down stairs and the other factors would be competent to produce an attack of an acute coronary insufficiency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">Q. Forgetting about what preceded the work and forgetting about the fact he was running up and down the stairs in the morning and forgetting about all of the undue effort he was performing in the morning, we are now dealing with a man who went out to lunch and had two sandwiches and two glasses of beer. You say that in and of itself puts a burden on the heart? With that fact coupled with the fact he had to go back to work and while he was bending over trying to determine how to catch the pipe and the coupling, in doing that act, can you, with some reasonable degree of certainty, piecing together the added burden on the heart by reason of the meal\u2014can you, with some reasonable degree of medical certainty, tell us whether or not, in your opinion, that was or it could have been the probably competent precipitating factor in producing the condition that you found? A. Well, in that case I couldn\u2019t be sure because the circumstances are not significant, enough to have an opinion with the same degree of certainty as knowing that the man had been doing the other work as described on that morning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>We then find that the question of the adverse physical effect of petitioner\u2019s aforesaid lunch loomed of still greater importance when on re-cross examination Dr. Lieb gave the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\">\u201cQ. Doctor, you say this lunch put a burden on his heart? A. This type of lunch. He had two sandwiches and two bottles of beer and shortly thereafter went to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">Q. Would this lunch be a sufficient burden to cause an insufficiency attack? A. I have no evidence that it was. I wouldn\u2019t know from just that one circumstance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">Q. How much of an extra burden do you need to cause a coronary insufficiency? A. Suppose we assume that in this particular case he had the two sandwiches and two bottles of beer and he blew up with a lot of gas and indigestion and there was nothing else to consider before this lunch and that might very well be the trigger mechanism.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The only further medical testimony presented by petitioner was that of Dr. Samuel L. Pollock, a neurologist, who had examined petitioner on October 4, 1958 and on December 19, 1959. These examinations also were in preparation for testimony at the Division hearing. He testified that petitioner had an \u201canxiety psychoneurosis with a cardiophobia; a fear of heart attack,\u201d and, in response to a hypothetical question, voiced the opinion that \u201cif the heart attack is compensable this anxiety is also compensable * <em>*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Dr. Lewis, who examined petitioner for respondent on July 14, 1958, stated that petitioner had given him a history that on February 5, 1958 he was pursuing \u201chis usual work. He had just returned from lunch * * *; he had a fairly substantial lunch, two meat sandwiches and three bottles of beer. Almost immediately after returning to the job he had to bend over in order to look through a hole in the floor\u201d when he \u201csuddenly felt a cold chill and lost his balance * * * felt sick and developed pain in the shoulders and chest.\u201d His diagnosis was that \u201cpetitioner suffered with arteriosclerotic heart disease and coronary insufficiency.\u201d In response to a hypothetical question he expressed the opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>that there was no connection between petitioner\u2019s work and his condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">We turn now to a consideration of the significance which may be attributed to petitioner\u2019s unexplained failure to call his co-worker as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">While under our decisional law there is no requirement that a petitioner produce corroborative evidence if his testimony be worthy of credence, the burden remains with him to establish by believable testimony that the facts justify a determination that he suffered a compensable injury. As above noted, petitioner relies on his own description of the alleged nature and extent of his activities on February 5, 1958, including a description of the work he was performing at the time of the attack, all of which he asserts subjected him to stress and strain. The question posed is whether the facts and circumstances incident to his work, considered with the nature of the attack he allegedly suffered, justify a recovery of compensation benefits. In attempting to justify his claim that he was engaged in intensive effort and working under particular strain, petitioner implies that on the day in question he was working alone at the time of the attack as well as prior thereto, instead of as a member of a two-man team which was the customary procedure followed in \u201chooking up\u201d radiators on the job. However, as above set forth, petitioner admitted that when he had the attack his co-worker \u201cnoticed the condition, * * * the way I was there, and at the time I fell * * *. He picked me up.\u201d He amplified this statement on cross-examination as follows: \u201cAt this particular moment my partner was there seeing me fall over and he come [sic] over and pulled me away because I was in front of a large plate glass window and he thought I would have gone through it at the time. So, he pulled me back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">Moreover, initially petitioner had testified on his direct examination that on the day in question he was working on the first floor as part of a two-man team. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>\u201cQ. Were you working alone or were you working with a helper? A. I had a partner with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\">Q. When you say a partner, was he a helper or was he another co-worker? A. Another co-worker.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">It is also to be noted that originally petitioner had testified that Eebruary 5 was the first day he had worked on the first floor. Later in his testimony he admitted he had been working there for a week, a fact which the foreman in his testimony confirmed. It is clear from the testimony of respondent\u2019s foreman that on the day in question there were six men working on the first floor \u201chooking up\u201d radiators; that the men worked in teams and that a man was working with petitioner on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">As above stated, petitioner failed to produce his co-worker as a witness. In view of petitioner\u2019s present contention that his work was unduly burdensome because he was pursuing it alone, his failure to call his co-worker as a witness is most significant. Not only was such employee at the immediate scene of the attack, but, if called, his testimony would have been invaluable in determining the exact nature of the work in which petitioner had been engaged on the day in question, particularly at the time of the attack, and in assessing petitioner\u2019s basic claim that he was working under \u201cstrain.\u201d The failure to call this crucial witness was left unexplained.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">We thus find petitioner seeking a compensation award without fortifying his case by a crucial lay witness, his co-worker, and without presentation of the medical testimony which in all probability held the key to the issue to be resolved. Our courts have spoken on this subject on many occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">In <em>Bober v. Independent Plating Corp., </em>28 <em>N. J. </em>160, 167 (1958), the court, speaking of the probative force of medical opinions, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">\u201c* =&gt; * In process of evaluation, a criterion of recognized significance is the greater opportunity of a treating physician, as compared with a doctor who conducts a single examination in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>to become an expert medical witness, to know, understand and decide upon the producing cause of the patient\u2019s condition. <em>Fusco v. Cambridge Piece Dyeing Corp., </em>135 <em>N. J. L. </em>160, 162 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1947).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">See also, <em>Conquy v. New Jersey Power &amp; Light Co., </em>23 <em>N. J. Super. </em>325, 330 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952); <em>Bialko v. II. Baker Milk Co., </em>38 <em>N. J. Super. </em>169, 172 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955), certification denied 20 <em>N. J. </em>535 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">EaiJnre to call the aforesaid lay and expert witnesses permits the inference that \u201ctheir testimony would not be as favorable to appellant as desired.\u201d <em>Agresla v. Western Electric Company, </em>1 <em>N. J. Super. </em>177, 179 <em>(App. Div. </em>1949).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">\u201c* * * The unexplained failure of a party to produce a witness whom he would naturally be expected to call, permits the inference that his testimony would have been unfavorable to that party. <em>Roach v. Yellow Cab Co., </em>6 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>386 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1928)<em>; Series Publishers, Inc. v. Greene, </em>9 <em>N. J. Super. </em>166 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950).\u201d <em>Schultz v. Hinz, </em>20 <em>N. J. Super. </em>346, 351 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">On the basis of our foregoing analysis we have, as above indicated, reached the conclusion that petitioner on his tendered hypothesis has not by a preponderance of probabilities borne the burden of proving a work-connected accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">The judgment of the County Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
