Both charges relate to one event on December 3, 1993, when S.M. was employed to baby-sit A.K., a five-year old male child.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">A.K. informed his father that during the afternoon, S.M. \u201cblew through my penis.\u201d A.K.\u2019s father immediately contacted police authorities and a police investigator interviewed A.K. At the subsequent trial, the court found A.K. competent to testify. On direct examination, A.K. related that S.M. placed his mouth on A.K.\u2019s penis and instructed A.K. to touch S.M.\u2019s penis while S.M. remained fully clothed. The State presented the testimony of A.K.\u2019s father, who was permitted to repeat A.K.\u2019s version of the events as it had been stated when the incident was first reported. The State also introduced the testimony of the police investigator who repeated the version of the incident as told by A.K. at the initial interview. The two prior statements were consistent with A.K.\u2019s trial testimony. In no rendition did A.K. clearly indicate that his penis entered S.M.\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">S.M. testified on his own behalf. He admitted that the incident occurred and indicated that although he did place his mouth upon A.K.\u2019s penis, he did not cause the penis to enter his mouth. S.M.\u2019s counsel vigorously argued that the proven facts failed to establish a violation of <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:14-2a(l), and that S.M. should only be found guilty of two second-degree offenses in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>2C:14-2b. The trial court rejected S.M.\u2019s argument, concluding that the act of \u201cfellatio\u201d does not require proof of the insertion or attempted insertion of the victim\u2019s penis into the mouth of the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">On July 14,1994, S.M. was sentenced to the Training School for Boys at Jamesburg for a period not to exceed eighteen months on each count of the juvenile delinquency complaint. The sentence on count two was to be served concurrent with the sentence on count one. The court also imposed a $80 penalty payable to the Violent Crimes Compensation Board on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">On October 6, 1994, S.M. appeared before the Family Part seeking reconsideration of his original sentence. On October 27, 1994, the trial judge granted S.M.\u2019s motion for reconsideration of sentence and placed S.M. under a two-year period of probation. As conditions of that probation, the judge placed S.M. under \u201chouse arrest\u201d and required S.M. to obtain and complete psychological counseling, to follow the recommendation of his physician, and to attend and complete an educational program.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">On appeal from both his conviction and his sentence, S.M. raises three points of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-10\">THE FEDERAL AND STATE DUE PROCESS AND FAIR TRIAL RIGHTS OF JUVENILE S.M. WERE VIOLATED BY THE TRIAL JUDGE\u2019S APPLICA TION OF AN ERRONEOUS DEFINITION OF \u201cFELLATIO\u201d TO FIND THAT S.M. HAD COMMITTED A FIRST DEGREE SEXUAL OFFENSE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-11\">A. THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRONEOUSLY HELD THAT \u201cFELLATIO\u201d, AS THAT TERM IS USED IN THE SEXUAL ASSAULT STATUTE, DOES NOT REQUIRE INSERTION OR ATTEMPTED INSERTION OF THE PENIS INTO THE ORAL CAVITY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-12\">B. S.M.\u2019S FEDERAL AND STATE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS AND TO A FAIR TRIAL WERE VIOLATED BECAUSE THE SEXUAL ASSAULT STATUTE, AS APPLIED TO DEFENDANT, WAS VAGUE. (Not Raised Below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-13\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-14\">DEFENDANT\u2019S SENTENCE IS LEGALLY IMPROPER UNDER THE JUVENILE CODE AND VIOLATES HIS STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">THE COURT\u2019S UNFAIR QUESTIONING OF WITNESSES AND ITS ADMISSION OF HEARSAY EVIDENCE VIOLATED S.M. [SIC] STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS AND TO A FAIR TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">In its brief and at oral argument, the State admitted that the trial judge, when resentencing S.M. on October 27, 1994, improperly imposed a probationary term of two years, as S.M.\u2019s original sentence encompassed an eighteen-month period of incarceration. Additionally, the State recognizes that the trial court failed to give S.M. credit against his sentence for the time spent at Jamesburg between July 14, 1994 and the date of resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">At oral argument, we learned that S.M. is no longer under \u201chouse arrest\u201d and has been permitted to re-enter the public school system.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">The substantial change in facts since the date of original sentencing and the State\u2019s admission that the sentence imposed at resentencing was constitutionally impermissible render the issues posed in Point II respecting the \u201clegality\u201d or \u201cpropriety\u201d of S.M.\u2019s original sentence moot. On remand, S.M. shall be entitled to a resentence. If again placed on probation, the term of probation may not exceed eighteen months retroactive to July 14,1994. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-44d(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">We conclude that S.M.\u2019s conviction was correct and accordingly, we affirm that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">The New Jersey Criminal Code defines sexual assault as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-13\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:14-2 Sexual Assault</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-14\">a. An actor is guilty of aggravated sexual assault if he commits an act of sexual penetration with another person under any one of the following circumstances: (1) The victim is less than 13 years old.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-15\">\u201cSexual Penetration\u201d is defined, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-le as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-16\">[V]aginal intercourse, cunnilingus, fellatio or anal intercourse between persons or insertion of the hand, finger or object into the anus or vagina either by the actor or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>upon the actor\u2019s instruction. The depth of insertion shall not be relevant as to the commission of the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">S.M. contends that the State failed to prove that A.K.\u2019s penis ever penetrated S.M.\u2019s mouth and that, without proof of penetration, S.M. could only be found guilty of violating <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b. The trial court, relying upon our decision in <em>State v. C.H., </em>264 <em>N.J.Super. </em>112, 624 A.2d 53 (App.Div.1993) and by analogy, our decision in <em>State v. Fraction, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>532, 503 A.2d 336 (App.Div.1985), <em>certif. denied, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>434, 517 A.2d 426 (1986), rejected that contention. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">In <em>Fraction, </em>we were required to determine whether the State proved an act of cunnilingus when the victim testified that defendant \u201c \u2018licked [her] outer labia\u2019 but did not insert his tongue into her vagina.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 535, 503 A.2d 336. After quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-1c, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">By its very terms, therefore, the phrase \u201csexual penetration\u201d includes the act of cunnilingus. Although the word \u201ccunnilingus\u201d is not defined in the Code of Criminal Justice, we are in accord with the trial judge\u2019s determination that it must be given its ordinary and well understood meaning, (citation omitted). It is generally defined as \u201coral stimulation of the vulva or clitoris.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>315 (1985). (citations omitted). Thus, by definition cunnilingus constitutes a form of \u201csexual penetration\u201d under the statute notwithstanding the fact that the actor\u2019s tongue is not inserted into the vagina.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 535-36, 503 A.2d 336.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-10\"><em>Fraction </em>provides an appropriate analogy to the ease before us. The word \u201cfellatio\u201d is not defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-1c. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, </em>836 (3d ed. 1981) defines \u201cfellatio\u201d as \u201cthe practice of obtaining sexual satisfaction by oral stimulation of the penis.\u201d Thus, by definition, fellatio constitutes a form of \u201csexual penetration\u201d under the statute notwithstanding the fact that the victim\u2019s penis does not enter the actor\u2019s mouth. Placement of the actor\u2019s mouth on the victim\u2019s penis is sufficient to prove a violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:14-la.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">In <em>State v. C.H., </em>the child victim stated that defendant tried to put his penis in her mouth and when she resisted, defendant held her nose to force her mouth open and defendant ejaculated. <em>C.H., </em>264 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 129, 624 A.2d 53. Although there had not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>penetration, we concluded that C.H. was guilty of attempted fellatio and thus aggravated sexual assault. <em>IcL</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Although neither <em>Fraction </em>nor <em>C.H. </em>relied upon decisions in other jurisdictions, the State has properly argued that the view which we have previously adopted is consistent with conclusions reached in those jurisdictions in which the question has been posed. In <em>Thomas v. State, </em>301 <em>Md. </em>294, 483 A.2d 6, 20 (1984), <em>cert. denied </em>470 <em>U.S. </em>1088, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>1856, 85 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>153 (1985), the court concluded that kissing a penis constituted an act of fellatio, as contact between the mouth and the penis without penetration was sufficient to constitute an act of fellatio. <em>See also State v. Phillips, </em>365 So.2d 1304, 1308 (La.1978), <em>cert. denied </em>442 <em>U.S. </em>919, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>2843, 61 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>287; <em>McDonald v. State, </em>513 S.W.2d 44, 46-47 (Tex.Crim.App.1974); <em>State v. Childs, </em>146 Wis.2d 116, 430 <em>N.W.2d </em>353, 355 (1988), <em>cert. denied </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>1025, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1154, 103 L.Ed.2d 213 (1989); <em>Murray v. State, </em>770 P.2d 1131, 1139 (Alaska Ct.App.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\"><em>State v. Childs </em>provides an excellent example of similar analysis undertaken by our sister States on facts strikingly similarly to those before us. <em>Childs </em>involved an appeal from the defendant\u2019s conviction for second-degree sexual assault. <em>Childs, </em>430 N.W.2d at 354. The defendant contended that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that \u201cfellatio is the oral stimulation of the penis.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 355. The defendant argued that this instruction relieved the State of its burden of proving penetration as an essential element of the crime charged. <em>Ibid</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The Court of Appeals of Wisconsin considered, as we do here, that in the absence of a statutory definition, a court should rely on the common and ordinary meaning of a word in examining a statute. <em>Ibid. </em>This meaning may be determined by \u201cthe definition of a recognized dictionary.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court of appeals found that the trial court\u2019s instruction comported with the definition of fellatio as found in <em>Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary. </em>This definition \u201cincludes oral stimulation of the penis without penetration into the mouth.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court therefore upheld the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>instruction and affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction. We agree with this method of analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">We acknowledge that the word \u201cfellatio\u201d may be traced to the past participle of the Latin word \u201cfelare\u201d which translated means \u201cto suck.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, </em>836 (1971). However, the origin of a word does not necessarily dictate its present meaning. Our legislature has not limited \u201cfellatio\u201d to a specific definition but has used that term in its broadest sense. We conclude that placing one\u2019s mouth on the penis of a male victim without inserting the victim\u2019s penis into the mouth falls within the legislature\u2019s proscription of prohibited acts. We conclude that the public is reasonably apprised of the legislative intent based upon concepts of common intelligence and ordinary human experience. <em>See State v. Lashinsky, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>1, 15-16, 404 A.2d 1121 (1979).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">The concept of vagueness or indefiniteness rests on the constitutional principle that procedural due process requires fair notice and proper standards for adjudication. The primary issues involved are whether the provision of a penal statute are sufficiently definite to give reasonable notice of the prohibited conduct to those who wish to avoid its penalties and to apprise judge and jury of standards for the determination of guilt. If the statute is so obscure that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its applicability, it is unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\"><em>[Id. </em>(quoting <em>Landry v. Daley, </em>280 <em>F.Supp. </em>938, 951-52 (N.D.Ill), appeal dismissed 393 <em>U.S. </em>220, 89 <em>S.Ct </em>455, 21 L.Ed.2d 392 (1968), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, sub. nom. Boyle v. Landry, </em>401 <em>U.S. </em>77, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>758, 27 L.Ed.2d 696 (1971)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">We accordingly reject S.M.\u2019s contention that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2 is constitutionally vague as written or as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">S.M. contends that the use at trial of A.K.\u2019s statement to his father as to the particulars of S.M.\u2019s conduct and the subsequent statement of A.K. to the investigating police officer violated <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(27) requiring a reversal of S.M.\u2019s adjudication of delinquency. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">We note that <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(27) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>A statement by a child under the age of 12 relating to sexual misconduct committed with or against that child is admissible in a criminal, juvenile, or civil proceeding if (a) the proponent of the statement makes known to the adverse party his intention to offer the statement and the particulars of the statement at such time as to provide him with a fair opportunity to prepare to meet it; (b) the court finds, in a hearing conducted pursuant to Rule 104(a), that on the basis of the time, content and circumstances of the statement there is a probability that the statement is trustworthy; and (c) either (i) the child testifies at the proceeding, or (ii) the child is unavailable as a witness and there is offered admissible evidence corroborating the act of sexual abuse; provided that no child whose statement is to be offered in evidence pursuant to this rule shall be disqualified to be a witness in such proceeding by virtue of the requirements of Rule 601.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Our review of the record demonstrates that S.M.\u2019s counsel objected to the testimony of A.K.\u2019s father, not because it was offered without a prior evidentiary ruling as to trustworthiness, but due to the fact that the prosecutor did not comply with subsection (a) of the rule, which requires notification by the State of its intent to use the prior statement of the victim. Unquestionably, the State had provided defense counsel with a copy of the statement in pretrial discovery. The State failed to specifically inform defense counsel that it intended to present that statement through the testimony of A.K.\u2019s father. We conclude that from the facts of this case, it would be self-evident to defense counsel that the State would call as a witness a five-year old victim\u2019s father, when discovery reflected that the victim revealed the act of delinquency to his father a few hours after the event allegedly occurred. S.M.\u2019s objection at trial, without any demonstration of prejudice, was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Our review of the record reveals that the recorded version of A.K.\u2019s statement to his father and thereafter to the investigating police officer was provided in advance of trial to S.M. through pretrial discovery. Although <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(27)(b) requires the court to \u201cfind, in a hearing conducted pursuant to Rule 104(a), that on the basis of the time, content and circumstances of the statement that there is a probability that the statement is trustworthy,\u201d we do not conclude that the failure of the court, sitting as the trier of fact, to conduct a hearing pursuant to Rule 104(a) is so violative of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(e)(27) as to warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Here, the statement of A.K. to his father occurred the very evening of the alleged delinquent conduct and was then briefly repeated in the presence of the investigating officer while A.K.\u2019s father was also present in the room. Here, S.M.\u2019s counsel did not request a Rule 104(a) hearing; S.M. has failed to articulate any prejudice resulting from the court\u2019s alleged dereliction in this non-jury proceeding. By the court\u2019s findings at the conclusion of this trial, it is clear that the court was fully aware of its responsibility to determine trustworthiness as outlined in <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 <em>U.S. </em>805, 822, 110 <em>S.Ct </em>3139, 3150, 111 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>638 (1990), and as discussed in <em>State v. D.R., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>348, 371-77, 537 A.2d 667 (1988). The court considered A.K.\u2019s in-eourt statement but also considered: (1) the circumstances under which the same statement was made to his father; (2) its spontaneity; (3) the mental state of the declarant; (4) the terminology attributed to the declarant; and (5) the declarant\u2019s lack of motive to fabricate.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Additionally, S.M.\u2019s contention chat reversal is mandated due to the fact that the trial judge asked several questions of A.K.\u2019s father in order to clarify the testimony is without merit. <em>See R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Defendant\u2019s conviction is affirmed. Defendant\u2019s sentence is vacated and this matter is remanded to the Family Part for the imposition of sentence in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
