Orso, Fort Lee Deputy Police Chief Thomas R. Tessaro, and Fort Lee Deputy Police Chief Salvatore Careri, filed a three count complaint based on defamation against defendants, Fort Lee City Couneilmember Laurence Goldberg, The Bergen Record Corporation, a daily newspaper, its Publisher Glenn Ritt, and its Staff Writer Jeff Pillets on October 18, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">Count One charged Goldberg with making false statements and accusations of criminal conduct against plaintiffs and other officers of the Fort Lee Police Department over a two year period. Count Two alleged that The Bergen Record published an article on June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>9, 1994 which repeated Goldberg\u2019s defamatory statements and accusations. The count further alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">The statements and comments in the article concerning criminal conduct and improprieties on behalf of the plaintiffs, that plaintiffs were the subject of criminal investigations and that plaintiffs would be indicted were and are defamatory and false and were made with knowledge of their falsity or reckless disregard of their truth or falsity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In Count Three, plaintiffs allege that the defendants\u2019 false, slanderous and libelous statements placed them in a false light before the general public and invaded their privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">On November 21, 1994, prior to filing an answer, The Bergen Record Corporation, Glenn Ritt and Jeff Pillets moved to dismiss the complaint as it pertained to them. On January 20, 1995, the Law Division judge heard argument on appellants\u2019 motion. On February 10, 1995, the judge issued a letter opinion denying the motion. This appeal, on leave granted by us, is from the February 23, 1995 order denying dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">The judge found that the language of the newspaper article taken in context and considered as, a whole was reasonably susceptible of a defamatory meaning since it tended to diminish plaintiffs\u2019 standing in the community. <em>See Lawrence v. Bauer, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>451, 459, 446 A.2d 469 (1982). Appellants and Amicus Curiae, N.J. Press Association, maintain that although the statements were defamatory, the article still was validly published and appellants must be protected from a defamation action.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">The Law Division judge in denying appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss noted that the fair report privilege covers the media when reporting judicial, legislative and other \u201cpublic proceedings,\u201d but that \u201c[i]n this case Mr. Goldberg\u2019s statements were in part obtained at a private interview as distinguished from statement made at a public proceeding,\u201d citing <em>Costello v. Ocean County Observer, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>594, 643 A.2d 1012 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">We find that the qualified privilege of the media to fairly report defamatory words or statements uttered by a public official and to report on matters of public interest affecting government and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>officials provides ample cause on the facts of this case to warrant summary judgment. We, therefore, reverse and remand for entry of an order of dismissal of the claims against appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Privileges that restrict recovery for defamation reflect the \u201cparamount public interest [in] permitting persons to speak or write freely without being restrained by the possibility of a defamation action.\u201d <em>Swede v. Passaic Daily News, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>320, 331, 153 A.2d 36 (1959). In \u201cnarrowly defined instances,\u201d where the public interest in unrestrained communication outweighs the reputation interests of individuals, a privilege will work to defeat the right of redress. <em>Fees v. Trow, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>330, 336, 521 A.2d 824 (1987); <em>see Erickson v. Marsh &amp; McLennan Co., </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>539, 564, 569 A.2d 793 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Clearly those statements made by Councilmember Goldberg during a public proceeding were protected by a qualified privilege. <em>Swede, supra, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>at 332-34, 153 A.2d 36. \u201cThe publication of defamatory matter concerning another in a report of an official action or proceeding or of a meeting open to the public that deals with a matter of public concern is privileged if the report is accurate and complete or a fair abridgement of the occurrence is reported.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>\u00a7 611; and <em>see Coleman v. Newark Morning Ledger Co., </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>357, 379, 149 A.2d 193 (1959) (adopting analogous rule in original Restatement); <em>accord Reilly v. Gillen, </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>321, 328, 423 A.2d 311 (App.Div.1980) (relying on the Restatement language to explain the fair-report privilege).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">This doctrine, which has come to be known as the \u201cfair report privilege,\u201d <em>see Medico v. Time, Inc., </em>643 F.2d 134 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. den. </em>454 <em>U.S. </em>836, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>139, 70 L.Ed.2d 116 (1981), developed as an exception to the common law rule that a person who republishes a defamation uttered by another was subject to liability as if he or she were the original defamer. <em>Id. </em>at 137. The common law \u201cfiction\u201d that a republisher adopted the defamatory matter created special problems for the press. <em>Ibid. </em>When a newspaper republished a newsworthy account of one person\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>defamation of another, by virtue of the common law rule, it was charged with publication of the underlying defamation. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The fair-report privilege, if not an absolute privilege, is much broader than many other conditional privileges. The privilege will be held to protect the media publisher even though the publisher does not personally believe the defamatory words he reports to be true and even when he knows them to be false. <em>Molnar v. Star-Ledger, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>12, 21, 471 A.2d 1209 (App.Div.1984); <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>\u00a7 600, comment a. In <em>Molnar, supra, </em>we found privileged the republication of a defamatory statement of a deputy fire chief, made during an interview, in regard to a fire investigation. <em>Id. </em>at 12, 471 A.2d 1209. We stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">The qualified privilege to report defamatory words or statements uttered by a public official with respect to matters within the scope of his official responsibility is <em>analogous </em>to the privilege afforded the news media with respect to full, fair and accurate reports of judicial, legislative and other public proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">[193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 20, 471 A.2d 1209 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Thus, we held that a privilege, analogous to the fair reporting privilege, applies to news coverage of public officials\u2019 statements to reporters pertaining to matters within the scope of their official duties. <em>Ibid. See Schiavone Constr. Co. v. Time, Inc., </em>847 F.2d 1069, 1085, 1087 n. 28 (3d Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">The privilege is founded on the public\u2019s interest in learning of important matters. <em>Medico, supra, </em>643 F.2d at 141 (quoting <em>Cowley v. Pulsifer, </em>137 <em>Mass. </em>392, (1884), Holmes, J.). This privilege exists both to examine the affairs of government officials, and to provide the public with information regarding matters of legitimate public concern. <em>Ibid. </em>Courts have recognized the importance of permitting the news media to report on issues of important public interest without the fear of being held to have adopted the defamatory charge of another. <em>See DiSalle v. P.G. Pub. Co., </em>375 <em>Pa.Super. </em>510, 544 A.2d 1345, 1362 (1988), <em>appeal denied, </em>521 <em>Pa. </em>620, 557 A.2d 724 (1989) (noting that the republication of false charges by a public official against another \u201cgives the electorate a valuable insight into the character\u201d of the accus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>er); <em>Chapin v. Knight-Ridder, Irte., </em>998 F.2d 1087, 1097 (4th Cir.1993) (Where a legislator made defamatory charge against plaintiffs, it was newsworthy that the charge was made).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">As noted in <em>Coleman v. Newark Morning Ledger Co., supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhV\">The rule of conditional or qualified privilege, whereby a person is protected from legal liability for defamatory words in fact untrue, if uttered honestly and without any indirect or improper motive, is founded on the general welfare of society and so new occasions for its application will necessarily arise with continually changing conditions ... The policy is an accommodation of competing social and political interests for the good of all: the protection of the reputation of individuals, on the one hand, and on the other the collective security and the \u201cinterest of the public in the fullest freedom of officials to make disclosures on matters within the scope of their public duties * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">[29 <em>N.J. </em>at 376, 149 A.2d 193 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">We find good reason for extending to these appellants a qualified privilege to the printing of those accusations made by Goldberg during non-public interviews. <em>See Molnar, supra, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 20, 471 A.2d 1209. The various plaintiffs involved are clearly public officials. <em>Costello v. Ocean County Observer, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 612-14, 643 A.2d 1012. The fair report privilege afforded the news media must extend to full, fair and accurate reports of what was said concerning conditions and situations existing in government which affect the public, where such persons are involved. The public interest in the affairs of government needs to be paramount. <em>See Fees, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 336, 521 A.2d 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">In their certification filed in opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, plaintiffs certified that Councilmember Goldberg had been making the same allegations reported in the article since April 1991, including at an official city council session in June 1991. We see no reason to deny the fair report protection to the media where the remarks reported in the article were made in an interview reasonably related to the public disclosure or public controversy. The overriding importance of the public interest in the thorough reporting and evaluation of the charges or dispute compels the protection of the publication even at the expense of the public officials\u2019 personal reputations. The statements were those of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>public official and were made regarding the police department and police officials. The media republication of those statements was in the context of the disruption that the charges were causing to the operation of the local government. The public\u2019s interest in obtaining knowledge of the effectiveness of its government compels us to conclude that a qualified fair report privilege applies to the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">For the fair report privilege to protect defamatory statements contained in a newspaper article, the court must also determine whether the report is a full, fair and accurate account. <em>Costello v. Ocean County Observer, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 607, 643 A.2d 1012. It is not necessary that the account be exact in every detail, so long as it conveys to the persons who read it a substantially correct account. <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>\u00a7 611, comment f; <em>see also Costello, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 607, 643 A.2d 1012 (quoting the <em>Restatement (Second) of </em>Torts). In the present case, there is no assertion that the reporting lacks the qualities of fairness and accuracy. Indeed, an unbiased reading of the article reveals such an exposition of the lack of validity to Goldberg\u2019s assertions that plaintiffs offer it as proof of appellants\u2019 malice and knowledge of the falsity of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">It is apparent from the pleadings and plaintiffs\u2019 own certification that appellants published a fair and accurate account of the statements made by Goldberg and the context in which they were made. The article is filled with exculpatory language to maintain the fairness of repeating the allegations of criminal activity made by Goldberg. Language throughout the article reveals that the accusations made by Goldberg and his political faction appeared to lack substance and defy confirmation. The article made the point that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">Feeding the discord are persistent\u2014and unsubstantiated\u2014allegations of wrongdoing by high-level police officials. The allegations have ripped apart a Democratic Party that has long controlled public policy in Fort Lee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The merit of those allegations, however, has taken a hack seat to the political infighting among the borough\u2019s elected leaders, split between those who favor the critics and those who support the department\u2019s leaders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-5\">None of the charges could be substantiated by The Record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">Orso and other top-ranking police officials vehemently deny the allegations and say they even offered the FBI access to all public and private police records\u2014an offer the agency declined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">Bergen County Prosecutor John J. Fahy says he knows of no improprieties involving the Fort Lee force. And in an unusual public statement last December, New Jersey FBI chief James Esposito said there was no substance to allegations against Orso and his aides.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Viewed in its entire context, it is clear the article is not misleading, confusing or internally inconsistent. <em>See Costello v. Ocean County Observer, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 615, 643 A.2d 1012. Reasonable persons cannot dispute that the article presents both sides of the controversy, fairly and accurately, in order to inform the public of circumstances reasonably construed to be interfering with the orderly administration of local government. The central focus of the article was precisely the political factioning in Fort Lee and its impact on its government.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">Plaintiffs maintain that even if the fair report privilege applies to the report of Goldberg\u2019s statements, the fair report privilege is defeated because appellants knew of the falsity of the charges after conducting their own investigation. We find the privilege is not defeated by appellants\u2019 conduct in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">According to the <em>Restatement, </em>a showing that appellants knew of or acted in reckless disregard of the falsity of the statements is insufficient to find the privilege defeated. The <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>\u00a7 600 sets forth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-11\">Except as stated in \u00a7 602, one who upon an occasion giving rise to a conditional privilege publishes false and defamatory matter concerning another abuses the privilege if he</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-12\">(a) knows the matter to be false, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-13\">(b) acts in reckless disregard to its truth or falsity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">Comment (c) to \u00a7 600, however, specifically excludes the fair report privilege from this standard. Under comment (a) to \u00a7 611, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>it is the <em>Restatement </em>position that the fair report privilege exists even though the publisher does not believe the defamatory words reported and even when the publisher knows them to be false. <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>\u00a7 611, comment a. According to the <em>Restatement, </em>abuse of the privilege takes place only when the publisher does not give a fair and accurate report of the proceedings. <em>Ibid.; Cf. Molnar v. Star Ledger, supra, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 21, 471 A.2d 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In <em>Coleman, supra, </em>our Supreme Court engaged in a lengthy discussion of \u201cmalice,\u201d and stated that \u201cthe court will look to the primary motive or purpose by which the defendant apparently is inspired\u201d and that \u201cthe privilege is lost if the publication is not made primarily for the purpose of furthering the interest which is entitled to protection.\u201d 29 <em>N.J. </em>at 375, 149 A.2d 193 (internal quotations omitted). Quoting the <em>Restatement (First) of Torts, </em>\u00a7 611, the <em>Coleman </em>court noted that \u201c... the privilege is \u2018lost if the report is published solely for the purpose of defaming the other and not for the purpose of informing the public,\u2019 and the privilege \u2018differs from the usual conditional privilege in that it affords protection even though the defamatory statement reported is known to be false.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coleman, supra, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>at 379, 149 A.2d 193 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In <em>Dairy Stores v. Sentinel Pub. Co., </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>125, 516 A.2d 220 (1986), the Supreme Court recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">\u201cMalice\" adds nothing to the legal analysis of an allegedly defamatory statement, and it can become a pitfall in the underbrush of common law. Consequently, we lose nothing by striking \u201cmalice\u201d from the vocabulary of the common law of defamation. Indeed, the Restatement eschews the term altogether, speaking instead of the \u201cabuse of privilege.\u201d ... It is more direct to recognize the legal consequences of the publication of certain statements without recourse to so ambiguous a word with such a checkered past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\">[citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Nonetheless, the court in <em>Dairy Stores, supra, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-10\">Although we discard the label, we adhere to the principle that to overcome a qualified or conditional privilege, a plaintiff must establish that the publisher knew the statement to be false or acted in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-11\">[104 <em>N.J. </em>at 151, 516 A.2d 220.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>For purposes of the present case, we need not resolve the conflict between the holding in <em>Dairy Stores </em>that knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard will defeat a qualified privilege, and the court\u2019s reference to \u00a7 600 of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>which, as previously discussed, excepts the fair report privilege from the rest of the qualified privileges. <em>See Fees v. Trow, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>330, 521 A.2d 824; <em>Schiavone, supra, </em>847 <em>F.</em>2d at 1087, n. 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">We are satisfied that on the undisputed facts in the present case, even applying a standard of actual malice, plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that appellants acted improperly or abused their privilege in printing the article. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that appellants conducted an investigation of the allegations through police documents and records, as well as by interviewing plaintiffs, and therefore appellants knew that the allegations were false.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Justice Garibaldi in <em>Costello v. Ocean County Observer, supra, </em>pronounced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">To survive summary judgment, a public official must prove that the statements were published either with knowledge that they were false or with reckless disregard of whether they were false. <em>[New York Times v. Sullivan, </em>376 <em>U.S. </em>254, 279-80, 84 <em>S.Ct. </em>710, 726, 11 L.Ed.2d 686, 706 (1964) ]. To determine whether a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding actual malice, a court must consider whether the plaintiff has produced the \u201cquantum and quality of proof\u2019 necessary under the <em>New York Times v. Sullivan </em>standard. <em>Schiavone, supra, </em>847 <em>F.2d </em>at 1089. The plaintiff must demonstrate that a reasonable jury could conclude that \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d exists that the defendants published the article with actual malice. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>242, 254-55, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2505, 2513, 91 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>202, 215-16 (1986).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-9\">[136 <em>N.J. </em>at 614, 643 A.2d 1012.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">The justice further expounded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-11\">Plaintiffs nonetheless must produce substantial evidence to survive a motion for summary judgment. Although courts construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party in a summary judgment motion, the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard in defamation action adds an additional weight to the plaintiffs\u2019 usual \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d burden.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-12\">[Id at 615, 643 A.2d 1012 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>We are convinced that considering the facts as alleged, in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, a reasonable fact finder could not find \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence of appellants\u2019 actual malice. There is no indication in the pleadings or certification of plaintiffs that appellants ignored any available information concerning the charges and allegations, or that they were less than thorough in reporting their inability to verify or confirm the assertions. The context of the article when viewed in its entirety reflects not actual malice and/or negligence, but rather full and fair media exposition of a matter of obvious public interest and importance. <em>See id. </em>at 619, 643 A.2d 1012.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">We are convinced that discovery would have served no useful purpose in this case. As stated in <em>Maressa v. New Jersey Monthly:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">Aside from the danger of a libel judgment and the intrusiveness of discovery of sources and editorial process, the cost of defending a libel action can itself deter free press____ The desultory pace of [litigation] gives little comfort to those who would assert their constitutional right to free speech about public affairs____ Our courts should resolve free speech litigation more expeditiously whenever possible. The perpetuation of meritless actions, with their attendant costs, chills the exercise of press freedom. To avoid this, trial courts should not hesitate to use summary judgment procedures to bring such actions to a speedy end.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-10\">[89 <em>N.J. </em>176, 196, 445 A.2d 376, <em>cert. den., </em>459 <em>U.S. </em>907, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>211, 74 L.Ed.2d 169 (1982) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">In <em>Kotlikoff v. The Community News, </em>our Supreme Court also stated that the threat of prolonged litigation has a real potential for chilling journalistic criticism and comment upon public figures and affairs. 89 <em>N.J. </em>62, 67, 444 A.2d 1086 (1982).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-12\">The summary judgment device, as employed by the trial court here in the pre-discovery stage, winnows out nonactionable claims, avoids the expenditure of unnecessary legal fees, and discourages frivolous suits. We therefore encourage trial courts to give particularly careful consideration to identifying appropriate cases for summary judgment disposition in this area of the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-13\">[Id. at 67-68, 444 A.2d 1086 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-14\">In conclusion, we add that appellants having acted reasonably and in the public interest concerning a matter involving public officials, summary judgment should have been granted. <em>See and compare Stockton Newspapers Inc. v. San Joaquin Superior </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number><em>Court, </em>206 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>966, 254 <em>Cal.Rptr., </em>389, 398 (1988) (protection of the interest of the public in learning of misconduct of a public official makes it reasonable for a newspaper to publish \u25a1claims of misconduct despite the absence of belief that [the] version of the misconduct is true).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The order denying summary judgment is reversed.
