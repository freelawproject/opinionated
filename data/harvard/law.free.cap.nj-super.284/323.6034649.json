Hanrahan, continued medical treatment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">On February 8, 1992, petitioner was injured in an automobile accident during and in the course of his employment as a Township Police Officer. On November 30, 1992, he filed a Workers\u2019 Compensation Claim Petition alleging \u201cinjury u&gt; neck, right shoulder and low back with orthopedic residuals thereof\u2019 arising out of the accident. Respondent filed an answer admitting the \u201cjurisdictional facts.\u201d Petitioner, by motion dated April 1, 1993, sought authorization for \u201con-going medical treatment in accordance with the recommendations of Dr. James L. Scales of Newton, N.J.\u201d Respondent filed an answering statement placing the issues in dispute and noting that \u201cpetitioner was evaluated by Dr. Dorsky on October 14, 1992 and was found to have reached maximum medical recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">Hearings were held on September 20, 1993, March 7, 1994 and March 28, 1994. On April 20, 1994, the Judge of Compensation rendered an oral decision granting petitioner additional medical benefits. On June 28, 1994, an order was entered requiring respondent to provide additional treatment \u201cand to continue to provide treatment until the petitioner is relieved of the effects of the injury, is discharged from treatment or by further Order of this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">On February 8, 1992, the petitioner was in his patrol car, when another vehicle, going about forty-five miles per hour, struck his vehicle in the rear. Petitioner received emergency medical treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>ment at the Newton Memorial Hospital. X-rays were taken of his cervical spine and skull. The cervical spine x-ray showed degenerative changes at C4-C5. The hospital staff gave him a cervical collar and some medication and he was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">A few days to a week after the accident, petitioner experienced \u201cproblems\u201d with his lower back and sought follow up care. He first went to a chiropractor a couple of times. Then, upon advice from respondent\u2019s insurance carrier, on April 8, 1992, he began treatment with Dr. Scales. Dr. Scales made a diagnosis of acute cervical sprain and acute lumbosacral sprain. He prescribed medication, physical therapy and a home exercise program. The physical therapy included moist heat, electric stimulation, ultrasound, massage, and range of motion and stretching exercises.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">With treatment, the problems with petitioner\u2019s neck, right shoulder and lower back improved somewhat over the n\u00e9xt few weeks. Petitioner testified that at that point he still experienced sporadic sharp pain in the base of his neck and that his shoulder would cramp. He also testified that the pain in his lower back would not go away and that when it became unbearable he would take the pain medication prescribed by Dr. Scales. Dr. Scales continued to order physical therapy. By May 1992, the doctor had added to his diagnosis of petitioner\u2019s injuries a right thoracic outlet syndrome. By May 27, 1992, the doctor felt that petitioner\u2019s condition was improving but that he would require an epidural steroid injection since he had not responded to conventional measures thus far for the thoracic outlet syndrome. Petitioner noted significant relief of the low back symptoms as a result of the injection.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In August of 1992, Dr. Scales referred petitioner to a neurologist for a consultation. The neurologist reported that petitioner suffered from mild brachioplexitis. On September 23, 1992, Dr. Scales again updated his diagnosis of petitioner. His new diagnosis was cervical sprain nearly resolved, probable annulus tear of the lumbosacral spine, mild right brachioplexitis and compensatory rotator cuff tendonitis of the right shoulder secondary to paresthesias. He advised petitioner to continue physical therapy for the rotator cuff tendonitis.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>In October 1992, petitioner was examined at the request of respondent\u2019s insurance carrier. At this time petitioner was still seeing Dr. Scales and was receiving physical therapy. As a result of respondent\u2019s doctor\u2019s examination and report, in November 1992, petitioner received notice from respondent\u2019s insurance carrier that \u201cthey were going to cancel the insurance benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AEH\">Petitioner also saw Dr. Dwyer, \u201ca spine specialist,\u201d to whom he was referred by Dr. Seales, in November 1992. Dr. Dwyer gave petitioner facet joint and epidural injections. Petitioner did not see any doctor from November of 1992 until his last visit to Dr. Dwyer in July or August of 1993 because the insurance carrier \u201cwouldn\u2019t pay for the visit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Petitioner testified that he never had low back pain of any sort before the accident. After the accident, petitioner avoided lifting and advised his shift supervisor that he could not go on ambulance calls and lift patients onto ambulances. At the hearing on the motion, on September 20,1993, petitioner testified that as a result of the accident he had sporadic sharp pain in the base of his neck, spasm or tightening of the muscle to the left side of his shoulder and constant pain in his lower back for which he continued to take the prescribed medicine. He also indicated that when he does any kind of strenuous work, his back pain becomes \u201creally painful,\u201d and that occasionally the pain radiates down to his buttocks. Petitioner stated, with regard to his pain, that for the four or five months preceding trial he had both bad and good periods and that the pain was not getting any better or any worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Petitioner presented the testimony of Dr. Horia Schwartz, who was stipulated to be an expert in the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation. The doctor testified to having reviewed the treating doctors\u2019 office notes, the therapy reports and other medical records and to having examined the petitioner. Dr. Schwartz\u2019s opinion was that petitioner</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">has been left with permanent residuals of multiple work related trauma, secondary to a motor vehicle accident, with indications of sprain and strain of both cervical and lumbosacral spine with myositis and myofascitis as well as radicular neuropa-thy secondary to an impingement like syndrome, particularly in the left lower extremity....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Dr. Schwartz was convinced that an adequate course of treatment would relieve petitioner\u2019s symptomatology. The doctor also opined that given the nature of police work such treatment was necessary due to the potential for further re-injury. The doctor recommended that petitioner be fitted with a lumbosacral support and receive hydrotherapy and a TENS appliance to reduce discomfort and muscle spasm and to increase flexibility of the spine. The doctor indicated that his approach, which he termed a \u201ckitchen sink\u201d approach, would be to try different treatment modalities depending upon what the patient found to be beneficial.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">When asked within what period of time this \u201ckitchen sink\u201d approach should be employed, the doctor responded that it would be three to six months. He felt that petitioner would not have to be treated every day, or be part of a formalized program. Rather, petitioner would only need a half-hour of instruction on how to use the TENS appliance and another half-hour of instruction on certain exercises. Periodic evaluation would also be needed to make sure that everything was in order. Dr. Schwartz asserted that this series of modalities would not cure petitioner, but would reduce his symptomatology and condition to such an extent that he would be able to work and function better and be more flexible.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Respondent presented the report of Dr. Bertram Kummel, an expert in the area of orthopedics, who examined the petitioner on June 25,1993. Dr. Kummel found no evidence of residual disability to the back or neck. He indicated that there was some limitation of motion in the shoulder, which he concluded would not be reduced by further treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The Judge of Compensation concluded that since treatments in the past to the neck and shoulder and the injections in the lower back had been effective in relieving petitioner\u2019s symptoms, \u201cit seems probable that additional treatment will relieve the petitioner\u2019s symptoms and perhaps restore function to the lower back enabling petitioner to lift more weight.\u201d The judge found that Dr. Kummel\u2019s conclusion that petitioner had a non-organic syndrome which would not respond to treatment was \u201cnot substantiated by the facts of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Appellant contends that the medical treatment ordered was not properly authorized by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act as it was palliative, and not curative, in a non-total disability case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u201cIn any problem relating to the construction of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, ... the act is to be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Howard v. Harwood\u2019s Restaurant Co., </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>72, 88, 135 A.2d 161 (1957). The Act provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">The employer shall furnish to the injured worker such medical, surgical and other treatment, and hospital service as shall be necessary to cure <em>and </em>relieve the worker of the effects of the injury and to restore the functions of the injured member or organ where such restoration is possible. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-15. [Emphasis Added.l</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">It was unsuccessfully argued in <em>Howard </em>that the word \u201cand\u201d in \u201ccure and relieve\u201d was used in the conjunctive sense, and that therefore \u201ccure\u201d operates as a precondition to \u201crelieve.\u201d <em>Howard, Supra </em>25 <em>N. J. </em>at 87-88, 135 A.2d 161. Our Supreme Court found \u201cthe legislative intent to be clearly otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88, 135 A.2d 161. It held that a worker was entitled to benefits for treatment which would afford relief from the sufferings incident to an accident arising out of his employment, whether or not a cure might at the same time be effectuated. <em>Id. </em>at 91, 135 A.2d 161. The Court concluded that \u201ccuring\u201d was not a necessary precondition to \u201crelieving\u201d and that medical services which afford relief alone are allowable finder the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 93-94, 135 A.2d 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Respondent urges that the holding in <em>Howard, Supra </em>should be limited to cases of total disability, noting that <em>Howard </em>involved a totally and permanently disabled worker who required constant nursing care in addition to palliative physiotherapy treatment. <em>Id. </em>at 94, 135 A.2d 161. In support of its contention, respondent cites <em>Sa v. Harrison &amp; Son, Inc., </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>203, 209, 183 A.2d 410 (1962), for the proposition that palliative treatment is limited to cases of total disability. <em>Sa Supra </em>however, is not authority for such a proposition. <em>Sa Supra </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>at 209, 183 A.2d 410. In <em>Sa Supra </em>the issue was whether an order could be fashioned with respect to medical treatment or expenses which were not shown to be presently needed but which might become necessary in the future. <em>Id. </em>at 204, 183 A.2d 410. The <em>Sa </em>court held that on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>facts of that case, it was not proper to direct the employer to furnish future treatment as the medical testimony indicated no likelihood of a prospective need for it. <em>Id, </em>at 209-10, 183 A.2d 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The <em>Howard </em>Court did not limit its holding to cases of total disability. <em>Howard, Supra, </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>at 93, 135 A.2d 161. <em>Howard </em>requires only that the treatment be shown by competent medical evidence to be reasonably necessary to cure or relieve the worker of the effects of the injury or to restore function to the injured member or organ where such restoration is possible. <em>See Howard, Supra, </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>at 93, 135 A.2d 161. In <em>Squeo v. Comfort Control Corp., </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>588, 606, 494 A.2d 313 (1985), our Supreme Court stressed that \u201cin determining what is reasonable and necessary, the touchstone is not the injured worker\u2019s desires or what he thinks to be most beneficial. Rather, it is what is shown by sufficient competent evidence to be reasonable and necessary to cure and relieve him.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 606, 494 A.2d 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The scope of appellate review in workers\u2019 compensation cases is set forth in <em>Close v. Kordulak Bros., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>589, 599, 210 A.2d 753 (1965); <em>Perez v. Monmouth Cable Vision, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>275, 282, 650 A.2d 1025 (App.Div.1994). The factual findings of the compensation judge will not be disturbed unless they are \u201cmanifestly unsupported by or inconsistent with competent, relevant and reasonably credible evidence as to offend the interests of justice.\u201d <em>Monmouth Cable Vision, Supra, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 282, 650 A.2d 1025 (quoting <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Appellant asserts that the judge based his finding of necessity solely on the fact that petitioner is a police officer and appellant argues that being a police officer does not in itself satisfy the medical requisite of proving necessity for medical treatment. Here, however, there was other evidence and competent medical testimony upon which the judge based his decision to order additional treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The judge in rendering his decision noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Based upon his physical examination of petitioner, Dr. Scales made a diagnosis of acute cervical sprain and acute lumbosacral sprain. After further examination, Dr. Scales added to his diagnosis right thoracic outlet syndrome. An MRI performed on June 3,1992, revealed a slight posterior disk bulge at L5-S1. Another MRI of the cervical spine was performed on August 18, 1992, which revealed a disk space narrowing at the C4-C5 level with what appeared to be a moderate diffuse annular bulge. The plain films also demonstrated an anterior and posterior bony ridging accompanying the bulge. The posterior ridging obliterated the anterior subarach-noid space, but there was no evidence of deformation of the spinal cord. The spinal cord was felt to be at the lower range of normal or borderline stenotic. At the C5-C6 level there was a much smaller posterior ridge more prominent towards the left side. Plain film correlation demonstrated a bony component to both posterior ridges. There was noted to be an encroachment of the neural foramen bilaterally at both the C4-C5 and the C5-C6 level.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Dr. Roberts\u2019 neurological consultation also was noted to have revealed a mild brachioplexitis with minimal denervation in the flexor earpiradialus muscle as well as intermittent paresthesia of the thumb, and first and second fingers suggesting a lesion in the lateral cord of the plexus. Dr. Dwyer\u2019s examination of October 28, 1992 revealed a decrease of 75 percent of extension of the lower back. Lateral bending was decreased by 50 percent and produced pain. Extension rotation maneuvers were painful as well. Dr. Dwyer diagnosed an annulus tear of the lumbar spine with bulging disk.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The judge also gave weight to the testimony of petitioner that the accident and injuries have affected his ability to engage in his functions as a police officer, and that it is difficult for him to maintain 12-hour shifts in a patrol car without it becoming painful. Petitioner stated that he can\u2019t lift or do any other type of strenuous work during his job and that he asked his supervisor not to assign him to ambulance duty unless it was absolutely necessary. In addition, petitioner testified to experiencing pain in his neck and that it was hard for him to turn his head from side to side, causing difficulty in his driving a police vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Dr. Schwartz\u2019s reasoning was that if the patient were treated with a variety of modalities including physical therapy, that while the pathology would remain the same, functionally and symptomo-logically there would be change because with treatment there would be less pain and with less pain the petitioner could function <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>better. He explained that if you have an increased range of motion, you can move better, and if you have less pain, you can walk, bend, lift, and twist farther and do more of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">It is clear that the judge did not find that additional treatment was necessary merely because petitioner was a police officer. Rather, he held that further treatments were necessary based upon the success of treatment in the past and upon the testimony of Dr. Schwartz that additional treatment would probably relieve petitioner\u2019s symptoms and thereby improve his ability to function.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">We hold that even in non-total disability cases <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-15 provides for continued treatment, whether or not labeled as \u201cpalliative,\u201d as long as there is a showing by competent medical testimony that the treatment is reasonably necessary to cure or relieve the effects of the injury. <em>See Squeo, Supra, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>at 606, 494 A.2d 313; <em>see also Howard, Supra, </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>at 93, 135 A.2d 161. Obviously there is a point beyond which reason dictates that the pain or disability experienced by the worker is insufficient to warrant the expense of active treatment. <em>See Squeo, Supra, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>at 606, 494 A.2d 313. This is not the situation presented here. Dr. Schwartz\u2019s testimony that additional treatment would reduce the petitioner\u2019s symptomatology and would restore function was accepted by the judge and is sufficient to meet the statutory requirement of reasonable necessity. This court concludes that the judge\u2019s findings could reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the record, and that his conclusions are legally sustainable as a correct interpretation of the Act. <em>See Kordulak, Supra, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>at 599, 210 A.2d 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">We note, however, that the order entered provides that continued physical therapy is to be provided until the petitioner is relieved of the effects of the injury, is discharged from treatment or by further order of the court. This language requiring the employer to provide treatment until petitioner is relieved of the effects of the injury has the potential for extending treatment beyond the parameters of the proofs upon which the judge based his ruling, and thereby exceeds the judge\u2019s oral determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>directing that the employer \u201cprovide the additional treatment to petitioner\u2019s low back.\u201d We were advised at oral argument that treatment has not yet been rendered, thereby further disabling the petitioner. Therefore, an amended order should be entered in accordance with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">We are constrained to add that we find it extremely disconcerting that despite the absence of a stay, the treatment, ordered by the Judge of Compensation after petitioner was compelled to wait 15 months for relief to finally be ordered, has not yet been provided. We consider the failure of the system to provide a prompt remedy to petitioner to be a matter for the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation to investigate and to take appropriate remedial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
