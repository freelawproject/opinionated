The indictment also charged Rosario and Negroni with other crimes. Mat\u00edas was convicted on several of the counts in a separate trial. Rosario then pled guilty and agreed to testify against his codefendants. Following a protracted trial, defendant was found guilty of conspiracy but was acquitted of the remaining charges. Negroni was convicted on several of the counts and was acquitted on others. After denying defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal, the trial judge imposed a custodial term of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Defendant appeals, contending (1) the trial judge erroneously refused to instruct the jury in accordance with defendant\u2019s requests to charge on statutory entrapment, (2) due process entrapment was established as a matter of law, and (3) the trial judge erred by propounding special interrogatories to the jury in the verdict sheet. We find no merit in these arguments and affirm defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">We need not recount the facts at length. Investigator Edward DiMaggio of the Bergen County Narcotics Task Force first met defendant while purchasing ice cream at a Dairy Queen she owned. The two engaged in conversation for approximately twenty minutes. Defendant asked numerous personal questions concerning DiMaggio\u2019s employment and marital status. Although the investigator had no reason to suspect defendant of criminal activity, in order to protect his undercover status, he claimed that he had just flown to New Jersey from Florida where he had left his girlfriend. DiMaggio added that he had not worked in a long time. Defendant pointedly asked DiMaggio why he had left Florida in \u201csuch a hurry.\u201d The nature of defendant\u2019s inquiry raised suspicions in DiMaggio\u2019s mind, but, after accepting her business card, the investigator made no further effort to continue the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Approximately a week later, however, DiMaggio telephoned defendant. In the course of their conversation, defendant repeated her questions regarding DiMaggio\u2019s lack of employment and ultimately asked him whether he was a drug dealer. DiMaggio explained that he had sold cocaine in Miami, but had no supplies or connections in New Jersey. Defendant then offered to assist DiMaggio in obtaining a supplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Defendant later introduced DiMaggio to Rosario. The three met at the Dairy Queen where they discussed purchasing varying amounts of cocaine. There followed a series of transactions in which DiMaggio and other members of the narcotics task force purchased increasingly large amounts of cocaine from Rosario, Mat\u00edas and Negroni. Rosario testified at trial that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>asked him what she would receive from the first deal. Although Rosario promised to give defendant cocaine, he never delivered, choosing to share the profits with Mat\u00edas and Negroni instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Arrangements were made for DiMaggio to purchase a full kilo of cocaine. However, defendant learned that the BMW driven by DiMaggio was listed as \u201cnot on file\u201d with the Division of Motor Vehicles. She also found that a telephone number given by one of the agents who had accompanied DiMaggio, Michael Rodriguez, belonged to the Bergen County Narcotics Task Force. Defendant immediately confronted DiMaggio with what she had learned, and the two agreed to meet at the Dairy Queen.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Lieutenant John Quigley, posing as a member of DiMaggio\u2019s drug network, accompanied DiMaggio to the meeting. In order to shift suspicion from themselves, Quigley and DiMaggio told defendant they suspected Rodriguez was either a police officer or an informant. Although defendant expressed concerns about being arrested and jeopardizing her suppliers, Quigley and DiMaggio apparently managed to alleviate her suspicions.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">On the next day, Quigley met alone with defendant to discuss the purchase of the kilo. Although defendant appeared apprehensive, she discussed the price of the cocaine and how much money she wanted for her role in the transaction. She specifically demanded $2,500 and a quantity of cocaine for her personal use. In later meetings with defendant, Quigley explained that he had phased DiMaggio out of the transaction because of DiMaggio\u2019s friendship with Rodriguez. He subsequently showed defendant a briefcase containing $30,500. After seeing the money, defendant, in Quigley\u2019s presence, telephoned Rosario and arranged for the sale of the cocaine. Defendant was later given a \u201csample\u201d of the kilo.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Arrests were made when Rosario, Mat\u00edas, and Negroni attempted to deliver the cocaine to Quigley. The investigators retrieved a knapsack containing over two pounds of the drug. In an oral statement later given to the police, defendant admitted her role in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Defendant at trial did not contest most of the State\u2019s evidence, but relied instead on the defense of entrapment. She claimed that she had been seduced by DiMaggio, who ultimately persuaded her to introduce him to a drug supplier. According to her testimony, she had never sold drugs, but knew at least one dealer who had previously supplied her with cocaine. Defendant claimed that she reluctantly participated in the drug transaction because she was \u201cromantically involved\u201d with DiMaggio, who repeatedly assured her she was blameless.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">It is against this factual backdrop that we consider defendant\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">We reject defendant\u2019s claim that the trial judge committed reversible error when he refused to instruct the jury in accordance with the requests to charge submitted by the defense. We have carefully examined the trial judge\u2019s jury instructions, which tracked the model charge on entrapment. We find no error capable of producing an unjust result.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">In several recent decisions, our Supreme Court has traced the evolution of New Jersey law dealing with entrapment. We see no need to tread upon ground so exhaustively covered in <em>State v. Florez, 134 N.J. </em>570, 636 A.2d 1040 (1994), <em>State v. Fogarty, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>59, 607 A.2d 624 (1992), and <em>State v. Johnson, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>458, 606 A.2d 315 (1992). Suffice it to say, New Jersey law recognizes both statutory entrapment and due process entrapment. Under the Code of Criminal Justice, entrapment is an affirmative defense which the defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>State v. Florez, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 583, 636 A.2d 1040. The statutory defense, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-12, has both subjective and objective elements. <em>State v. Rockholt, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>570, 579, 476 A.2d 1236 (1994). \u201cSubjective entrapment occurs when the police implant a criminal plan in the mind of an innocent person who would not ordinarily have committed the offense.\u201d <em>State v. Florez, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 583-84, 636 A.2d 1040. Objective entrapment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>takes place when the police conduct \u201cis so egregious as to \u2018impugn the integrity of the court\u2019 \u201d permitting a conviction or \u201ccauses an average citizen to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584, 636 A.2d 1040 (quoting <em>State v. Fogarty, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 65, 607 A.2d 624). \u201cThe statutory entrapment defense based upon both subjective and objective elements is an issue that the jury must determine.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">In contrast, due process entrapment focuses exclusively on government conduct. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 470, 606 A.2d 315. Due process entrapment occurs when government conduct is \u201cpatently wrongful in that it constitutes an abuse of lawful power, perverts the proper role of government, and offends principles of fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473, 606 A.2d 315; <em>see generally State v. Talbot, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>160, 364 A.2d 9 (1976). Due process entrapment poses an issue of law that must be decided by the court. <em>State v. Florez, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 584, 636 A.2d 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The trial judge\u2019s instructions on statutory entrapment clearly apprised the jury of the subjective and objective elements required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-12. Although the judge\u2019s instructions did not follow defendant\u2019s requests to charge word for word, the essential legal requisites of the defense were plainly conveyed to the jury. Indeed, in some respects the charge as given was overly favorable to the defense. For example, the judge told the jury the State bears the burden of proving defendant\u2019s predisposition to commit the crime \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubts\u201d This instruction is wrong because it tends to fragment the requisites of the defense and dilutes the defendant\u2019s statutory duty to establish entrapment by a preponderance of the evidence. N.J.S.A 2C:2-12b.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">In any event, the only principle contained in defendant\u2019s requests that was not arguably conveyed to the jury pertains to a guideline adopted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation which bars an officer from offering to a suspect an inducement to commit a crime unless there is reasonable indication the subject is predisposed to commit the offense. The United States Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>referred to the guideline in <em>Jacobson v. United States, </em>503 <em>U.S. </em>540, 549 n. 2, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>1535, 1540, 118 L.Ed.2d 174, 184 (1992). There, the Court said that a defendant\u2019s predisposition must exist prior to the defendant\u2019s \u201cbeing approached by Government agents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1540, 118 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 184. Our Supreme Court has similarly stated in the context of due process entrapment that the \u201cpolice should ordinarily have a reasonable suspicion that the targeted defendant would be likely to engage in the commission of the crime contemplated.\u201d <em>State v. Florez, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 587, 636 A.2d 1040; <em>see also State v. Johnson, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 475, 606 A.2d 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">We do not read these opinions as requiring that the police must have evidence of a defendant\u2019s predisposition before they ever seek to contact him. The courts have never required that law enforcement officers have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity before commencing an investigation. To the contrary, we have long recognized that \u201c[t]he police officer\u2019s duties include vital preventive roles.\u201d <em>State v. Dilley, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>460, 464, 231 A.2d 353 (1967). In other contexts, it has been said that the police do not violate constitutional principles by \u201c \u2018merely approaching an individual on the street or in another public place, by asking him if he is willing to answer some questions, by putting questions to him if the person is willing to listen, or by offering as evidence in a criminal prosecution his voluntary answers to such questions.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>490, 497, 517 A.2d 859 (1986) (quoting <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 <em>U.S. </em>491, 497, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1319, 1324, 75 L.Ed.2d 229, 236 (1983)). <em>See also State v. Sheffield, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>441, 447, 303 A.2d 68, <em>cert. denied, </em>414 <em>U.S. </em>876, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>83, 38 L.Ed.2d 121 (1973). There are a myriad of daily street encounters between citizens and police which are initiated by the police for a wide variety of purposes. We know of no constitutional requirement that all such encounters must be preceded by a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">It is certainly reasonable to require law enforcement officers to have some reasonable suspicion that a citizen is predisposed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>commit a crime before offering that citizen an inducement to participate in a criminal venture. It is far different to suggest that law enforcement officers may not even approach a citizen to determine whether such a predisposition exists without first harboring a reasonable suspicion of the citizen\u2019s criminal inclination. There is a distinction between \u201cgovernment conduct that merely highlights the temptation of the crime itself\u2019 and government conduct that threatens, coerces, or induces a person into committing criminal activity. <em>Jacobson v. United States, </em>503 <em>U.S. </em>at 558, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1545, 118 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 190 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">In this case, for example, no evidence was presented that DiMaggio offered defendant an inducement to commit a crime before she expressed an interest in drug activity. Although DiMaggio had no hard evidence that defendant was involved in the drug trade before telephoning her, defendant\u2019s subsequent statements clearly raised a reasonable suspicion that she was so inclined. Thus, the trial judge did not err by refusing to charge the jury that a police officer may not offer a citizen an inducement to commit a crime without having first a reasonable suspicion of the targeted defendant\u2019s predisposition. The evidence did not support such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">We add that even if we are incorrect regarding the distinction we have drawn, we would not reverse defendant\u2019s conviction in light of the strong evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt. We would find any error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">We find no basis to disturb the trial judge\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s post-verdict motion for a judgment of acquittal. The record does not support defendant\u2019s claim of due process entrapment. In reaching this conclusion, we have applied the factors enunciated in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 474, 606 A.2d 315. The defense was disproved by clear and convincing evidence. <em>State v. Florez, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 590-91, 636 A.2d 1040. While defendant\u2019s claim that she was seduced by DiMaggio is indeed disturb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>ing, it was not substantiated by the evidence presented at trial. We note that defendant\u2019s testimony on this point was riddled with contradictions and inconsistencies and was not corroborated by independent proofs. Moreover, defendant continued to participate in the conspiracy long after DiMaggio\u2019s role ended. It cannot fairly be said that due process entrapment was established as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">We quickly dispose of defendant\u2019s contention that the trial judge erred by submitting special interrogatories to the jury. The short answer to this argument is that the verdict sheet does not contain special interrogatories. Rather, it lists each count of the indictment and specifies the date, place and crime alleged, followed by spaces for the jury to check \u201cnot guilty\u201d or \u201cguilty,\u201d and blanks for the amount of the cocaine where gradation is in issue. The verdict sheet fully complied with <em>R. </em>3:19-1 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The singular vice of special interrogatories \u201cis their potential for destroying the ability of the jury to deliberate upon the issue of guilt or innocence free of extraneous influences.\u201d <em>State v. Simon, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>191, 199, 398 A.2d 861 (1979). Special interrogatories \u201ccan constitute a form of mental conditioning which is antithetical to the untrammeled functioning of the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200, 398 A.2d 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">Here, the verdict sheet did not have the capacity to proselytize the jury to the guilt of the defendant. Nor did it have the potential for perverting the jury\u2019s deliberative processes by encroaching upon its freedom in structuring its inquiry. As we noted earlier, the trial was a lengthy one, and the indictment had multiple counts. It would have been extremely difficult for the jury to have deliberated without specific references to the charges, dates and locations alleged. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>We note one further point before leaving the subject. Defendant contends that the verdict sheet should have contained a specific reference to the defense of entrapment. \u201cNot guilty by reason of entrapment\u201d is not a separate verdict, since, unlike a finding of \u201cnot guilty by reason of insanity,\u201d it has no independent consequences. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-8; <em>R. </em>3:19-2. We find no error in the trial judge\u2019s failure to make specific reference to the defense of entrapment in the verdict sheet. <em>See State v. Florez, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>570, 591, 636 A.2d 1040 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
