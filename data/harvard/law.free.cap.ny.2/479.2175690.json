This Court has a history of rejecting the State Commission on Judicial Conduct\u2019s determination of removal, and this case fits within the criteria to reject the sanction of removal. <em>(Matter of Kiley, </em>74 NY2d 364; <em>Matter of Shilling, </em>51 NY2d 397; <em>Matter of Skinner, </em>91 NY2d 142; <em>Matter of Watson, </em>100 NY2d 290; <em>Matter of LaBelle, </em>79 NY2d 350; <em>Matter of Edwards, </em>67 NY2d 153; <em>Matter of Kelso, </em>61 NY2d 82; <em>Matter of Cunningham, </em>57 NY2d 270; <em>Matter of Quinn v State Commn. on Jud.

The Commission decided that petitioner should be removed from office because of (1) conduct as an attorney in converting funds from an escrow account and (2) conduct as a judge which, the Commission found, was intended to retaliate against the Westchester County District Attorney for making a previous complaint to the Commission about petitioner. In view of the conduct of petitioner that led to this and five previous Commission proceedings, we accept the sanction as determined by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s Previous History with the Commission</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">In 1993, the Commission sent petitioner a Letter of Dismissal and Caution addressing two instances of petitioner\u2019s misuse of his judicial position. He had directed some defendants who appeared before him \u201cto attend a village board meeting to complain about snow emergency regulations\u201d and thus to \u201cadvance [petitioner\u2019s] personal position on . . . snow emergency signs.\u201d He had also made, from the bench, a complaint to an attorney for a carting company that was a defendant in a criminal proceeding before him; petitioner had expressed unhappiness with the company\u2019s operation of trucks on a Mount Kisco street. The Commission dismissed the complaint against petitioner that was based on these incidents, but cautioned him to adhere to the relevant provisions of the Rules of Judicial Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">In 1996, the Commission admonished petitioner on the basis of two separate series of events. The first of these occurred during a criminal case before petitioner in which the defendant was the son of people petitioner had represented. Petitioner telephoned the complaining witness ex parte and made favorable remarks about the defendant that persuaded the witness to withdraw the complaint. Petitioner then dismissed the charges, over the prosecution\u2019s objection, without disclosing either his prior relationship with the defendant\u2019s family or his conversation with the witness. The Commission found that petitioner\u2019s telephone call and his failure to disclose it created an \u201cappearance of favoritism.\u201d The other basis for the 1996 admonition was a practice followed by petitioner for a few months in late 1993 and early 1994 of conducting arraignments in the Mount Kisco police station, rather than in a public courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">In 1997, petitioner received two more Letters of Dismissal and Caution from the Commission. The first of these related to a lawsuit by petitioner\u2019s sister against the Village of Mount Kisco, in which petitioner had listed himself as his sister\u2019s attorney and engaged in settlement discussions with counsel for the insurance carrier. The Commission told petitioner that \u201c[a] part-time judge should not act as an attorney in a lawsuit against the municipality in which the judge sits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Later in 1997, the Commission again cautioned petitioner, this time on the basis of a letter petitioner had written on judicial stationery to a former public official \u201cconcerning files that [the recipient] had supposedly kept on [petitioner] and oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>ers.\u201d Petitioner had \u201cdemanded a list of all those upon whom such files were maintained.\u201d The Commission told petitioner that \u201c[b]y using judicial stationery in connection with what was essentially a private, political dispute, you used the prestige of your office to further your personal interests.\u201d The Commission added: \u201cIt is troubling that even on reflection you insist that the use of judicial stationery under these circumstances was appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">In 1999, petitioner received his last Letter of Dismissal and Caution. This one concerned an attorney who had appeared before him. The Commission\u2019s 1999 letter stated that \u201cin several cases, you advised clients of [the attorney] that he had made a complaint to the Commission against you and inquired as to whether they would seek your recusal.\u201d The Commission said that by taking this approach\u2014i.e., by making the attorney\u2019s clients aware of the problem, rather than simply deciding for himself whether he should be recused\u2014petitioner was \u201cinterfering with attorney-client relationships in apparent retaliation for the complaint made against you.\u201d The Commission also noted that, in one case where the attorney was defense counsel, petitioner \u201crestored the case to the court calendar a day after it had been disposed of so that [he] could discuss an advisory opinion concerning disqualification with [the attorney].\u201d This conduct, the Commission\u2019s letter stated, \u201cconstituted abuse of your judicial powers\u201d because petitioner had placed the defendant again in jeopardy in order to \u201cmake a point\u201d with her attorney. The Commission added that this \u201cextraordinary procedure . . . created the reasonable impression that you were retaliating against [the attorney].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The Present Proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">A. The Escrow</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The first of the two charges against petitioner that the Commission sustained in this proceeding arose out of petitioner\u2019s private law practice. In 1999, while petitioner was representing the executrix of an estate, a tax refund check, made out to the executrix, was sent to petitioner. Without his client\u2019s knowledge or consent, petitioner deposited the check in his escrow account and then wrote a check on that account to himself for his attorney\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">As a result of this action, petitioner was suspended from the practice of law for one year. <em>(Matter of Cerbone, </em>295 AD2d 66 [2d Dept 2002].) In choosing to suspend petitioner rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>to disbar him the Appellate Division relied upon \u201cthe totality of circumstances, including the absence of venality.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 68.)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">B. The Dispute with the District Attorney</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The second charge sustained by the Commission in this proceeding is based on petitioner\u2019s inappropriate expressions of displeasure with the Westchester County District Attorney during 2001 and 2002. This displeasure apparently grew out of the proceeding which led the Commission to admonish petitioner in 1996. As noted above, the Commission found that petitioner had acted improperly by having an ex parte conversation with a complaining witness that led her to withdraw a criminal complaint. Petitioner evidently blamed the District Attorney for bringing this incident to the Commission\u2019s attention, and as a result, the Commission found in the present case, he engaged in the following conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">1. He \u201cprepared and distributed to defense attorneys who appeared before him in criminal cases a form letter which he asked them to complete and mail to the office of the District Attorney.\u201d The form letter disclaimed any professional or social relationship between the defendant in the criminal case and petitioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">2. When distributing the form letter, petitioner \u201cfrequently made remarks to the effect that the District Attorney had previously filed a complaint against him which had cost him half a million dollars to defend against and that due to illnesses in his family he had neither the time or money to defend himself against future complaints.\u201d These remarks were made in open court, in the hearing of an assistant district attorney and of defense lawyers and defendants present for the call of the criminal calendar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">3. Petitioner \u201crecused himself <em>sua sponte </em>from four shoplifting cases while stating that he was doing so because the District Attorney had failed to prosecute former Mount Kisco employees for their private use of computers belonging to the Town, despite clear evidence of their crimes.\u201d As a result of petitioner\u2019s recusal, the cases had to be reassigned to petitioner\u2019s co-justice, who would not sit until the following month, thus necessitating an extra court appearance for defendants and their lawyers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">4. Petitioner stated on several occasions to those present in his court \u201cthat his office telephone was \u2018tapped,\u2019 that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>District Attorney was keeping \u2018dossiers\u2019 on him, and that he was \u2018being watched.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">C. The Commission\u2019s Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Based on its findings of fact, the Commission concluded that petitioner had violated eight provisions of the Rules of Judicial Conduct (22 NYCRR part 100): sections 100.1 (general requirement of \u201chigh standards of conduct\u201d); 100.2 (A) (obligation to \u201crespect and comply with the law and . . . act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary\u201d); 100.3 (B) (2) (obligation to \u201crequire order and decorum in proceedings\u201d); 100.3 (B) (3) (obligation to be \u201cpatient, dignified and courteous\u201d to litigants and others); 100.3 (B) (4) (obligation to perform duties \u201cwithout bias or prejudice\u201d); 100.3 (B) (7) (obligation to \u201cdispose of all judicial matters promptly, efficiently and fairly\u201d); 100.4 (A) (2) (prohibition on extrajudicial activities that \u201cdetract from the dignity of judicial office\u201d); and 100.4 (A) (3) (prohibition on extrajudicial activities that \u201cinterfere with the proper performance of judicial duties\u201d or are \u201cincompatible with judicial office\u201d). The Commission also determined that, because petitioner \u201cconverted funds entrusted to his care\u201d and \u201cused his courtroom as a forum for expressing his personal grievances against the District Attorney,\u201d he \u201clacks the judgment and temperament to sit on the bench and is unfit for judicial office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Our role in this proceeding is to review the Commission\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, and to decide whether the sanction determined by the Commission, or another sanction or no sanction, should be imposed. (NY Const, art VI, \u00a7 22 [d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Petitioner does not challenge the Commission\u2019s findings of fact. We agree with those findings and with the Commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>conclusions that petitioner violated sections 100.1, 100.2 (A) and 100.3 (B) (3), (4) and (7) of the Rules of Judicial Conduct. It is not necessary to consider the other sections relied on by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Petitioner\u2019s sole argument is that the sanction of removal is too severe for this case. In making this argument, he relies on our statement in <em>Matter of Cunningham </em>(57 NY2d 270, 275 [1982]): \u201cRemoval is an extreme sanction and should be imposed only in the event of truly egregious circumstances .... Indeed, we have indicated that removal should not be ordered for conduct that amounts simply to poor judgment, or even extremely poor judgment ...\u201d (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Petitioner points out that we have sometimes rejected the sanction of removal where we found misconduct to be based on failings of judgment rather than on more profound flaws of character. <em>(See Matter of Kelso, </em>61 NY2d 82 [1984] [judge who, as a private lawyer, mishandled a case and misled his client about it, but did not receive any fee or other sum from his client]; <em>Matter of LaBelle, </em>79 NY2d 350, 363 [1992] [improper rulings that were \u201cmotivated primarily by compassion\u201d]; <em>Matter of Kiley, </em>74 NY2d 364, 370 [1989] [improper actions at the request of friends with no \u201celement of venality, selfish or dishonorable purpose\u201d].) The Commission stresses that the present case, unlike those cited above, involved the conversion of client funds, and relies on <em>Matter of Boulanger </em>(61 NY2d 89 [1984]), <em>Matter of Tamsen </em>(100 NY2d 19 [2003]) and <em>Matter of Embser </em>(90 NY2d 711 [1997]) as holding that financial improprieties are the sort of egregious conduct that warrant removal. Petitioner responds that in <em>Boulanger, Tamsen </em>and <em>Embser </em>there was an element of \u201cvenality,\u201d which the Appellate Division, in suspending petitioner from the practice of law for one year, found to be absent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">In deciding the appropriate sanction we consider both the severity of the misconduct involved in this proceeding and petitioner\u2019s extensive prior history. This is his <em>sixth </em>encounter with judicial discipline, and several of the prior proceedings were, as this one is, based on more than one incident. While the facts of the cases differ greatly, many of them involve a common theme: petitioner seems incapable of understanding, despite repeated warnings, that a judge performing judicial duties must both act and appear to act as an impartial arbiter serving the public interest, not someone with an axe to grind. A judge who does not know this, and is not capable of learning it, should not be on the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Accordingly, the determined sanction should be accepted without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo, Read and R.S. Smith concur in per curiam opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Determined sanction accepted, without costs, and Joseph J. Cerbone removed from the office of Justice of the Mount Kisco Town Court, Westchester County.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b530-9\"> Petitioner asserted at the hearing before the Commission in this case that his telephone had indeed been \u201ctapped\u201d from 1993 to 1997. The basis for this allegation was that, until 1997, two lines used by petitioner\u2019s court were linked to the telephone system of the police department (which was in the same building), so that the police department\u2019s recording equipment could record calls originating from those two lines. After petitioner became aware of and complained about this situation, the District Attorney conducted an investigation and concluded that, while the connection between the court and police lines did exist, neither court nor police personnel had been aware of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">Evidence before the Commission also established that the District Attorney had in her file four documents relating to the matter that resulted in the 1996 admonition. These documents, in petitioner\u2019s view, constituted a \u201cdossier.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
