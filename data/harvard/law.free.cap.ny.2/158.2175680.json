Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The issue here is whether a liability insurer is obligated to defend and indemnify its insured, a \u201cbeauty salon/health spa,\u201d in an action brought against the insured based on an alleged sexual assault by the insured\u2019s employee. We hold that the alleged assault was an \u201caccident\u201d within the meaning of the policy, and that the policy\u2019s exclusions for injuries expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured and for bodily injury arising out of body massage do not apply. We therefore hold that the insurer is obligated to defend and indemnify.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">Appellant, RJC Realty Holding Corp., doing business as \u201cPure Maximus Spa/Salon,\u201d obtained an insurance policy including \u201cBusinessowners Liability Coverage\u201d from respondent Republic Franklin Insurance Co.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the policy, Republic agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>indemnify and defend RJC against claims for \u201cbodily injury\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d as defined in the policy. \u201cOccurrence\u201d is defined as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Two exclusions in the policy are also relevant here. The policy states that it is not applicable to \u201c \u2018[bjodily injury\u2019 . . . expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured\u201d or to \u201c \u2018[b]odily injury\u2019 . . . arising out of . . . [b]ody massage other than facial massage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Marie and Thomas Harrison brought an action against RJC and a masseur employed by RJC, alleging that the masseur performed a body massage on Marie Harrison and that Marie Harrison \u201cwas the victim of improper sexual contact.\u201d The Harrisons alleged that RJC was liable to them for negligently hiring and retaining the masseur, and for failing properly to supervise his activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">RJC notified Republic of the alleged sexual assault, and subsequently provided Republic with a copy of the Harrison complaint. Republic responded by disclaiming coverage, relying on the definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d and the two exclusions quoted above.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">RJC sued Republic, seeking a declaratory judgment that Republic was obligated to defend and indemnify RJC in the Harrison action. On cross motions for summary judgment, Supreme Court ruled in RJC\u2019s favor. Supreme Court found the issue under the \u201cexpected or intended\u201d exclusion to be controlled by our decision in <em>Agoado Realty Corp. v United Intl. Ins. Co. </em>(95 NY2d 141 [2000]) and stated: \u201cSince the conduct was not intentional on the part of the insured, the exclusion does not apply.\u201d Supreme Court found the issue under the \u201cbody massage\u201d exclusion a \u201ccloser question,\u201d but decided that question in the insured\u2019s favor also.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">On Republic\u2019s appeal, the Appellate Division reversed, holding that the \u201cexpected or intended\u201d exclusion applied. In the view of the Appellate Division, the decisive fact was that the Harrison complaint alleged \u201can intentional sexual assault by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>RJC\u2019s employee,\u201d which the Appellate Division held \u201cfalls within the exclusionary language of the policy.\u201d (303 AD2d 573, 574 [2003].) We granted RJC\u2019s motion for leave to appeal, and now reverse the Appellate Division order and reinstate the Supreme Court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">A. The \u201cAccident\u201d and \u201cExpected or Intended\u201d Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The questions of whether the alleged sexual assault was an \u201caccident\u201d and therefore an \u201coccurrence\u201d within the meaning of the policy, and whether it was excluded from coverage as an act \u201cexpected or intended from the standpoint of the insured\u201d are both controlled by Agoado, where we construed a policy containing identical language.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">In <em>Agoado, </em>the issue was whether the insurer was required to indemnify its insureds, the landlords of a building, against a claim brought by the estate of a tenant who had been murdered in the building by an unknown assailant. We held that the murder, though obviously intended from the murderer\u2019s point of view, was an \u201caccident\u201d within the meaning of the policy. Relying on <em>Miller v Continental Ins. Co. </em>(40 NY2d 675 [1976]), we said that: \u201cin deciding whether a loss is the result of an accident, it must be determined, <em>from the point of view of the insured, </em>whether the loss was unexpected, unusual and unforeseen.\u201d (95 NY2d at 145 [emphasis in original].) Since the landlords in <em>Agoado </em>obviously did not expect or intend the tenant\u2019s murder, we held that it was an \u201caccident\u201d from their point of view. We also held that\u2014as seems self-evident on the facts of Agoado\u2014the murder was not within the policy exclusion for conduct \u201cexpected or intended from the standpoint of\u2019 the landlords <em>(id. </em>at 146).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">The only significant difference between this case and <em>Agoado </em>is that here the alleged perpetrator of the assault was the insured\u2019s employee. If\u2014as we must assume for present purposes\u2014the assault occurred at all, it was obviously expected and intended by the masseur, and was not an accident from his point of view. Thus, the critical question is whether the masseur\u2019s expectation and intention in committing the assault should be attributed to his employer, RJC.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">This question is answered in the negative by our decision in <em>Judith M. v Sisters of Charity Hosp. </em>(93 NY2d 932 [1999]). In that case, a hospital patient sued the hospital for a sexual as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>sault allegedly committed by the hospital\u2019s employee. The patient claimed that the hospital was vicariously liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior. We rejected this contention, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">\u201cThe doctrine of respondeat superior renders an employer vicariously liable for torts committed by an employee acting within the scope of the employment. Pursuant to this doctrine, the employer may be liable when the employee acts negligently or intentionally, so long as the tortious conduct is generally foreseeable and a natural incident of the employment <em>(Riviello v Waldron, </em>47 NY2d 297, 304). If, however, an employee \u2018for purposes of his own departs from the line of his duty so that for the time being his acts constitute an abandonment of his service, the master is not liable\u2019 <em>(Jones v Weigand, </em>134 App Div 644, 645, quoted in <em>Baker v Allen &amp; Arnink Auto Renting Co., </em>231 NY 8, 13). <em>Assuming plaintiff\u2019s allegations of sexual abuse are true, it is clear that the employee here departed from his duties for solely personal motives unrelated to the furtherance of the Hospital\u2019s business (see, Mataxas v North Shore Univ. Hosp., </em>211 AD2d 762, 763). Accordingly, the courts below properly dismissed plaintiffs respondeat superior cause of action.\u201d (93 NY2d at 933 [emphasis added].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Under <em>Judith M., </em>the masseur\u2019s alleged act here could not be attributed to RJC for purposes of the respondeat superior doctrine. Here too, if the allegation of sexual abuse is true, the masseur \u201cdeparted from his duties for solely personal motives unrelated to the furtherance of [RJC\u2019s] business.\u201d We see no reason not to apply the same test to the question of whether the masseur\u2019s expectations or intentions should be attributed to RJC in determining the applicability of Republic\u2019s insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The parties here agreed that the policy would cover only an \u201caccident\u201d and would not apply to certain acts \u201cexpected or intended\u201d by RJC. When they did so, they could reasonably have anticipated that the rules of respondeat superior would govern the question of when a corporate entity is deemed to expect or intend its employee\u2019s actions. Since the masseur\u2019s actions here were not RJC\u2019s actions for purposes of the respondeat superior doctrine, they were \u201cunexpected, unusual and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>unforeseen\u201d from RJC\u2019s point of view, and were not \u201cexpected or intended\u201d by RJC. Accordingly, they were an \u201caccident,\u201d within the coverage of the policy, and were not excluded by the \u201cexpected or intended\u201d clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">B. The \u201cBody Massage\u201d Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Like Supreme Court, we find the question of whether the \u201cbodily injury\u201d for which the Harrisons sued RJC arose out of a \u201cbody massage\u201d to be a closer one, but like Supreme Court we resolve it in RJC\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">It is true that the alleged act for which the Harrisons sued RJC occurred during a body massage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The insurance policy, however, does not exclude coverage for all alleged conduct during a body massage, but only for <em>\u201cinjury . . . arising out of </em>. . . [b]ody massage.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We think the words of the exclusion are most plausibly read to refer to a bruise or similar injury inflicted on the customer by a massage itself, not to the emotional or physical injury resulting from a sexual assault by a masseur. At least that is a reasonable reading of the words, and an exclusion in an insurance policy can negate coverage only where it is stated \u201cin clear and unmistakable language [and] is subject to no other reasonable interpretation.\u201d <em>(Continental Cas. Co. v Rapid-American Corp., </em>80 NY2d 640, 652 [1993].) We therefore hold the \u201cbody massage\u201d exclusion to be inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the judgment of Supreme Court reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Cipabick, Geaffeo and Read concur; Judge Rosenblatt taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-10\">. Utica National Insurance Group, apparently Republic\u2019s parent or affiliate, is also a party in this case. It appears from the record that Republic is the corporation that actually issued the policy. \u201cRepublic\u201d in this opinion refers both to Republic and to Utica National.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b208-9\">. The policy\u2019s definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d includes \u201c[s]hock, mental anguish or mental injury.\u201d It is not disputed that the injury involved in this case is \u201cbodily injury\u201d within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b208-10\">. RJC raises an issue as to the timeliness of Republic\u2019s disclaimer. That issue is moot in light of our holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b211-11\">. The Harrisons\u2019 complaint alleges that the masseur gave Mrs. Harrison a body massage and that he committed sexual assault, but does not specifically say that the two acts were simultaneous. That is the likeliest inference from the complaint, however, and the letter from RJC\u2019s attorney notifying Republic of the claim specifically refers to \u201csexual abuse involving a customer during the course of a massage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
