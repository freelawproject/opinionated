Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 237 (a) does, and was specifically amended to, protect attorneys discharged without cause. <em>(Matter of New York Post Corp. v Leibowitz, </em>2 NY2d 677; <em>People ex rel.

The Appellate Division\u2019s decision is inconsistent with the holdings of this Court in <em>Klein v Eubank </em>(87 NY2d 459 [1996]). <em>(Intar-Tass Russian News Agency v Russian Kurier, Inc., </em>140 F3d 442; <em>Shalom Toy v Each &amp; Every One of Members of N.Y. Prop. Ins. Underwriting Assn., </em>239 AD2d 196.) III. The firm\u2019s rights under Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 237 (a) were preserved in prior court decisions and at the time the firm was discharged. <em>(Hogan v Hogan, </em>194 AD2d 520; <em>Redgrave v Redgrave, </em>304 AD2d 1062; <em>Gleckman v Kaplan, </em>215 AD2d 527.) IV.

The order of the Appellate Division must be reversed. <em>(Klein v Eubank, </em>87 NY2d 459; <em>O\u2019Shea v O\u2019Shea, </em>93 NY2d 187.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b648-9\"><em>Alexander Potruch, L.L.C., </em>Mine\u00f3la <em>(Alexander Potruch </em>and <em>Michael C.

Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 237 (a) does not grant a \u201cdischarged\u201d or \u201cformer\u201d attorney the right to seek an award of counsel fees in its own name as against the adversary spouse. <em>(O\u2019Shea v O\u2019Shea, </em>93 NY2d 187; <em>Charpie v Charpie, 271 </em>AD2d 169; <em>Katzman v Katzman, </em>284 AD2d 160; <em>Sadofsky v Sadofsky, </em>78 AD2d 520; <em>Bartow </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number><em>v Bartow, </em>212 AD2d 564; <em>Hogan v Hogan, </em>194 AD2d 520; <em>Monteleon v Monteleon, 160 </em>AD2d 372; <em>American Home Assur.

II. \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case\u201d appellant\u2019s right to make an application against respondent was not preserved, and a reversal of the Appellate Division\u2019s determination will lead to unintended, negative consequences which could not have been intended by the Legislature. <em>(Campaign for Fiscal Equity v State of New York, </em>100 NY2d 893; <em>DeCabrera v Cabrera-Rosete, </em>70 NY2d 879.) III. The facts in the case of <em>Klein v Eubank </em>(87 NY2d 459 [1996]) do not parallel the facts of the instant matter and do not provide a basis to reverse the majority opinion of the Appellate Division. <em>(Sadofsky v Sadofsky, </em>78 AD2d 520; <em>Haser v Haser, </em>271 AD2d 253; <em>Miller v Kassatly, </em>216 AD2d 260; <em>Kaplan v Reuss, </em>113 AD2d 184.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b649-4\"><em>Elliott Scheinberg, </em>New York City, for American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, New York Chapter, amicus curiae.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXb-\">I. Counsel fees have long been acknowledged as a failsafe to financial disparity which permits the nonmonied spouse, typically the wife, to participate meaningfully in the litigation. <em>(Hinden v Hinden, </em>122 Misc 2d 552; <em>O\u2019Shea v O\u2019Shea, </em>93 NY2d 187; <em>DeCabrera v Cabrera-Rosete, </em>70 NY2d 879; <em>Charpie v Charpie, </em>271 AD2d 169.) II. <em>Frankel v Frankel </em>(309 AD2d 65 [2003]) is contrary to codified principles of statutory construction that the legislative intent be effectuated, first and foremost, and to the precedent authority of <em>O\u2019Shea v O\u2019Shea </em>(93 NY2d 187 [1999]) and <em>DeCabrera v Cabrera-Rosete </em>(70 NY2d 879 [1987]) which held that the elimination of the words \u201cduring the pendency of the action\u201d broadened the scope of the statute with the legislative intent. <em>(Matter of Albano v Kirby, </em>36 NY2d 526; <em>Matter of Hogan v Culkin, </em>18 NY2d 330; <em>Katzman v Katzman, </em>284 AD2d 160.) III. Decisional authority, like its statutory counterpart, has steadfastly held that an absence of ambiguity in a statute does not mandate a substitution for reasoned interpretation: effectuating the legislative intent is the preeminent responsibility. <em>(Fumarelli v Marsam Dev., </em>92 NY2d 298; <em>Matter of Petterson v Daystrom Corp., </em>17 NY2d 32; <em>New York State Bankers Assn. v Albright, </em>38 NY2d 430; <em>Price v Price, </em>69 NY2d 8; <em>Rankin v Shanker, </em>23 NY2d 111; <em>Matter of Albano v Kirby, </em>36 NY2d 526; <em>Matter of Hogan v Culkin, </em>18 NY2d 330; <em>Matter ofSutka v Conners, </em>73 NY2d 395; <em>Matter of Scotto v Dinkins, </em>85 NY2d 209.) IV Statutes are presumed not to work hardships nor injustice, nor are they created in a vacuum to leave parties without a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>remedy; decisional authority and the Legislature have been consistent in their efforts to prevent unjust results to counsel and clients; if permitted to stand, <em>Frankel v Frankel </em>(309 AD2d 65 [2003]) will harm counsel <em>and </em>litigants. <em>(Sadofsky v Sadofsky, </em>78 AD2d 520; <em>Haser v Haser, </em>271 AD2d 253.) <em>V. </em>It is settled law that a timely fee application is key to the preservation of an outgoing attorney\u2019s rights to a hearing within the context of the action; although timely asserted <em>Frankel v Frankel </em>(309 AD2d 65 [2003]) resulted in a forfeiture of the right. <em>(Sadofsky v Sadofsky, 78 </em>AD2d 520; <em>Pratt v Pratt, </em>282 AD2d 941; <em>Matter of Buono v Fantacone, </em>252 AD2d 917; <em>Shapiro v Shapiro, </em>179 AD2d 525; <em>Gleckman v Kaplan, </em>215 AD2d 527; <em>New York Life Ins. Co. v Aitkin, </em>125 NY 660; <em>Matter of Salvano v Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, </em>85 NY2d 173; <em>Rubenfeld v Rubenfeld, </em>279 AD2d 153; <em>Bartow v Bartow, </em>212 AD2d 564; <em>Zielinski v Zielinski, </em>252 AD2d 800.) VI. Outgoing counsel in <em>Frankel v Frankel </em>(309 AD2d 65 [2003]) seeks to preserve a procedural right not to immediately enforce a substantive one to the client\u2019s detriment as seems to concern the majority; these concerns can be easily remedied without prejudice to counsel. <em>(O\u2019Shea v O\u2019Shea, </em>93 NY2d 187; <em>DeCabrera v Cabrera-Rosete, </em>70 NY2d 879.) VII. Pursuant to the principles of statutory construction Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 237 (a) and Judiciary Law \u00a7 475 are statutes in pari materia which must be accorded analogous and parallel readings because they seek to protect the same class of people\u2014 attorneys; <em>Frankel v Frankel </em>(309 AD2d 65 [2003]) contravenes this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Klein v Eubank </em>(87 NY2d 459 [1996]) under section 475. <em>(Kaplan v Reuss, </em>113 AD2d 184, 68 NY2d 693.) VIII. <em>Frankel v Frankel </em>(309 AD2d 65 [2003]) erred in ruling that neither statute nor case law grants a discharged attorney a right to apply in his or her own name for retrospective fees against the adversary spouse, either within or without the matrimonial action. <em>(Klein v Eubank, 87 </em>NY2d 459; <em>Haser v Haser, </em>271 AD2d 253; <em>Kaplan v Reuss, </em>113 AD2d 184, 68 NY2d 693.) IX. Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 237 (a) places counsel for the nonmonied spouse in limited privity directly with the other spouse. <em>(Sadofsky v Sadofsky, 78 </em>AD2d 520; <em>Haser v Haser, </em>271 AD2d 253.) X. <em>Frankel v Frankel </em>(309 AD2d 65 [2003]) not only devastates counsel\u2019s procedural rights but it also assaults his or her substantive rights by exposing uncollected fees to discharge-ability in bankruptcy. <em>(In re Spong, </em>661 F2d 6.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b650-4\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b650-5\">Rosenblatt, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In matrimonial litigation, counsel fee awards have helped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>reduce what would otherwise be a substantial advantage to the monied spouse. Pursuant to Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 237 (a), a lawyer who represents a nonmonied spouse may seek attorneys\u2019 fees from the monied spouse in the divorce action. This appeal raises the question whether attorneys may do so after their clients have discharged them without cause. A divided Appellate Division said no. We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">The Frankels were married in December 1988. The husband was a cardiologist and the wife a homemaker. The husband filed for divorce in 1998, and Supreme Court granted it in 2001. The wife paid her lawyer an initial retainer of $5,000, but the billings soon went well beyond that amount. In June 1999, Supreme Court awarded the wife\u2019s attorney an interim fee of $2,500. Nearly two years later, after a 32-day custody trial, the court granted an additional interim counsel fee of $25,000 on March 12, 2001, to be paid by the husband at the rate of $1,500 per month. Eighteen days later, the wife discharged her lawyer without cause. After taking into account the retainer and the two interim awards, the wife\u2019s lawyer claimed that she owed him considerably more and proceeded against the husband for that amount pursuant to Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 237 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court ruled that even though the wife\u2019s attorney had been discharged, he could look to the husband for counsel fees. The court then ordered a hearing before a special referee to determine the appropriate award. On the husband\u2019s appeal, the Appellate Division reversed, holding that \u201cformer counsel has no standing to pursue the adversary spouse within the matrimonial action\u201d (309 AD2d 65, 69 [2d Dept 2003]).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 237 (a) provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-4\">\u201c[i]n any action or proceeding . . . for a divorce . . . the court may direct either spouse ... to pay such sum or sums of money directly to the attorney of the other spouse to enable that spouse to carry on or defend the action or proceeding as, in the court\u2019s discretion, justice requires, having regard to the circumstances of the case and of the respective parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The statute goes on to say that \u201c[a]ny applications for counsel fees and expenses may be maintained by the attorney for either spouse in [counsel\u2019s] own name in the same proceeding.\u201d The provision is silent, however, as to whether an attorney who has been discharged without cause has the right in the same proceeding to seek counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">A divided Appellate Division concluded that, because he was discharged, the wife\u2019s attorney had no standing to proceed against the husband for counsel fees. The Court interpreted Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 237 (a) as authorizing only \u201cthe current attorney of record\u201d to seek counsel fees against a client\u2019s spouse (309 AD2d at 67). Reading the provision in light of our precedents and the policy interests surrounding the statute, we agree with the Appellate Division dissenters that Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 237 (a) allows an attorney who was discharged without cause to proceed against the monied spouse in the matrimonial litigation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">In <em>O\u2019Shea v O\u2019Shea </em>(93 NY2d 187 [1999]), we considered whether a trial court had discretion to award fees under Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 237 (a) for legal services rendered before and after the divorce action. Although the predecessor statute, former Civil Practice Act \u00a7 1169, included language limiting fee awards to services rendered \u201cduring the pendency\u201d of an action, this clause does not appear in the current statute. In concluding that courts could award counsel fees for services performed both before and after the divorce action itself, we looked not only to this textual change but also to the policy underlying fee shifting in the divorce context. This is a dramatic departure from the American rule that usually requires litigants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>to pay their own legal expenses. We explained that giving courts the power to order a spouse to pay the other\u2019s counsel fees \u201cis designed to redress the economic disparity between the monied spouse and the non-monied spouse\u201d and ensure that \u201cthe matrimonial scales of justice are not unbalanced by the weight of the wealthier litigant\u2019s wallet\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 190).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">That is true here. If lawyers terminated without cause lose their right to petition the court for a fee award from an adversary spouse, the less affluent spouse would suffer the consequences. The spouse with ready and ample funds would have a wide choice of counsel, and the financial wherewithal to maintain the litigation, while the nonmonied spouse would struggle to find a lawyer who might have to go unpaid. A matrimonial lawyer may be willing to carry a client on its accounts receivable books, but not as to accounts that will prove unreceivable. In this regard, the Legislature designed Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 237 (a) to eliminate the disparity between the monied and the nonmonied spouse. The husband\u2019s interpretation would thwart the statutory intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">As amicus American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers points out, the realities of contentious matrimonial litigation require a regular infusion of funds. Although this is a regrettable byproduct of divorce, interpreting the statute to preclude applications like the one at issue here would confound the collection process and discourage attorneys from representing nonmonied litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The husband argues that a rule allowing a wife\u2019s discharged attorney to proceed against him would impede settlements. We disagree. Allowing the application would enable a global settlement that takes into account property distribution and other equities that affect the outcome. Otherwise, the case would be \u201csettled,\u201d leaving unadjudicated the amount of the attorney\u2019s rightfully earned fees and shifting the venue to a plenary proceeding\u2014another lawsuit, with the unpleasant prospect of a judgment against the nonmonied spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the order of Supreme Court, Nassau County, reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Graffeo, Read and R.S. Smith concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-5\">. We note that more frequent interim counsel fee awards would prevent accumulation of bills. As the Committee to Examine Lawyer Conduct in Matrimonial Actions (Committee) noted in a report, \u201c[t]he practice of many judges to defer [pendente lite counsel fee applications] to the trial court essentially delays the awarding of fees until the final settlement or judgment, and often compromises the nonmonied spouse\u2019s ability to adequately litigate the case\u201d (Report of Committee, at 36 [May 4, 1993]). The Committee further observed that if applications for legal fees are denied or deferred, \u201cthe attorney for the nonmonied spouse is left not only without payment for services rendered but without reasonable expectation as to how or whether payment will be made. Considering the protracted nature of divorce actions, both client and attorney are left in limbo for an indefinite period of time, a circumstance which can drive a wedge between attorney and client\u201d (id. at 37; <em>see also </em>Seheinkman, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 14, Domestic Relations Law C237:4 [1999]; Uniform Rules for Trial Cts [22 NYCRR] \u00a7 202.16 [k]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b652-8\">. We note that in the context of Judiciary Law \u00a7 475, we have already held that a discharged attorney may enforce his statutory charging lien (see <em>KLein v Eubank, </em>87 NY2d 459, 462 [1996]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
