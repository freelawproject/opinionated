The Chair rationally construes \u201cboard certified\u201d to mean certification by a medical specialty board, not the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board. <em>(Matter of Rosenblum v New York State Workers\u2019 Compensation Bd., </em>309 AD2d 120; <em>People v Mendez, </em>1 NY3d 15; <em>Diaz v New York Downtown Hosp., </em>99 NY2d 542; <em>Matter of Theroux v Reilly, </em>1 NY3d 232; <em>Castro v United Container Mach.

The Chair\u2019s selection of medical specialty boards recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties or the American Osteopathic Association to provide the required certification comports with its delegation of the authority from the Legislature, furthers the remedial purpose of the statute, and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>in all respects rational. <em>(Matter of Employers Claim Control Serv.

The proper interpretation of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 137 (3) (a) supports the physicians\u2019 position that medical specialty board certification is not required to be an independent medical examination provider. <em>(Matter of Gruber v New York City Dept. of Personnel, </em>89 NY2d 225; <em>Kurcsics v Merchants Mut.

Co., Inc., </em>3 F Supp 2d 223.) II. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Board\u2019s actions in limiting independent medical examination authorization to those holding American Board of Medical Specialties/American Osteopathic Association credentials is arbitrary and capricious. <em>(Matter of Pell v Board of Educ., </em>34 NY2d 222; <em>Kuppersmith v Dowling, </em>93 NY2d 90; <em>New York State Assn. of Counties v Axelrod, </em>78 NY2d 158, 191 AD2d 932, 82 NY2d 705; <em>Matter of Brothers of Mercy Nursing &amp; Rehabilitation Ctr. v Commissioner of N.Y.

If the statute\u2019s reference to \u201cboard certified\u201d is properly interpreted as a reference to medical specialty board as a prerequisite to independent medical examination authorization, then it is an unconstitutional delegation of governmental function to private parties. <em>(General Elec.

We also address whether the regulations promulgated by the WCB appropriately defined \u201cboard certified\u201d as certification by a medical speciality board recognized by either the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) or American Osteopathic Association (AOA) <em>(see </em>12 NYCRR 300.2 [b] [3]).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">In 2000, the Legislature enacted the Injured Workers\u2019 Protection Act (L 2000, ch 473), after a report by the New York State AFL-CIO and the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health detailing the problems with the then-in-place independent medical examination (IME) process<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> within the workers\u2019 compensation system (New York State AFL-CIO and New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health, <em>Unjust Treatment: \u2018Independent\u2019 Medical Examinations &amp; Workers Compensation in New York State </em>&lt;www.nycosh.org/ IME_Reportl.html&gt; [last updated Dec. 30, 2002]). According to the report, the IME system was not sufficiently regulated, resulting in improper and fraudulent examinations and reports. The report made several recommendations, including that IME physicians should be New York State licensed \u201cand certified by the New York State Workers\u2019 Compensation Board\u201d <em>(Unjust Treatment).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">In response, the Injured Workers\u2019 Protection Act added section 137 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law to provide that \u201c[o]nly a New York state licensed and board certified physician, surgeon, podiatrist or any other person authorized to examine or evaluate injury or illness by the board shall perform such independent medical examination\u201d (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 137 [3] [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>The statute goes on to state that IMEs \u201cshall be performed by a practitioner who is licensed and board certified in the state of New York or any other person authorized to examine or evaluate injury or illness by the board\u201d (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 137 [5]). Although the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law does not define the term \u201cboard certified,\u201d it does define \u201c[b]oard\u201d as \u201cthe workmen\u2019s [sic] compensation board of the state of New York\u201d (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 2 [2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">In accordance with the new law, and consistent with the definition of board certified in current use as it relates to fee schedules, the WCB promulgated regulations defining \u201cboard certified.\u201d Those regulations provide that, in order to conduct IMEs, a physician or surgeon must have an appropriate degree, meet the State Board of Medicine\u2019s and Commissioner of Education\u2019s licensing requirements and be \u201cboard certified\u201d as further defined in the regulations <em>(see </em>12 NYCRR 300.2 [b] [2] [ii] [a]). The regulations define \u201cboard certified\u201d as \u201ca physician or surgeon who is certified by a specialty board that is recognized by the [ABMS] or the [AOA]\u201d (12 NYCRR 300.2 [b] [3]). There are separate requirements for podiatrists, chiropractors and psychologists, who are not medical doctors and cannot be certified by the ABMS or AOA <em>(see </em>12 NYCRR 300.2 [b] [2] [ii] [b]-[d]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Petitioners are New York State licensed medical doctors who, prior to the enactment of the challenged provisions, performed IMEs in the course of their practice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The WCB denied petitioners\u2019 requests for authorization to conduct IMEs pursuant to Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 13-b (1) because they were not certified by an appropriate medical specialty board. Many of the petitioners are certified by specialty boards that are not recognized by ABMS or AOA. Some of the petitioners are \u201cCrated\u201d (designated a consultant in a certain speciality) by the WCB. This status is typically granted to those physicians certi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>tied by the ABMS or AOA. However, the WCB occasionally grants a \u201cC\u201d rating to physicians who show a certain level of competence through years of experience, thus allowing such physicians to collect a higher fee for services.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Petitioners commenced separate CPLR article 78 proceedings seeking to annul the portion of 12 NYCRR 300.2 that required physicians to be ABMS or AOA board-certified in order to conduct IMEs, and to annul the WCB\u2019s determination that petitioners were not authorized to conduct IMEs. After consolidating the actions, Supreme Court granted the petitions in part, finding that the language of the statute and the legislative history supported the interpretation that the term \u201cboard certified\u201d referred to the WCB. Specifically, Supreme Court noted that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law defined the term \u201cboard\u201d as the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board <em>(see </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 2 [2]), and held that the term should have the same meaning throughout section 137. The court also concluded that the WCB\u2019s interpretation was irrational and that the determinations denying petitioners authorization to conduct IMEs should be annulled, converted the remainder of the proceedings to a declaratory judgment action and declared 12 NYCRR 300.2 (b) (2) (ii) (a) and 300.2 (b) (3)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> invalid insofar as they required physicians to be ABMS or AOA board certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The Appellate Division affirmed, agreeing that deference to the WCB was not required for this question of pure statutory interpretation. The Court also found that the legislative intent was to give the Chair of the WCB the authority to discipline IME providers and that this purpose was served by making the providers subject to WCB certification (304 AD2d 211, 215-216 [2003]). It did not determine whether the Board\u2019s choice of the ABMS or AOA for certification was rational, finding the WCB\u2019s interpretation incompatible with the statutory language. We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Although we reach the same conclusion as the WCB, this is not a case where its interpretation of a statute is entitled to deference. Deference is generally accorded to an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of statutes it enforces when the interpretation involves some type of specialized knowledge <em>(see Mat</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number><em>ter of Gruber [New York City Dept. of Personnel], </em>89 NY2d 225, 231 [1996]). \u201cBy contrast, where \u2018the question is one of pure statutory reading and analysis, dependent only on accurate apprehension of legislative intent, there is little basis to rely on any special competence or expertise of the administrative agency\u2019 ... In such circumstances, the judiciary need not accord any deference to the agency\u2019s determination, and is free to ascertain the proper interpretation from the statutory language and legislative intent\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 231-232 [citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">A plain language reading of the statute supports the conclusion that \u201cboard certified\u201d means certification by a medical specialty board. The phrase \u201cboard certified\u201d is a term of art, typically understood to refer to approval by a designated group of professionals<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(see </em>McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 233). This is especially true when the phrase is used to describe physicians, who are commonly referred to as board certified. The Legislature has also used the term \u201cboard certified\u201d in other statutes to refer to a medical specialty board <em>(see </em>Correction Law \u00a7 43 [1]; Insurance Law \u00a7 4900 [b] [2] [A] [ii]; Public Health Law \u00a7 4900 [2] [b] [i] [B]).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Petitioners attempt to separate the word \u201cboard\u201d from the phrase \u201cboard certified,\u201d contending that \u201cboard\u201d should be given the same meaning throughout the provision. However, \u201cboard\u201d can have a different meaning on its own than it does as part of the phrase \u201cboard certified.\u201d The statutory definition should not be applied mechanically, regardless of context. Indeed, there are several places in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law where the term \u201cboard\u201d is not used to refer to the WCB <em>(see e.g. </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 13-d [1] [referring to county medical board]). Thus, the most natural interpretation is that \u201cboard certified\u201d refers to certification by a medical specialty board and we read the statute accordingly <em>(see e.g. Castro v United Container Mach. Group, Inc., </em>96 NY2d 398, 401 [2001]).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">We likewise reject petitioners\u2019 argument that the WCB\u2019s construction of the statute renders the term \u201cpodiatrist\u201d superfluous. The statute as we interpret it provides that physicians and surgeons must be state licensed and medical board certified <em>(see </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 137 [3]). A podia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>trist, who is not a medical doctor and thus cannot be medical board certified, is an \u201cother person\u201d who may be authorized to perform IMEs by the WCB <em>(see </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 137 [3] [a]). Indeed, as the WCB notes, the phrase \u201cboard certified\u201d would be superfluous under petitioners\u2019 construction, since Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 13-b (1) and (2) were specifically amended in the same bill to give the WCB the power to authorize providers to perform IMEs (L 2000, ch 473, \u00a7 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The Appellate Division, First Department has also addressed this issue and reached the same conclusion we reach today <em>(see Matter of Rosenblum v New York State Workers\u2019 Compensation Bd., </em>309 AD2d 120 [1st Dept 2003]). Although that Court found that the WCB\u2019s interpretation of the statute was entitled to deference, it also stated that \u201cthe WCB\u2019s interpretation of the statute, which comports with its plain language, its purpose and its legislative history and gives meaning to every phrase, was a sound one even as a matter of pure statutory construction\u201d <em>(Matter of Rosenblum, </em>309 AD2d at 123).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Having determined that \u201cboard certified\u201d should be read as certification by an appropriate medical specialty board, we next address whether the regulations requiring certification by the ABMS or AOA are rational. The WCB is authorized to \u201cadopt reasonable rules consistent with and supplemental to the provisions of this chapter\u201d (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 117 [1]). This Court reviews administrative regulations to determine whether they are rational and to ensure that they are not arbitrary or capricious <em>(see Matter of Levine v Whalen, </em>39 NY2d 510, 518 [1976]).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">We conclude that the regulations at issue are rational and relate to the goals of the Injured Workers\u2019 Protection Act. The statute requires that IME physicians be certified by a medical specialty board. The ABMS and AOA are organizations of approved medical and osteopathic specialty boards. Indeed the Medical Society of the State of New York specifically requested that the WCB designate only ABMS and AOA certifying boards. Requiring such board certification promotes the purpose of the statute since it provides a greater level of quality assurance as the physicians authorized to perform IMEs have attained a certain degree of professional competence as recognized by the certifying boards. That some of the petitioners have been retained as impartial specialists for the WCB does not render the regulation irrational. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Law does not require such specialists to be \u201cboard certified\u201d <em>(see </em>Work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>ers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 13 [e]). Only specialists selected by employers in the first instance to perform IMEs need to be board certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Petitioners\u2019 remaining claims are likewise without merit. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, the petition should be dismissed and the subject regulations should be declared valid to the extent challenged herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B.
