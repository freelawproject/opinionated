Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">The issue presented is whether an action for an intentional tort is barred by the plaintiffs receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits where both parties were employees of the same firm, but the defendant\u2019s alleged misconduct arose from purely personal motives and was not in furtherance of the employer\u2019s business. We answered this question in the negative in <em>Maines v Cronomer Val. Fire Dept. </em>(50 NY2d 535 [1980]), and <em>Maines </em>compels a reversal here.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">Denise Hanford brings this action against Morton Landowne,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging that Landowne concealed a video camera in a locker room on the premises of their employer, in an unsuccessful at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>tempt to tape Hanford, while she changed her clothes. Hanford\u2019s complaint charges Landowne with violations of the New York Human Rights Law, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and discrimination and sexual harassment \u201cas prima facie tort.\u201d Hanford applied for and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits arising out of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Supreme Court dismissed Hanford\u2019s action against Landowne on the basis of the exclusivity provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, and the Appellate Division affirmed, two Justices dissenting. Inexplicably, the Appellate Division majority opinion does not cite <em>Maines, </em>though the dissent points out that it is this Court\u2019s leading decision on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\"><em>Maines </em>was an action by a firefighter against fellow firefighters who had thrown him into a garbage dumpster as a prank. The defendant firefighters moved to dismiss under the Volunteer Firefighters\u2019 Benefit Law; section 20 of that law incorporates by reference Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 29 (6) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law provides in part: \u201cThe right to compensation or benefits under this chapter, shall be the exclusive remedy to an employee . . . when such employee is injured ... by the negligence or wrong of another in the same employ . . . .\u201d In <em>Maines, </em>we held this provision inapplicable, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\u201c[T]he words \u2018in the same employ\u2019 as used in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law are not satisfied simply because both plaintiff and defendant have the same employer; a defendant, to have the protection of the exclusivity provision, must himself have been acting within the scope of his employment and not have been engaged in a willful or intentional tort.\u201d (50 NY2d at 543.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-8\"><em>Maines </em>is indistinguishable from this case, and Landowne does not attempt to distinguish it. He does argue that <em>Maines </em>has been \u201cnarrowed\u201d in subsequent cases, but his argument is ill-founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Landowne relies on <em>Werner v State of New York </em>(53 NY2d 346 [1981]) and <em>O\u2019Connor v Midiria </em>(55 NY2d 538 [1982]). In those cases we held that, where the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>has determined that certain injuries were suffered accidentally and in the course of employment, a subsequent action <em>against the employer </em>for an intentional tort based on the same event is barred by the exclusive remedy and finality provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, and by principles of res judicata. In <em>O\u2019Connor </em>we also dismissed an action against a supervisory employee of the same employer, who was not himself accused of intentional misconduct, but was sued on the theory that he knew of the offender\u2019s \u201cpropensity\u201d for such misconduct (55 NY2d at 540).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Neither in <em>Werner </em>nor in <em>O\u2019Connor </em>did we contradict or question the holding of Maines\u2014that an employee who commits an intentional tort outside of the scope of his employment is not protected by Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29. We explained in <em>Maines, </em>as the Appellate Division dissent notes, that the same event may be \u201caccidental\u201d from the employer\u2019s point of view (thus justifying a workers\u2019 compensation award) and intentional from the point of view of the perpetrator. Thus there is no tension between the holding of <em>Maines </em>and the holding of <em>Werner </em>and <em>O\u2019Connor. </em>Indeed, we noted in <em>Werner, </em>with a citation to <em>Maines: </em>\u201c[I]t is clear that subdivision 6 of section 29 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law does not bar an employee who has accepted compensation benefits from suing a coemployee who has committed an intentional assault upon him . . ..\u201d (53 NY2d at 351 n 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Under <em>Maines, </em>Hanford\u2019s complaint against Landowne was erroneously dismissed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, the complaint reinstated against defendant Landowne and the certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo and Read concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-12\">. Hanford\u2019s claims against other defendants are not in issue on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b396-10\">. We noted in <em>Maines </em>that the relevant provisions of the Volunteer Firefighters\u2019 Benefit Law and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law were different in some respects, but we expressly declined to predicate our ruling in <em>Maines </em>on the differences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b397-9\">. This does not mean, of course, that Hanford can recover twice for the same injuries. To the extent that she recovers damages from Landowne her recovery may be subject to recoupment by the workers\u2019 compensation carrier, as with any recovery by a workers\u2019 compensation claimant against a third party. <em>(See </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 [1].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
