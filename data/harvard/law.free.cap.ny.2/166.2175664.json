For the reasons that follow, we conclude that he may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">In 1995, the Legislature enacted Insurance Law \u00a7\u00a7 4321 and 4322 (L 1995, ch 504, \u00a7 12), which were intended to make affordable health care coverage available to individuals who buy their own health insurance. These provisions mandate all Insurance Law article 43 not-for-profit health insurers and health management organizations (HMOs) certified under Public Health Law article 44 (for purposes of this decision, referred to collectively as \u201cinsurers\u201d) to offer, on an open enrollment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> community-rated basis,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> individual direct-payment HMO contracts and point-of-service (POS) contracts providing comprehensive and standardized benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">At the time sections 4321 and 4322 were enacted, Insurance Law \u00a7 4308 required the Superintendent to approve all insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>anee contracts as well as initial premium rates and subsequent rate modifications before they became effective. As is relevant on this appeal, subsection (b) authorized the Superintendent to disapprove proposed initial premiums upon finding that they were \u201cexcessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory\u201d <em>(see </em>Insurance Law \u00a7 4308 [b]). After approval, premiums could only be modified after public hearings and the Superintendent\u2019s prior written approval, a lengthy and often costly process prescribed by subsection (c) <em>(see </em>Insurance Law \u00a7 4308 [c] [l]-[3]).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">As part of the 1995 amendments, however, the Legislature enacted new subsections (g) through (j), dubbed the file and use provisions. Under the file and use methodology, insurers seeking to increase or decrease premiums may submit a rate filing or application to the Superintendent, which <em>\u201cshall be deemed approved, </em>provided that . . . the anticipated incurred loss ratio for [the] contract form [falls within prescribed minimum and maximum loss ratios (between 80% and 105% for individual direct-payment contracts) as certified by an actuary]\u201d (Insurance Law \u00a7 4308 [g] [1]; [j] [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">A loss ratio is determined by dividing claims incurred by premiums earned. The \u201canticipated incurred loss ratio\u201d is an actuarial prediction of the loss ratio for the upcoming calendar year. Insurers annually report their actual loss ratio for the previous calendar year <em>(see </em>Insurance Law \u00a7 4308 [h] [1]). If the actual loss ratio is below 80% the insurer must issue a refund to its subscribers or credit a dividend against future premiums by September 30th of the year following the year in which the loss ratio requirements were not satisfied <em>(see </em>Insurance Law \u00a7 4308 [h] [2]). Conversely, if the actual loss ratio exceeds 105% the insurer must increase its premium rates accordingly <em>(see id. </em>\u00a7 4308 [h] [3]).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Because the file and use provisions require insurers to give each subscriber at least 30 days written , notice of a premium rate increase <em>(see </em>Insurance Law \u00a7 4308 [g] [2]), insurers typically submit rate filings to the Superintendent and notify their subscribers simultaneously at year-end. A cap limiting premium increases or decreases to 10% per year was in force from 1996 through 1999 <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">By letter dated November 13, 2001, the Superintendent informed Excellus, which provides health care coverage in 45 upstate counties, that he was modifying his review procedures for certain file and use rate applications \u201cto provide [him] with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>sufficient time to make the necessary determination that the requested premium rates [were] in compliance with the requirements of Section 4308.\u201d The Superintendent also advised Excellus that premium rate adjustments for individual direct-pay HMO and POS contracts could \u201cnot be implemented until the [Superintendent\u2019s] review [was] completed and the company [was] so advised in writing\u201d; however, Excellus \u201cshould continue to provide the required 30 day written notice to [its] subscribers based upon the requested effective date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">In late November 2001, Excellus submitted its rate filing for new premium rates effective January 1, 2002, accompanied by the required actuarial certifications. On November 30, 2001, the Superintendent acknowledged receipt of Excellus\u2019s submission; stated that the requested rates were being reviewed for compliance with section 4308; asked for further information; and cautioned that \u201cthe requested premium adjustments . . . may not be implemented until the [Superintendent\u2019s] review is completed and [Excellus] receives a written confirmation that the requested rates have been placed on file.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">By letter dated January 10, 2002, the Superintendent notified Excellus that he had reviewed the rates and was modifying some of them by reducing increases and, in two instances, denying any increase at all. Excellus thereafter commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding to challenge the Superintendent\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Excellus argued that the Superintendent\u2019s actions ran afoul of the file and use statutory scheme by improperly conditioning a premium rate change on his review and approval. The Superintendent took the position that he acted properly because section 4308 (b) authorizes him to disapprove any premium that is \u201cexcessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.\u201d He asserted that he properly reviewed Excellus\u2019s filed rates under subsection (b), given the \u201csteep\u201d increases and wide discrepancies in premium rates, the sharp decline in direct-pay subscribers and the largely competition-free insurance market involved. The Superintendent also argued that his review was necessary because many rate filings were based on extremely small populations, not reflecting a true basis for community rating. Since insurers use certain market stabilization mechanisms, which may provide them with additional funds to offset losses, the Superintendent further contended that he needed to verify whether the actuaries properly accounted for recoveries from these programs in their rate analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Supreme Court annulled the Superintendent\u2019s letters and determined that Excellus\u2019s filed rates were approved as a matter of law, effective on January 1, 2002. The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed, relying on a plain language analysis (303 AD2d 864 [3d Dept 2003]). The Court observed that \u201c[h]ad the Legislature wished to require [the Superintendent\u2019s] subsequent approval of a rate filing or application, it could have done so through appropriate wording\u201d and concluded that \u201c[the Superintendent\u2019s] interpretation, however laudable its purpose, imports a policy not expressed in the plain words of the statute\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 868). We granted the Superintendent leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">When interpreting a statute, we turn first to the statutory text as the best evidence of the Legislature\u2019s intent. \u201cAs a general rule, unambiguous language of a statute is alone determinative\u201d <em>(Riley v County of Broome, </em>95 NY2d 455, 463 [2000] [citation omitted]). Further, although an agency\u2019s rational construction of a statute is normally entitled to deference, \u201ca determination by the agency that runs counter to the clear wording of a statutory provision is given little weight\u201d <em>(Matter of Raritan Dev. Corp. v Silva, </em>91 NY2d 98, 103 [1997] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Here, the \u201cclear wording\u201d of section 4308 (g) (1) unambiguously states that a rate filing or application submitted to the Superintendent \u201cshall be deemed approved,\u201d provided that it is accompanied by an actuarial document certifying that the anticipated loss ratios fall within the statutorily prescribed range. Thus, once the Superintendent receives a new premium rate filing, accompanied by the requisite actuarial certification, the rates specified in the filing are approved by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">The Superintendent and the dissent would read the statute to mandate approval of file and use rates under the requirements of subsection (g) unless (and, in the case of the dissent, until) the Superintendent subsequently disapproves these rates as \u201cexcessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory,\u201d which is the standard under subsection (b). We decline to interpolate into subsection (g) an exception unexpressed by the Legislature. This reading of the statute would create a \u201cforced [and] unnatural interpretation[ ]\u201d of \u201cshall be deemed approved\u201d by making approval by operation of law, in fact, contingent upon the Superintendent\u2019s assent <em>(see Castro v United Container Mach. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number><em>Group, </em>96 NY2d 398, 401 [2001]; <em>see also </em>McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 94 [legislative intent must be ascertained \u201caccording to its natural and most obvious sense, without resorting to an artificial or forced construction\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Our interpretation comports not only with the statute\u2019s plain language, but also with its legislative history and overall purpose. In enacting the file and use provisions, the Legislature sought to \u201creform[ ] the costly and time-consuming system for the approval of [ ] premium rates . . . , <em>allow appropriate rate increases </em>to be implemented on a more timely basis and also <em>help assure that rates are equitable\u201d </em>(Governor\u2019s Approval Mem No. 72, Bill Jacket, L 1995, ch 504, at 6 [emphasis added]). To implement timely rate increases that are fair to consumers, the Legislature established anticipated loss ratios as the gauge of reasonableness, and provided for automatic refunds or credits if actual loss ratios were less.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">A letter from former Superintendent Muhl to the Governor\u2019s Counsel\u2014noting that the Insurance Department participated in the drafting of the bill and recommending its approval\u2014emphasizes that the file and use methodology not only \u201censures that appropriate rate increases or decreases will be implemented on a timely basis . . . and enables HMOs and insurers to recognize savings in administrative costs\u201d but also <em>\u201cassures that rates are equitable\u201d </em>and <em>\u201cis beneficial to [both] consumers and carriers\u201d </em>(Letter of Superintendent Muhl to Honorable Michael C. Finnegan, Counsel to the Governor, dated July 19, 1995, Bill Jacket, L 1995, ch 504, at 15 [emphasis added]). Indeed, the Department\u2019s regulations state that using a preapproved loss ratio is a proper method to determine the propriety of rates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\"><em>\u201cOne method of determining whether benefits are reasonable, </em>in relation to the premium charged, is to determine the percentage of the premium collected which is expected to be returned to all policyholders in the form of benefits. This percentage of return is known as the expected loss ratio. <em>In order to prevent the insurer from retaining an unreasonable percentage of the premiums collected for expenses, commissions and profit, </em>minimum expected loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>ratio standards have been established\u201d (11 NYCRR 52.1 [f] [emphasis added]).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">In short, the legislative history of the file and use provisions is consonant with the statutory language. Neither intimates that the Legislature expected the Superintendent to exercise his traditional rate review powers with respect to premium rates \u201cdeemed approved.\u201d The Superintendent protests that the file and use statutory scheme, unmoderated by his review and potential intervention, undercuts affordable health care for direct-pay customers. Even if this is so, we must hew to the statute\u2019s text. The remedy sought by the Superintendent on grounds of public policy lies with the Legislature, not with the courts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Finally, we note that the Superintendent may always act to ensure that <em>initial </em>contract terms and premiums are not \u201cexcessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory\u201d under subsections (a) and (b) of section 4308, as previously discussed. He may review rates pursuant to the \u201cexcessive management salary\u201d provision of subsection (b)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or the audit provisions of subsections (d) through (f).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Superintendent may ensure that the file and use actuarial certifications are correct, and he may is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>sue regulations regarding how loss ratio certifications are to be prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-11\">. Under open enrollment, the insurer must provide health insurance coverage to all willing purchasers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-12\">. A community rate is determined by the insurer\u2019s average cost per person in the relevant geographic area. Insurers consequently charge subscribers uniform rates regardless of individual health risks or medical history.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b214-13\">. Insurers are thus required to offer two forms of direct-payment contract: the usual HMO contract to cover statutorily specified services from hospitals and physicians approved by the HMO; or a point-of-service contract, where, in addition, the same benefits are available from the hospital or physician of the enrollee\u2019s choosing, typically covered at a percent of the fee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b219-6\">. The Department\u2019s regulations establish specified loss ratios for different insurance products to ensure that rates are equitable. In many instances, those loss ratios are lower than the 80% allowed by the Legislature in the file and use context (see <em>e.g. </em>11 NYCRR 52.15 [allowing loss ratios as low as 60% for specified disease coverage]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\">. Notably, in recent years the Legislature has created or expanded several health care programs aimed at solving the complicated problem of New York\u2019s uninsureds <em>(see </em>L 1996, ch 639 [New York Health Care Reform Act of 1996]; L 1999, ch 1 [New York Health Care Reform Act of 2000]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\">. Section 4308 (b) provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[notwithstanding any other provision of law, the superintendent, as part of the rate increase approval process, may defer, reduce or reject a rate increase if, in the judgment of the superintendent, the salary increases for senior level management executives . . . are excessive or unwarranted given the financial condition or overall performance of such corporation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b219-9\">.

(concurring in part and dissenting in part).</author>\n<p id=\"AA2\">Since 1934, the Superintendent of Insurance has been authorized to review rates charged by health insurance providers (L 1934, ch 595). The majority nonetheless holds that the Superintendent may no longer review rate increases to determine whether they are excessive, inadequate or discriminatory when a health insurance provider uses the \u201cfile and use\u201d procedure set forth in Insurance Law \u00a7 4308 (g). Because subsection (g) contains no language clearly stripping the Superintendent of this power, I respectfully dissent from that part of the majority\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Although I agree with the majority that by adopting the file and use procedure, the Legislature clearly intended to expedite rate increases for certain health insurance providers, I find nothing in the statute or its history supporting the majority\u2019s conclusion that the Legislature also intended to divest the Superintendent of his authority to review rates to determine if they are \u201cexcessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory\u201d as authorized in Insurance Law \u00a7 4308 (b). In fact, the plain language of subsection (g) suggests otherwise. The Legislature merely referred to the file and use methodology as an \u201calternate procedure\u201d to the lengthy and costly public hearing process required by subsection (c) of the provision. No mention was made of a new standard for reviewing rates\u2014much less the elimination of the Superintendent\u2019s review authority altogether. And, critically, by its plain terms subsection (g) did not supplant or limit the Superintendent\u2019s authority under subsection (b) to review rates to determine whether they are excessive, inadequate or discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Like the statutory language, the legislative history is devoid of any indication that the Superintendent\u2019s power to oversee health insurance rates was being diminished. The purpose of the 1995 legislation was to make health insurance more affordable and available for direct pay consumers <em>(see </em>L 1995, ch 504). The legislation created two new standardized health insurance products for these consumers, an HMO plan and a point of ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>vice plan, and mandated that such plans be offered by certain health insurance providers, including Excellus. Governor Pataki, who submitted the reform package as part of his insurance program, stated that the legislation was intended to address problems faced by direct pay consumers, who had \u201climited choices\u201d in health insurance coverage because most insurers did not offer direct pay policies (Governor\u2019s Approval Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1995, ch 504, at 5). As for those consumers who already had insurance, the Governor observed: \u201cBecause of continuing rate increases, this critical coverage is becoming more and more expensive for the existing policyholders\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The streamlined procedure for establishing rate changes was but one aspect of this comprehensive health insurance reform legislation. In discussing the new file and use method, the Governor noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">\u201c[t]he bill also reforms the costly and time-consuming system for the approval of the premium rates offered by HMOs and Blue Cross Plans on their community-rated business. <em>At the same time, it also preserves certain consumer protections. </em>The adoption of a file and use rating methodology for community rated contracts of HMOs and Article 43 corporations with minimum and maximum loss ratios will yield savings in administrative costs, allow appropriate rate increases to be implemented on a more timely basis and also help assure that rates are equitable\u201d (Governor\u2019s Approval Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1995, ch 504, at 6 [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">It appears that the Governor expected the amendment to create an alternative to the costly, time-consuming public hearing prior-approval procedure of subsection (c) while preserving \u201cconsumer protections\u201d that would help assure equitable rates. Since the subsection (b) standard provides the framework for assuring such protections for consumers, I am unpersuaded that the file and use procedure was intended to repeal that subsection\u2014particularly since the Legislature could have easily so provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Though not a model of clarity, the statute\u2019s provisions can be read together in a manner that gives meaning to each of its terms and effect to the overriding intent of the 1995 legislation. And where a statute\u2019s terms can be harmonized, the canons of statutory construction require that we do so <em>(see generally, Matter of Tall Trees Constr. Corp. v Zoning Bd. of Appeals, </em>97 NY2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>86, 91 [2001]). While the majority gives great weight to subsection (g)\u2019s \u201cdeemed approved\u201d language,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this is just one phrase in a lengthy statute. There is no basis to conclude that the \u201cdeemed approved\u201d language vitiates the long-standing \u201cexcessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory\u201d standard set forth in subsection (b). Both subsections can and should be given effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">As I read the statute, the 1995 amendment offers insurers a more efficient and cost-effective means of securing rate approval. If rate increases fall within the minimum and maximum loss ratios established in subsection (g), the rates are \u201cdeemed approved,\u201d meaning that insurance providers can collect the new rates from consumers. Thus, under the file and use method, the Superintendent is precluded from requiring insurance companies to submit to prior review or approval by the Insurance Department before rate increases go into effect.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the Superintendent decides to exercise his review authority under subsection (b) and finds that the rates are excessive, inadequate or discriminatory, the rates may no longer be charged prospectively, although the Superintendent\u2019s determination can be challenged in a CPLR article 78 proceeding (as occurred in this case).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This interpretation of the statute gives effect to all of its terms and is consistent with the history of the reform legislation as a whole and of subsection (g) in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Excellus\u2019 argument that the minimum and maximum loss ratios, used to calculate rates under the file and use procedure, will protect consumers from excessive or discriminatory rates does not withstand scrutiny. In the absence of the Superintendent\u2019s intervention, the file and use procedure has produced HMO rates for direct pay consumers that increased 69.3% between 1999 and 2002 (testimony of Gregory V Serio, Superintendent of Insurance, before the New York State Senate Standing Committee on Insurance, Apr. 15, 2003). The climb in point of service contract rates was even more precipitous: 82.7% during the same time frame <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In addition to resulting in exponential rate increases, the file and use procedure has apparently led to divergences in rates from county to county which, according to the Superintendent, are not justified by regional differences in health care costs. While the loss ratios restrict the percentage of rate increase adopted for a particular plan, they do not require that a provider take a uniform approach to rate increases from plan to plan or region to region. Consequently, as long as rate increases fall within the loss ratios, the file and use procedure does not prevent a provider from increasing rates 50% in one county and not at all in the adjoining county. Absent review, a provider could charge divergent rates without justification and compound the differences in the next filing\u2014even if the rates are patently discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Left unchecked, the file and use procedure can lead to precipitous rate fluctuations and unjustified regional discrepancies that could thwart the underlying purpose of the 1995 legislation. While the Superintendent retains the authority to order an independent management and financial audit under the majority\u2019s reading of the statute, audit review may come too late to meaningfully protect direct pay consumers who must meet premium payments each month. If this class of vulnerable insurance subscribers cannot afford the increased rates, they will drop off the insurance rolls and join the ranks of the uninsured\u2014a result completely contrary to the overriding legislative motivation to increase availability of coverage for direct pay consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The Superintendent has alleged that misuse of the file and use procedure was precisely what prompted him to exercise his review authority to reduce Excellus\u2019 rate increases in January 2002. The merits of this determination were never reviewed because the lower courts each concluded that the \u201cdeemed ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>proved\u201d language divested the Superintendent of rate increase review authority. Because I believe the Superintendent retains authority under subsection (b), I would remit this matter to Supreme Court to assess whether the Superintendent\u2019s prospective alteration of Excellus\u2019 rate increases was arbitrary or capricious, i.e., whether the Superintendent rationally concluded that the provider\u2019s rate increases were excessive, inadequate or discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt and R.S. Smith concur with Judge Read; Judge Graffeo concurs in part and dissents in part in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-6\">. In prior cases, this Court has interpreted a statute containing the phrase \u201cdeemed approved\u201d in a manner consistent with and appropriate to its context. For example, in <em>Matter of King v Chmielewski </em>(76 NY2d 182 [1990]), we rejected the argument that a subdivision application was automatically approved by operation of law 45 days after the public hearing even though Town Law \u00a7 276 (4) provided that the application would be \u201cdeemed approved\u201d if not acted upon within that period. Instead of reading the phrase \u201cdeemed approved\u201d in isolation, we considered it in the context of other relevant provisions of law, declining to adopt a narrow interpretation of the statute that \u201cwould be inconsistent with the legislative design\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 188; see <em>also, Matter of Sun Beach Real Estate Dev. Corp. v Anderson, </em>98 AD2d 367 [2d Dept 1983], <em>affd </em>62 NY2d 965 [1984] [Town Law\u2019s 45-day \u201cdeemed approved\u201d provision must be harmonized with SEQRA\u2019s more extended review process]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\">. This confers a significant benefit. For several years after the file and use procedure was adopted, the Superintendent apparently saw no need to exercise his review power at all and providers\u2019 rates were not disturbed once filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b222-8\">. Given my reading of the statute, I concur with the majority holding insofar as it annuls the Superintendent\u2019s November 2001 letter because it attempted to impose a prior approval requirement on providers who use the subsection (g) file and use procedure. I would also strike that portion of the Superintendent\u2019s rate review determination directing retroactive application of the Superintendent\u2019s rate modifications.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
