Challenged on this appeal are the Department of Health\u2019s \u201cClinical Guidelines for Office-based Surgery.\u201d Plaintiff\u2014a not-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>for-profit corporation that represents more than 750 certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), nurses specially trained to administer anesthesia\u2014seeks a declaration that these Guidelines are null and void because they are in fact regulations and defendants, the Department of Health, Commissioner of Health and Public Health Council, are without authority to regulate services provided in private physicians\u2019 offices. We conclude that plaintiff lacks standing to maintain this action and reach no other issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The Guidelines</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">In 1997, defendants created a Committee on Quality Assurance in Office-Based Surgery in order to establish standards of care for the burgeoning, but unregulated, practice of surgeries performed in physicians\u2019 offices. In December 2000\u2014with defendants\u2019 endorsement\u2014the Committee issued the Guidelines that are the subject of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The stated intent and goal of the Guidelines is to \u201censure that the public is adequately protected when undergoing surgery/invasive procedures in private offices of health care practitioners.\u201d The Guidelines include a broad range of recommendations for the qualification of practitioners and staff, equipment, facilities, ancillary services, and policies and procedures for patient admission, monitoring, discharge and emergency care. Most directly relevant to the present litigation, the Guidelines contain specifications regarding anesthesia administered in private offices\u2014from conscious to unconscious/ deep sedation and general anesthesia. Among other things, the Guidelines suggest that CRNAs administering anesthesia to patients in doctors\u2019 offices be supervised by a physician, dentist or podiatrist who is \u201cphysically present, [and] qualified by law, regulation or hospital appointment to perform and supervise the administration of the anesthesia and who has accepted responsibility for supervision.\u201d The Guidelines also recommend that the supervising physician perform a preanesthetic examination, prescribe the anesthesia, remain physically present during the surgery and be \u201cavailable for diagnosis, treatment and management of anesthesia-related complications or emergencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Shortly before issuance of the Guidelines, plaintiff initiated this action seeking a declaration that the Guidelines are null and void because defendants\u2019 authority to regulate surgery is limited under Public Health Law article 28 to hospital settings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>In their motion to dismiss, defendants urged both that the case was not ripe for review and that plaintiff lacked standing to mount this challenge. Assuming standing, Supreme Court denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, granted plaintiff summary judgment, and declared the Guidelines null and void as exceeding defendants\u2019 authority. The Appellate Division correctly recognized that a grant of relief to plaintiff first requires resolution of the standing issue; explicitly found that plaintiff had standing; and agreed with Supreme Court that the Guidelines are regulations beyond defendants\u2019 purview and thus illegal. In opposition to defendants\u2019 appeal to this Court as of right under CPLR 5601 (b) (1), plaintiff argued that \u201c[i]t is the statutory issue, <em>i.e., </em>whether the Department of Health exceeded the clear limits of its statutory authority, that is dispositive.\u201d We dismissed defendants\u2019 appeal as of right (100 NY2d 534 [2003]), granted their motion for leave to determine this issue (100 NY2d 510 [2003]) and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Standing is, of course, a threshold requirement for a plaintiff seeking to challenge governmental action. The two-part test for determining standing is a familiar one. First, a plaintiff must show \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d meaning that plaintiff will actually be harmed by the challenged administrative action. As the term itself implies, the injury must be more than conjectural. Second, the injury a plaintiff asserts must fall within the zone of interests or concerns sought to be promoted or protected by the statutory provision under which the agency has acted <em>(see Society of Plastics Indus, v County of Suffolk, </em>77 NY2d 761, 773 [1991]; <em>Matter of Colella v Board of Assessors, </em>95 NY2d 401, 409-410 [2000]). To establish standing, an organizational plaintiff\u2014such as plaintiff here\u2014must show that at least one of its members would have standing to sue, that it is representative of the organizational purposes it asserts and that the case would not require the participation of individual members. <em>(See e.g. Rudder v Pataki, </em>93 NY2d 273, 278 [1999]; <em>Matter of Dental Socy. of State of N.Y. v Carey, </em>61 NY2d 330, 333-334 [1984]; <em>Matter of Dairylea Coop, v Walkley, </em>38 NY2d 6, 9 [1975].)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Although the Appellate Division determined standing by first looking to \u201czone of interests,\u201d concluding that plaintiff\u2019s members fall within the class of individuals protected by the constitutional and statutory provisions that are the basis for suit, we begin our analysis with the critical element of in-fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>injury\u2014the requirement that plaintiff have an actual legal stake in the matter in dispute. Because we conclude that plaintiff has not shown in-fact injury entitling it to challenge defendants\u2019 authority to issue the Guidelines, we need not reach the other components of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The core of plaintiffs assertion of in-fact injury is that the Guidelines \u201ceffectively\u201d require CRNAs to be supervised by anesthesiologists; that physicians would find it cost prohibitive to have both CRNAs and anesthesiologists during surgery; and that the Guidelines therefore \u201ceffectively\u201d prohibit CRNAs from performing anesthesia services in an office-based setting. In short, according to plaintiff, the Guidelines \u201c[ojbviously . . . restrict the scope of a CRNA\u2019s area of practice.\u201d Plaintiffs asserted injury rests on the following extract from the Guidelines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">\u201cAnesthesia should be administered only by a licensed, qualified and competent practitioner. Registered professional nurses (RNs) who administer anesthesia as part of a medical, dental or podiatric procedure (including but not limited to CRNAs) should have training and experience appropriate to the level of anesthesia administered, and function in accordance with their scope of practice. Supervision of the anesthesia component of the medical, dental or podiatric procedure should be provided by a physician, dentist or podiatrist who is physically present, who is qualified by law, regulation or hospital appointment to perform and supervise the administration of the anesthesia and who has accepted responsibility for supervision. The physician, dentist or podiatrist providing supervision should:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">\u201c1. perform a preanesthetic examination and evaluation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">\u201c2. prescribe the anesthesia;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">\u201c3. assure that qualified practitioners participate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">\u201c4. remain physically present during the entire perioperative period and immediately available for diagnosis, treatment and management of anesthesia-related complications or emergencies; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-10\">\u201c5. assure the provision of indicated postanesthesia care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>The Appellate Division accepted plaintiffs assumption that CRNAs will likely be injured as \u201creasonable and sufficient to demonstrate a likelihood of actual injury\u201d (301 AD2d 895, 898 [3d Dept 2003]). We conclude, however, that plaintiffs assumption lacks the concreteness required for \u201cinjury <em>in fact\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Plaintiffs argument that CRNAs will likely be injured is founded on two layers of speculation\u2014that the Guidelines will be rigorously enforced as regulations and that, as such, they will effectively harm CRNAs. At this juncture, it is not at all \u201cobvious\u201d that, even if enforced as regulations, the Guidelines would in fact injure any of plaintiffs members as claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The Guidelines themselves do not explicitly restrict a CRNA\u2019s area of practice; nor do they express any intent to do so. Rather, they explicitly provide for the continued employment of CRNAs so long as they have \u201ctraining and experience appropriate to the level of anesthesia administered.\u201d When executing a medical regimen, all nurses\u2014including CRNAs working in a physician\u2019s office\u2014already must be supervised \u201cby a licensed physician, dentist or other licensed health care provider legally authorized under this title\u201d (Education Law \u00a7 6902 [1]; <em>see also </em>1948 Ops Atty Gen 203 [\u201ca nurse working under a physician, is entitled to administer general anesthesia\u201d]; 48 State Dept Rep 137, 138 [1933] [a nurse does not violate the law if the nurse administers anesthesia \u201cunder the direction of a physician\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The Guidelines do not require anesthesiologist supervision, and do not prohibit operating physicians from themselves supervising CRNAs as they administer anesthesia. On the contrary, the Guidelines specifically recommend that the minimum number of available personnel during administration of conscious sedation should be two: \u201cthe practitioner performing the surgery and the individual monitoring the patient,\u201d with analogous recommendations for regional and general anesthesia. Since the Guidelines allow nurses to administer all types of anesthesia, it is clear that the operating doctor can also be the supervising doctor. Furthermore, as defendants point out, the Guidelines recommend that the supervising physician be <em>qualified by law </em>to perform and supervise the administration of anesthesia, and a license to practice medicine under Education Law article 131 is the only credential required <em>by law </em>to perform a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>medical procedure, including the administration of anesthesia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These physicians may, as the Guidelines explicitly suggest, elect to participate in continuing education training in order to maintain high standards of quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The recommended procedures might, or might not, actually affect the employment of CRNAs in physicians\u2019 offices. At this point, there is no certainty whatsoever that any CRNA would in fact be injured. That some physicians do not routinely or ordinarily perform measures now recommended in the Guidelines (as plaintiff argues) does not mean that physicians could not and would not themselves choose to do so, as opposed to firing CRNAs and hiring anesthesiologists.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Plaintiffs speculation about the future course the Guidelines might take cannot, under our precedents, supply the missing ingredient of in-fact injury. In <em>Dental Society, </em>we recognized the standing of an organization of licensed dentists to challenge a Medicaid dental fee reimbursement schedule, where dentist-members receiving reimbursements necessarily suffered actual economic loss from defendants\u2019 failure over nearly 20 years to update the schedule. In <em>Rudder, </em>by contrast, there was no showing that any member of plaintiff organizations would be deprived of opportunities or entitlements. As we noted in affirming the dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 declaratory judgment action, standing requires a showing of \u201ccognizable harm,\u201d meaning that an individual member of plaintiff organizations \u201chas been or will be injured\u201d; \u201c \u2018tenuous\u2019 and \u2018ephemeral\u2019 harm ... is insufficient to trigger judicial intervention\u201d (93 NY2d at 279).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">While the record leads us to a different conclusion from the dissent, we are unanimous in our commitment to predictability in the law of standing, starting with the element of in-fact injury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consistent with our precedents, we conclude that, on this record, plaintiff has failed to demonstrate an in-fact injury sufficient to meet the first prong of the test for standing. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>in the future the hypothesized harm might befall CRNAs does not at this time entitle plaintiff to maintain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the complaint dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\">. Defendants do not suggest that the Guidelines are \u201cmeaningless\u201d or \u201credundan[t]\u201d (dissenting op at 219, 220), only that they would not operate as plaintiff projects, underscoring the abstract quality of plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\">. Addressing the dissent, we note that standing may indeed be a complicated subject, posing close and difficult issues that divide the Court. Our jurisprudence, however, represents not a black box from which we conjure a desired result, but an effort to articulate, and consistently apply, sound, logical principles that assure that courts\u2019 decisions will be neither abstract nor advisory. That may at times mean dismissing a well-intentioned plaintiff who prematurely commences suit, or agreeing with a defendant who, in its briefs, places greater emphasis on other issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b261-5\">R.S. Smith, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AIx\">The Commissioner of Health has promulgated \u201cGuidelines,\u201d which say that certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) should provide certain services in connection with office-based surgery only when they are subject to what the Commissioner considers appropriate supervision. Plaintiff, an association of New York CRNAs, challenges the Guidelines, asserting that they are regulations in disguise. I think it is clear that the Guidelines will injure CRNAs\u2019 opportunities for employment, and I therefore dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that CRNAs lack standing because they have not shown that the Guidelines will injure them.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The pertinent portion of the Guidelines is quoted in full in the majority opinion (majority op at 212). The Guidelines say that, when a CRNA administers anesthesia in an office setting, \u201c[supervision . . . should be provided by a physician, dentist or podiatrist who is physically present, who is qualified by law, regulation or hospital appointment to perform and supervise the administration of the anesthesia and who has accepted responsibility for supervision.\u201d The Guidelines go on to itemize five things that the person providing supervision should do, including \u201cperform a preanesthetic examination and evaluation\u201d and \u201cremain physically present during the entire perioperative period.\u201d The majority opinion does not describe the evidence provided by plaintiff of the economic harm that these provisions of the Guidelines will do to its members. This is a striking omission, for plaintiffs showing of injury is powerful, detailed and virtually unrebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The complaint alleges that the Guidelines change the status quo in several ways that limit what a CRNA can do. The complaint says that CRNAs now commonly work under the supervision of surgeons who are not \u201cqualified ... to perform the administration of anesthesia,\u201d and that the Guidelines will change this by \u201ceffectively requiring] the presence of an anesthesiologist [i.e. a doctor specializing in anesthesia] at all office-based surgeries.\u201d The complaint also alleges that the \u201cpre-anesthetic examination and evaluation\u201d are now performed routinely by CRNAs, and that requiring a physician to be pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>ent during the \u201centire perioperative period\u201d effectively \u201cnecessitates the presence of an anesthesiologist since the surgeon routinely does not directly monitor the patient during the periods before and after the operation.\u201d As a result, according to the complaint, \u201c[b]ecause it is cost-prohibitive for both CRNAs and anesthesiologists to be present during surgery, the [Guidelines effectively prohibit CRNAs from performing anesthesia services in an office-based setting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The allegations of harm in the complaint were amplified in affidavits submitted to Supreme Court. Sandra Tunajek, a CRNA and the Director of Practice of the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, testified: \u201cI can state unequivocally that the effect of these Guidelines will be to require the presence of an anesthesiologist whenever regional or general anesthesia are administered in the office-based setting.\u201d Tunajek\u2019s affidavit did not merely state this conclusion, but explained the basis for it in detail, dealing first with the impact of the requirement that the CRNA\u2019s supervisor be a \u201cphysician, dentist or podiatrist . . . qualified ... to perform and supervise the administration of the anesthesia.\u201d The gist of her explanation is that most surgeons lack these qualifications, and must hire either an anesthesiologist or a CRNA to administer anesthesia; the Guidelines would effectively force them to choose an anesthesiologist. Tunajek\u2019s testimony on this point is extensive, and I quote it only in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">\u201cGuideline G (1) (a) specifically requires that the supervising physician must be \u2018qualified by law, regulation or hospital appointment to perform . . . the administration of anesthesia.\u2019 Operating physicians who are qualified by law, regulation or appointment to actually <em>perform </em>the administration of anesthesia are extremely rare. Most physicians who perform surgery in the hospital, ambulatory surgery or office setting are not qualified to administer anesthesia. These physicians rely upon the expertise of a CRNA or an anesthesiologist, both of whom are trained to administer anesthesia. While operating physicians are qualified to deal with surgical complications, and may have limited knowledge of anesthesia complications, they are not qualified to administer anesthesia.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">In addition, Tunajek testified that, of the five steps which the Guidelines require a physician to perform, \u201cfour . . . are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>routinely performed by CRNAs or anesthesiologists.\u201d Again, she set forth the basis for her conclusion in clear and persuasive detail, and again I quote only an excerpt, relating to one of the requirements\u2014that of the supervisor\u2019s physical presence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\">\u201c[T]he Guidelines require the physician to remain physically present during the entire \u2018perioperative period\u2019 and immediately available for management of \u2018anesthesia-related complications or emergencies.\u2019 In virtually all surgeries, the operating surgeon does not remain present with the patient during the entire perioperative period. It is the job of the CRNA or the anesthesiologist to remain with the patient to assure that the patient is recovering properly from the effects of the anesthesia. Further, the CRNA or the anesthesiologist is specifically trained to deal with complications or emergencies arising from the administration of anesthesia.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Again, Tunajek explained, the effect of the Guidelines is to require the presence of an anesthesiologist at office-based surgeries. Tunajek concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">\u201cIf an anesthesiologist\u2019s presence is compulsory, the CRNA would have no role in the office-based setting. It is simply not economically feasible to have both an anesthesiologist and a CRNA involved in an office-based surgery. Virtually all office-based surgeries conducted throughout the United States involve the presence of a CRNA or an anesthesiologist, not both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Plaintiff also submitted the affidavit of an eye surgeon, Kenneth Anthone. Dr. Anthone testified that he and his partner \u201chave routinely used CRNAs since 1994\u201d; that \u201c[n]either I nor my partner consider ourselves to be able to \u2018perform\u2019 anesthesia\u201d; and that \u201c[w]e do not remain physically present with the patient during the post-operative period.\u201d Dr. Anthone concluded: \u201cSince there would be no reason to have both a CRNA and an anesthesiologist present during the procedure, and the cost of such duplication of services would be prohibitive, the net effect of the application of the Guidelines to our practice would be the elimination of all positions for CRNAs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">In defendants\u2019 factual submissions to Supreme Court, their response to all this evidence of harm was virtual silence. Defendants\u2019 answer denied plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Guidelines \u201ceffectively require [CRNAs] to be supervised by anesthesiologists,\u201d but the more specific allegations of the complaint that I quoted or summarized above were met either with a reference \u201cto the guidelines themselves as the best evidence of their contents\u201d or with a denial of \u201csufficient knowledge or information to form a basis for responding.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the affidavits submitted below, defendants presented no evidence on the \u201cinjury in fact\u201d issue except one conclusory and ambiguous sentence in the affidavit of Wayne Osten, Director of the Office of Health Systems Management. Osten testified: \u201cThe Guidelines do not require anesthesiologist supervision as alleged by plaintiff, and I am aware of no objective information to substantiate plaintiffs economic concerns.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Osten added that the Guidelines served worthy goals which \u201cfar outweigh potential economic impacts upon [CRNAs]\u201d\u2014thus virtually admitting that such \u201cpotential economic impacts\u201d exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">On this record, the majority concludes that plaintiff has failed to show that CRNAs will be injured by the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The majority opinion correctly states the two-part test for determining standing\u2014plaintiff must show \u201cinjury in fact\u201d and must also show that the injury is within the \u201czone of interest\u201d appropriate to confer standing. The first part of the test is of course the easier to satisfy, and common sense suggests that it will be satisfied in most cases. People do not usually spend the time and money to bring lawsuits challenging actions that do not in fact injure them.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Here, as I pointed out above, plaintiff made a powerful factual showing of injury in Supreme Court, and defendants submitted no contrary evidence of substance. But defendants now argue that \u201cinjury in fact\u201d is lacking. The gist of their argument is that the Guidelines could not possibly injure CRNAs because the Guidelines, to the extent plaintiff complains of them, are meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Defendants claim that the requirement for supervision of anesthesia by \u201ca physician . . . who is qualified by law, regulation or hospital appointment to perform and supervise the administration of the anesthesia\u201d requires only supervision by \u201ca physician\u201d and that the \u201cwho is qualified\u201d clause is tautological. Defendants point out that there is no separate legal requirement for the credentialing of an anesthesiologist, and they conclude from this that \u201call M.D.s are qualified by law to perform anesthesia and therefore qualify under the Guidelines to supervise CRNAs.\u201d Thus, defendants say that \u201c[w]ith respect to physicians, this guideline adds nothing to the parameters of medical practice.\u201d Why the Commissioner would write a guideline that \u201cadds nothing\u201d remains a mystery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">I find defendants\u2019 reading of this portion of the Guidelines completely unpersuasive. Plaintiff\u2019s evidence shows, and defendants do not dispute, that there are physicians who are not in fact qualified to administer anesthesia. Indeed, one such physician submitted an affidavit to that effect below. To say that all physicians\u2014even those who could not administer anesthesia without endangering a patient\u2019s life\u2014are \u201cqualified by law\u201d within the meaning of the Guidelines because there is no law that <em>prohibits </em>them from administering anesthesia strikes me as a bit of verbal cleverness devised by lawyers for litigation purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">There is not a hint in the Guidelines themselves, or in the extensive materials submitted to Supreme Court concerning the development of the Guidelines, to the effect that the words \u201cphysician . . . who is qualified\u201d were intended as a mere redundancy. On the contrary, an e-mail generated during the drafting of the Guidelines shows that the author of the clause thought it did have meaning: the head of the relevant subcommittee said in the e-mail that, while the words of the Guidelines did not \u201cspecify . . . an anesthesiologist,\u201d they implied that \u201conly someone with qualifications as outlined\u201d should supervise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>CRNAs. If, as defendants now claim, all physicians have these qualifications, this e-mail does not make sense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Thus the essential meaninglessness of the \u201cwho is qualified\u201d language, as applied to doctors, was apparently first discovered by the lawyers defending this lawsuit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But it does not really matter whether defendants are right or wrong about the \u201cwho is qualified\u201d clause, for defendants do not even attempt to answer plaintiffs demonstration that CRNAs will be injured by other provisions of the Guidelines. For example, there is uncontradicted proof in the record, quoted above, that a supervising physician does not ordinarily perform \u201cpreanesthetic examination and evaluation\u201d and is not present during the \u201centire perioperative period,\u201d as the Guidelines require. If the Guidelines are implemented, supervising physicians who are not able, or do not choose, to take on these added responsibilities will have to hire anesthesiologists to perform them\u2014making CRNAs superfluous. Defendants nowhere even assert that this is not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">In short, defendants\u2019 response to plaintiffs position on the \u201cinjury in fact\u201d issue is partly unpersuasive and partly nonexistent. The majority opinion does not remedy any of the deficiencies in defendants\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The majority says that plaintiffs claim of injury is founded on \u201ctwo layers of speculation\u201d (majority op at 213). The first \u201clayer\u201d is \u201cthat the Guidelines will be rigorously enforced as regulations\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (majority op at 213). But the question of whether the Guidelines are recommendations or regulations is the question presented by this case on the merits\u2014the question that plaintiff is asking us to decide, and that we are refusing to decide on standing grounds. Plaintiff need not show it would win on the merits in order to establish its standing (see <em>e.g. Society of Plastics Indus, v County of Suffolk, 11 </em>NY2d 761, 780 [1991] [inappropriate to consider the merits in determining standing]; <em>Matter of Dairylea Coop, v Walkley, </em>38 NY2d 6, 9 [1975] [same]).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>The majority\u2019s second \u201clayer[ ] of speculation\u201d is that the Guidelines, if enforced, \u201cwill effectively harm CRNAs\u201d (majority op at 213). But to label plaintiff\u2019s expectation of harm as \u201cspeculation\u201d is simply to ignore the extensive evidence I described above. The majority does ignore this evidence; and it does not analyze either side\u2019s argument on the \u201cinjury in fact\u201d issue in any detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">The majority says that it is \u201cnot at all \u2018obvious\u2019 that, even if enforced as regulations, the Guidelines would in fact injure any of plaintiff\u2019s members as claimed.\u201d (Majority op at 213.) It bolsters this remark with a very brief review of the Guidelines, largely ignoring plaintiffs explanations of why the Guidelines are harmful, and swallowing whole, without noting its flaws, defendants\u2019 interpretation of the \u201cwho is qualified\u201d phrase. The majority also says that physicians who \u201cdo not routinely or ordinarily perform measures now recommended in the Guidelines\u201d might \u201cthemselves choose to do so, as opposed to firing CRNAs and hiring anesthesiologists\u201d (majority op at 214). There are two answers to this: First, the record shows that the reason most physicians do not themselves perform these \u201cmeasures\u201d is that most of them are not qualified to perform them; secondly, even if some do choose to perform the tasks themselves, it is most unlikely, based on the evidence in this record, that so few will turn to anesthesiologists that CRNAs will suffer no injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The majority\u2019s conclusion is agnostic: \u201cThe recommended procedures might, or might not, actually affect the employment of CRNAs in physicians\u2019 offices.\u201d (Majority op at 214.) The majority\u2019s reasoning seems to suggest that any doubt about the existence of plaintiffs injury is a sufficient reason to deny standing. I do not think this is, or ever has been, the law\u2014and in any event, for the reasons I have stated, I do not think there is any doubt about the injury to the CRNAs here.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The injury in fact issue here is controlled by <em>Matter of Dental Socy. of State ofN.Y. v Carey </em>(61 NY2d 330 [1984]), in which an organization of licensed dentists was held to have standing to challenge a Medicaid dental fee reimbursement schedule. The plaintiff alleged, and the record demonstrated, that among its members were some who would receive less compensation because of the inadequate fee schedule; this was enough to show injury in fact. The present case differs only in that the facts relevant to the injury to plaintiffs members are more complicated; the record, as described above, overwhelmingly demonstrates that at least some CRNAs will lose the opportunity for work if the Guidelines are implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>The only case cited by the majority as supporting its holding is <em>Rudder v Pataki </em>(93 NY2d 273 [1999]). In <em>Rudder, </em>an association of social workers and a union of health and human services workers were among the plaintiffs who challenged an Executive Order of the Governor. That order had prevented the Department of Health from instituting a requirement that certain hospital positions be held only by people having a Master\u2019s degree in social work (MSW). Some members of the organizational plaintiffs held MSWs, and the Court acknowledged that those members \u201cwill not have the benefit of increased job prospects\u201d because of the Executive Order in issue <em>(id. </em>at 279). But, the Court said, \u201cthis does not mean that any one individual member with an MSW has been or will be injured\u201d <em>(id.). </em>The Court concluded that the anticipated injury to the association members was \u201c[a]t best . . . only \u2018tenuous\u2019 and \u2018ephemeral\u2019 \u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">I admit I find this portion of the <em>Rudder </em>opinion difficult to explain; I can no more understand why people holding MSWs were not injured in <em>Rudder </em>than I can understand how the CRNAs are not injured here. I believe that <em>Rudder </em>was more soundly based on its second alternative holding\u2014that since the organizational plaintiffs represented both social workers with MSWs and social workers without them, \u201cthe interests of the organizations . . . are not entirely germane to the relief they seek . . .\u201d <em>(id.). </em>In any event, even if it could be shown that <em>Rudder </em>rests on a logical error, I would not regard that as justification for being equally illogical in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">I find decisions like the present one, and like the first alternative holding <em>in Rudder, to </em>be troubling because they render the law of standing unpredictable. Indeed, I am convinced from a reading of the briefs that no party expected this case to be dismissed on \u201cinjury in fact\u201d grounds.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Standing is a complicated subject at best, and there is always the danger that it will become a black box, from which a judicial conjurer can extract the desired result at will.-, I do not say that any such thing has happened in this case; but I do say that such things have happened before, and will probably happen again. Today\u2019s decision can only increase that unfortunate likelihood.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Because I am convinced that injury in fact is present and because I believe that CRNAs are within the \u201czone of interests\u201d protected by the statutes and legal doctrines plaintiff is seeking to enforce (see <em>Dental Socy., </em>61 NY2d 330 [1984]), I would hold that plaintiff has standing to maintain this action. Since the majority concludes otherwise, the merits of the action are moot, and I do not address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo and Read concur with Chief Judge Kaye; Judge R.S. Smith dissents in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-9\">. As to one paragraph of the complaint (1f 30), defendants\u2019 answer first admitted it in part, and referred the court to the Guidelines as to the remainder; then, later, denied the entire paragraph. The reason for this inconsistency is not apparent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-10\">. This statement is even less impressive than it appears on its face because of the use of the word \u201crequire.\u201d It is defendants\u2019 position that the Guidelines are only recommendations and do not \u201crequire\u201d anything. Thus Osten\u2019s statement could be literally true, in his own opinion, even if the Guidelines\u2019 \u201crecommendations\u201d include anesthesiologist supervision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b265-6\">. Defendants say that the clause requiring a \u201cphysician, dentist or podiatrist. . . who is qualified\u201d was included \u201cbecause the Guidelines also apply to dentists and podiatrists.\u201d This leaves unanswered the question of why the clause was made applicable to physicians. If defendants are correct, the Guidelines should read \u201cby a physician, or by a dentist or podiatrist . . . who is qualified.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b266-8\">. I assume that\u2014as the author\u2019s e-mail seems to suggest\u2014some nonanesthesiologists could meet the criteria specified for supervisors in the Guidelines, and that plaintiffs claim that the Guidelines would require an anesthesiologist at <em>all </em>office-based surgeries is therefore overstated. But this does not affect the thrust of plaintiffs \u201cinjury in fact\u201d argument\u2014that the Guidelines will compel many physicians to hire anesthesiologists instead of CRNAs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b266-9\">. It will be interesting to see whether, having prevailed on their argument that the language is meaningless, defendants will now interpret it that way in practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b266-10\">. The majority\u2019s reference to \u201crigorous\u201d enforcement is pure surplusage. CRNAs will be injured if the Guidelines are enforced at all\u2014the \u201crigor\u201d of the enforcement would affect only the extent, not the fact, of their injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b268-7\">. Defendants\u2019 \u201cinjury in fact\u201d argument is not only extremely weak, as I pointed out above; it is presented in perfunctory and unenthusiastic fashion. Though \u201cinjury in fact\u201d is logically a threshold issue, defendants do not discuss it until after a lengthy argument on the \u201czone of interests\u201d issue. They then devote three pages of their 46-page brief to \u201cinjury in fact.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
