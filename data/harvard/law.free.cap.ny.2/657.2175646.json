The muddled history of this case determines our answer to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">On April 24, 2000\u2014more than four years ago\u2014the NYCLU sent a FOIL request to the City of Schenectady requesting (among other things) \u201c[a] 11 documents, memoranda, reports and/or other writings referencing . . . [u]se of force by police officers against civilians.\u201d The City responded that the request was \u201ctoo broad,\u201d and the NYCLU thereafter limited its request to \u201c[fincident reports prepared by police officers pertaining to use of force.\u201d The City made no response. The NYCLU then filed an appeal with the Mayor, as the Records Access Appeals Officer (see Public Officers Law \u00a7 89). The City again made no response and, on May 7, 2001, the Department of State Committee on Open Government issued an Advisory Opinion concluding that the City had failed to comply with FOIL.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">With still no response, on August 1, 2001 the NYCLU filed this CPLR article 78 proceeding alleging that the City violated FOIL by neither producing the requested records nor submitting a particularized, specific justification for its failure to do so. The City then produced certain documents including Police Objective Review Committee\u2019s Annual Reports for 1999 and 2000 and offered to provide access to the Corporation Counsel\u2019s \u201cClaim Book\u201d listing all filed claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">Before Supreme Court, the City represented that the records being sought were \u201cof the same type\u201d as those sought in <em>Matter of Gannett Co. v James </em>(86 AD2d 744 [4th Dept 1982], <em>lv denied </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>56 NY2d 502 [1982]) where the \u201cUse of Force\u201d form utilized by the Rochester Police Department was exempt from FOIL disclosure. Citing <em>Gannett, </em>Supreme Court agreed that the City was not required to produce the incident reports because \u201ccase authority squarely holds that incident reports prepared by police officers detailing use of force are exempt from disclosure under Public Officers Law \u00a7 87 (2) (g).\u201d Before the Appellate Division, the City again argued that the Schenectady use of force form was \u201cessentially identical\u201d to the form used in <em>Gannett </em>and therefore production was not required. The Appellate Division affirmed, concluding that \u201cthe Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>[.Matter of Gould v New York City Police Dept., </em>89 NY2d 267 (1996)] neither erodes nor overrules the Fourth Department\u2019s holding in <em>Gannett Co.\u201d </em>(306 AD2d 784, 786 [3d Dept 2003].) We granted the NYCLU leave to appeal (1 NY3d 503 [2003]).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">After the NYCLU\u2019s brief was filed, the City informed this Court by letter that it had discovered \u201ca misunderstanding of the record.\u201d Supported by the affidavit of the Police Chief enclosed with its letter, the City represented to us that it \u201cdoes not have or utilize a \u2018Use of Force\u2019 form. In fact, the City has no routine procedure for reporting use of force other than references that might be included in standard incident and arrest reports which would normally be available for inspection pursuant to NY Public Officers Law \u00a7 87, or in the course of internal affairs investigations which would be exempt from public inspection pursuant to POL \u00a7 87 (2) (a) and Civil Rights Law \u00a7 50-a.\u201d Additionally, the City wrote us, \u201cthe present Administration would have likely agreed to disclosure of use of force materials, redacted to safeguard exempt information, or to an in camera review by Supreme Court.\u201d The Police Chief\u2019s affidavit, however, further states that \u201csearching the thousands of such reports each year to determine whether any reference to the use of force is entered therein would present a considerable burden on the personnel of my department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The NYCLU countered that it had been given a \u201crunaround for the past four years,\u201d and asks us to order production subject to an in camera inspection of records as to which an exemption is claimed. The City\u2019s brief before this Court\u2014completed after its representation that it does not have any use of force forms\u2014 continues to address the theoretical issue regarding whether use of force forms are exempt from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The City\u2019s inconsistent position presents a situation far different from the leave application, and creates a quandary. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Though the legal issue that has been briefed centers on use of force forms essentially identical to Rochester\u2019s in <em>Gannett (see Matter of Newsday, Inc. v New York City Police Dept., </em>133 AD2d 4, 18-19 [1st Dept 1987] [annexing the form]), we now know from correspondence and oral argument that in fact the City has no such records. Deciding whether such documents, had they existed, would have been subject to FOIL production is thus an academic issue. We do not decide academic issues, and on this record have no occasion to consider whether <em>Gannett </em>has any continuing viability after <em>Gould. </em>By the same token, the City acknowledges that its incident and arrest reports would normally be subject to FOIL, and that it would agree to disclosure of existing use of force materials, redacted to safeguard exempt information, or to an in camera review, but maintains that searching the thousands of such documents involved would be burdensome.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">In this setting, the Appellate Division conclusion that \u201cthe denial of petitioner\u2019s request in this regard was entirely proper\u201d (306 AD2d at 786) cannot stand. The City does have incident and arrest reports that may include reference to use of force, and would be willing to disclose those subject to appropriate redaction or review. Denial of petitioner\u2019s request was therefore not \u201centirely proper.\u201d The shifting sands have, however, obscured even what records are in dispute at this time, although the parties at oral argument indicated essential agreement that <em>at </em>least documents evidencing assaults or injuries to a police officer or suspect, or use of a weapon, and documents pertaining to resisting arrest would pertain to use of force and would be subject to FOIL production.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Oral argument before the Court of Appeals is not the time or place for fixing the precise parameters of records \u201cpertaining to use of force.\u201d What is clear above all is that the \u201crunaround\u201d must end. The matter should therefore be remitted to Supreme Court, for its direction\u2014consistent with the City\u2019s obligations and acknowledgments\u2014as to documents to be produced, subject to review by that court or a referee as necessary. The City is reminded that government records are \u201cpresumptively open,\u201d statutory exemptions are \u201cnarrowly construed,\u201d and the City must articulate a \u201cparticularized and specific justification\u201d for nondisclosure <em>(Matter of Gould v New York City Police Dept. </em>89 NY2d 267, 274, 275 [1996] [internal quotation marks omitted]). We trust that the City\u2019s present attitude toward its disclosure obligations, together with Supreme Court\u2019s expeditious resolu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>tion of disputed issues, will bring a prompt and satisfactory end to this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the matter remitted to Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo, Read and R.S. Smith concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
