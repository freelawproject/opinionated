The application of this Court\u2019s scope of review to the Appellate Division\u2019s decision necessitates the reversal of the Appellate Division\u2019s decision and a reinstatement of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. <em>(Matter of New York State Assn, of Criminal Defense Lawyers v Kaye, </em>95 NY2d 556; <em>Schwartz v Greenberg, </em>304 NY 250; <em>Matter of Belding v Belding, </em>53 NY2d 810; <em>Hart v Blabey, </em>287 NY 257; <em>People v Kin Kan, </em>78 NY2d 54; <em>People ex rel.

There is a protected property interest that vests or attaches at the point when a person has filed for a SEQRA review with the environmental assessment form. <em>(RRI Realty Corp. v Incorporated Vil. of Southampton, </em>870 F2d 911; <em>Sullivan v Town of Salem, </em>805 F2d 81; <em>City of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio v Buckeye Community Hope Found., </em>538 US 188; <em>Town of Orangetown v Magee, </em>88 NY2d 41.) II. The courts of this state have, historically, recognized that in certain situations property rights vest even where there was no substantial construction undertaken. <em>(Matter of Schoonmaker </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number><em>Homes\u2014John Steinberg, Inc. v Village of Maybrook, </em>178 AD2d 722; <em>Telimar Homes v Miller, </em>14 AD2d 586, 701; <em>Preble Aggregate v Town of Preble, </em>263 AD2d 849; <em>Matter of Ellington Constr.

III. Where a permit has been issued, an approval granted or a right vested, a property owner possesses a cognizable property interest sufficient to satisfy the basic element of a due process claim; predicated on today\u2019s construction and development realities, the right should be vested at an earlier stage than the \u201cpermit\u201d being issued, or an approval granted. <em>(RRI Realty Corp. v Incorporated Vil. of Southampton, </em>870 F2d 911; <em>Brady v Town of Colchester, </em>863 F2d 205; <em>Town of Orangetown v Magee, </em>88 NY2d 41.) IV It is not only a breach of the \u201cequitable\u201d theory of vesting to delay egregiously so as to change the law after the filing of an environmental assessment form, but also of the \u201clegal\u201d theory, since there has been a substantial expenditure and engineering, architectural, financial, legal and other expertise has been brought into play at a large monetary cost. <em>(Matter of Pete Drown, Inc. v Town Bd. of Town of Ellenburg, </em>229 AD2d 877.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b668-4\"><em>J. Wade Beltramo, </em>Albany, for New York State Conference of Mayors and Municipal Officials, amicus curiae in the second above-entitled action.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZG\">I. The nature of the permitting process for altering a public roadway did not entitle plaintiff to a permit as of right and, thus, plaintiff does not have a proprietary interest in the permit. <em>(Markey v County of Queens, </em>154 NY 675; <em>Acme Realty Co. v Schinasi, </em>215 NY 495; <em>City of New York v Rice, </em>198 NY 124; <em>People v Kerr, </em>27 NY 188; <em>Board of Trustees of Vil. of Lansing v Pyramid Cos., </em>51 AD2d 414; <em>Matter of Hill v Town of Horicon, </em>176 AD2d 1169; <em>Matter of Danial v Town of Delhi, </em>185 AD2d 500; <em>Lincoln Safe Deposit Co. v City of New York, </em>210 NY 34; <em>Cities Serv.

Although the projects ultimately proceeded to completion, appellants seek damages under 42 USC \u00a7 1983 for the delays occasioned by the wrongdoing. We conclude, as did the Appellate Division, that there was no constitutional violation and the complaints should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">\n<em>Bower Associates v Town of Pleasant Valley</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A5P\">Bower Associates, a housing developer, owns approximately 91 acres in Dutchess County\u201488 acres in the Town of Poughkeepsie and three adjacent acres in the Town of Pleasant Valley. In August 1999, Poughkeepsie approved Bower\u2019s plan to subdivide the land and construct the Stratford Farms subdivision\u2014134 detached single-family homes and 51 townhouses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The project has two access roads\u2014one wholly within Poughkeepsie, the second partially in Pleasant Valley, through the three-acre Bower Associates subdivision. Poughkeepsie\u2019s final approval of Stratford Farms was conditioned on approval by Pleasant Valley of the access road partially within that Town.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">In January 1999, Bower applied to the Pleasant Valley Planning Board for permission to subdivide its three acres there to create three residential homes and access roads for use by both Bower subdivisions. In January 2000, the Pleasant Valley Planning Board denied Bower\u2019s application, citing numerous environmental concerns relating to the Stratford Farms subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">In Bower\u2019s challenge under CPLR article 78, Supreme Court directed approval of the subdivision plan, concluding that the Planning Board\u2019s actions were arbitrary in that its determination was not based on environmental concerns unique to the Bower Associates subdivision. Rather, \u201cthe determination was driven largely by community pressure because the Stratford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Farms subdivision located in the Town of Poughkeepsie would provide no tax benefit to the Town of Pleasant Valley.\u201d The Appellate Division affirmed, agreeing that Bower \u201cmet all the conditions needed for approval of its subdivision application in both this and the related Stratford [Farms] subdivision\u201d <em>(Matter of Bower Assoc. v Planning Bd. of Town of Pleasant Val., </em>289 AD2d 575, 575 [2d Dept 2001]).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Its article 78 relief in hand, in March 2001 Bower commenced this civil rights action pursuant to 42 USC \u00a7 1983 against the Town of Pleasant Valley and its Planning Board for $2 million in damages, alleging a denial of procedural and substantive due process, equal protection and just compensation. Supreme Court denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, but the Appellate Division reversed, finding no cognizable property interest entitling Bower to substantive due process protection, both because the Board had discretion in granting subdivision approval and because defendants violated no rights protected by the United States Constitution (304 AD2d 259 [2d Dept 2003]). Further, the Appellate Division dismissed Bower\u2019s takings and equal protection claims, concluding that Bower alleged no unlawful taking, and failed to show that the subject property was treated differently from other similarly situated properties. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">\n<em>Home Depot v Dunn</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In February 1996, Home Depot, U.S.A., Inc., a home improvement retailer, obtained site plan approval from the Village of Port Chester to develop an 8.33 acre site for a retail establishment of approximately 101,467 square feet, with an 18,000 square foot outdoor garden center and 537 parking spaces in Port Chester, at the border between Port Chester and the City of Rye.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The facility opened in February 2000, after long wrangling with defendants, the City of Rye, its Mayor and City Council members (collectively Rye).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">As an \u201cInterested Agency\u201d in the environmental review process led by Port Chester, Rye demanded that four traffic-mitigating measures be imposed, among them the widening of Midland Avenue in Rye\u2014and Port Chester made that demand a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>condition for its approval of the project.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because Midland Avenue is a county road within the City of Rye, the plans also required the County\u2019s approval, which in turn required the City\u2019s approval. Thus, without Rye\u2019s go-ahead, Home Depot could not proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Beginning in fall 1996 with a Home Depot letter threatening damages actions unless Rye signed the county permit, tension mounted. After several executive sessions of the Rye City Council, and negotiations with Home Depot, the parties reached tentative settlement in February 1997, with Rye exacting a promise of a $200,000 payment by Home Depot and additional traffic-mitigation measures, and agreeing not to appeal an adverse decision in its second article 78 proceeding against Port Chester. In March 1997, however, after community opposition, the City Council rejected the settlement and refused consent to the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">In April 1997, Home Depot commenced two suits\u2014an article 78 proceeding to compel Rye to sign (and the County of Westchester to issue) the permit, and a civil rights action pursuant to 42 USC \u00a7 1983 against the Mayor and the City Council members (both personally and officially) seeking $50 million in compensatory damages and unspecified punitive damages, for delaying construction by more than two years. As a July 1997 Home Depot interoffice memorandum reflects, Home Depot saw the \u201creal value\u201d of the section 1983 action \u201cas leverage for settlement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">On January 30, 1998, in Home Depot\u2019s article 78 proceeding, Supreme Court\u2014while recognizing that the actions Home Depot sought to compel were \u201cof a discretionary nature\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> held that Rye\u2019s insistence on additional mitigation measures and its refusal to approve the permit were arbitrary and capricious. The court annulled Rye\u2019s denial of the road-widening permit, and the Appellate Division affirmed (259 AD2d 547 [2d Dept 1999]). At about that time, however, Home Depot\u2019s site plan approval from Port Chester expired, which necessitated a third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>environmental review. Port Chester issued a new site plan approval, which did not require the widening of Midland Avenue or Rye\u2019s consent. Construction began almost immediately and the facility opened in February 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Meanwhile, discovery proceeded in the section 1983 action, after which Home Depot sought summary judgment and Rye cross-moved for dismissal of the complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Supreme Court granted Home Depot\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to liability on its substantive due process claim, holding that Home Depot had a \u201cclear entitlement to defendants\u2019 approval of the permit\u201d because defendants\u2019 refusal to sign off on the permit lacked a rational basis, and that defendants\u2019 conduct was a gross abuse of governmental authority. The court denied Home Depot\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the equal protection claim, finding a triable issue with respect to the similarities of other permit applications to Home Depot\u2019s; the court further denied both sides summary judgment with respect to the takings claim, and denied defendants\u2019 claim of immunity. The Appellate Division reversed and dismissed the complaint, concluding that Home Depot had failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to a due process violation and that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity, rendering the remaining contentions academic (305 AD2d 459 [2d Dept 2003]). We now affirm as to the lack of a constitutional violation, and thus need not reach the immunity issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">In the land-use context, 42 USC \u00a7 1983 protects against municipal actions that violate a property owner\u2019s rights to due process, equal protection of the laws and just compensation for the taking of property under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution <em>(Town of Orangetown v Ma-gee, </em>88 NY2d 41, 49 [1996]). Both cases before us center on alleged deprivation of substantive due process; in this Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Home Depot also presses a claimed violation of the guarantee of equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">We underscore at the outset of our analysis the Appellate Division\u2019s observation that \u201c42 USC \u00a7 1983 is not simply an additional vehicle for judicial review of land-use determinations\u201d <em>(Bower Assoc. v Town of Pleasant Val., </em>304 AD2d 259, 263 [2d Dept 2003]). In the same vein, federal courts dismissing section 1983 land-use claims have repeatedly noted that they do not function as zoning boards of appeal, or substitute for state courts interpreting land-use regulations. The point is simply that denial of a permit\u2014even an <em>arbitrary </em>denial redressable by an article 78 or other state law proceeding\u2014is not tantamount to a constitutional violation under 42 USC \u00a7 1983; significantly more is required. With that in mind, we turn to consideration of appellants\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Substantive Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">More often litigated in federal courts, the issue of substantive due process in land-use cases has come before this Court once, in <em>Town of Orangetown v Magee (88 </em>NY2d 41 [1996]). There, the Magees had acquired 34 acres of land in the Town of Orangetown at an estimated cost of $3 million in order to construct a 184,000 square foot industrial building. Years later, after plans had been approved, a permit issued and more than $4 million spent on the land and building, the Town revoked the permit and amended its Zoning Code to preclude commercial buildings on the land, halting the project. We agreed with the trial court and Appellate Division that the Town\u2019s action violated 42 USC \u00a7 1983, and affirmed the order reinstating the building permit and awarding the Magees damages of $5,137,126, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Drawing on federal precedents, we set out the two-part test for substantive due process violations. First, claimants must establish a cognizable property interest, meaning a vested property interest, or \u201cmore than a mere expectation or hope to retain the permit and continue their improvements; they must show that pursuant to State or local law, they had a legitimate claim of entitlement to continue construction\u201d <em>(Magee, 88 </em>NY2d at 52 [internal quotation marks omitted]). Second, claimants must show that the governmental action was wholly without legal justification <em>(id. </em>at 53).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Key to establishing the Magees\u2019 cognizable property interest was that the right to develop their land had vested under state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>law: they owned the land, a permit and improvements and \u201cunquestionably would have received the limited future authorizations necessary to complete the project. . . . [T]he Town had \u2018engendered a clear expectation of continued enjoyment\u2019 of the permit sufficient to constitute a protectable property interest for purposes of a section 1983 claim\u201d <em>(Magee, </em>88 NY2d at 52-53, quoting <em>Barry v Barchi, </em>443 US 55, 64 n 11 [1979]). The Magees satisfied the second requirement by establishing that the Town\u2019s actions were \u201cwithout legal justification and motivated entirely by political concerns\u201d <em>(Magee, </em>88 NY2d at 53).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Federal courts elaborating on the first element of the test have noted that it should be applied \u201cwith considerable rigor\u201d <em>(RRI Realty Corp. v Incorporated Vil. of Southampton, </em>870 F2d 911, 918 [2d Cir 1989]). Even if \u201cobjective observers would estimate that the probability of [obtaining the relief sought] was extremely high, the opportunity of the local agency to deny issuance suffices to defeat the existence of a federally protected property interest\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Beyond a vested property right arising from substantial expenditures pursuant to a lawful permit (as in <em>Magee), </em>a legitimate claim of entitlement to a permit can exist only where there is either a \u201ccertainty or a very strong likelihood\u201d that an application for approval would have been granted <em>(Harlen Assoc. v Incorporated Vil. of Mineola, </em>273 F3d 494, 504 [2d Cir 2001]).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Where an issuing authority has discretion in approving or denying a permit, a clear entitlement can exist only when that discretion \u201cis so narrowly circumscribed that approval of a proper application is virtually assured\u201d <em>(Villager Pond, Inc. v Town of Darien, </em>56 F3d 375, 378 [2d Cir 1995]; <em>see also Natale v Town of Ridgefield, </em>170 F3d 258, 263 [2d Cir 1999]; <em>Walz v Town of Smithtown, </em>46 F3d 162, 168 [2d Cir 1995]).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">As for the second element of the test, \u201conly the most egregious official conduct can be said to be arbitrary in the constitutional sense\u201d <em>(City of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio v Buckeye Community Hope Found., </em>538 US 188, 198 [2003] [internal quotation marks omitted]; <em>see also Harlen, </em>273 F3d at 501 [board action based on community opposition is not unconstitutionally arbitrary \u201cif the opposition is based on legitimate state interests such as, <em>inter alia, </em>traffic, safety, crime, community pride, or noise\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>(internal quotation marks omitted)]; <em>Natale, </em>170 F3d at 263 [\u201c(s)ubstantive due process standards are violated only by conduct that is so outrageously arbitrary as to constitute a gross abuse of governmental authority\u201d]; <em>Lisa\u2019s Party City, Inc. v Town of Henrietta, </em>185 F3d 12, 17 [2d Cir 1999] [where town acted in accordance with a legitimate concern, it cannot be said to have acted \u201cin an outrageously arbitrary manner so as to violate (plaintiffs) substantive due process rights\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The two-part test strikes an appropriate balance between the role of local governments in regulatory matters affecting the health, welfare and safety of their citizens, and the protection of constitutional rights \u201cat the very outer margins of municipal behavior. It represents an acknowledgment that decisions on matters of local concern should ordinarily be made by those whom local residents select to represent them in municipal government\u201d <em>(Zahra v Town of Southold, </em>48 F3d 674, 680 [2d Cir 1995]).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Applying this test, we agree with the Appellate Division that neither appellant established a cognizable property interest or arbitrary conduct of a constitutional dimension.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">While recognizing the discretion of the Planning Board in the subdivision approval process, Bower argues that because the Board acted <em>outside its discretion </em>there was necessarily a deprivation of a protected property right. This claim relies heavily on the Appellate Division\u2019s conclusion in the article 78 proceeding that Bower had \u201cmet all the conditions needed for approval of its subdivision application in both this and the related Stratford [Farms] subdivision\u201d (289 AD2d at 575). In effect, Bower argues that victory in an article 78 proceeding\u2014a finding that conduct was arbitrary, capricious and without rational basis, or an abuse of discretion, or even action beyond or outside a board\u2019s discretion\u2014establishes a constitutionally protected property interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The law is otherwise. While the existence of discretion in a municipal actor does not alone defeat the existence of a property interest in a permit applicant, that discretion must be so narrowly circumscribed that approval is virtually assured. That was the case in <em>Magee </em>(88 NY2d at 52 [town engendered clear expectation of future authorizations]), and <em>Walz v Town of Smithtown </em>(46 F3d 162, 168 [2d Cir 1995] [so long as the permit application stated nature, location, extent and purpose of the proposed excavations, there was no discretion to decline the permit]), and <em>Sullivan v Town of Salem </em>(805 F2d 81, 85 [2d Cir <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>1986] [if homes fully conformed to building requirements, builder was entitled to certificates of occupancy]). That is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">We reach the same conclusions as to Home Depot, where the actions it sought to compel were discretionary in nature and that discretion had not been so circumscribed as to create a clear entitlement to Rye\u2019s signature on the County\u2019s permit. Moreover, unlike Bower (which owned the subject land), Home Depot at the time of Rye\u2019s refusal to consent to the road-widening permit was a contract vendee and, significantly, had only conditional site plan approval for the property it hoped to buy.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">In neither case was the challenged conduct constitutionally arbitrary. While the lower courts concluded that the municipalities\u2019 actions in both cases were arbitrary, capricious and without rational basis in an article 78 sense, what is lacking is the egregious conduct that implicates federal constitutional law <em>(see e.g. Walz, </em>46 F3d 162 [1995] [homeowner compelled to convey portion of property in order to obtain water and utility service]; <em>Scott v Greenville County, </em>716 F2d 1409 [4th Cir 1983] [moratorium to limit rental housing for minorities]).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Thus, we agree with the Appellate Division in each case that appellant has failed to state a cause of action for a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Equal Protection</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Unlike substantive due process, the Equal Protection Clause has generated relatively few federal court decisions in land-use cases, and none in this Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because equal protection can no more become another general overseer of local land-use determinations than substantive due process, the standards must be applied with the same \u201crigor\u201d <em>(see RRI Realty Corp. v Incorporated Vil. of Southampton, </em>870 F2d at 918).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">The essence of a violation of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection is, of course, that all persons similarly situated must be treated alike. Home Depot\u2019s equal protection challenge does not rest on differential treatment as a constitutionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>protected suspect class, or denial of a fundamental right <em>(see e.g. Frooks v Town of Corttandt, </em>997 F Supp 438, 453 [SD NY 1998], <em>affd </em>182 F3d 899 [2d Cir 1999] [unpublished op]). Rather, Home Depot\u2019s equal protection claim sounds in selective enforcement <em>(see Village of Willowbrook v Olech, </em>528 US 562 [2000]).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">As such, a violation of equal protection arises where <em>first, </em>a person (compared with others similarly situated) is selectively treated and <em>second, </em>such treatment is based on impermissible considerations such as race, religion, intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person <em>(Harlen Assoc. v Incorporated Vil. of Mineola, </em>273 F3d 494, 499 [2d Cir 2001]). In that Home Depot does not allege selective treatment based on race, religion or punishment for the exercise of constitutional rights, it must demonstrate that Rye singled out its request for consent to the road-widening permit with malevolent intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The \u201csimilarly situated\u201d element of the test asks \u201cwhether a prudent person, looking objectively at the incidents, would think them roughly equivalent\u201d <em>(Penlyn Dev. Corp. v Incorporated Vil. of Lloyd Harbor, </em>51 F Supp 2d 255, 264 [ED NY 1999]). But even different treatment of persons similarly situated, without more, does not establish a claim. What matters is impermissible motive: proof of action with intent to injure\u2014that is, proof that the applicant was singled out with an \u201cevil eye and an unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances\u201d <em>(Masi Mgt. v Town of Ogden </em>[appeal No. 3], 273 AD2d 837, 838 [4th Dept 2000], quoting <em>Matter of 303 W. 42nd St. Corp. v Klein, </em>46 NY2d 686, 693 [1979]). The following cases (where federal courts denied motions to dismiss equal protection claims) are illustrative: <em>Forseth v Village of Sussex </em>(199 F3d 363, 371 [7th Cir 2000] [village official demanded and received significant personal financial gain]); <em>LaTrieste Rest. &amp; Cabaret Inc. v Village of Port Chester </em>(40 F3d 587, 590 [2d Cir 1994] [village\u2019s enforcement tactics to prohibit proposed land use included fines and arrests]); <em>Brady v Town of Colchester </em>(863 F2d 205 [2d Cir 1988] [permit denied because owner leased space to opposing political party]); <em>Gavlak v Town of Somers </em>(267 F Supp 2d 214, 223 [D Conn 2003] [town officials acted to destroy business after owner refused to make a zoning official a partner in the business]).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Home Depot argues that it was treated in a manner uniquely different from any other applicant and that Rye with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>held, its signature from the county permit in order to impede construction, despite having executed other contemporaneous applications within hours or days. There is no proof, however, that other entities were similarly situated to Home Depot\u2014in terms of obtaining Rye\u2019s signature on comparable permits\u2014and received more favorable treatment. The other allegedly comparable situations\u2014permits for road work by the New York State Thruway Authority, a curb cut, digging up pavement to install a domestic water service, closing the entrance of a driveway and installing a water service pipe\u2014were not shown to be comparable to widening a county road for a traffic influx and thus do not support an equal protection claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">While Home Depot makes much of the City Manager\u2019s testimony that this was the first permit the City Council reviewed in executive session, the requisite showing of improper motivation is lacking. Home Depot\u2019s improper motivation claim more closely addresses the merits of the City\u2019s decision than its constitutionality <em>(Harlen, </em>273 F3d at 502; <em>Masi Mgt. v Town of Ogden, </em>180 Misc 2d 881, 902 [Sup Ct, Monroe County 1999] [\u201cThe concept of equal protection is trivialized when it is used to subject every decision (claimed to be arbitrary and capricious in the sense contemplated by principles of State administrative law) to constitutional review by federal courts\u201d], <em>affd </em>273 AD2d 837 [4th Dept 2000]). Even the community\u2019s \u201cpolitical\u201d opposition to the high-traffic superstore at the City\u2019s border is not the equivalent of the \u201cevil eye and an unequal hand\u201d for constitutional equal protection purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Accordingly, in each case, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo and Read concur; Judge R.S. Smith taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">In each case: Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-9\">. After Poughkeepsie approved the subdivision, Pleasant Valley brought a CPLR article 78 proceeding to nullify that determination.

In denying the motion, Supreme Court noted that \u201c[t]he issue of building a Home Depot in Port Chester has generated extensive litigation between Port Chester and Rye over the past few years, as well as strong community opposition to the project by the citizens of Rye. Rye officials have adamantly opposed said project\u201d <em>(Home Depot U.S.A., Inc. v Dunn, </em>Sup Ct., Westchester County, Feb. 17, 1998, Cowhey, J., Index No. 97/05316).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b674-6\">.
