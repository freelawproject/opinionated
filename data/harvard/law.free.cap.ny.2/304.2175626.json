We conclude that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Defendant was charged in a single-count indictment with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (Penal Law \u00a7 220.39), arising from a buy and bust operation in Manhattan. His trial consisted of approximately three hours of testimony from three witnesses, two for the prosecution and one for the defense. The only issue at trial was the identity of defendant as the seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">On the morning of April 30, 2001, following summations, the trial judge charged the jury and it began its deliberations. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>about five hours, and having requested exhibits and readback of testimony, the jury sent a note at 4:05 p.m. claiming that it was \u201cdeadlock[ed] at this time.\u201d The jurors were brought back into the courtroom and, the trial judge instructed them to \u201c[c]ontinue deliberating. We await your verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jurors were subsequently excused until 9:30 a.m. the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">On the second day of deliberations, the jurors again made a request for testimony to be read back. At 3:30 p.m., after about five more hours of deliberations, the jurors sent a second deadlock note to the court, stating that \u201cwe are not able to come up with a unanimous decision.\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s request for a mistrial was rejected and the jurors were brought into the courtroom. The trial judge then delivered the following supplemental instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">\u201cWhen we started, you heard me describe a couple of different ways in the preliminary remarks and in the jury selection what the point of this was. Other countries do it a different way. You heard me describe how some countries don\u2019t have juries. Some countries don\u2019t have trials. We collectively for over 200 years have decided that we\u2019re not leaving it to a group of military officers. We\u2019re not leaving it to the single judge. We\u2019re not leaving it to a panel of judges but you folks are doing it. The point of this process is to get a result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">\u201cSomething happened in this case. It was proven or not. The standard was met or it was not. The tree that fell made a noise or it didn\u2019t. The bell that was rung with nobody around\u2014sorry. Something hit the bell probably and with nobody around. Only you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>folks can tell us was there a gong, a ding, a ping or nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">\u201cWhen I started to tell you what the law was so you could deliberate, almost certainly I said, if not these words, close to these words: Now I\u2019m going to tell you what the law is to put you in a position to do what you said you would do when we started which is to decide this case. You heard me saying during jury selection no judge can say to defendant nor a prosecutor I\u2019m tired of this case, plead guilty, I\u2019m tired of this case, dismiss it. It stays in a drawer until a jury decides it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">\u201cSomething happened in this case. It was not a nonevent. The standard was met or it was not and there is no other entity on the face of the earth that can tell us what the answer is to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">\u201cYour note says: At 3:30 you, on May the 1st, [\u2018]we are not able to come up with a unanimous decision.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">\u201cWhether there is a rare occurrence\u2014of course, it happens but it is a rare occurrence\u2014whether there is in this case the rare occurrence of a jury unable to resolve a case is not a factual decision. It\u2019s a legal decision. It is not your decision. It is mine. We are nowhere near at the point where I would begin to consider the possibility that you folks might not be able to resolve this case. Continue your deliberations please.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Defense counsel immediately registered an objection to this instruction on the ground that it was an improper <em>Allen </em>charge (see <em>Allen v United States, </em>164 US 492 [1896]), arguing that the supplemental instruction was coercive, would shame the jurors into a guilty result, and would create undue pressure on any dissenting jurors. The court denied counsel\u2019s objection, and the jury continued deliberating, returning a verdict of guilty in just five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">Supreme Court convicted defendant, upon the verdict, of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and sentenced him, as a second felony offender, to a term of 6 to 12 years. The same court denied defendant\u2019s CPL 330.30 motion to set aside the verdict made on the ground that the jury instruction was improper and coercive and therefore deprived him of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>his right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Appellate Division, with two Justices dissenting, reversed and remanded to Supreme Court for a new trial, holding that the supplemental jury instruction was unbalanced and coercive. Specifically, the Appellate Division found that the trial court\u2019s charge (1) overemphasized the need to get a result, (2) suggested that the jurors were failing in their duty, (3) stressed that \u2018\u2018[something happened\u201d in the case, (4) presented jurors with the prospect of prolonged deliberations, and (5) failed to caution jurors not to surrender their conscientiously held beliefs. We agree and affirm the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">While perhaps no one of these five flaws would alone be enough to warrant reversal, their combined effect requires it. We have long approved supplemental charges that encourage a verdict after the jury has reported a deadlock <em>(see People v Ford, </em>78 NY2d 878, 880 [1991]; <em>see also People v Pagan, </em>45 NY2d 725, 726 [1978]). \u201c[A] trial court may properly discharge its responsibility to avoid mistrials by encouraging jurors to adhere to their oaths and make one final effort to review the evidence and reach a verdict one way or the other\u201d <em>(Pagan, </em>45 NY2d at 727). However, a court \u201c \u2018must not attempt to coerce or compel the jury to agree upon a particular verdict, or any verdict\u2019 \u201d <em>(Pagan, </em>45 NY2d at 726, quoting <em>People v Faber, </em>199 NY 256, 259 [1910]). Supplemental charges that coerce jurors \u201cwith untoward pressure to reach an agreement will not be countenanced\u201d <em>(Pagan, </em>45 NY2d at 727 [citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Here, Supreme Court\u2019s supplemental instruction overemphasized the jury\u2019s obligation to return a verdict. It told the jury: \u201cThe point of this process is to get a result. Something happened in this case. It was proven or not. The standard was met or it was not.\u201d The court continued in this vein to state that it had instructed jurors as to the law so as \u201cto put you in a position to do what you said you would do when we started which is to decide this case.\u201d Limited in scope to the importance of returning a verdict and suggesting that the jurors were failing in their duty to reach a decision, the court\u2019s supplemental instruction as a whole was unbalanced and coercive <em>(see Ford, </em>78 NY2d at 880). The trial court\u2019s admonition that it was \u201cnowhere near\u201d considering that the jurors would be unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>reach a decision added to the pressure to return a verdict, presenting jurors with the prospect of prolonged deliberations well beyond the two days they had already deliberated over the three-hour trial. Finally, the supplemental jury instruction failed to advise the jurors that they should not surrender a conscientiously held belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">While an <em>Allen </em>charge is not \u201cunbalanced or coercive for its failure to emphasize that \u2018the verdict must be the verdict of each individual juror, and not a mere acquiescence in the conclusion of [a juror\u2019s] fellows\u2019 \u201d <em>(see Ford, </em>78 NY2d at 880, quoting <em>Allen, </em>164 US at 501), the charge here did not include any encouraging language to balance its instruction that the jury needed to \u201cdecide this case.\u201d In giving supplemental jury instructions to a deadlocked jury, trial courts should follow up the importance of reaching a verdict with a clarifying statement to the effect that it is the jurors\u2019 \u201cduty to decide the case <em>if </em>they [can] conscientiously do so\u201d <em>(Allen, </em>164 US at 501 [emphasis added]); jurors should not surrender their honest convictions \u201cfor the mere purpose of returning a verdict\u201d (1 CJI[NY] 42.60, at 1019 [1983]). Contrary to the court\u2019s supplemental instruction, the object of the jury system is not to \u201cget a result,\u201d it is \u201cto secure unanimity by a comparison of views, and by arguments among the jurors themselves\u201d <em>(Allen, </em>164 US at 501).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The jury here, after a three-hour trial, two full days of deliberations and a second deadlock note, returned a verdict of guilty only five minutes after the supplemental instruction was given. While the swiftness of the verdict is not dispositive, it suggests that the jury was coerced <em>(Lowenfield v Phelps, </em>484 US 231, 240 [1988]; <em>see also United States v United States Gypsum Co., </em>438 US 422, 462 [1978]). The supplemental charge here fails to negate this coercive implication. Defendant was entitled to an uncoerced, unanimous jury verdict, not one tainted by the improper jury instructions given here. On retrial, the court should be mindful that criminal \u201cjury instructions generally are not fertile ground for innovation during trial\u201d <em>(People v Owens, </em>69 NY2d 585, 589 [1987]).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Rosenblatt, Graffeo, Read and R.S. Smith concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-8\">. The full text of this first supplemental instruction, not being challenged as coercive, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">\u201cJust generally asking, ever go to a doctor and you are really upset about something. Your health is obviously the most important thing in your life. You ever find yourself describing a situation to the doctor that is obviously very very problematic and it\u2019s [sic] sort of eats you up. It is the most important thing going on in your life at that point and describe this very important personal problem. The doctor is sitting there, nodding and not saying a word because the doctor has heard it before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">\u201cI don\u2019t know what you expected when you signed on for jury service. You\u2019ve heard me in one way or [ ] another say I\u2019ve been doing this for 18 years and this is jury deliberations. Continue deliberating. We await your verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b354-7\">. The trial judge maintained at trial and in a written opinion that he \u201cgave the jury additional <em>non-Allen </em>instructions.\u201d On this appeal, both sides agree that this supplemental instruction is subject to the <em>Allen </em>charge standard of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
