Under this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sharapata v Town of Islip </em>(56 NY2d 332 [1982]), the New York City Council can, by statute, waive the City of New York\u2019s common-law immunity from punitive damages for its acts of gender-based employment discrimination so long as the statute does so \u201cexpressly.\u201d <em>(Thoreson v Penthouse Intl., </em>80 NY2d 490.) II. The New York City Human Rights Law does expressly subject the City of New York to punitive damages liability for its acts of gender-based employment discrimination. <em>(Bracker v Cohen, </em>204 AD2d 115; <em>Matter of Levy v City Commn. on Human Rights, </em>85 NY2d 740; <em>Thoreson v Penthouse Intl., </em>80 NY2d 490; <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem.

The trial court both erroneously interpreted <em>Sharapata v Town of Islip </em>(56 NY2d 332 [1982]) and erroneously applied <em>Sharapata </em>to the New York City Human Rights Law. <em>(Katt v City of New York, </em>151 F Supp 2d 313; <em>Matter of Petterson v Daystrom Corp., </em>17 NY2d 32; <em>Rust v Reyer, </em>91 NY2d 355; <em>People v Cooper, </em>219 AD2d 426, 90 NY2d 292.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b376-9\"><em>Michael A.

Under <em>Sharapata v Town of Islip </em>(56 NY2d 332 [1982]), New York City Human Rights Law (Administrative Code of City of NY) \u00a7 8-502 does not waive the City of New York\u2019s immunity from punitive damages liability. (Clark-<em>Fitzpatrick, Inc. v Long Is. R.R.

II. This Court should reject Katt\u2019s and Gurian\u2019s attempt to infer, from various New York City Human Rights Law provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>sions, that the City Council implicitly waived the City of New York\u2019s immunity from punitive damages liability. <em>(.Juarez v Wavecrest Mgt.

This Court should also reject Katt\u2019s and Gurian\u2019s attempts to infer a waiver from the New York City Human Rights Law\u2019s \u201coverall statutory scheme.\u201d <em>(Katt v City of New York, </em>151 F Supp 2d 313; <em>Thoreson v Penthouse Intl., </em>80 NY2d 490.) IV Similarly, this Court should reject Katt\u2019s and Gurian\u2019s speculative inferences that never-enacted and later-enacted bills somehow reveal an implicit waiver of immunity in New York City Human Rights Law (Administrative Code of City of NY) \u00a7 8-502 (a). <em>(Sharapata v Town of Islip, </em>56 NY2d 332; <em>Katt v City of New York, </em>151 F Supp 2d 313; <em>People v Nogueros, </em>42 NY2d 956; <em>People v Phyfe, </em>136 NY 554; <em>New York City Health &amp; Hosps.

V The State Constitution\u2019s gift provisions bar the City Council from using public money for punitive damages awards. <em>(People v Westchester County Natl.

VI. Exposing the City of New York to punitive damages liability under the New York City Human Rights Law would violate public policy. <em>(Sharapata v Town of Islip, </em>82 AD2d 350, 56 NY2d 332; <em>Costich v City of Rochester, </em>68 App Div 623; <em>City of Newport v Fact Concerts, Inc., </em>453 US 247; <em>Ciraolo v City of New York, </em>216 F3d 236, 531 US 993; <em>Clark-Fitzpatrick, Inc. v Long Is.

Both the language of Administrative Code of the City of New York \u00a7 8-502 (a) and the legislative history of Local Law No. 39 (1991) of the City of New York demonstrate that the clear import of the enactment was to permit the punitive damages to be awarded against the City of New York where warranted. <em>(Sharapata v Town of Islip, </em>56 NY2d 332; <em>Katt v City of New York, </em>151 F Supp 2d 313; <em>Juarez v Wavecrest Mgt. Team, </em>88 NY2d 628; <em>Matter of Levy v City Commn. on Human Rights, </em>85 NY2d 740; <em>Umansky v Masterpiece Intl., </em>276 AD2d 692; <em>Levin v Yeshiva Univ., </em>96 NY2d 484.) II. The New York City Human Rights Law offers both the City and all other discrimination defendants ample opportunity to mitigate punitive damages, mitigation provisions that are designed as a well-thought-through system of incentives and disincentives for all defendants. <em>(Katt v City of New York, </em>151 F Supp 2d 313.) III. Defendant\u2019s attempt to analogize city law to either state or federal civil rights law is misguided and misleading. <em>(Matter of 119-121 E. 97th St. Corp. v New York City Commn. on Human Rights, </em>220 AD2d 79; <em>Levin v Yeshiva Univ., </em>96 NY2d 484; <em>Mohamed v Marriott Intl., </em>905 F Supp 141; <em>Matter of Pace Univ. v New York City Commn. on Human Rights, </em>200 AD2d 173, 85 NY2d 125; <em>Matter of Buckhout v New York City Commn. on Human Rights, </em>203 AD2d 67.) IV The suggestion that the City of New York is somehow not an \u201cemployer\u201d for punitive damages purposes is entirely without merit. <em>(Katt v City of New York, </em>151 F Supp 2d 313.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b378-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b378-6\">ClPARIGK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Plaintiff Alii Katt<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sued her former employer, the New York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>City Police Department (the City), and Police Lieutenant Anthony DiPalma alleging that she was subjected to sexual harassment and a sexually hostile and abusive work environment in violation of state and federal law and the New York City Human Rights Law. Katt, a civilian employee, worked as a police administrative aide in the Seventh Precinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">This action was commenced roughly nine years ago, in 1995, and has an extensive procedural history. The complaint originally named three additional individual defendants and alleged several causes of action. At the time of trial, plaintiffs only remaining claims were for violations of 42 USC \u00a7 1983, the New York State Human Rights Law (Executive Law \u00a7 290 <em>et </em>seq.) and New York City Human Rights Law (Administrative Code of City of NY) \u00a7 8-502, against the City and DiPalma.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">After trial in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the jury delivered a verdict in plaintiffs favor, awarding $400,000 in compensatory damages against both defendants and $1,000,000 in punitive damages against the City. In response to defendants\u2019 motions for judgment as a matter of law <em>(see </em>Fed Rules Civ Pro rule 50 [b]) or, in the alternative, for a new trial <em>(see </em>Fed Rules Civ Pro rule 59), the court struck the punitive damages award against the City, and otherwise directed entry of judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $400,000. The court determined that punitive damages were not authorized under section 8-502 of the New York City Human Rights Law because the statute does not contain an unequivocal indication of legislative intent to waive the City\u2019s common-law immunity from liability for such damages (151 F Supp 2d 313, 345 [US Dist Ct, SD NY 2001]). The court subsequently denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Defendants appealed the District Court\u2019s denial of their motion for a new trial, which the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. Plaintiff cross-appealed from the portion of the District Court\u2019s order vacating the punitive damages award. Determining that there was insufficient guidance from this Court to resolve the issue, which raises significant state law public policy concerns, the Second Circuit certified the following question: \u201cCan a person claiming gender-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>based employment discrimination recover punitive damages from the City of New York under section 8-502(a) of the New York City Human Rights Law, N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7 8-502(a)?\u201d (341 F3d 177, 182 [2003].) We accepted certification (100 NY2d 605 [2003]) and now answer that question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Plaintiff claims gender-based employment discrimination under section 8-502 (a) of the New York City Human Rights Law, which states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, any person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful discriminatory practice as defined in chapter one of this title . . . shall have a cause of action in any court of competent jurisdiction for damages, including punitive damages, and for injunctive relief and such other remedies as may be appropriate\u201d (Administrative Code of City of NY \u00a7 8-502 [a]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Under the Code, it is an unlawful discriminatory practice for an employer \u201cto discriminate against [a] person in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment\u201d because of the person\u2019s gender <em>(see </em>Administrative Code \u00a7 8-107 [1] [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The Code then defines \u201cemployer\u201d by excluding those employers with three employees or less <em>(see </em>Administrative Code \u00a7 8-102 [5]), and does not differentiate between public and private employers. Although the definition of \u201cperson\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> includes \u201cgovernmental bodies or agencies,\u201d section 8-502 (a) uses \u201cperson\u201d to refer to those aggrieved by discriminatory treatment, rather than those subject to liability for damages <em>(see </em>Administrative Code \u00a7 8-102 [1]; \u00a7 8-502 [a]). Plaintiff argues since this Court has previously determined that the New York City Transit Authority was an \u201cemployer\u201d within the definition of the New York City Human Rights Law <em>(see Matter of Levy v City Commn. on Human Rights, </em>85 NY2d 740, 744 [1995]), that the City should also be considered an \u201cemployer\u201d here. However, holding the City to be an \u201cemployer\u201d for the purposes of the Human Rights Law, does not of itself constitute legislative authorization for punitive damages liability <em>(see Sharapata v Town of Islip, </em>56 NY2d 332, 336 n 5 [1982]).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>In <em>Sharapata, </em>we addressed whether the State of New York was liable for punitive damages under section 8 of the Court of Claims Act and held that the waiver of sovereign immunity-contained in that statute was alone insufficient to subject the State to punitive damages liability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> First, <em>\u201ca </em>statute in derogation of the sovereignty of a State must be strictly construed, waiver of immunity by inference being disfavored\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 336). Although \u201cexpress legislative authorization\u201d would be necessary to subject the State (here the municipality) to punitive damages, section 8 did not make any specific reference to such damages <em>(id. </em>n 5). Second, we found it significant that the legislative history did not give any indication that the Legislature had considered the issue of punitive damages. Finally, we observed that \u201cthe twin justifications for punitive damages\u2014 punishment and deterrence\u2014are hardly advanced when applied to a governmental unit\u201d since it is the taxpayers who are ultimately penalized <em>(id. </em>at 338; <em>see also Clark-Fitzpatrick, Inc. v Long Is. R.R. Co., </em>70 NY2d 382, 388 [1987] [holding that the Long Island Rail Road should be exempt from liability for punitive damages because a large portion of its funding came from public sources and it served an \u201cessential, governmental purpose\u201d and, as a result, the burden would actually fall upon the taxpayers]).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Here, by contrast to <em>Sharapata, </em>the language of the Code provision expressly references punitive damages. The question is whether that reference is sufficient to imply the City\u2019s waiver of immunity to liability for punitive damages. Under plaintiffs reading of the provision, since the City is within the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d under section 8-102 (5), and an \u201cemployer\u201d is prohibited from engaging in unlawful discriminatory practices under section 8-107 (1) (a), the City is expressly subject to punitive damages under section 8-502. We agree, however, with the District Court that this language is not an unambiguous expression of legislative authorization to subject the City to liability for punitive damages <em>(see </em>151 F Supp 2d at 342-343) and is insufficient to waive the City\u2019s immunity to punitive damages liability. The absence of any specific reference to the municipality in the provision itself supports the interpretation that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>is neither a waiver of sovereign immunity nor express legislative authorization for punitive damages liability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Further, the statute begins with the phrase, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law\u201d (Administrative Code \u00a7 8-502 [a]). It has been a common-law principle in this State that a municipality is not liable for punitive damages flowing from its employees\u2019 misconduct in the absence of express legislative authorization to the contrary <em>(see Sharapata, </em>56 NY2d at 336). Thus, \u201cwe must presume that the City Council was aware of the common-law rule and abrogated it only to the extent indicated by the clear import of its enactment\u201d <em>(Juarez v Wavecrest Mgt. Team, </em>88 NY2d 628, 646 [1996] [citations omitted]; <em>see also </em>McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 301 [b]). The absence of any specific reference to the municipality, combined with the \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law\u201d language, suggest that the City Council in fact intended to preserve the principle of municipal immunity from punitive damages. At best, the provision is ambiguous as to imposition of punitive damages liability upon the City and thus cannot be considered express legislative authorization or abrogation of this well-settled principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">In addition, as was the case in <em>Sharapata, </em>here there is no indication that the City Council discussed, debated or even contemplated exposing the City to punitive damages or the potential fiscal impact of punitive damages on the City. In fact, the Fiscal Impact Statement from the Finance Division of the City Council included in the Local Law Bill Jacket does not include potential punitive damages in its estimated impact on expenditures <em>(see </em>Local Law Bill Jacket, Local Law No. 39 [1991] of City of New York). The Statement did, however, mention that the proposed provision authorized civil penalties and calculated such penalties as revenue to the City <em>(see </em>Local Law Bill Jacket, Local Law No. 39 [1991]).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The general statements that the provision was intended to give \u201cenhanced protection against discrimination\u201d and should be liberally construed do not provide conclusive support for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>proposition that the City Council intended to abrogate the longstanding common-law principle that New York municipalities are immune from punitive damages liability and impose such liability on the City <em>(see </em>Report of Legal Div, Comm on Gen Welfare, at 2, 12-13, Local Law Bill Jacket, Local Law No. 39 [1991]). These statements merely reflect the broad policy behind the local law to discourage discrimination <em>(see </em>Administrative Code \u00a7 8-101 [\u201cthere is no greater danger to the health, morals, safety and welfare of the city and its inhabitants than the existence of groups prejudiced against one another and antagonistic to each other because of their actual or perceived differences\u201d]; <em>see also </em>Administrative Code \u00a7 8-130 [the Code provisions should be liberally construed]).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Plaintiff asks us to infer a waiver from the overall statutory scheme including the civil penalty provisions. The civil penalties are merely part of the Code\u2019s alternative method of recovery for victims of discrimination. A person may file a complaint with the Commission on Human Rights provided that he or she has not previously instituted a civil action or started a proceeding before an administrative agency, or filed a complaint with the State Division of Human Rights relating to the same grievance <em>(see </em>Administrative Code \u00a7 8-109 [a], [f]). In addition to such remedies as compensatory damages and back pay <em>(see </em>Administrative Code \u00a7 8-120 [a] [8], [2]), the Commission is authorized to impose civil penalties not to exceed $100,000 <em>(see </em>Administrative Code \u00a7 8-126 [a]). Instead of being paid to the complainant, however, the civil penalties are paid into a general fund <em>(see </em>Administrative Code \u00a7 8-127 [a]). The Code specifies that civil penalties received from a city agency are to be paid into a separate fund to \u201cbe used solely to support city agencies\u2019 anti-bias education programs, activities sponsored by city agencies that are designed to eradicate discrimination or to fund remedial programs that are necessary to address the city\u2019s liability for discriminatory acts or practices\u201d (Administrative Code \u00a7 8-127 [b]). It makes little sense, given scarce public resources, that the City Council would put a cap on civil penalties that would be paid into a city fund, yet allow for open-ended punitive damages liability to be paid to a plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Plaintiffs argument that a previous proposed version of the provision specifically excluded the City from a private right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>action under section 8-502 is not conclusive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It certainly seems probable that the City Council\u2019s intent in furthering the purpose behind the legislation\u2014to discourage discrimination\u2014allowed the City, as well as private entities, to be liable for compensatory damages. The omission of the language from the previous proposal, without more, cannot amount to express legislative authorization necessary to subject the City to punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">In short, persons claiming gender-based employment discrimination cannot recover punitive damages pursuant to section 8-502 as the provision does not clearly, expressly and specifically waive New York City\u2019s sovereign immunity. In light of this determination, it is not necessary to address the City\u2019s constitutional argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Accordingly, the certified question should be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Rosenblatt, Graffeo, Read and R.S.
