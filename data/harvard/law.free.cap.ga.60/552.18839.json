The deputy sheriff made the following return : \u201c Sheriff\u2019s Office, Savannah, May 16th, 1877. By virtue of within, I have this day, at half-past 12 o\u2019clock p. m., served a summons of garnishment, directed to the Central Eailroad and Banking Company of Georgia, by serving the same upon T. M. Cunningham, cashier of the said corporation, and at twenty minutes past one o\u2019clock p. m., another one upon E.

Three days before such adjournment, the garnishee traversed the return of service. The court held the return sufficient for certain purposes, immaterial here. To this ruling, the garnishee filed exception <em>pendente lite.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-7\">Prior to the traverse, and subsequent thereto, plaintiffs moved for judgment as against a garnishee in default. In response to the last motion, the garnishee proposed then to file an answer denying indebtedness, without showing any cause for his previous default. This the court permitted, and overruled the motion for judgment.
