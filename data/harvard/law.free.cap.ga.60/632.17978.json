On the trial in the justice court, judgment was rendered for the plaintiffs. The defendant sued out a <em>certiorari </em>and brought the case before the superior court, which court, after considering the justice\u2019s return thereto, sustained the <em>certiorari </em>and ordered a new trial, on the ground stated in the order, whereupon the defendant in <em>certiorari </em>excepted. When the case was called for a hearing in the court below, the defendant in <em>certiora/ri </em>made a motion to dismiss it on the ground that it was not brought within the time prescribed by law, which motion the court overruled, and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>The <em>certiorari </em>was sanctioned on the 7th of September, 1877, and filed in the clerk\u2019s office on the 12th of September, 1877. The case was tried and the judgment rendered in the justice court on the 12th of June, 1877; and the question is, whether the <em>certiorari </em>was brought in time? The 2920th section of the Code declares \u201c that all writs of <em>certiorari </em>shall be allowed and brought within three months after the rendition of the judgment sought to be reversed.\u201d A writ of <em>certiorari </em>is merely the judicial means of enforcing a right, and must not only be allowed to be brought by the sanction of the judge, but must actually be brought <em>within </em>three months after the rendition of the judgment sought to be reversed. By way of analogy to the commencement of a suit, as provided for by the 3333d section of the Code, the petition for the writ of <em>certiorari </em>in this case was brought on the 12th of September, 1877, the day it was filed in the clerk\u2019s office. The judgment sought to be reversed was rendered on the 12th of June, 1877. Counting the 12th day of June, the day on which the judgment was rendered, and the three months expired at 12 o\u2019clock at night on the 11th of September, 1877. Therefore the writ of <em>certiorari </em>was not brought <em>within </em>three months \"after the rendition of the judgment sought to be reversed, as required by law. See <em>English vs. </em>Ozburn, 59 <em>Ga., </em>392. The refusal to dismiss the <em>certiorari </em>was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Let the judgment of the court below be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
