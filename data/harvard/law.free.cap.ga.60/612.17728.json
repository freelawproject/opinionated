The <em>mcmdamits nisi </em>was granted, and made returnable to the April term of the superior court, at which term the court, after hearing and considering the answers of the ordinary and treasurer, refused to grant an order making the <em>mandamus </em>absolute. Whereupon the complainants excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-18\">We are not awai\u2019e of any law which makes provision for the payment of $2.00 per day, or any other sum, to jurors serving upon coroners\u2019 inquests in this state. Before an officer can be required to pay out public money, or be justified in doing so, those who demand its payment should be able to show a clear provision of the law which entitles them to receive it. There was no error in refusing to grant an absolute <em>mcMidamus </em>on the statement of facts contained in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-19\">Let the judgment of the court below be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
