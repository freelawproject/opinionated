The litigation was about certain land. Schofield was appointed receiver, and so acted during the litigation. At the April term of court, 1876, a verdict was rendered and decree made. The decree adjudged certain debts to be due, ordered certain credits to be entered, certain lands to be sold, and the proceeds applied as directed. It did not in express terms either continue or discharge the receiver. Afterwards, he rented a part of the land for the year 1877 to Yisage ; at the end of the term he rented to another, and proceeded against Yisage by rule to show why he should not be attached for contempt, alleging demand for the land and refusal to deliver. Defendant demurred to the rule on the ground that the litigation was ended and the receiver no longer in office. The demurrer was over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>rnled, and the rule made absolute for the delivery of the land.
