October Adjourned Term, 1877.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b682-7\">This case is connected with the case of <em>Visage vs. Schofield </em>decided just before it. That Yisage is the husband of this plaintiff in error. After an order to him to deliver possession of the land to the receiver, the latter, by his new tenant, demanded possession ; the wife refused to deliver possession on the ground that she, not her husband, had the right to hold it. On application by the receiver, the court granted an order the substance of which is set out in the head-note. She thereupon excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b682-8\">Loeton <em>&amp; </em>Bartlett, for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAF\">cited. 57 <em>Ga., </em>24 ; 47 <em>Ib., </em>366 ; 2 Dan.

Mrs. Yisage claimed possession of the land after her husband\u2019s term expired. She seems to have been in with him as his wife, but it is insisted that she should have been served with rule to show cause. The presiding judge certifies that if he had delayed the case, the receiver of the court could not have rented the land for want of time ; her counsel, too, were present in court and heard in argument. So he passed an order that she be dispossessed unless in ten days she showed to the court some reason in law or equity why she should not be dispossessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">The order seems to us proper and right. The two cases were argued together, and are in reality but one.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
