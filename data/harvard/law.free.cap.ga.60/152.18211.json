Buice has been paid as above stated, in good order as it is at this time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-6\">The chancellor decreed accordingly, appointing a receiver to effectively carry out the provisions of the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-7\">A motion for a new trial was made, because the verdict was contrary to law and evidence, because of error in the charge, and because of refusal to charge.
