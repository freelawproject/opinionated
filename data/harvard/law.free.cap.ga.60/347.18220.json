For the purpose of proving notice of dishonor to the indorsers, the certificate of a notary public, made at the time of protesting the note for non-payment, and annexed to the protest itself, may be given in evidence in connection with the testimony of the notary to the effect that the certificate is genuine, and that, though he has no recollection of the facts stated therein, or any of them, he is satisfied of their truth, because he would not have certified them had he not been convinced of their truth at the time.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b347-7\"><em>2. </em>When the mail or post-office, was used as a means of conveying not tice to the indorsers, and it is in evidence that notice did not in fact reach them, the plaintiff must make it appear that the letters or notices were in a condition to pass to the indorsers in the ordinary course of the postal service \u2014 that is, that they were properly directed and stamped, or with the postage otherwise duly paid.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b347-8\">3. Evidence that the notary \"served\u201d the indorsers with notice \u201cby depositing said notices in the post-office, in the city of Atlanta,\u201d with no statement as to the direction, or as to the payment of postage, was not sufficient, where the indorsers testified that they did not receive notice ; more especially as Atlanta was not shown affirmatively to have been their place of residence, or the place where they usually got their letters.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-9\">Negotiable instruments.

The indorsers were served and a return of <em>non est inventus </em>made as to the makers. The evidence, as far as material, is stated in the opinion. The jury found for the plaintiff. The defendants moved for a new trial upon the following grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-11\">1st. Because the court erred in admitting in evidence the notarial certificate as to protest, etc., and especially that part thereof, as follows: <em>\u201c </em>and I further certify that on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>same day, to-wit: February 13, 1872, I served written notices of the demand and refusal of payment,and of protest for non-payment of the note, whereof a true copy is on the other side hereof written, on the drawer and indorsers, by depositing said notices in the post-office in the city of Atlanta.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-5\">2d.

In connection with this evidence, the certificate was admissible. 5 Martin (La.) N. S. 196 ; 2 Nott <em>&amp; </em>McCord, 331; 1 Gr\u2019l\u2019f\u2019s Ev. \u00a7437; 2 Phil. Ev. by Cowen &amp; Hill, 750, note 528; 6 <em>Ga., </em>365; Code, \u00a73866.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> But neither the certificate nor the testimony supplementing the same, disclosed how the notices were addressed; that is, to what post-office the enveloj)es or packages were directed ; nor did it appear that they were in a condition, with respect to stamps or prepayment of postage, to pass to the indorsers in the regular course of the postal service. There being positive affirmative evidence that the notices were not received, the want of evidence that the address was proper and that the postage was paid, was not to be supplied by mere implication. It was incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove these facts to the reasonable satisfaction of the jury. As to direction, see 20 Johns, 168 ; 1 Parsons on N. &amp; B., 496, 478, note v.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number><bracketnum>3.</bracketnum> The evidence was, that the notary <em>served </em>the indorsers with notice by depositing said notices in the post-office in the city of Atlanta. It did not appear that the indorsers resided in or near Atlanta, or that they usually got their letters there. Neither did it appear that the postage was paid, or that there was any address or direction on the package or packages. The evidence fell short; and the plaintiff should not have recovered against the indorsers, they testifying that the notices were not received. -</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Cited for the indorsers : Code, \u00a73829; Cobb\u2019s Dig., 273; 3 <em>Ga., </em>492, 493, 486; Code, \u00a71502; 2 Daniel Nego.
