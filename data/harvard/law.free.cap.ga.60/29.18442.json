The conveyance of March 6, 1873, from I. P. Garvin, trustee, to Harmon Rowley, being a security to pay an individual debt of Joseph M. Newby, and Harmon Rowley being cognizant of that fact, said conveyance is void as to Rowley, and passed no title to him, nor did ho, by it, acquire any right to the property described in the deed, namely: the land in controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-9\">Second. The conveyance being void as to Rowley, the trust estate of Mrs. Newby acquired no rights under the bond for titles from Rowley to Garvin, trustee, and that obligation is void as to Mrs. Newby and Rowley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-10\">Third. The judgment in favor of Rowley <em>vs. </em>J. M. Newby is null and void as to any liability on the trust estate of Mrs. Newby, and has no lien on the same, .either in law or equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-11\">Fourth. The title to Mrs. Pike to the laud is valid, she being an innocent purchaser, in good faith, for value, and without notice of the facts connected with the transaction between Mrs. Newby, J. M. Newby, and the trustee, Gar vin, and Harmon Rowley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-12\">Fifth. It appearing from the verdict of the jury that Newby received from Rowley $1,275.00, and, also, from the written consent of Mrs. Newby attached to the deed, that Mrs. Newby authorized the payment of the money to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>her husband, she ought to do equity. She claims that her act was one forbidden by law, to-wit: a securityship for her husband. The jury have found that to be true. Newby, then, her agent, receives money from Rowley without any consideration. That act is her act \u2014 good conscience requires her to payback this money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-5\">It is, therefore, adjudged and decreed that the whole contract was void, and that she (Mrs. Newby) must pay back the fruits of the void contract; also, that the complainant recover of Harmon Rowley the sum of $2,500.00, the value of the land, with $250.00 per annum for rent from the 12th day of January, 1875, allowing one week for the time Mrs. Newby was in possession of the building, less $1,275.00 paid Mr. \u00d1ewby by order of Mrs. Newby ; also, ordered that the costs up to the time when Rowley was made a party be paid by complainant \u2014 after that time to be paid by Rowley.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-6\">The plaintiff in error excepts to the decree, and alleges error therein as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-7\">1. That the chancellor decreed that complainant must pay back to Harmon Rowley $1,275.00 before getting from him the value of the land, with rent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-8\">2. That he decreed the title of Mrs. Pike to the land to be valid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-9\">3. Thathe decreed costs against complainant to the time Rowley was made a party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-10\">4. That he refused to decree the land to complainant, with rent from the time of the dispossession, to be paid by Hannon Rowley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-11\">Rowley joined in the bill of exceptions, because any sum was decreed against him, and because he was not allowed interest on the sum of $1,275.00.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-12\">H.

On this verdict the court granted a decree, and the only matter complained of is that decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The substance of the verdict is, that Rowley loaned Newby, the husband of Mary A. Newby, $1,500.00, to secure which N ewby and wife executed to him a mortgage of the wife\u2019s land; that no money was paid for the land as purchase money; the deed to the land of Mrs. Newby was to pay the individual debt of Newby; part of Rowley\u2019s debt on Newby was $15 or $25 taxes, and $166 premium on New-by\u2019s life for the benefit of Mrs. Newby; Mrs. Newby\u2019s purpose was to contract as security for her husband, and Rowley knew it; the land was worth $2,500.00, and the rent $250.00 per annum; Rowley knew that Newby acted as agent of his wife; Mrs. Newby acquiesced in the transaction, and permitted the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale of the land to go into possession, but she did so in ignorance of her rights under the law; Rowley represented to Mrs. Pike that the title was good, and this representation induced the purchase; Mrs. Pike paid Rowley $2,300 for the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">The facts disclosed by the record, as admitted in the pleadings, and found by the verdict of the jury, seem, with sufficient certainty, to be substantially these :</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">That Mrs. Pike was an innocent purchaser without notice; that the sale of the trustee was for the purpose of paying or securing a debt for the husband of Mrs. Newby; and that the sale to Rowley was by the trustee, and authorized by the deed, if Mrs. Newby consented thereto, which consent appeared on the face of the papers; that she bought from Rowley, paying him $2,300 for the land, taking his bid off his hands for value, he having paid but $1,500 for it; that the sheriff made her the deed, and she went into possession and inqn-oved the land, with the knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Mrs. Newby, who knew of the sheriff\u2019s sale also; that Rowley knew all about the purpose and object of the sale, having himself been the purchaser to pay his own debt owing by Newby, the husband, to him; that the value of the land was twenty-five hundred dollars; and that, of the entire proceeds thereof, but one hudred and sixty-six dollars, insu. ranee premium, and twenty-five dollars, taxes, was used for the benefit of Mrs. Newby, the entire balance being applied to Newby\u2019s debt to Rowley.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The statute, Code, \u00a71783, is in the following words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">\u201cThe wife is a <em>femme sole </em>as to her separate estate, unless controlled by the settlement. Every restriction upon her power in it must be complied with; but, while the wife may contract, she cannot bind her separate estate by any contract of suretyship, nor by any assumption of the debts of her husband, and any sale of her separate estate, made to a creditor of her husband in extinguishment of his debts, shall be absolutely void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Section 2329 of the Code is \u2018as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">\u201c The purchaser from a trustee, with notice actual or constructive of the trust, holds as trustee for the beneficiaries; if the purchase be <em>bona fide, </em>and without notice, the purchaser holds the property freed from the trust.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-9\">Section 2622 requires the purchaser to \u201c look for himself as to the title and soundness of all property sold under judicial process.\u201d ' '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-10\">Section 2628 declares, in substance, that the purchaser at judicial sales is not responsible for the disposition of the funds, or the returns or irregularities of the sale, but is only bound to see \u201cthat the officer has competent authority to sell, e nd that he is apparently proceeding to sell under the prescribed forms.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-11\">Section 2640 is to the effect, that \u201c though a title obtained by fraud be voidable in the vendee, it will be protected in a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser without notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-12\">Section 3092 declares that \u201c a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>value, and without notice of an equity, will not be interfered with by a court of equity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Section 2633 enacts that fraud <em>voids </em>a sale where consent is obtained by it; and section 2751 enacts that fraud <em>voids </em>all contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\u00a5e think that these sections of the Code all have a bearing upon the decree proper to be rendered in the case made by the admissions in the pleadings and the findings of the T7-</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The language of section 1783 is very strong. A sale of the wife\u2019s separate estate made to a creditor of the husband to extinguish his debt, is declared to be <em>absolutely void.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">As between Rowley, the creditor of the husband, and Mrs. Newby, the sale is clearly void; and if Rowley held the land, the deed to him would be set aside, and the land restored to Mrs. Newby, beyond all cavil or question. But it has passed out of his hands, and is in the possession of Mrs. Pike under a purchase for value from Rowley, without notice to her that the sale was to pay Newby\u2019s debts; and the question arises as between Mrs. Newby and Mrs. Pike, will a court of equity interfere to relieve Mrs. Newby when Mrs. Pike is an innocent purchaser? Section 3092 would seem to forbid such interference, for Mrs. Newby\u2019s title is an equitable one; the legal title was in the trustee; the trustee sold pursuant to the deed of trust by Mrs. New-by\u2019s assent thereto ; and if the sale, though not made to her directly by. the trustee, came to her from Rowley, who bought from him, and she believed that it was all right, she certainly ought to be protected, and equity ought not to disturb her possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">\"While the sheriff made the deed to Mrs. Pike, she cannot be said to be exactly a purchaser at a judicial sale; for, though she bought the bid of Rowley, she did not take it off his hands at the same price he gave, but paid very nearly the full value of the land \u2014 eight hundred dollars more than he gave for it. If she had been the actual purchaser at the sale, under section 2622, which requires such purchaser to look to the title of the property for himself, it is possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>that she would have acquired no title, as it was sold as Newby\u2019s property, the deed being made to him by Rowley under the bond for titles; but even then, if innocent, under section 2828, she need not have looked to see how the money she paid was applied. The officer had authority to sell, the thing looked fair, the title apparently passed out of the trustee of Mrs. Newby into Rowley, and from him to Newby, and seemed all regular.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">If she had bought directly from the trustee, as Rowley did, but without any knowledge or notice that the money which she paid was to go to pay the husband\u2019s debt, then she would have been protected by section 2329 of the Code, which enacts clearly that such a purchaser holds the property freed from the trust. While Rowley held it as trustee for Mrs. Newby, because he was not innocent, but was trying to pay a debt to himself of the husband, Mrs. Pike would have taken it free from the trust, for the reason that she was innocent, and had no notice of aught that was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Now, it cannot change her rights in equity that, instead of buying from Garvin, the trustee, directly, she bought from the man to whom he had sold, all appealing right on the papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">It is true that it seems singular, if not absurd, that a void title in one vendee can transmit to another anything valid; but. the Code is explicit in sections 2633 and 2751, that fraud <em>voids </em>\u2014 which, I suppose, means makes absolutely void \u2014 all contracts, and yet a title so acquired by fraud, and void on that account, when transmitted to an innocent purchaser, without notice and for value, is made good by section 2640. It is true that the language there used is the word \u201c voidable,\u201d which certainly makes a difference ; but then the other sections, 2633 and 2751, use the word \u201c voids,\u201d which assuredly must mean \u201c makes void ;\u201d and yet this fraudulently <em>void </em>title transmits a <em>valid </em>one to the <em>Toona fide </em>purchaser for value without notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">But, independently of all this, we think that as between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Mrs. Pike and Mrs. Newby, the principle of an equitable estoppel may be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Mrs. Newby gave her assent to the sale by her trustee of this property \u2014 she knew of the sheriff\u2019s sale of it as the property of her husband, conveyed to him by Rowley, to whom her trustee, by her consent, conveyed it under the terms of the deed of trust. She saw Mrs. Pike put in possession and making improvements, and yet she gave no warning. Under these facts, will not equity estop her from setting up her title against Mrs. Pike ? It strikes us that it should. The Code, section 3753, gives a succinct, summary of estoppels, and concludes thus : \u201c and other admissions, upon which other parties have acted, either to their own injury or the benefit of the persons making the admissions, and similar cases where it would be more unjust and productive of more evil to hear the truth than to forbear investigation.\u201d It seems to us that the acts of Mrs. Newby, and her omission to give notice of her title or equity, during all this time, constitute such a case, as applying the principle of the Oode to it, will prevent her from setting up her equitable estate <em>against an innocent purchaser. </em>It would be more unjust to let her tell the truth about her title, as respects an innocent purchaser, than to forbear the investigation and disturb that innocent purchaser. The facts make a case where Mrs. Pike\u2019s equity is superior to that of Mrs. Newby.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The doctrine of estoppel will apply to married women in such cases. Perry on Trusts, \u00a7170.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Our own Code, in respect to the <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for value, but re-enacts the principles of equity. Perry on Trusts, \u00a7218, <em>et seq.; </em>where it is said that such a purchaser holds the property free from the trust; and <em>\u201c that equity will not disarm a </em>purchaser, <em>but assist him \u2022 </em>and precedents of this nature are very ancient and numerous, viz : where the court hath refused to give any assistance against a purchaser, either to an heir, or to a widow, or to the fatherless, or to creditors, or even to one purchaser against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>another; \u201d but if he has the legal title, he may buy up any ncumbrance and defend himself at law, and equity will not harm him; and numerous eases are cited to sustain the main principle, that such a purchaser will not be disturbed by a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">So in the same book, \u00a7680, it is said, speaking of the contracts of married women, <em>\u201c </em>it will be remembered that the contracts themselves were <em>utterly void, </em>but that equity gave them effect as <em>quasi </em>charges upon their separate property.\u2019\u2019 Here we have equity giving effect to something \u201c <em>utterly </em>void,\u201d because the married woman ought not to be allowed to use the exemptions and privileges which the law gives her for her protection against fraud in others or the power of her husband over her, to defraud other people.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">So this court held, the other day, in the case of <em>Glover vs. Moore, </em>from Bartow, not yet reported, that her attorney could bind a married, woman by a confession of judgment on terms, because she had employed him, and that the judgment concluded her, because the other side had acted upon it by giving time and not litigating the case, as they might have done but for the <em>settlement; </em>and this on the same principle of estoppel. And her separate estate was-held subject to the judgment, though the allegation was that the debts were all her husband's.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">So the Code, \u00a7119, under the chapter of \u201c Accident and Mistake, enacts that \u201c Equity will grant relief as between the original parties, or their privies in law, in fact, or in estate, <em>exceptbona fide purchasers for value without noticefi </em>showing the favor that equity everywhere extends to an innocent man who honestly paid his money for property.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">We think, therefore, that the court was right in decreeing, upon the verdict, that Mrs. Pike was protected, and that equity would not interfere with her title and possession of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">2. But in respect to Rowley, it is clear that he stands in no such attitude, and so, too, the court held; but we think that the decree does not give effect in .full to the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>the whole trade is void as to him. For the decree allows him to retain $1,275.00 of the money which the land brought. We think that he is only entitled to a credit of $25.00, for taxes paid on this land, and $166.00, insurance for her benefit. Purchasing the land from her trustee, with full knowledge of her equities, and in utter violation of the law which prohibited the sale to him to pay the debt her husband owed him, lie got no title thereto, but became, and is, her trustee, and must account for the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Having purchased with full notice, he became her trustee. Perry on Trusts, \u00a7217; Code, \u00a72329; and aiding in misapplying her funds, he is responsible to her. Code, \u00a73151. We think, therefore, that the decree in favor of Mrs. Newby against him should be for the value of the land, as showed by the sale to Mrs. Pike, $2,300.00, with interest thereon from the 19th day of January, 1875, when Mrs. Newby was dispossessed thereof; and the decree will be modified accordingly. To give a credit to Rowley of $1,275.00, which Newby got, and with which he paid his debts, would be to do what the statute, we think, prohibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The judgment is reversed upon the ground that the chancellor erred in decreeing too little to Mrs. Newby against Rowley, and affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
