The reason rendered must appear m the record or bill of exceptions, otherwise no reversal can be had of a refusal of leave to reinstate unconditionally; the leave granted being conditional on the payment of accrued costs.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b422-9\">Practice in Superior Court.

If any reason was shown in the court below, it ought to have been set out in the record or the bill of ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>ceptions, so that the supreme court could determine whether the case should be reinstated or not. The permission to reinstate, on condition of paying costs, may have been more favorable to the plaintiff than he was entitled to, instead of less favorable. The supreme court not being informed, authoritatively, why he was absent, or why he was not properly represented, cannot hold that he was entitled to reinstate at all, much less that he was entitled to reinstate on better terms than the superior court prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
