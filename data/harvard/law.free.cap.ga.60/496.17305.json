In the latter class of cases, the supreme court will not control the discretion of the superior court, where it appears that if the plaintiff can recover at all, on a second trial, his recovery will be limited to mere nominal damages.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-10\">New trial.

G. Eiswald, Atlanta, Ga.; that had the cheek been presented by 10 o\u2019clock a. m., or soon thereafter, on the morning of the 25th, it would have been paid by the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-5\">No issuable plea having been filed the court, Judge Hop^ kins then presiding, rendered judgment for defendant.

The express company undertook to carry and deliver a check drawn upon a bank by a depositor in favor of his wife ; and delivery to the wife was not made, it is contended, as early as it ought to have been made. In the mean time the bank failed and the depositor\u2019s money was lost. The verdict was for the defendant, and the court refused to grant a new trial. Under the evidence, the presiding judge believed, no doubt, that the failure of the bank took place before a reasonable time for delivery had expired, and that the plaintiff\u2019s money was thus really lost while the express company was not in default; that the default of the latter, if any, by undue delay in making delivery, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>unattended with any actual damage to the plaintiff. The evidence would very well warrant such a conclusion; so that, admitting that the duty of the company was to deliver at the residence of the consignee, according to the street and number designated in the address of the package, (a question we need not decide,) the plaintiff probably had a cause of action for nothing beyond nominal damages. In actions of tort, or in some of them, because the mere branding of the defendant\u2019s act as a wrong may be of future consequence to the plaintiff in the matter of upholding the right involved, a new trial will be granted on the disallowance of nominal damages where such damages ought to have been found; but this strictness does not prevail in cases of contract, the same reason not applying.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">At all events, in this class of cases a reviewing court will not constrain the primary court to grant a new trial in order that mere nominal damages may be recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Cited in the argument: Red. on Railways, 32; Ang. on Carriers, \u00a7\u00a7287, <em>(n) </em>291, 295, <em>et seq : </em>Brown on Carriers, 195, 199, <em>et seq; </em>2 Kent\u2019s Com., 604; Ad. on Cont., 500, 501; 17 Wend., 305; 6 Bosw., 235; Code, \u00a72946; 4 Ga., 264; 18 Ib., 539, <em>et seq; </em>Code, \u00a7\u00a72066, 2062, 2060, 2080 ; 45 <em>Ga., </em>309; 46 <em>Ib., </em>307; Code, \u00a72070; 37 <em>Ga., </em>693; 46 <em>Ib., </em>433; 17 Wall., 357; 15 Minn., 270; 23 Am.
