Geffcken, therein being found, wrongfully, feloniously, and fraudulently, did take and carry away with intent to steal the same, etc. The jury acquitted Davis, but found Smith guilty. The court sentenced him to the penitentiary for eight years. It did not appear in the record of the ease that either the prisoner or his counsel was present when judgment was pronounced. Smith moved to set aside the sentence because it was unsigned, not sufficiently full, the punishment was excessive, and it was unauthorized by the verdict. Also, because the pleadings and record were so fatally defective that no valid judgment could be based thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-5\">The judge certifies that the sentence was pronounced and entered on the minutes on January 26, 1877, and the minutes duly signed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-6\">The motion was overruled, and defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b431-7\">A.

The court will do nothing in their absence that ought to be done in th\u00e9ir presence, and. will, from time to time, see for itself that they are present. But it is not usual to make any special entry.in the minutes,- or elsewhere, as a memorial of such pres\u00e9nce. The reason is, doubtless, that whenever any act or proceeding is recorded as taking place in a criminal case, the presence of the prisoner and his counsel, though not noted expressly, is included in each entry by a kind of implication; or so it is deemed, so long as the fact of presence is not negatived by the record, or by some appropriate evidence <em>aliimde. </em>Arraignment is required to be recorded (Code, \u00a7\u00a74636, 4638, 4640), but the ordinary form of entering it affords no evidence of the prisoner\u2019s presence, other than that which isimjffied in the fact of the arraignment. To arraign a prisoner in his absence is legally impossible. Therefore, if he was arraigned he must have been present. Sentence, also,is recorded, and the record bears the same kind of testimony to the prisoner\u2019s presence, at the time when.it was orally pronounced, as on the occasion, of arraignment. To sentence a prisoner (in felony,' at least,) during' his absence, is legally impossible; from which it, follows, that if he was- sentenced he must have been present. The presence of his counsel, unless dispensed with by consent, is equally within the implication, inasmuch as (except when so dispensed with) their presence is no less essential than his. 51 <em>Ga., </em>567. As may be seen by'the authorities cited by counsel <em>infra, </em>this Georgia practice would not suffice in England, nor generally in America. But in all judicial proceedings, this state has long used a concise method of recording- \u2014 sometimes, it may be, altogether too concise. Brevity, within certain limits, is a great merit; but extreme brevity, like most other extremes, is an imperfection, and the scrappy recording which is in vogue with us is attended, not infrequently, with grave inconvenience. Erom the language used in 11 <em>Ga., </em>253, in the head-note, or in thatyised in the opinion, it need not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>necessarily inferred that the prisoner\u2019s presence or that of his counsel was matter of record, in that case, on' the minutes of the superior court, or elsewhere in what is termed the record proper. Most probably it appeared to the supreme court from the bill of exceptions, and not otherwise. In a large and loose sense, the transcript and the bill of exceptions taken together are often called <em>\u201c </em>the record,\u201d after a case reaches the supreme court. The expression \u201c conceded on the record,\u201d as used in the opinion referred to,would scarcely be apropriate if the purpose had been to rest the argument on the contents of a direct entry appearing in the record proper. As the bill of exceptions was prepared and signed by counsel for the plaintiff in error, the statement therein of a fact favorable to the state (the defendant in error), might well be called a concession. The authority most in point on the question .before us is 53 <em>Ga., </em>137. It rules that absence at the rendition of the verdict is a fact extrinsic of the record, and may be proved on a motion to set aside the verdict; and that the judgment will not be arrested because presence does not affirmatively appear, in express terms, on the face of the record. The ground of the decision is, established practice believed to be uniform:</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\"><bracketnum>4.</bracketnum> Failure to name the offense in the body of the sentence, and to sign the sentence and date it, is not fatal. The case was fully stated at the top, or beginning of the sentence, and both the date and signature were supplied by entering the sentence on the minutes as of a particular day, and the regular signing of the minutes of that day by the judge. As the minutes now stand, they show that the judgment, or sentence, was pronounced by the court, when it was pronounced, against whom,-and for what offense. The record is complete, and sufficiently explicit.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Cited by counsel: (indictment) R. M. Charl., 1.51; 50 <em>Ga., </em>258 to 261; Code, \u00a7\u00a74413, 4414, 4628; 1 Bish.
