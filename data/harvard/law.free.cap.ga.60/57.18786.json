The court had before it the circumstances by which counsel were surrounded : the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>length of time that was to elapse before the adjournment, other engagements then pressing on the court and counsel, illness of counsel (which is alleged as one of the grounds), and all the circumstances entering into it. The court might properly take jurisdiction of the question of whether it made such an extraordinary case or not; and the adjudication of that motion, at that time, and under these circumstances, by the court, and the order granted, under these circumstances, became valid and binding; and the order remained of force until set -aside in some method known to the law; and the parties having acted on that order, permitting the adjournment to occur without further steps, and perfecting their motion in compliance with the order, we think it proper, in accordance with the principles, both of law and justice, to require that the movants should be heard on their motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
