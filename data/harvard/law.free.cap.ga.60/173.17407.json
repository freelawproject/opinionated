It is incumbent upon one relying upon the homestead to show that it was set apart before that act.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-7\">Homestead.

M., on said note, and judgment was obtained thereon, from which <em>thefi. fa. </em>now levied issued; that defendant has had all said land set apart to him as exempt under the 2049th section of the Code of Georgia.\u201d The court sustained the illegality, and awarded judgment against the plaintiff for costs, whereupon the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">It appears from the agreed statement of facts that the note upon which the judgment was obtained was given for the pm chase money of the land which was levied on in satisfaction thereof, but it does not appear whether the defendant\u2019s homestead exemption was set apart before or after the passage of the act of 27th February, 1874. If it was set apart after the passage of that act, it was subject to he levied on and sold for the purchase money due therefor, and as the defendant claimed that the land was exempt from levy and sale, it was incumbent on him to show affirmatively such a state of facts as would have exempted it under the law. Inasmuch as there is nothing in the record going to show that the homestead exemption of the land was set apart to the defendant before the passage of the act of 1874, the court erred in sustaining the defendant\u2019s affidavit of illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Let the judgment of the court below be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
