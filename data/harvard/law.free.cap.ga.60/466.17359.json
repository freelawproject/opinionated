Steadwell, for a certain island of about sixteen acres, called Big Myhall, lying in the waters of the Altainaha river, with the adjoining marshes and the appurtenances, including a count for mesne profits. The action was commenced October 23d, 1S72. The defendant, Steadwell, did not appear or plead. The defendant, Morris, pleaded as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AU1\">1st. The general issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-13\">2d. That he was a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, and being in the possession <em>bona fide </em>and under a claim of right, he, from time to time, put valuable improvements upon the land, of great value, to wit: of the value of $5,000 ; which value he proposed to set off against the plaintiff\u2019s claim for mesne profits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-14\">3d. An equitable plea, in which, alleging the same facts as in his second plea, he claimed compensation for the value of his improvements in the event of a recovery against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>The plaintiff introduced the following evidence :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-5\">1st. A deed from John M. McIntosh to Bradford T. Chapman, dated April 10th, 1855, conveying the land in dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-6\">2d. A deed from the same Chapman to the plaintiff, dated April 23d, 1860, conveying the land in dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-7\">3d. The parol testimony of \"William C. Tinker, who 'testified as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-8\">I am the person to whom the laud was conveyed by Chapman. I was in possession of it from that time until September, 1870, when I went away, leaving my family residing on the land. I returned in June, 1871, and found my family removed, and Steadwell in possession. I do not know how this came about. I understood that Steadwell and Morris were in possession as partners. There were on the island when I left a steam saw-mill and several houses. The yearly value of the land and houses, with the saw-mill, was about $1,500.00. (The defendant objected to the admission of any statements by the witness about the sawmill as irrelevant, the saw-mill not being involved in the controversy ; but the objection was overruled.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-9\">On cross-examination, the witness said :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-10\">The yearly value of the mill alone was $1,500.00. The dwelling-house was- worth, to live in, $50.00 per annum. Before I left, the saw-mill was sold under a mortgage <em>fi.fa. </em>in \"favor of Richard Cogdell.\" I was present at the commencement of the sale, and heard that it was bought by Richard Cogdell, junior ; but I never considered or recognized the sale as good, .and I remained in possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-11\">The plaintiff here closed, and the defendant offered in evidence the following documents :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-12\">1. An execution for state taxes for the year 1870 amounting to $12.52, issued by the tax collector for McIntosh county, dated September 30, 1870, against \"Wm. O. Tinker.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-13\">2. An execution for county taxes for the same year amounting to $23.85, of the same date, and issued by the same tax collector against \"Wm. C. Tinker.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-14\">(On each of these executions was an indorsement by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>sheriff of McIntosh county, dated September 30, 1870, stating that he had levied it on Myhall Island and mill as the property of Tinker.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-5\">3. \u00c1 deed dated November 1, 1870, from the same sheriff to one Wing, reciting that on October 1,1870, he had levied an execution for taxes against Tinker on Myhall Island, and on a steam saw-mill located on said island, and that after lawful advertisement, etc., he had sold the property levied on, on the sale-day in November, 1870, and that the same had been bought by Wing, and proceeding to convey the same in the usual fonn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-6\">(This deed did not recite that the sale was at the door of the court-house, or between the usual hours of sale; nor did it identify the tax execution under which it was sold further than as above stated.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-7\">4. A conveyance from Wing to the defendant, Morris, written on the back of the foregoing deed, of the property described in it, dated May 30, 1871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-8\">These papers being offered together, objection was made by the plaintiff to the executions and to the sheriff\u2019s deed to Wing. The court sustained the objection to the documents as evidence of title, but admitted all the papers offered for what they were worth as evidence, that Morris was a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-9\">The defendant offered a witness to prove that the sale mentioned in the sheriff\u2019s deed to Wing did in fact take place at the door of the court-house, and between the usual hour\u2019s of sale, but the court refused to admit the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-10\">The following witnesses were then sworn, and testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-11\">1. James S. Dunwody:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-12\">I know the land. It was worth by the year, without the saw-mill and machinery, and without the improvements and repairs put upon it by Morris, $10 per acre. Those improvements and repairs consisted of wharves, an enlarge<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>ment of the basin for timber, a dam for the basin, a wall, dwelling, office, etc. The increase in the value of the whole property resulting from these improvements is from $4,000 to $5,000. The yearly value of the whole, <em>with </em>the sawmill and machinery, is from $800 to $1,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-5\">On cross-examination he said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-6\">Eor a mill-site, it is not worth over $10 per acre, yearly. It is worth that for planting. 1 was employed there in 1872. A large part of the improvements, etc., have been put there since 1872 \u2014 such as the digging out of the basin and the present wharf. As to the others,, I do not know when they were put there, nor what any of them cost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-7\">Being re-examined, he said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-8\">The market value of the property in November, 1870, without the mill and machinery, was from $1,000 to $1,200. It is worth now, without the mill and machinery, $6,000. It is not worth more than $1,000 to $1,200 as a mill-site.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-9\">2. Richard L. Morris, the defendant:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-10\">I went into possession under my purchase from Wing the last of May or 1st of June, 1871. The value of the property then, not including the mill and machinery, but including all buildings, etc., was about $1,500. I have constructed a new wharf, enlarged the basin to double its former size and dug it out, repaired the dam of the basin, put up a slab-pit wall, and a new building for an office and storehouse with two chimneys. The market value of the property, thus improved, is $6,000 at this time. The land, without the mill, when I got it, had no yearly value. All the yearly value it has results from my improvements, except what the place had of itself for purposes not connected with those improvements, or as a mere site. Besides the improvements and repairs already mentioned, I put a new foundation under the mill-building, and repaired other buildings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-11\">On cross-examination, he said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-12\">I gave $2,500 for the land, mill and all. I have not lost, but rather made money by the mill. The wharf was worth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>nothing when I bought it; it was very much decayed, and could not be fully used, though I did use it as far as possible. It had to be repaired. But I have since rebuilt it anew. I cannot tell how much the improvements and repairs cost. They have not all been made since the commencement of this suit; some have, I do not remember precisely which. I commenced to repair and improve from the time I went into possession. The land without the wharf, is worth as a mill-site, to a man with a mill to put on it, from $300 to $400 yearly. The wharf is indispensable to the use of the mill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-5\">Defendant also offered in evidence the following documents, viz: A sheriff\u2019s deed to one Richard Cogdell, junior, dated in March, 1870, reciting the sale of a steam saw-mill, etc., located on Big Myhall Island, as the property of Tinker&gt; under a mortgage execution; and a conveyance of the said mill, etc., from Cogdell, junior, to Morris, dated May 30th, 1871. But the plaintiff objected to this evidence on the ground of irrelevancy, and the defendant withdrew it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-6\">The defendant here closed, and the plaintiff recalled Tinker in rebuttal, who said :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-7\">I ran the mill till September, 1870, when I went north to get money to continue it. The place was used as a mill-site when I left. There was a wharf there then. As a mill-site, with the houses but without machinery and mill, the place was worth $2,000. I don\u2019t know what improvements have been made by Morris. The basin has to be cleaned out every year, and the wharf repaired every year or two. The materials of a wharf will not last more than two years ; they have to be constantly repaired and renewed to be used. The basins have to be cleaned out two or three times a year to make them of use. This is indispensable to the use of the mill. Digging out basins and making and repairing wharves at this mill do not improve the property in any permanent way. Whoever uses the mill must repair and keep up the wharves, and keep the basins dug out for the use of the mill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>The court referred to the jury the following questions of fact, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-5\">1. What amount of mesne profits should be allowed to the plaintiff ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-6\">2. What amount of improvements was put upon the land' by the defendant, Morris, he being in possession <em>ion-/, fide </em>and under a claim of right?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-7\">In response to the first of these questions, the jury found-the sum of $3,791. To the second they said: \u201cNo im-. provements have been made except for the benefit of the. defendant.\u201d And the formal verdict found for plaintiff the land in dispute, and $3,791 as mesne profits. ;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-8\">The defendant moved for a new trial on the following grounds, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-9\">1. Because the court rejected as evidence of title the tax executions and entries thereon, the sheriff\u2019s deed to Wing,' and Wing\u2019s deed to Morris.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-10\">2. Because the court refused to admit the testimony of a witness, offered by the defendant to prove that the sale mentioned in the sheriff\u2019s deed to Wing took place at the courthouse door between the legal hours of sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-11\">3. Because the court charged the jury that in estimating the mesne profits, they ought to include the profits derived, from the mill and machinery, as well as those derived from the land <em>without </em>the mill and machinery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-12\">4. Because the court refused to charge the jury, as requested by the defendant, that a saw-mill, machinery, etc., are personal property, a.nd that those mentioned in this testimony are not involved in the suit, but only the land and \u201c things permanently attached to the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-13\">5. Because the verdict was without evidence to justify it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-14\">The court refused \u2019 the new trial upon each and every ground taken in the motion,' and the defendant excepted:</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b471-16\">Jackson, Lawton &amp; Basinger ; W. R. GIignilliat, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b471-17\">Rufus E. Lester, for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Bleckley, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b472-5\"><bracketnum>1.</bracketnum> The Code declares (section 888) that when the principal amount of a tax execution does not exceed fifty dollars, the levy * * must be made by a constable, and not otherwise.\u201d The act of February 25, 1876, (pamph. p. 30)? changes this provision, but the act is subsequent to the levy and sale now under consideration, and therefore cannot be invoked here. The sheriff was empowered to sell land after levy- and return by a constable, but could not make the levy himself unless the execution exceeded fifty dollars in amount. This was the law; and a levy made by the sheriff contrary to its express provisions, was nothing. A sale resting on such a levy has no validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> The sale being a nullity, the sheriff\u2019s deed was utterly void. It was irrelevant as color of title, for it was too young. Upon its face, it showed there could be no prescription under it, the legal prescriptive period being longer than the interval between the date of the deed and the commencement of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\"><bracketnum>3.</bracketnum> The mill-site and the mill thereon could have been rented or leased by one and the same contract, and the whole sum would have been collectible as rent. 39 Ga., 18, 19. Whatever would be rent as between landlord and tenant, is <em>mesne </em>profits as between the parties in ejectment.' Though the mill and the laud may have been separable without injury to either, still, while they were in fact together, and used, or capable of being used in the ordinary way, they were worth so much for rent. It is proper, and accords with usage, we think, to speak of the rent of a mill, the rent of a factory, etc., and in so doing, the use of the machinery, fixed or unfixed, is not thought of as excluded, but as included. The exact point made by counsel, however, is, that the declaration does not mention the mill, but describes the land only. There is plausibility in the objection, but not much positive force. With reference to rent or <em>mesne </em>profits, the whole is to be taken as realty, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>suit for the profits of the land, applies to the land in its actual condition. In an action by a landlord against his tenant for rent, there could, we think, be a recovery for the entire rent, under such a description of the premises as this declaration contains. This being so, the description seems to us sufficient. When a mill-site has a mill upon it, attached to the earth in the usual way, and a trespasser takes possession of the site and uses the mill as it stands, he cannot insist on a separate valuation of the site and the mill, in accounting for <em>mesne </em>profits. He is chargeable with the value of the premises for rent, as a whole, and a description of the land with sufficient certainty to identify the premises, will include all parts of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><bracketnum>4.</bracketnum> According to the evidence, the improvements which were urged as a set-off against <em>mesne </em>profits were, for the most part, temporary in their nature. They were perishable, and the jury could well believe that they had perished, or were likely to do so before the owner of the premises could reap any benefit from them. Though they cost a considerable sum, and for a time enhanced the value of the property, there was good reason for disallowing them as matter of set-off. Owing to the destructive influences to which they were exposed, they had to be renewed periodically.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
