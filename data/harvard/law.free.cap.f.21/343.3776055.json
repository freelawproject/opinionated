White against the steam-ship Algiers, for a collision, in which the steamship sank and destroyed the schooner and her cargo. The Providence Washington Insurance Company intervened for their interest, as insurers of the schooner\u2019s cargo. The collision occurred shortly before 1 a. at. on November 19, 1882, about 25 miles south-eastwardly from the capes of the Delaware. The wind was fresh from between N. and N. by E., with a high sea. The moon had set at half past 12, leaving the night somewhat cloudy, although many witnesses testified that the stars were visible, and several that, despite the clouds, it was possible to see a vessel, \u201clights and sails and all,\u201d a mile or a mile and a half away; all agreed that it was a good night for seeing lights. The schooner White wassailing N. W. by W., and making between three and four knots per hour, close-hauled, her booms being inboard almost upon a line fore and aft. She was a good sailer, and held this course steadily, keeping to within about five points of the wind up to the moment of collision. Her red and green lights were of good quality, and were trimmed and burning brightly. Her binnacle light (an ordinary lantern about seven mqhes in diameter) was carried in the binnacle box, on top of the cabin-roof, a position unusually high. The Algiers was heading N. N. E., making eight knots an hour. Her white light was seen off the port beam by the schooner\u2019s lookout about two hours before the collision, and her green light was visible in the same direction for at least half an hour. Neither the schooner nor her lights were seen by the crew of the steamer until at most 15 minutes before collision. At this time, as the steamer\u2019s lookout testified, he saw with Ms naked eye a white light about three points on the starboard bow; this he supposed to be the distant mast-head light of a steamer, whereas it was alleged by respondents to have boon, in reality, the binnacle light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>schooner, placed in an improperly prominent position. The officer* on deck examined this light with a glass for from three to five minutes, when the schooner\u2019s red light suddenly appeared almost dead ahead. The steamer\u2019s helm was at once ported, and as her advancing masthead light revealed the sails and spars of the schooner, the engines were reversed. At the same moment, the ship struck, head on, just abaft the schooner\u2019s fore-rigging, cutting into the schooner from 10 to 15 feet, and sinking her instantly. The mate of the schooner swore that, on seeing the steamer approaching, he grasped the binnacle lantern and swung it at the steamer for five or six minutes; those witnesses on the steamer who saw the lantern denied that it was swung long enough before the moment of collision to be of the least benefit. At no time did the schooner display to the approaching steamer a lighted torch.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b362-4\"><em>S. M. Thomas, H.

In this case the steamer\u2019s lookouts should have seen the schooner\u2019s red light long before they did; it was negligence in them not to have done so.

In this she disregarded the law, and was plainly in fault. She answers, however, that this fault did not contribute to the disaster, and has called a large number of witnesses who support the assertion. This testimony is deemed of little, if any, value. In view of the circumstances shown, the positive declaration that the display of this light would not have tended to avoid the collision, seems like a reckless venture. The direct tendency of its absence was to produce the disaster. The law has determined the presence of such a light to be essential to safety, under circumstances such as existed when this collision occurred. That the flaming torch is more likely to attract attention than the ordinary side-light, is very manifest. This greater likelihood of arresting attention led to its adoption. How, then, can it be said that this light would not have been seen, and the collision avoided, if it had been displayed? Granting that the respondent\u2019s lookout was careless, how can it be affirmed that the glare and flash of the torch would not have attracted the attention of even this careless lookout ? So much less frequently displayed than the ordinary light, and bearing the character of a danger signal, its presence could hardly have been overlooked. There are, of course, circumstances in which the failure to display it may be held unimportant; as where the side-lights were actually and plainly seen from the approaching steamer, and the situation and course of the vessel fully understood, in ample time to avoid collision. Here it is not suggested that these lights were seen. It is clear they were not. Whether they <em>should </em>have been, is a different question, and unimportant in this connection. The libelant was plainly in fault. She saw the steamer in abundant time to warn her, and yet did not. That the situation demanded it, seems too plain for discussion. The exhibition of the globe light, at the moment of collision, was of no value.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Was the respondent also in fault ? The only fault imputed is in having an insufficient lookout. It must be conceded that the libel-ant\u2019s side-lights were burning. Her witnesses fully establish this fact. I am asked to infer from it that the steamer\u2019s lookout was imperfect. If the case rested here, the inference would seem just, and might bo adopted. But the respondent\u2019s testimony is equally full and positive that the steamer\u2019s lookout was <em>vigilant, </em>and that the lights were not seen. Before this direct evidence the inference must give way. It must do so, unless, indeed, the respondent\u2019s witnesses are perjured. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>A suggestion of perjury, however, would be unwarranted. As reasonably might it be said that the libelant\u2019s lights were not burning because the respondent\u2019s witnesses did not see them. The lights were burning, and the respondent\u2019s lookout was vigilant and sufficient. No other conclusion is admissible. The latter fact is as satisfactorily proved as the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Why the lights were not seen need not be determined. The case, in this respect, is strikingly similar to that of <em>The Narragansett, </em>3 Fed. Rep. 253, and 11 Fed. Rep. 291; and what is there said on this subject is equally applicable here. A solution of the problem may, however, be found in the suggestion that the position of the vessels was not that ascribed to them by the libelant. A slight change would so place them that neither side-light could be seen from the steamer, and thus reconcile all the testimony. That such was their position, seems very probable, if not' entirely clear, from the facts that the side-light was not seen, and that a white light, corresponding with the libelant\u2019s binnacle light, (which was carried unusually high,) was seen. There is little testimony less satisfactory than that respecting the position of vessels preceding a collision. The reliance placed on the supposed direction of the blow received by the respondent, is not justified by anything in the case. She sank immediately after receiving it, barely affording time for the crew to escape. The officers\u2019 hasty glance at the wound was sufficient to see its fatal character, but not to form a judgment respecting the question under consideration, and it is quite certain this was not in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The libel must be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
