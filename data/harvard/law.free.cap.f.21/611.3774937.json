Motion for judgment on tlie pleadings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-12\">This action is brought by the plaintiff, a citizen of New York, to recover the possession of the undivided jj- of the E. <em>\u00bf </em>of the donation of Danford Balch, the same being claim 58, and parts of sections 28, 29, 32, and 33, in township 1N., of range 1 E. of the Wallamet meridian, and situate in the county of Multnomah and state of Oregon. The plaintiff alleges that ho is the owner in fee of an undivided five-eighths of the premises, and as such entitled to the possession thereof, and that from October 4, 1870, to December 31, 1883, \u201cthe plaintiff, his predecessors and grantors, were seized of the said premises so owned by him, and in the actual and adverse possession thereof.\u201d The action is brought against John Balch and Alexander Hamilton, citizens of Oregon, and the persons in the actual possession of the property at the time. The complaint alleges that they, or those under whom they claim, are the owners of one undivided eighth of the premises, and that on December 31, 1883, the said defendants, denying the right and title of the plaintiff to three of the said five eighths, entered into and took possession of the same, and ousted plaintiff from the said three-eighths, and are now in the actual possession of the same, denying the.rigbt and title of the plaintiff thereto, and unlawfully and wrongfully withhold the possession of the said undivided three-eighths of said land from the plaintiff.\u201d Wherefore, they pray \u201cjudgment against the defendants for the possession of said three of said undivided five eighths.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-13\">Tlie defendants Batch and Hamilton answered, alleging that they were in possession of the premises, in common with the plaintiff, as tenants of certain parties named Smith, Gilliland, Hamilton, Dickinson, and Walker, and on the same day said parties applied to the court to be made defendants in the action, in place of said tenants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>as provided in section 314 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which application was allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-4\">Afterwards, these parties answered the complaint severally, setting forth the undivided interest of each in the premises, which in the aggregate amounts to four-eighths of the same. They also deny that, the plaintiff is the owner of more than one-half of the premises, or that he is entitled to the exclusive possession of any part thereof, or that they ever ousted the plaintiff from three-eighths or any portion of the premises, or withheld the possession thereof from him; and allege that they and the plaintiff are tenants in common of the premises, and as such are in the possession thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-5\">Qn the argument of the motion counsel for the plaintiff contended that section 324 of the Code of Civil Procedure should be construed so as to allow a tenant in common to maintain an action against his co-tenant when the latter has simply denied the extent of his estate or interest in the premises owned in common; while the counsel for the defendants insisted that the section was only applicable to an action at law to recover possession of real property, which could only be maintained according to it when the right of the co-tenant plaintiff to the \u201cpossession\u201d of the premises was wholly denied by the defendant. The section reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-6\">\u201cIn an action for the recovery of dower before admeasurement, or by a tenant in common of real property against a co-tenant, the plaintiff shall show, in addition to the evidenc\u00e9of his right of possession, that the defendant either denied the plaintiff\u2019s right, or did some act amounting to such denial.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-7\">This section is derived from the Revised Statutes of New York, pt. 3, <em>c. </em>5, \u00a7 27, in which it is provided that in an action of ejectment between tenants in common, the plaintiff, \u201cin addition to all other evidence which he may be bound to give,\u201d shall prove \u201cthat the defendant actually ousted \u201d him, \u201cor did some other act amounting to a total denial of his right as such co-tenant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-8\">In the draught of the New York Code of Civil Procedure, reported December 31, 1849, the commissioners took this section and made it, in a modified form, section 890 of such draught, placing it in a title relating to \u201cactions to determine conflicting claims to real property,\u201d under which it was intended that both legal and equitable rights and claims to real property might be prosecuted and determined. The modification consisted in extending the section to actions \u201cfor the recovery of dower before admeasurement,\u201d and providing that the plaintiff who claims as a covenant must \u201cshow, in addition to the evidence of his right, that the defendant either denied the plaintiff\u2019s right or did some act amounting to such denial.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-9\">Subsequently, in 1862, the section was incorporated in the Oregon Code of Civil Procedure as section 324 thereof, and is a part of title 1 of chapter 4, relating exclusively to actions at law \u201cto recover the possession of real property,\u201d with the addition of the words \u201cof possession\u201d inserted after the words \u201cevidence of his right.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>The Code also provides (chapter 5, tit. 8, \u00a7 500) for the determination of \u201cadverse claims to real property\u201d by a suit in equity. The section reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-4\">\u201cAny peraon in possession, by himself or Ills tenant, o\u00a3 real property, may maintain a suit in equity against another who claims an estate or interest therein, adverse to him, ior the purpose o\u00a3 determining such claim, estate, or ini erest. \u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b631-5\"><em>George H.

It can only be filed subsequently upon leave of the court and a withdrawal of the answer. The motion, therefore, in the form in which it is presented, must be denied. But as, by the pleadings, it appears that tire plaintiff has presented bis case upon the theory that one co-tenant of real property, in possession, can maintain ejectment against another co-tenant, also in possession, if the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s interest is denied, it may not be improper to call the attention of counsel to matters which are essential to the maintenance of the action, and consequently to the allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">The action of ejectment is primarily for the possession of the property in controversy, the right to which may depend upon the ownership of the property, or a contract with the owner for the use of it,\u2014 a letting of it by him to the plaintiff. There must be in the plaintiff a present right of possession, which is withheld by the defendant. Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Now, each tenant in common has an equal right to the possession of the whole and of every part of the common property. If a tenant in common is in possession of any interest, no matter how small, he is, in law, in possession of the whole property. Therefore, no tenant in common, in possession, can maintain ejectment against a co-tenant also in possession. In such ease he already has all that a judgment in his favor could give him. To sustain such an action the co-tenant plaintiff must be entirely excluded from the possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">The statute (section 324 of the Code of Civil Procedure) does not change this rule of the common law; it only changes the proof of ouster, or rather makes a denial of the plaintiff\u2019s right of possession the equivalent of actual ouster, so as to authorize a recovery upon proof of such denial, when his right is otherwise established.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">In the case at bar the complaint alleges that the plaintiff is the owner of five undivided eighths of the premises described, and was in their actual and adverse possession for a period exceeding 13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>years,\u2014from October 4, 1870, to December 31, 1883,\u2014that on this last date the defendants entered upon three of these five eighths and excluded him from them, and withholds them from him; and that they are the owners of one undivided eighth. There is no allegation that the plaintiff has ever been dispossessed of the remaining two of the five undivided eighths. The necessary presumption, therefore, is that he is still in their possession. Being in possession as such' owner, he is in possession of the whole premises, under the law which governs the rights of tenants in common. So, as the complaint now stands, the plaintiff cannot upon its allegations recover in ejectment. The allegation of ownership of the five-eighths must be reduced to that of three-eighths; or the ouster\u2014that is, the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s right by the defendants\u2014must be alleged to extend to the whole five-eighths. If, therefore, the present action is to be continued, the complaint must be amended in this form. But if the fact be as stated, that the plaintiff\u2019s right to three of the five eighths is only denied, and he continues in possession as the owner of two-eighths, while the defendants are admitted to be the owners of one-eighth, the plaintiff\u2019s remedy to determine the validity of the defendants\u2019 right to the disputed three-eighths is in equity, under the statute, (Or. Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 500,) authorizing suits for the determination of estates claimed adversely to the owner. Being in\u2019 possession by his co-tenancy, the plaintiff can insist that the defendants disclose their alleged adverse interest, and call upon the court to pass upon its validity. In this way the interests and claims of the defendants, as against the plaintiff, can be fully determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">While the motion, as presented, is denied, the plaintiff can have leave to amend his complaint as suggested, the defendants having the right to answer anew, or he can withdraw the present action and institute a suit in equity. Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b632-5\">Deady, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6y\">I concur with the circuit justice, but wish to add that this motion is anomalous, and will not lie under any circumstances. It is made by the defendant, and is for \u201cjudgment on the pleadings,\u201d \u2014the pleadings being the complaint and answer. But, as a judgment on the pleadings cannot be given on the pleading of the party, moving for it, unless the truth of the allegations therein is admitted by the subsequent pleading or silence of the adverse party, this is really a motion by the defendant for a judgment on the complaint. Now, there can be no judgment for the defendant on the complaint except upon the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and that objection or question can only be made by demurrer. So that if the defendant had made this motion before answer, still it would not lie. But the motion is also singular in the nature of the judgment it asks\u2014\u201cthat the plaintiff\u2019s complaint be dismissed.\u201d A bill or suit in equity is said to be \u201cdismissed\u201d when finally disposed \u00f3f adversely to the plaintiff therein; and un&lt; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>less the decree of dismissal is declared to be \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d it is a bar to any further litigation of tho matter between the parties. But an action at law is disposed \u00f3f either by a judgment for the plaintiff, or in bar of its maintenance, or of nonsuit. By either the first or second one the cause of action is determined and the action brought to an end; but by the third the action only is ended or disposed of, and another may be brought upon the samo cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Tins judgment of nonsuit can only bo obtained on motion of the defendant, before trial, because of the failure of the, plaintiff to appear for trial, or by consent. Tho form of it is \u201cthat the plaintiff take nothing by his writ or action, and that the defendant go hence without day;\u201d and the effect of it, under the Code, is to dismiss tho action. See Code of Civil Procedure, <em>c. </em>2, tit. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">But a \u201cmotion\u201d to dismiss \u201ca complaint,\u201d whether at law. or in equity, will not lie under any circumstances; and it proceeds upon a total misconception of the nature of legal procedure, both under the Code and at common law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
