The court will, however, control the report as the verdict of a jury would be. <em>Excelsior Carpet Lining Co. </em>v. <em>Potts, </em>7 <em>Vroom </em>301.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Rule one hundred and seven of the Supreme Court directs that unless the parties shall state whether the award shall have the effect of a finding or a verdict, and in the absence of such statement, the award shall be treated as a verdict. But there is no provision in this rule, or elsewhere, that will bring the case of a reference by consent of parties within sections one hundred and seventy-seven and one hundred and seventy-nine of the practice act.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The motion must be made to set aside the report or award as a verdict, for proper cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The motion for trial of exceptions' by a jury is refused, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
