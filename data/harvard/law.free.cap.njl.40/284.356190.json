On December 20th, 1877, the plaintiff entered judgment in this cause and issued execution, which the defendants now move to set aside. They are entitled to their motion. The eighty eighth section of the same statute <em>(Rev., p. </em>772,) explicitly forbade the issuing of the writ. The plaintiff insists that because the defendants received their letters of administration on February 19th, 1873, and on that day took the ordinary nine months\u2019 rule to bar creditors, these revised statutes are not, applicable, not being retroactive; and the ease of <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Volk, Executrix, </em>9 <em>Vroom </em>204, settles the point that they are entitled to execution, because insolvency proceedings were not instituted within ten months after the date last named. Even conceding that the question is not to be determin\u00e9d by the revised statutes, the defendants\u2019 right appears to be the same, for the sections already cited are substantial copies of the third and twelfth sections of the insolvent estates act, <em>(Nix. Dig. </em>419); and the case of Taylor <em>v. </em>Volk, Executrix, does not touch the matter in controversy. The decision there simply was, that the right to execution was suspended for ten months after the making of the usual nine months\u2019 order to limit creditors; and if within those ten months the insolvency proceedings were prosecuted, such suspension continued. But if they are not then begun, they may be subsequently commenced under the laws now invoked, and upon judgments entered during their pendency, no execution can issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Let the execution be set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
