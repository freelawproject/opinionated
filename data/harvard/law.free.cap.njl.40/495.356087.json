A single good count in an indictment is sufficient, on error brought, to support the judgment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b525-9\">2. Descriptive inconsistencies in the several counts of an indictment, with respect to the place of the death of the victim of a murder, or of the instruments used, do not show that several felonies are embraced in such indictmentin legal intendment but a single offence is described.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b525-10\">3. When declarations of a third party are the natural and inartificial concomitants of an act done by him, and are explanatory of such act, and such act is a part of the <em>res gestee, </em>such declarations are not hearsay, and are admissible.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b525-11\">4. A., the man afterwards murdered, made statements to his son, and wrote a note to his wife, a few hours before leaving home on the night of the murder, to the effect that he was going to the city of 0. on business, and that the prisoner was going with <em>him\u2014held, </em>such statements, both oral and written, were admissible as explanations and preparations of the act of going from home.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b525-12\">5. The admission of illegal testimony will not avoid a judgment on error, if it plainly appears that such testimony could not have injuriously affected the defendant on the merits of the case.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>6. When a mortal blow is given within the jurisdiction of this state, and the death of the victim occurs within the jurisdiction of another state, the courts of this state have cognizance of the crime by force of the seventy-eighth section of the act relating to criminal procedure.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-4\">This cause came before this court by writ of error, to remove to this court the judgment of the Court of Oyer and Terminer of the county of Camden.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-5\">At the May Term, 1878, of said court, Benjamin Hunter was indicted and tried for the murder of John M. Armstrong. The jury rendered a verdict of murder in the first degree, and judgment was entered upon the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-6\">On the trial, a number of exceptions were taken to the evidence and to the charge of the court, the substance of which sufficiently appears in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b526-7\">For the plaintiff in error, <em>George M. Robeson.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-8\">I. The first count of the indictment contains no averment of the place at which, or jurisdiction within which Armstrong died, except by inference from the place where the blow is alleged to have been given, as this is the only averment of place in the count, and this is an averment of his death in New Jersey.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-9\">II. The sixth count of the indictment contains no averment of death at all. If the averment of the time and place of death is contained in the general averment of the murder made in the count, then it is an averment of the death of Armstrong in the State of New Jersey.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-10\">III. These two counts, then, aver the death of one John M. Armstrong, who died in the State of New Jersey, but the remaining four counts of the indictment each aver the death of one John M. Armstrong, who died in the State of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-11\">This is not a different form of averment of the same crime, but the two classes of counts directly and positively aver two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>different things, which are impossible to be in the satne, namely, the first and' sixth, the death \u25a0 of a John M. Armstrong, who died in the State of New Jersey; and the remaining four counts, the death of a John M. Armstrong who must have been a different person, since he died in -the State of Pennsylvania. There is no word used in any of the counts to show that the same Armstrong is meant in each, but the counts are kept specially distinct, by designation in each, as one John M. Armstrong.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-5\">This shows an indictment containing two distinct charges of felony and murder done by the prisoner on two different persons; one set out and charged in the first and sixth counts, and the other in the remaining four counts of the indictment. This makes the indictment multifarious, incongruous, and bad.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-6\">IV. The prisoner was injured: because, if he was presented and put on trial for two murders, he was entitled at least to double the number of challenges..</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-7\">It matters not that the state proved but one charge; if the prisoner was by it put on trial for two, he was entitled to all his rights under <em>both, </em>as his trial progressed; and to be deprived of any one of them iras to be injured.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-8\"><em>Whart. on Cr. Law </em>416; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Vandercomb, </em>2 <em>Leach C.

The judgment in this case ought to be reversed, because John M. Armstrong, who is alleged to have been murdered by the prisoner, died out of the State of New Jersey, and in the State of Pennsylvania, and within the separate territory and exclusive jurisdiction of the said State of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-10\">Thus the death and the <em>crime of murder </em>took place out of the jurisdiction of the State of New Jersey, and within another acknowledged and exclusive jurisdiction, and so beyond the judicial knowledge and cognizance of the Court of Oyer and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Terminer of the county of Camden, to which the indictment was presented, and where the judgment was rendered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-4\">. Under these circumstances the death could not, at common law, be inquired of by the grand jury of the county of Camden, nor the prisoner be tried for the crime of which it was an essential part, by the courts of said county.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-5\">1. Murder is defined to be the killing, with malice aforethought, by a person of discreet age and sound mind, of a human being under the peace of the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-6\">Murder is a complex term, denoting several facts, of which the death of the party is the most essential.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-7\"><em>a. </em>It consists of felonious violence against a living being\u2014 which amounts to a different crime, until it is changed to. murder by the death of the victim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b528-8\"><em>b. </em>The death of the victim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-9\">The death is an essential element of the crime of murder, without which it cannot exist.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-10\">2 <em>Co. Inst. </em>318; 1 <em>Hale P. C. </em>426; <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>Morris, Hob. </em>183; <em>United States </em>v. <em>McGill, </em>4 <em>Dall. </em>429; <em>S. C., </em>1 <em>Wash. C.

It was generally held that it could-not be tried in <em>either </em>jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-12\">It was not triable where the different constituent parts happened in different counties, for the grand inquest of neither could inquire of the whole.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-13\">1 <em>Chitty Cr. L. </em>178; 2 <em>Id. </em>733; 1 <em>Hale P. C. </em>651; 1 <em>East Cr. L. </em>361.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-14\">Nor where the different parts happened within the jurisdiction of different courts, so that neither has cognizance of the whole.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number><em>Bulwer\u2019s case, </em>7 <em>Rep. 2; Constable\u2019s case, 2 Rep. </em>93; 1 <em>East Cr. L. </em>366; 1 <em>Hale P. C. </em>426; 1 <em>Chitty Cr. L. </em>180.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-5\">The death, then, is the very part of the occurrence without which the crime of murder does not happen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-6\">It may be said that the criminal act of the murderer is complete without the death\u2014that his part is done, and the \u2022crime, for him, complete; but such is not the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-7\">The question is not one of moral guilt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-8\">When the essential parts of the crime of murder happened in different jurisdictions, there was no means of trying it, without the interference of legislative power, efficient for the purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-9\">2. This was, in England, in several instances, found to be the ease, and created great difficulty and inconvenience. Yet, the general jurisdiction of the English government, as claimed and asserted, covered, in each instance, by reason of jurisdiction of the places or the parties, the whole subject matter of the crime.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-10\"><em>a. </em>Thus, in the case of different counties or courts, each having jurisdiction of some part, of the crime, the sovereignty of the British Empire covered all, and it needed only an expression of the legislative will to determine which county or court should have exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-11\"><em>b. </em>And the sovereignty was held to extend to all the provinces and dependencies, on the seas, and wherever, on account of the nature of the place or the crime, the offence would be held to be against the peace and sovereignty of all civilized nations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-12\">c. It was sometimes extended, by reason of her claimed continuous sovereignty, over any one once her subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-13\"><em>d. </em>And the difficulties and inconveniences arising out of the internal division of her several localities, or the divided jurisdiction of her several courts, were met and disposed of as they arose, by various acts of parliament, passed for the purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-14\">2 <em>Geo.

But these acts did not attempt to arrogate to the sovereignty of the empire any new jurisdiction not before claimed, nor to create or define any new offence, but merely fixed the-place of trial, or the court which should have cognizance of the offence, which already existed against English law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-4\">Whenever the original common law definition did not cover the crime, and bring it within the claimed general jurisdiction of English law, as when committed in another jurisdiction, by a person not a subject of England, then the words of the statute, however broad, were not held to apply.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-5\"><em>Rex </em>v. <em>Helsham, 4 C. &amp; P. </em>394; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Mattos, </em>7 <em>C. &amp; P. </em>458; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Depardo, </em>1 <em>Taunt. </em>26; <em>Reg. </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>7 <em>Cox C. C. 278 ; Reg. </em>v. <em>Keyn, L. R., </em>2 <em>Ex. Div. </em>63; 1 <em>Russ on Cr. </em>553.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-6\">No state\u2014not even the British Empire, with her claim of' almost universal jurisdiction over the world of waters and the dim and distant lands that lay beyond\u2014ever assumed to punish an offence which she did not claim to be against her own peace and sovereignty, or, what was the same thing, against the peace of the human race.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajq\">And the quality or character \u201cagainst the peace of the human race \u201d obtained only where the place was without any organized affirmative, exclusive jurisdiction, but was common to all nations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-8\">It follows that, if the whole crime is to be punished by any government, the whole must be against the peace and sovereignty of the government punishing it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-9\">And this may be done when the dissevered, parts come together under one general sovereignty, which has power to bring them, as a whole, within one particular jurisdiction, <em>and has exereised that power.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-10\">But they must all be within the <em>actual </em>or <em>constructive </em>jurisdiction of a state, to give that state power to provide for the punishment of the complete crime.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-11\">Our statute of 1797 <em>(Rev., p. </em>282,) by Judge Paterson, was passed to reach the same point as the English statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>4. If any essential part of the complete crime happen within another exclusive jurisdiction, the state cannot have, at \u2022common law, or take, by force of its own statutes, jurisdiction of the complete crime. Nor can its courts have judicial .knowledge of the part happening within another exclusive Jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-5\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>3 <em>Dutcher </em>499; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wyckoff, </em>2 <em>Vroom </em>65; <em>State </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>1 <em>Taylor </em>65; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>2 <em>Johns. </em>477; <em>State </em>v. <em>LeBlanch, </em>2 <em>Vroom </em>82.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhU\">In construing our statute, we may fairly presume that the legislature only meant to go to the limit of its power.

The language, then, of the New Jersey statute, <em>(Rev., p. </em>282, \u00a7 78,) however broad, cannot be construed to include a crime done in any exclusive foreign jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>\u2022 The jurisdiction of our state is co-extensive with our territory, and the power of our laws extends no farther.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-4\">\u201c Criminal laws are in their nature local, and confined in their operation within the limits of the state within which they are enacted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>LeBlanch, </em>2 <em>Vr. </em>87.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-5\">Jurisdiction is the power of exclusive legislation. <em>Marshall, Ch. </em>J., <em>U.

There may have been no such thing as felony, in our sense of the term, known to the law of that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-7\">Again, the person giving the blow may be punishable in the jurisdiction where it was given\u2014is he to be punished here also; and can he have the ordinary pleas of former acquittal, or punishment, or of pardon ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-8\">Again, the punishment of the blow in the jurisdiction may be different where it happened\u2014shall its nature and its penalty change by the act of the party ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-9\">The act speaks of <em>such-murder. </em>If the blow was in a foreign jurisdiction, who shall say it was murder\u2014what law, which code, which jurisdiction shall determine ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-10\">Again, the act speaks of the offence of <em>such accessory. </em>If his crime was committed within another jurisdiction, who shall say what his offence was, and who fix his punishment ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-11\">These difficulties arise, of course, only where the action was out of the jurisdiction; but the construction of the statute, the language and the law is the same in effect for both branches.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-12\">There can be no distinction between the alternative things presented by this statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-13\">They are \u00a1presented in the same language, in the same clause of the same statute.

Am. Cr. L., </em>\u00a7 424,) \u201cwill insert, as many counts as will be necessary to provide for every possible contingency in the evidence, and this the law permits.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-6\">An indictment may contain two or more counts alleging distinct offences if they are of the same general description, and the mode of trial and the nature of the punishment is the same.

Am. Cr. L., </em>\u00a7 423,) \u201csuch elections in felonies will not be required to be made where several counts are introduced solely for the purpose of meeting the evidence as it may transpire, the charges being substantially for the same offence. <em>Kane </em>v. <em>People, </em>8 <em>Wend. </em>203; <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Hills, </em>10 <em>Cush. </em>530; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>28 <em>Cal. </em>214; <em>Donnelly </em>v. <em>State, </em>2 <em>Dutcher </em>463, 601; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gummer, </em>22 <em>Wis. </em>441; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>State, </em>25 <em>Wis. </em>384; <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>34 <em>Conn. </em>298 ; <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>People, </em>70 N. <em>Y. </em>38.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-8\">For in such case the joinder of counts, cannot prejudice the defendant, which is the only ground on which this application to the discretion of the court can be founded to make the prosecutor elect. And whether a court will compel a prosecuting officer to elect which count to proceed on, rests in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>discretion of the court, and cannot be assigned for error. 1 <em>Whart.

In <em>Stone </em>v. <em>State, Spenc. </em>404, it was held, (as in my proposition,) if one count in an indictment be good, it will be sufficient to sustain a general verdict of guilty, although all the other counts are defective, and Mr. Justice Carpenter, in delivering the opinion of the court, says: \u201cI have been unable to find any case, or even <em>dictum, </em>in which this well-settled principle has been denied, or even doubted.\u201d See, also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayberry, </em>48 <em>Maine </em>238; <em>State </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>38 <em>Maine </em>574; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hadlock, </em>1 <em>Maine </em>282; <em>State v.

The rule in construing a state constitution is, that the legislature possesses plenary powers unrestricted, except by the instrument itself, and that the presumption is in favor of the validity of a peculiar statute, until it plainly appears from the constitution itself, that the legislature had no power to pass it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McWilliams, </em>11 <em>Penn. St. </em>61; <em>People </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>3 <em>Mich. </em>348, 349, 359, per Green, J.; <em>Id. </em>404, 405, per Martin, J.; <em>People </em>v. <em>Draper, </em>15 <em>N.

And a careful analysis of this statute will demonstrate, I submit, that an indictment properly framed upon it cannot be legally and successfully assailed, nor a conviction had under it 'in due form of law, be properly set aside.</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-8\">It was long doubtful, where the mortal stroke and death were in different counties\u2014and, by parity of reasoning, in differ-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>ant countries\u2014whether the offender could be indicted at all, of murder, for the reason that the offence was not complete in either. <em>Hale P.

This statute begins with declaring: \u201cFor as much as the most necessary office and duty of law is to preserve and save the life of man, and condignly to punish such persons that unlawfully, and wilfully murder, slay, or destroy men.\u201d And, after reciting that where the stroke and death are in different counties: \u201c In such case, it hath not been found by the laws or customs of this realm, that any such indictment thereof can be taken in either of the said two counties.\u201d ' It then enacts the said statute: \u201c For redress and punishment of which offences and safeguard of man\u2019s life,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-10\">Again, in 1729, the parliament of Great Britain passed the statute of 2 <em>Geo. II., ch. </em>21\u2014cited in 1 <em>East P. C., ch. </em>5, \u00a7 131\u2014declared to be \u201cfor preventing any failure of justice, and taking away all doubts touching the trial of murders in the cases hereinafter mentioned.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-11\">Upon these two English statutes, enacted as aforesaid, \u201c for redress and punishment,\u201d \u201csafeguard of man\u2019s life,\u201d and for \u201c taking away all doubts touching the trial of murders,\u201d the act of March 7th, 1797, which constitutes sections seventy-six, seventy-seven, and seventy-eight of our criminal procedure act, is founded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-12\">This act of March 7th, 1797, is entitled \u201cAn act concerning the trial of murder in cases where the stroke and death happen in differeiit counties, and in cases where either the stroke or death only happens within this state,\u201d and may be found in the pamphlet laws of the twenty-first general assembly of the State of New Jersey, page 207, and in <em>Pat.

Ero., </em>\u00a7 78\u2014has remained, <em>verbatim et literatim, </em>unchanged upon our statute book; and if the construction to be put upon it is to be made consonant with the well settled rules of law, rather than the unauthorized <em>diota </em>of counsel, its meaning is clear beyond all possibility of mistake.</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-6\">I. Look, for example, at the words. Could language be more clear, more plain? \u201cWhere any person shall he feloniously stricken or poisoned, within the jurisdiction of this state\u201d\u2014the limits of the state having been authoritatively ascertained, \u201cwithin the jurisdiction\u201d of it is sufficiently comprehensive\u2014\u201cand shall die of such stroke or poisoning, upon the sea, or\u201d\u2014mark the words, not generally \u201cout of the jurisdiction of this state,\u201d but\u2014\u201c at any place out of the jurisdiction of this state, in either of the said cases, an indictment thereof, found by jurors of the county within the jurisdiction of this state, in which such death-stroke or poisoning shall happen, respectively as aforesaid,\u201d &amp;c., \u201cshall be as good,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-7\">II. Look at the context. While the subject matter of the first and second sections of this act of March 7th, 1797\u2014 <em>Crim. Pro., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 76, 77\u2014was, in fact, a part of the common law of the State of New Jersey at the time of the passage of the act, the subject matter of the third <em>section\u2014Grim. Pro., </em>\u00a7 78\u2014was not then a part of our common law, because the statute of 2 <em>Geo. II, ch. </em>21, was restricted, in its operation, to \u201c that part of Great Britain called England.\u201d How significant, then, in its interpretation, is the connection of this third section with the first and second, all, together, constituting one legislative act,, the first and second sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>providing for the punishment of principal and accessory to murder, where the death and stroke were in different counties within the state, and the third section providing, in like manner, where the death or stroke was on the high seas, or at any place outside of the jurisdiction of the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-5\">III. Again, if it is to be interpreted by its subject matter, this is easily discernible. Only turn to the original act of March 7th, 1797, in the pamphlet laws above cited. Its title (and titles to acts in those days were honest and comprehensive,) describes it <em>(inter alia) </em>as \u201cAn act concerning the trial of murder\u201d \u201cin cases where either the stroke or death only happens with this state.\u201d And the mai\u2019ginal syllabus of section three, contemporaneous with the adoption of the act, reads: \u201c Indictment may be found where the death, stroke, or poisoning shall happen.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-6\">And other foreign jurisdictions have statutes in substance similar to our own statute in question; and in the absence of any authoritative interpretation by our own courts, their construction becomes important.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-7\">I have already referred to the kingdom of Great Britain. Ever since the enactment of 2 <em>Geo. II, ch. </em>21, a similar statute has been upon the English statute book ; such statute having been re-enacted in 9 <em>Geo. IV., ah. </em>31, \u00a7 8, and in 24 <em>and </em>25 <em>Vict, ch. </em>100, \u00a7 10. Never in all that time has the legality or constitutionality of this statute been seriously questioned, and in all the cases which I have been able to find and examine, a similar interpretation has been placed upon the law to that now claimed by this state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-8\">In <em>Reg. </em>v. <em>Azzopardi, </em>1 <em>C. &amp; K. </em>203, it was held that a British subject who commits a murder in a foreign country upon a person who was not a British subject, is triable in England.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-9\">In <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Helsham, </em>4 <em>C. &amp; P. </em>394, the prisoner was indicted and tried in England for killing Lieutenant Growther, at Boulogne.</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-10\">Indeed, the English cases, while they differ in a measure as to the application of this law to foreigners not British subjects^ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>all concur in this, that the law thus construed is necessary to prevent a defeat of justice, which without it might have arisen from the difficulty of trial in cases of homicide when the death occurs in a different place from that at which the blow causing it was given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-4\">See the opinion of Mr. Justice Willis in <em>Reg. </em>v. <em>Lewis, Cox C.

I have been able to find but one case in the United States in which a different doctrine was enunciated to our own at bar. That was the case of Com. v. <em>Linton, 2 Va. Cas. </em>205, in which it was held that if a person be stabbed in Virginia and die of his wounds in another state, he could not be tried for the murder in any county in Virginia, which was perfectly good law at the time the decision was rendered, there being then no special statutory provision for such cases. Since then, however, Virginia has adopted the statute to which I have previously referred, and Com. <em>v. </em>Linton has ceased to be good law, even in that state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-7\">In the case of <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Macloon et al., </em>101 <em>Mass. </em>1, this question was thoroughly discussed. The direct point of inquiry was, whether under the general statute <em>(ch. </em>171, \u00a7 19,) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Massachusetts, providing for the punishment of causing death within the state by means of a mortal wound given, or other violence or injury inflicted without the state, a conviction might be had- for causing death by exposure or starvation. The question of jurisdiction was raised, and Justice Gray, in an elaborate and exhaustive opinion, decided that the state had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Agg\">In <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Parker, 2 Pick. </em>549, the question was whether, when the cause of death happens in one county, and the death in another, an indictment thereof might be found in the latter and not be repugnant to the declaration in the constitution, that in criminal prosecutions the verification of facts in the vicinity where they happen, is one of the greatest securities of the life, &amp;c., of the citizen. Chief Justice Parker devotes the larger portion- of his opinion to the consideration of the power of the legislature to enact this and similar laws, and concludes that \u201c surely an act of the legislature which removes all doubt as to the place of trial, by designating the county in which the death happened, is in no respect a violation of the spirit, or even the letter, of the constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-6\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Pauley, 12 Wis. </em>537, was a case in which the blow was struck in one county and the death occurred in another; the question of jurisdiction was raised, and the right of the legislature to enact the statute involved, and similar statutes, was discussed and conceded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-7\">So, also, a similar question was considered, and the same result arrived at, in <em>Riley </em>v. <em>State, </em>9 <em>Humph. </em>646.</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-8\"><em>Tyler </em>v. <em>The People, </em>8 <em>Mich. </em>321, was a case in which the blow was struck upon a river of the then province of Canada, and the death occurred in a county of the State of Michigan. It was held by the majority of the court that Michigan, under the statute, had jurisdiction of this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-9\">In the case of <em>Steerman </em>v. <em>State, </em>10 <em>Mo. </em>503, which was a trial of larceny in the State of Missouri, under a special statute, committed on a vessel in the course of a voyage, Justice McBride says, in delivering the opinion of the court, \u201cWhere a mortal wound shall have been inflicted in one county, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>d'eath ensues in \u00bfmother, the indictment, trial, etc., may be had in either county; and where the wound is inflicted in another state, and death takes place in this state, the indictment-may be found in the county where the death happened.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-4\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>3 <em>Dutcher </em>499, is referred to, and relied upon, by the plaintiff as being in contravention of the interpretation of the law by the court below. This was an indictment charging a felonious assault and battery in New York, and that the party injured came into and died from its-effects in New Jersey, which was held to charge no crime against this state. But neither the principle involved in that case, nor the <em>obiter dieta </em>of the learned justice, appertain to,, or fit, this case. \u201c If the acts charged in that indictment,\u201d Jastiee \"Vredenburgh says, \u201cbe criminal in New Jersey, it must be either by force of some statute, or upon general principles. There is no statute, unless it be the act to be found in <em>Nix. Dig., ch. </em>3,\u201d (which is section seventy-eight of our criminal procedure and the act now in question;) \u201c but this evidently relates to murder only, and not to manslaughter.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-5\">I submit, then, that in the absence of any reliable case, either in this country or Great Britain, antagonistic to the view adopted and expressed by the court below, and in the presence, to the contrary, of the cases in Great Britain and our several states, above cited, this court will not undertake to say that this law in question, which we find upon the statute book of one of our oldest states (Massachusetts), as well as of one of our youngest (Colorado)\u2014a law which Great Britain has had, with a slight interruption, for nearly two centuries, and some of our states for well nigh a century\u2014which fourteen at least of our states have thought it necessary to adopt, and which four of them, through their highest judicial tribunals, have directly or indirectly endorsed and sustained\u2014I say, in view of all this, I submit that this court will not pronounce this law inoperative, but will, in like manner with other of our states, endorse and sustain the interpretation of the court below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-6\">Every consideration of public policy should induce your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>arrival at such a conclusion.

II, </em>with immaterial alterations, our statute substituting the expression \u201c out of the j urisdiction of the state \u201d for the words \u201c out of that part of Great Britain called England.\u201d It did not refer to crimes against the law of other nations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"212\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-9\">In Rex <em>v. </em>Anderson it was ruled by all the judges that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>felon could not be indicted in Cumberland, in which county he was taken with goods, where the original taking was in Scotland, otherwise between the counties of England. At the time of this decision, Scotland, though a part of the British dominions, was a distinct kingdom, so far as concerned her criminal law. <em>State </em>v. <em>LeBlanch, </em>2 <em>Vroom </em>85.</p>\n<p data-order=\"213\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-5\">So when this question arose in our own state, in the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>3 <em>Dutcher </em>499, it was held that an indictment charging a felonious assault and battery in New York, and that the party injured came into and died from its effects in New Jersey, charges no crime against this state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"214\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-6\">That any statute making criminal acts done wholly in another sovereignty was necessarily void. But Judge Vredenburgh, in the opinion of the court, sustains the converse of the proposition, approving the statute so far as it is applicable to our form of government, so far as it applies to the criminal procedure of New Jersey. He says: \u201c It is said that i-f we do not take jurisdiction, the defendant will go unpunished, inasmuch as the party injured not dying in New York, he could not be guilty of murder there. But New York may provide by law for such cases; and, if she does not, it is their-fault, and not ours. The act done is against her sovereignty, and if she does not choose to avenge it, it is not for us to step in and do it for them.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"215\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-7\">It is universally conceded that criininal laws are in their nature local, and in their operation are confined within the limits of the state in which they are enacted. The flag may indeed, under the doctrine of extra-territoriality, extend the area over which the criminal law of a state extends, but this exception only proves the rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"216\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-8\">State <em>v. </em>Carter is approved of by Chief Justice Beasley, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Wikoff, </em>2 <em>Vroom </em>67, where the cases are reviewed, showing that crime may be committed against the laws of a state without personal presence within the jurisdiction. But the question always is against what sovereignty the crime was committed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Knight, Taylor (N. C.) </em>65.</p>\n<p data-order=\"217\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-9\">The -legislature has provided that where any person shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>be feloniously stricken within the jurisdiction of this state, and shall die of such stroke outside of the jurisdiction of this state, an indictment found by jurors of the county of this state in which such stroke shall happen\u2014whether it shall be found before the coroner, on view of the body, or not\u2014shall be good and effectual.</p>\n<p data-order=\"218\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-4\">This is the language of the third section of the act, stripped of the converse of the proposition. Its title is, \u201cAn act concerning the trial of murder in cases where the stroke and deatli happen in different counties, and in cases where either the stroke or death only happens within this state.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"219\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-5\">Many other states of the Union have substantially so provided. The parliament of Great Britain has so provided. Ancient forms of indictments have been framed upon such legislation, since, the time of Edward VI. Innumerable cases have held it competent for the supreme legislative power so to provide. It is believed there is no case where the power has been denied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"220\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-6\">The act, as its title denotes, creates no new crime. It does not seek to extend the territorial jurisdiction of the criminal laws of the state. \u201c It is concerning the crime of murder in cases where the stroke and death happen in different counties.\u201d It provides that the jurors where the stroke happens, may indict, whether the coroner view the body or not. It alters the machinery of the common law in this particular, and it is an act \u201cconcerning murder, where either the stroke or death only happens within this state.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"221\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-7\">Concerning the commission of the crime of murder, where only the stroke or death happens within this state, it provides that if any person shall be feloniously stricken within the jurisdiction of this state, and shall die of such stroke, out of the jurisdiction of the state, he may be indicted by the jurors where the stroke was given, without view of the body by the coroner. It is an act, therefore, which concerns murder, a known crime against the laws of New Jersey, which does occur where the party dies out of the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"222\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-8\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Macloon, </em>101 <em>Mass. </em>1, it was held, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>after a thorough review of the eases, that a citizen of another state, or of a' foreign country, may be convicted of manslaughter of a person who dies within the commonwealth, of injuries indicted upon him by the accused, in a foreign merchant vessel, upon the high seas.</p>\n<p data-order=\"223\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-5\">If Judge Gray is correct, there can be no possible question of the power of the legislature to pass such an act, which is all we are required to show. But we are not required to rest this case on the soundness of the decision in the Maeloon case, nor to insist on the power to punish offences which occur outside of the area over which the authority of the laws of New Jersey extends. We do not think such a proposition can be maintained, and are, therefore, unwilling to rest this case upon it, no matter how high the authority may be upon which it rests. The doctrines of the courts of New Jersey are in accord with the courts of Great Britain, on this important question. Great Britain has never asserted such a right, but only to punish such offences as occurred outside of Great Britain, but within the admiral\u2019s jurisdiction; and the admiral\u2019s jurisdiction, in this country, is vested by the constitution in the federal government. The states are sovereign, but not independent. Mr. Wheaton says it is evident that a state cannot punish an offence against its municipal laws, committed within the territory of another state, unless by its own citizens. <em>Lawrence\u2019s Wheat. </em>230; <em>Story on Const. </em>618; 5 <em>Wheat. </em>416 ; <em>United States </em>v.

III, </em>\u00a7 3; <em>Jackalow\u2019s case, </em>1 <em>Black </em>486.</p>\n<p data-order=\"225\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-7\">It is provided by the crimes act, <em>(Rev. Stat. of U. S., p, </em>138, \u00a7 730): \u201cThe trial of all offences committed on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>high seas, or elsewhere out of the jurisdiction of any particular state or district, shall be in the district where the offender is found, or into which he is first brought.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"226\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-4\">Now, in Great Britain, if a blow is struck on the high seas, but within the jurisdiction of the sovereign, the offender may be punished where the death occurs. In the United States, a stroke on the high seas, and death in a state, subjects the offender to be tried in such place as congress may designate. It is an offence against the sovereignty and laws of the United States, and for this reason, having occurred outside the jurisdiction of a state, is cognizable by the federal courts. Otherwise, there would be here, as in Great Britain, numerous cases where crimes against the laws of the state might occur within the admiralty jurisdiction, and they would be cognizable where the party died, and not where congress designated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"227\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-5\">Crimes not committed in any state, may be defined to be\u2014 offences committed in the District of Columbia; in forts or arsenals to which jurisdiction has been ceded by the states; in the territories of the United States; in the Indian country; upon the high seas, and everywhere, when against the law of nations.

It follows that whenever the stroke is given in the state/and the death outside, the blow is felonious, and the act indictable; but when the stroke is outside, it is only felonious, and therefore only indictable where the doctrine of extra-territoriality extends the jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"229\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-7\">Chief Justice Cockburn says, in <em>Queen </em>v. <em>Keyn, L.

Thus, where the question is as to the motives of a debtor in leaving his home and going and remaining abroad, so as to determine whether or not an act of bankruptcy has been committed, his declarations, when leaving his home and while remaining abroad, as to his motives for leaving his home and for remaining abroad, are admissible in evidence.

If no new crime was created, then to make the statute apply to this case, you must hold that the legislature <em>intended </em>and <em>did </em>by this statute undertake to prescribe the means-for the trial of offences, the material parts of which occurred-in another <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"266\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b561-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b561-12\">Beasley, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"A4r\">The plaintiff in error was convicted of murder in the first degree before the Court of Oyer and Terminer of the county of Camden, and by the authority of the recent statute relative to writs of error in capital cases, certain parts of the proceedings at his trial have been brought before this court for revision. I shall notice briefly each part thus presented, in the order in which they stand in the printed points laid before the court by his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">The first and second of the objections thus made to these proceedings are of the same character and rest on the same ground, and may be disposed of conjointly and in a word. They relate to alleged defects in the first and sixth counts of the indictment, but as there is and can be no pretence that some of the other counts are not good, it would be useless for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>present purposes.to consider what weight there is in such exceptions, for it has long since been authoritatively established by judicial decisions in this state, that a single good count in an indictment is sufficient to sustain the judgment. <em>West </em>v. <em>State, </em>2 <em>Zab. </em>236, and the cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The third, fourth, and fifth exceptions relate to but one subject, presenting it in different aspects, and under varied forms of objection. The point raised is this : That in two of the counts of the indictment the death of John M. Armstrong is laid as having occurred in this state, while in each of the other four counts there is an averment of his death in the State of Pennsylvania. Upon this it is objected, in the language of counsel, that \u201c this is not a different form of averment of the same crime, but the two classes of counts directly and positively aver two different things, which are impossible to be the same, namely, the first and sixth, the death of John M. Armstrong, Avho died in the State of New Jersey, and the remaining four counts, the death of John M. Armstrong, who must have been a different person, since he died in the State of Pennsylvania. There is no word used in any of the counts to show that the same Armstrong is meant in each, but the counts are kept specially distinct by the designation in each as one John M. Armstrong. This shows an indictment containing two distinct charges of felony and murder done by the prisoner upon two different persons. This makes the indictment multifarious, incongruous and bad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">If it were admitted that this record, in conjunction with the general verdict of guilty, imports all that is claimed in this contention, it is not apparent why, on this writ of error, the judgment should be reversed. If the -plaintiff in error has, in truth, murdered two men, instead of one, there seems no reason why the present sentence should not stand. It is indeed urged in behalf of the prisoner, that by this mode of treatment he has been put to disadvantage in the loss of the right to challenge double the number of jurors that can be challenged when the crimination is single; but the reply to this is, that this record does not show that he claimed such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>right, or that it was withheld from him; for aught that appears, he may have exercised it. But, independently of such considerations, there can be no doubt as to the rule of law applicable to the subject, for it always has been held that the. only mode of objecting to the joinder of several distinct felonies in one indictment is by a motion to the trial court, before plea, to quash the indictment, or in a subsequent stage of the proceedings to apply to compel the prosecutor to elect which charge he will try; and it is further settled that the decisions on such motions are not subject to review on error brought. But at this time I do not think it is necessary to .further pursue this line of inquiry, or to conclude anything involved in it, inasmuch as it is clear that it is only by a .misconstruction of the legal form of this record that any of the questions embraced in this exception can be considered to be legally presented. These several counts are mere formularies, having a fixed and certain legal efficacy. Each several count, in a well drawn indictment, imports, according to its terms, a charge of a distinct offence, and there is no interdependence exhibited, in anywise, between the several counts. Thus, in charging a homicide, one count may lay the killing to have been done with an axe; another may allege that the instrument used was a knife, and a third may describe it as a sword. The act of killing is thus differentiated by descriptive <em>indicia, </em>so that, read literally, such counts are always incongruous ; but their literal sense is not their legal sense. They are regarded in law as charging, in substance, the same \u25a0offence, the incidents only being varied .for the technical purpose of harmonizing, even in details, the described crime with .the possible proofs. The offence is no more marked and .individualized by a description of the place of death, than it .is by a description of the instrument used. And this question, like those already disposed of, is also <em>res adjudicaba </em>in our courts. The whole subject was considered and adjudged in the case of <em>Donnelly </em>v. <em>State, </em>(first in the Supreme Court and afterwards in this court,) 2 <em>Dutcher </em>461, 601. On that occasion, Mr. Scott, who appeared for the prisoner, insisted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>each of the four counts in that indictment charged a distinct offence, and that the general verdict was so incongruous that it found that the slain man had been murdered and had died four times on the same day. But the court, looking beyond the mere form, and recognizing its object and purpose, held that the four counts charged but a single offence.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">This decision rules the present question, as the principle on which it rests is plainly applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The next two exceptions pertain to certain declarations, both written and oral, which are alleged to be mere hearsay, and which, therefore, it is urged, were inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The question thus raised is of importance, and in some of its aspects its decision is attended with considerable difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">In pressing this matter on the attention of the court, this is the printed language of the counsel of the defendant: \u201cSixth. The court erred in admitting the declarations of John M. Armstrong, made in Philadelphia, on the afternoon of the twenty-third of January, to the effect that he intended to go that evening to Camden, in company with Mr. Hunter, said declarations not being dying declarations, nor made in the presence of Hunter, nor under any circumstances which made them competent as evidence in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">It will be observed, from this statement, that the whole objection here made is to the statement that the deceased said he was going to Camden with Mr. Hunter on the night in question. Upon turning to the proceedings at the trial and the bill of exceptions, it appears that the statement of the witness, with reference to the matter in question, was fuller, and contained other particulars than those above indicated. The witness was the son of the murdered man ; and, narrating the statements made to him by his father, his words were as follows: \u201c He said, in the morning, that Mr. Hunter had told him that some one had told him (Hunter) that Davis had a bank account, and that he had advised my father to come over \u00e1nd see about it, and get the money, and he would go with him. Father said he intended to go-with Mr. Hunter, and he and Mr. Hunter were going to Camden that night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Following this statement of the witness, the bill of exception proceeds in this form, viz.: \u201c To which testimony counsel for the prisoner there and then objected, and moved and contended that the same was mere hearsay testimony, and should be overruled; but the court thereupon denied the motion, aud refused to overrule the said testimony, or any part thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">From this presentation it appears that this entire statement of this witness was objected to as a whole; there was no attempt to separate it into parts, discriminating the bad from the good, so that, until this had been done, the court could not be required to do it, but was right, if the statement contained in any respect legitimate evidence, in refusing to overrule it or any part of it. The rule on the subject is settled beyond all controversy, and has been frequently acted upon by this court. If, consequently, the narration of the witness, to the effect that his father told him that he and Mr. Hunter were going to Camden that night was unobjectionable evidence, this action of the judge in refusing to overrule the entire statement cannot be impeached. I think there can be no doubt that this latter declaration was the particular to which the attention of the court and the counsel was directed at the trial, and that the objection then made was pointed at it exclusively. It was certainly the exclusive subject, so far as touches the testimony of this witness, of the printed exception on the part of the defence, and was the foundation on which was rested the well digested and very forcible argument which the counsel of the prisoner addressed in his behalf t(j' this court. From these circumstances I have concluded that-the question whether this witness should have been allowed to declare -what his father had said touching the Davis book account is not now legally presented for consideration. I shall therefore treat this part of the case as it was treated by the counsel of the prisoner in his argument here, as raising the single inquiry whether the witness could be allowed to testify that his father told him he was going to Camden with the plaintiff in error on the night of the murder. I may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>remark, however, in this connection, that in the sequel it will appear that the permitted reference by this witness to the Davis account seeins to me, from one of the views I take of the questions involved, a circumstance of no importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Connected with this subject, and raising questions controlled by the same considerations, is the testimony called in question by the seventh exception. This was a letter written by John M. Armstrong to his wife, on the afternoon preceding the night of his murder, which was in these words, viz.: \u201c No. 710 Sansom street, Philadelphia. I will not be home much before nine o\u2019clock. Am going over to Camden again with Mr. Hunter, on business connected with the Davis matter. (Signed) John M. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">\u201c Frank will not be at home to supper; he is going down to Goudey\u2019s to tea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The person here described as Frank was the son of Mr. Armstrong. The envelope containing this note was addressed to his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The conversation with the son, embraced in the foregoing exception, occurred in the afternoon of the day of the murder, the letter being sent at a later hour of the same afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">From the foregoing statement of facts it will, I think, be apparent that the particular question to be at present resolved, is, whether these communications of Mr. Armstrong, whether .written or oral, of his intention of going to Camden with Mr. Hunter, were, in a legal view, to be regarded as a part of. the <em>res gestee. </em>The peculiar features of this case affecting this question will be hereafter considered by me; but I think it is obvious that, with reference to general legal principles, such communications were no part of the matter in controversy, unless they were so connected with the act of the deceased in going to Camden as to be, in a reasonable sense, part of such act.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Now I think I may safely say that there are few problems involved in the law of evidence more unsolved than what things are to be embraced in those occurrences that are designated in the law as the <em>res gestee. </em>The adjudications on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>subject, more especially those in this country, are perplexingly variant and discordant. I can readily finid judicial rulings by force of which this testimony would be excluded; but I -can as readily find other rulings of equal weight, that would sanction its admission. This result has grown out of the difficulty of applying, with anything like precision, general rules to a class of cases of infinite variety. In the well considered case of <em>Lund and wife </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Tyngsburgh, </em>9 <em>Cush. </em>42, it is said: \u201c The <em>res gestee </em>are different in different cases ; and it is, perhaps, not possible to frame any definition which would embrace all the various cases which may arise in practice. It is for the judicial mind to determine, upon such principles and tests as are established by the law of evidence, what facts and circumstances, in particular cases, come within the import of the terms.\u201d In the present instance the test thus indicated will be found, I think, in the rule that such declarations as these are admissible, because they are so connected with an act, itself admissible as a part of the <em>res </em>gestee, as to have become incorporated with it. The declaration and the act must make up one transaction. The theory justifying this course is that, when such declarations are thus coupled with a provable act, they receive confirmation from it; but if they stand alone, without such support, they depend altogether for their credence on the veracity of the utterer, and thus conditioned, they are pure hearsay, and inadmissible. Alluding to the rule that excludes hearsay, Mr. Starkie, vol. I., p. 65, says : <em>\u201c </em>The principle does not extend to the exclusion of any of w'hat may be termed real or natural facts and circumstances in any way connected with the transaction, and from which any inference as to the truth of the disputed fact can reasonably be made.\u201d The present point of inquiry therefore is, whether these declarations of Mr. Armstrong to his son, and the similar declaration contained in the note to his wife, can reasonably be said to be component parts, or the natural incidents of the act of the deceased in going to Camden, which act was incontestably a part of the <em>res gestee. </em>After mature reflection and a careful examination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>authorities, my conclusion is, that these communications of the deceased should be regarded as constituents of that transaction, for I think they were preparations for it, and thus were naturally connected with it. In the ordinary course of things it was the usual information that a man about leaving home -would communicate for the convenience of his family, the information of his friends, or the regulation of his business. At tine time it was given, such declarations could, in the nature of things, mean harm to no one; he who uttered them was bent on no expedition of mischief or wrong, and the attitude of affairs at the time entirely explodes the idea that such utterances were intended to serve any purpose but that for which they were obviously designed. If it be said that such notice of an intention of leaving home could have been given without introducing in it the name of Mr. Hunter, the obvious answer to the suggestion I think is, that a reference to the companion -who is to accompany the person leaving, is as natural a part of the transaction as is any other incident or quality of it. If it is legitimate to show by a man\u2019s own declarations that he left his home to be gone a week, or for a certain destination, which seems incontestable, why may it not be proved in the same way that a designated person was to bear him company ? At the time the words were uttered or written, they imported no wrong-doing to any one, and the reference to the companion who was to go with him was nothing more, as matters then stood, than an indication of an additional circumslauce of his going. If it was in the ordinary train of events for this man to leave word, or to state where he was going, it seems to me it was equally so for him to say with whom he was going. I think Mr. Wharton has well described that assemblage of acts and their incidents, that make up the <em>res gestee. </em>He thus writes : \u201c The <em>res gestee </em>may therefore be defined as those circumstances which are the undesigned incidents of a particular litigated act, which are admissible when illustrative of such act. These incidents may be separated from the. act by a lapse of time more or less appreciable. They may consist of speeches of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>any one concerned, whether participant or bystander; they may comprise things left undone as well as things done. Their sole distinguishing feature is that they should be the necessary incidents of the litigated act; necessary, in this sense, that they are part of the immediate preparations for, or emanations of such act, and are not produced by the calculated policy of the actors.\u201d This definition obviously embraces the declarations now challenged, for they were immediate preparations for the act in question, and were certainly not produced by the calculated policy of the actor who gave utterance to them. I am unable to see that the reference made to Mr. Hunter by the deceased was not as closely combined with the probable act of his going to Camden, as were the inquiries made by Parkman, as he passed through the streets of Cambridge, for the house of Dr. Webster; and those inquiries were admitted as evidence by Chief Justice Shaw. <em>Report of Webster's case. </em>It is true that in that instance the inquiries happened to be precisely cotemporaneous with the act being done; but all the authorities admit that it would be absurd to require exact coincidence in point of time between the doing of the act and saying of the words explanatory of it. Thus, in the case already cited from 9 <em>Cushing, </em>it is said: <em>\u201cSo </em>declarations, to be admissible, must be cotemporaneous with the main <em>fact </em>or transaction ; but it is impracticable <em>to </em>fix, by any general rule, any exact instant of time, so as to preclude debate or conflict of opinion in regard to this particular point.\u201d Lord Denman is quite strong in his expressions on this subject, for in <em>Rouch </em>v. <em>Great Western R. R. Co., </em>1 <em>Q. B. </em>60, he uses this language: \u201c The principle of admission is, that the declarations are <em>pars rei gestae, </em>and therefore it has been contended that they must be cotemporaneous with it; but this has been decided not to be necessary, on good grounds; for the nature and strength of the connection with the act are the material things to be looked to; and, although concurrence of time cannot but be always material evidence to show the connection, yet it is by no means essential.\u201d In the case now under consideration, these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>declarations are so naturally, and therefore strongly, associated with the act in contemplation that, in my estimation, the most exact cotemporaneousness of the two things would give no additional force to the connection between them. There is nothing in the case to countenance the notion that any change of purpose occurred between the time of the expression of such purpose and the execution of it, so, as there is no \u25a0extraneous interference, the disclosure of the intention and its performance may be said to be, within the meaning of the authorities, one entire transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">It is principally from, the foregoing considerations that I find myself constrained to think that the declarations under \u25a0discussion, even if they stood in the case unsupported or unaffected by other circumstances, were admissible, on general principles, on the single ground that they were the natural and inartificial concomitants of a probable act, which itself was a part of the <em>res gestee. </em>In such a <em>status </em>of the evidence, I should think that the exception to the principle that rules \u25a0out hearsay, had been carried to its extreme limit, but without transcending such limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">But, in point of fact, the question thus discussed is not, on this record, presented in this narrow point of view, for it is, in the proofs, connected with facts that appear to put the admissibility of these declarations on a stable foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"Axo\">It was in the connection now to be disclosed, that this testimony was admitted by the judge at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">A witness for the state had been produced, who had testified that he had overheard a certain conversation, that had occurred on the day of the murder, between the victim, Mr. Armstrong, and the defendant, Mr. Hunter. This witness, referring to the latter person, said: \u201cI saw him in the office, talking to Mr. Armstrong. * * * I heard him say, This man has a bank account; I heard it from 'private/ or 'outside\u2019 parties ; I do not know which; you go there to-night, at seven o\u2019clock, and I will go with you.\u201d Here, then, it appeared that Mr. Hunter made an offer to go with the deceased. It was certainly competent to show that there was a mutual understand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>ing to that effect, and the evidence in question was admitted with that view, and for that single purpose. Whether the deceased acceded to the plan proposed to him, was known to himself, but his purpose could be made manifest to others only by his words. Otherwise than in this way, how was it possible to show the assent of the deceased to the proffered arrangement ? Suppose the defence had shown that a proposition had been made by some third party to accompany the deceased to Camden, on the night in question\u2014could it have been reasonably contended that such evidence could not have been supplemented,, and made significant, by proof that the deceased evinced, by his statements, that he, on his side, had agreed to the proposal, and was about to carry it into effect ? In this aspect of the evidence, the case seems to be brought fully within that other exception to the rule excluding hearsay, which legalizes declarations which are explanatory of a state of mind, such mental condition being the subject of inquiry. In the case of Lund <em>v. </em>Inhabitants of Tyngsburgh, already cited, the principle which is apposite is stated in these terms: \u201cPerhaps the most common and largest class of cases in which declarations are admissible, is that in which the state of mind, or motive with which any particular act is done, is the subject of inquiry. Thus, where the question is as to the motives of a debtor in leaving his house, and going and remaining abroad, so as to determine whether or not an act of bankruptcy has been committed, his declarations when leaving his house and while remaining abroad, as to his motives for leaving his house and for remaining abroad, are admissible in evidence. Such declarations, accompanying the act, clearly belong to the <em>res gestee. </em>They are calculated to elucidate and explain the act, and they derive a degree of credit from the act.\u201d This, undoubtedly, is a correct statement of the legal doctrine, and it seems completely applicable to this case in the present point of view. One of the important questions at the trial was, whether the deceased had pome into an agreement with the defendant to accompany him to Camden on the night of the murder. There was testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>showing the assent of' Mr. Hunter to such agreement. The question for solution was as to the intention of the deceased in leaving his home, whether his motive and purpose were to assent to and execute such agreement. Such a juncture, with respect to intention and conduct, I cannot distinguish from that of the bankrupt in departing from his home, so far as the rules of evidence touching declarations are concerned; and, in my opinion, this testimony, on this ground, was also admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">In this connection, it is proper that I should say that I have examined the testimony of William L. Donnell, and that I have found it of the same general character as that just considered, and that, in its principal features, I think it is to be controlled by the principles already laid down. It does not refer to Mr. Hunter by name, but the witness says that the deceased told him that a certain party had told him that Davis.\u201chad money in bank, and they were going over to see about it.\u201d The witness further said the' deceased told him that he \u201chad been over the night before,\u201d but this statement had no significance in the case. In view of the admission of the other declarations which so directly referred to the defendant, and his arrangement with the deceased,' the testimony of this particular witness was of no consequence in the case; and that was the estimation apparently put upon it by the counsel of the defendant, for it was scarcely alluded to in .his exhaustive argument on this branch of the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">I have already shown that' I have been led to the result that all these declarations which were excepted to as hearsay, were legitimate evidence in the cause; and I have now to make the further remark, that if I had arrived at the opposite conclusion, I still should not have felt justified, on that account, to vote in favor of reversing this judgment. My reason is this, that I am satisfied that the admission of this testimony could not have hurt the defendant on the trial of the cause, and by force of the law of this state it is not enough, for the purpose of overthrowing a judgment in a criminal case, that errors in law have entered into the proceeding. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>eighty-ninth section of the statute regulating criminal procedure says : \u201c No judgment given upon any indictment shall be reversed for any imperfection, omission, defect in, or lack of form, or for any error except such as shall or may have prejudiced the defendant in maintaining his defence upon the merits.\u201d In addition to the existence of error in law, it must be shown that such error was, or might have been, prejudicial to the defence on the merits. This exposition of the statute was applied in the case of <em>Donnelly </em>v. State, 2 <em>Dutcher </em>493.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">And from a careful examination of this case, I have fully satisfied my own mind that all the facts embodied in these disputed declarations appeared from indisputable testimony, so that they stood in the case as undisputed facts. That the deceased <em>said </em>that he and Mr. Hunter were to go to Camden on the night in question, with respect to the Davis account, I find conclusively established, irrespectively of these reported statements made by the deceased, the admissibility of which has been denied. I will turn to the evidence for, the purpose of seeing that it appears in an undisputed form, and-without contradiction, that the deceased said these things. In the first place, I will refer to the son of the deceased, Mr. Armstrong. This witness says he told Mr. Hunter, the day succeeding the murder, what his father had said to him touching his going to Camden. His language is: \u201cHe (Hunter) came to the dining-room, and I told him father had been assaulted in Camden; I asked him if he had been along with father; he said no; I told him that father had told me that he was going over to Camden with him that night, and he said he did hot say so\u2014that it was not so.\u201d And on the cross-examination of this witness, the further important testimony was elicited : the counsel of the defendant, referring to a statement made by the witness on a previous occasion, asked this question : \u201c Then how is it that you said that reference was made to Davis\u2019 bank account before?\u201d Answer\u2014\u201cI forgot that.\u201d Question\u2014\u201cWhat else occurred that you have not told us now?\u201d Answer\u2014\u201c I said Mr. Hunter thought that perhaps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>this party that had told him that Davis had a bank account had proven treacherous.\u201d And further on, refei\u2019ring to the statement of the witness to Mr. Hunter, that his father had told him that he was going to Camden with him, the crossexaniiner proceeds thus: \u201c And you told him that perhaps the party who had told him that Davis had a bank account had proved a traitor?\u201d Answer\u2014\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Question\u2014 \u201cThat is to say, you made it up?\u201d Answer\u2014\u201cNo, sir; I did not make it up.\u201d Question\u2014\u201c Where did you get the information ?\u201d Answer\u2014\u201c Because my father had told me that Mr. Hunter had told him.\u201d Here, then, we have a witness distinctly swearing to all the material facts comprehended in the disputed declarations, in a form that was unquestionably legal. He here testified to his information from his father that Mr. Hunter was to go with him to Camden, and that such visit related to the Davis account. Further than this, in the defendant\u2019s own testimony, when a witness in his own behalf, he says, referring to the interview with the son of the deceased : \u201c He told me that his father had been assaulted in Camden, and he asked me if I was there; I told him I was not; he intimated to me\u2014in fact said to me\u2014that his father said I was going with him to Camden, and through the conversation he said I would have to locate myself.\u201d So,, with respect to the same theme, being called for an explanation of an alleged conversation with Mr. Lorrilliere, he further testified: \u201cWell, I said something to this effect, I think: that I was very sorry to hear about the trouble of Mr. Armstrong ; that he had said I was over there that night, or something to that effect.\u201d There was also further evidence on the point. The widow of the murdered man was a witness, and she narrated a conversation she had with Mr. Hunter on the morning after the murder, and told him, in the course of it,, that she had received a note from her husband on Wednesday evening, stating that he was going to Camden with him in the evening; and then the cross-examination follows, in this wise : Question\u2014\u201c Piad Mr. Armstrong told you that Mr. Hunter was going over with him on Tuesday, also ?\u201d Answer\u2014\u201c He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>told me on Tuesday morning, early.\u201d Question\u2014\u201c What did he tell you ?\u201d Answer\u2014\u201c He said he would not be home that day, on Tuesday evening; he was to have taken his p\u00e1pers concerning the Davis matter with him, and Hunter would go with him, and he would be back about nine o\u2019clock.\u201d Now this mass of testimony, proving the fact that the deceased did say that the defendant was to accompany him to Camden on the night of the murder, stands in the case absolutely unquestioned either by word or circumstance. These statements may not have been true; Mr. Hunter may not have arranged to go to Camden with him ; but that is not the point; the question was, whether the deceased so asserted; and that, I repeat, I consider was absolutely indisputable, in view of the admittedly legal evidence. The contested declarations, therefore, were mere surplusage; they did, and could do, neither harm nor good to either side. To overturn this judgment, therefore, on this ground, would be, in my judgment, to overturn it on a mere technicality. To-do so would be to contravene the provisions of that wise and valuable statute which has just been recited.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">On the whole, therefore, I think it clear that these particular exceptions are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The tenth assignment of errors is in these words, viz.: \u201cThe court erred in admitting Lydia Graham, wife of Thomas Graham, to be sworn and give testimony in corroboration of the statement and confession of her husband, that he had been guilty of the infamous crime of murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Thomas Graham, the husband of this witness, was the alleged accomplice of the plaintiff in error, and having been called as a witness by the state, had admitted his guilt as the associate of Mr. Hunter in the homicide. Subsequently,.in the progress of the trial, the wife was offered as a witness, and was admitted after objection.-</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">All that the wife testified to was, that just before the murder Mr. Hunter had called to see her husband, and on one of such occasions had left a card containing a request that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>husband would meet him at a designated place in the city of Philadelphia.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">It appeared in the case that the husband had been separately indicted for this murder, and had not, at the time of the trial, pleaded to the accusation.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">This objection was not much pressed on the argument, and it is plain, on all the authorities, that it cannot be sustained. It is altogether settled that the wife is a competent witness, when the husband is not a party in the suit, to testify to facts that merely tend to his crimination, provided the facts proved by her do not manifest that an indictable offence has been committed by him. This was the rule that received the sanction of this court in the case of <em>Ware </em>v. <em>State, </em>reported in 6 <em>Vroom </em>554.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">This exception, I think, should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The eleventh and last exception is thus expressed : \u201c The judgment in this case ought to be reversed because John M. Armstrong, who is alleged to have been murdered by the prisoner, died out of the State of New Jersey and in the State of Pennsylvania, and within the separate territory and exclusive jurisdiction of the said State of Pennsylvania.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The question thus raised for consideration is one relating entirely to the meaning and effect of one of the statutes of' this state, and it was so treated by the counsel of the plaintiff in error in his argument addressed to this court. For his contention was, that by the rules of the common law, and except for statutory aid, the conditions of the case being a felonious and mortal blow within the territory of this state, and the occurrence of the resulting death beyond the limits of such territory, the criminal act could not be treated and punished as murder within this jurisdiction. It is not necessary that I should either assent to, or controvert, these premises, and for the present I shall proceed upon the.assumption of their truth, and shall regard the inquiry as dependent for solution on the proper interpretation of the act under the rules of statutory exposition. And I may say at once, that in this point of view I have from the first failed to see the least difficulty in the subject. The language of this statute is thi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number><em>s: </em>Where any person shall be feloniously stricken or poisoned upon the sea, or at any place out of the jurisdiction of this state, and shall die of the same stroke or poisoning within the jurisdiction of this state, or where any person shall be feloniously stricken or poisoned within the jurisdiction of this state, and shall die of such stroke or poisoning upon the sea or at any place out of the jurisdiction of this state, in either of said cases,\u201d &amp;c.., jurisdiction is given to the courts of this state to try and punish such murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Now it will be at once observed that this clause of this law, interpreted by its own terms, has a meaning perfectly clear and definite. It describes with faultless accuracy of phraseology the place in which the jurisdictional facts are to occur; the mortal blow is to be struck \u201c within the jurisdiction of this state,\u201d in the one case, or \u201c upon the sea, or at any place out of the jurisdiction of this state,\u201d in the other; and the same words define the places in which the death is to happen. Why, then, should not this act be understood and enforced according to its plain import ? The only reason which has been suggested is, that when the body of the crime has been committed within the territory of any of the other states of this Union, or in a foreign country, it is contrary to fundamental legal principles for this state to assume a jurisdiction over such offence merely from the fact that the victim of the crime died within such jurisdiction ; and it is therefore argued that the act should receive such a construction as will exclude from its operation such a result. The sense in which it was urged that the terms descriptive of the foreign places in which the homicidal' blow was to occur were to be interpreted was, that they should be taken to indicate only such places as were out of the dominions of every organized government. The argument, then, having reached this point, was turned to practical application by the further contention that, as the terms descriptive of the place of the blow and of the place of the death were the same, that the latter occurrence, as well as the former, must happen outside of the reign of law, and as the death in this case took place within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the consequence was that the conjuncture to whicli the statute applied was not present, and therefore the courts of this state were destitute of jurisdiction to try the offence. It will be perceived that the premise of this train of reasoning is, the inference that the-statute, construed according to its terms, leads to an enormity,, that is, to the arrogation by the state of the prerogative of' punishing offenses against the laws of foreign governments.. There can be no doubt that the spirit of a statute will sometimes control its letter, but when the letter is plain, the reason must be most cogent for departing from it. I am unable to perceive on what ground it can be claimed that such reason exists in this case. A claim to jurisdiction over extra-territorial crimes from the fact that the death, resulting from such crimes, occurred within such jurisdiction, has been decided by courts whose decisions are entitled to the highest respect, to-be a legitimate exercise of the powers of government. Such was the result reached, after an elaborate examination of the subject, by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, in the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Macloon, </em>101 <em>Mass. </em>1; and the English statute is held by the courts of that country to give jurisdiction whenever an Englishman has committed a murder, the victim dying within the realm, although the fatal blow has been struck in a foreign country. This doctrine was enforced in <em>Reg. </em>v. <em>Azzopardi, </em>1 <em>C. &amp; K. </em>203, and was reaffirmed in a considered judgment, in the case of <em>Reg. </em>v. Lewis, 7 <em>Cox C. C. </em>277. It is therefore utterly out of the question to concede that a result thus accredited is to be considered so abnormal and monstrous as to raise a conviction that such result is not within the statutory intent, when the words of such statute are plain to that end. I do not overlook the circumstance that there are some expressions used in the opinion read in the case of State <em>v. </em>Carter that may be said to tend in the direction of the opposite view; but it is obvious from the-context and general tenor of the judicial reasoning in that opinion, that the point really attempted to be sustained was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>that the legislature was not invested with the ability to pass .a law to punish foreign murders from the' death of the person slain happening within the jurisdiction of the state. The case itself is no authority, even for such a doctrine, and what was said with reference to this matter was entirely extra-judicial, for the only question presented was, whether the act extended to the crime of manslaughter, and it was decided that it did not. But it is not with this question, or to the right of the legislature to pass a law of the kind referred to, that we are at present concerned ; for no one denies that when the mortal blow, as in this case, has been struck in this stale, .such power exists; the only inquiry is, whether the legislature designed to enact such a statute. I have endeavored to show that its words are of plain import, and that there is .nothing in the effects or consequences of the act by which the force of such words can be limited. I will remark, in conclusion, that if a corroboration of the foregoing view is necessary, it will, I think, be found by looking at the consequences of the statute in question if we adopt the exposition contended for by the counsel of the defendant. That exposition is that it. was not the intention to punish crimes committed within foreign jurisdictions, and that when the statute speaks of any person being \u201c feloniously stricken or poisoned upon the sea, or at any place out of the jurisdiction of this state,\u201d it is the necessary intendment that all foreign jurisdictions in which regular government prevails, are excepted. It is obvious, therefore, that with respect to the land when we search for .a place within the statutory description, we are confined to desert lauds, or the abodes of barbarous peoples; and with \u00bfrespect to the sea, as every ship, being subject to established law, is excluded by the definition, we have but the waste of waters in which the statutory blow is to be struck or the poison is to be administered. Manifestly it is safe to say this act- was never intended to provide for the punishment of such impossible crimes.' The statute must be read according to its .terms, and in that sense it is applicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>After full examination of all the points argued, I am of opinion that this judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><em>For </em>affirmance\u2014The Chancellor, Chief Justice, Dalrimple, Depue, Dixon, Knapp, Reed, Scudder, Yan Syckel, Clement, Dodd, Green, Lathrop, Wales. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\"><em>For </em>reversal\u2014None.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
