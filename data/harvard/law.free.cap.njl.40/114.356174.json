POTTER v. ROBERT ROBINSON.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b144-6\">When a debtor, who has been remanded to prison upon the undertaking and agreement of a dissatisfied creditor, pursuant to the thirteenth section of the insolvent debtors\u2019 act, <em>(Rev., p. </em>500,) gives bond, and is released from custody under the same section, the creditor\u2019s obligation to pay the weekly stipend is thereby terminated.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-7\">On <em>eertiorari.</em></summary>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b144-8\">Argued at November Term, 1877, before Justices Scudder, Dixon and Reed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b144-9\">For the plaintiff, <em>Garret Berry.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b144-10\">For the defendant, <em>J.

Immediately on such remand, the defendant gave the bond authorized by the proviso of the same section, conditioned for his compliance with the insolvent laws, and was forthwith discharged from custody. The plaintiff did not thereafter pay the weekly sum stipulated, and for that cause the court, on the defendant\u2019s application, ordered him to be discharged. This order is brought before us by <em>certiorari, </em>and the question presented, discussed and to be decided is, whether the plaintiff was bound to pay the weekly stipend after the defendant\u2019s release from imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The argument urged before us, in support of the view adopted by the court below, is mainly that the language of the statute requires the payment under all circumstances, and it is, therefore, not within the province of the courts to create an <em>exception\u2014ita lex scripta </em>est\u2014and the judiciary must simply declare, not make the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">It should not, however, be forgotten that while this is clearly the duty of the courts, yet, in performing that duty, we must not confine our examination to the bare words of the statute; we are to look also at the reason of the enactment, and guard against an absurd conclusion, if a literal construction would lead thereto. The intent of the legislature, as ascertained by the court, constitutes the law, and the court will not conclude that that intent was unreasonable or absurd, if such a conclusion can be evaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The provision enabling the dissatisfied creditor to keep his debtor in confinement pending the subsequent proceedings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>notwithstanding the purpose of the court to release him, first appears in the act of March 18th, 1795, section six. <em>Elm. Dig. </em>250. From that time until the act of February 24th,, 1858, <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>103,) the debtor was bound to remain in custody until his right to a final discharge was settled, provided the creditor complied with the terms of the statute. One of those terms was that the creditor should agree to pay and should pay such sum as the court might direct, not exceeding, at first, four shillings; then, (November 28th, 1822, <em>Elm. Dig. </em>256,) $1; then, (April 16th, 1846, <em>Nix. Dig. </em>410,) $2 per week, to and for the support of the debtor; to be paid to the-debtor or jailor, originally, on the second day of each week; afterwards, (November 28th, 1822, <em>Elm. Dig. </em>256,) in such sum and at such time as the creditor might choose, but not to-be withheld for a space longer than a week at any one time. The purpose of this allowance is declared by the act itself to be \u201cthe support of the debtor,\u201d and the necessity for its prompt payment, or the immediate discharge of the debtor, is indicated in the language of Chief Justice Ewing in <em>State </em>v. <em>Stiles, </em>7 <em>Halst. </em>296, where he decides that notice of the application for discharge need not be given to the creditor, lest, pending the delay, the debtor may be starving or subsisting on the bounty of others, from the want of what the creditor has engaged to supply. This exigency, of starving or subsisting on the bounty of others, could not press upon the debtor, save while he was in confinement, and it is reasonable to presume that the provision which the law has made to meet it was not designed to extend beyond the same period. It was because of the debtor\u2019s inability to support himself while actually imprisoned, that the law required his creditor to support him, and the alternative for the creditor\u2019s failure so to do was the prompt discharge of the debtor, that he might avail himself of his own resources. This discharge was, under the original statute, to be a release, not only from physical restraint, but also from legal liability to further arrest\u2014a final discharge; but it was the release from actual custody which exonerated the creditor from the duty of subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>payment, and the discharge of the debtor, from legal liability \u00a1accompanied that release only because the statute had no provision for separating them.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">But the act of February 24th, 1858, made such provision, and distinguished between the release from bodily restraint and that from legal liability, enabling the debtor, on giving bond, to be at large pending the question of his final acquittance. This act, however, did not in terms declare whether freedom, so obtained, should terminate the creditor\u2019s obligation to pay, but provided that all subsequent proceedings should be had in like manner, \u201c <em>as near as may be,\u201d </em>as if the debtor were actually in prison, under the remand of the court. This phrase <em>as near as may be, </em>manifestly contemplates some variation from the prescribed course. The extent of such variation is not defined, and hence it is for the courts to give such effect to this new provision as, in reason, ought to flow from it. It should not be limited by the physical possibilities of the case, but should be made inclusive of whatever changes the spirit of the legislation requires. Under the guidance of the two rules of construction laid down by Mattel, <em>(Potter\u2019s Dwar. on Stat. </em>128,) \u201c Every interpretation that leads to an absurdity ought to be rejected; \u201d and \u201cThe reason of the law, that is, the motive which led to the making of it, is one of the most certain means of establishing the true sense,\u201d I think no doubt can exist that the legislature has not required a creditor to pay his debtor a weekly stipend, merely because the former undertakes to show the latter not entitled to the benefit of the insolvent laws; and has enacted that such an allowance shall cease when the imprisonment, which gives rise to it, terminates.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In my judgment, therefore, the order discharging the defendant was erroneous, and should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
