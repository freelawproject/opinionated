J. L. </em>1, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">But this does not avail the prosecutor to have the conviction set aside. His remedy was by <em>mandamus </em>to compel the consideration of his application for a license subject to the lawful features of the ordinance b'ut without regard to the illegal provision of non-residence contained therein; and not to attempt to maintain a junk yard in violation of the valid portions of the ordinance without the issue of any license whatever. <em>Fields </em>v. <em>Duffy, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>319.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The writ is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
