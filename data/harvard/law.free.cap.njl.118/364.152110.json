Enteman, </em>of counsel).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-6\">For the respondent, <em>Skolkin &amp; Cohen (Jack Rinzler, </em>of counsel).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b411-8\">Heher, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG4\">The District Court judge, sitting without a jury, awarded plaintiff disability benefits under a clause of a policy of life insurance, issued to him as the assured by the defendant company, obligating the insurer to pay such benefits if, after the payment of one full year\u2019s premium on the policy, the insured \u201cshall become <em>wholly and permanently disabled </em>by bodily injury or disease sustained or contracted after the date\u201d thereof, \u201cso that thereby he will be <em>wholly continuously and permanently prevented </em>from the pursuit of <em>any form of mental or manual labor for compensation, gain or profit whatsoever, </em>and has been so disabled for not less than sixty days * * Liability was expressly conditioned upon \u201cthe receipt of due proof of such disability.\u201d Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">The first insistence is that the furnishing of \u201cdue proof\u201d of such disability is a condition precedent to the right of recovery, and there is no evidence of compliance with that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">We think the proofs support a finding of waiver of the provision by the insurer. On this point, the case seems to be ruled by <em>Teitelbaum </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Accident Co., </em>13 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>811; <em>affirmed, </em>116 <em>N. J. L. </em>417.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">But the inquiry need not be pursued. We perceive no basis in the evidence for the finding that the insured is \u201cwholly and permanently disabled,\u201d within the intendment of the policy provision; and it was therefore error to deny the insurer\u2019s motions for a nonsuit and a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>The insured is a house painter by trade. In his application for the policy in suit, he stated his \u201cpresent occupation\u201d to be that of a \u201ccontractor painter;\u201d and he admitted that he has engaged in that pursuit to some extent since he sustained his injuries, which consisted of a fracture of the pelvic bone and a comminuted fracture of the tibia of the right leg. It is conceded that he has had \u201ca marvelous recovery.\u201d His own physician described it as \u201ca lucky one.\u201d The pelvic break has completely healed, and there is little or no consequent disability. As to the fractured tibia, \u201cthe alignment was satisfactory.\u201d And \u201cthe recovery in general * * * was satisfactory,\u201d although at the time of this physician\u2019s \u201clast complete physical examination,\u201d \u2014 in the latter part of January, 1934, less than a year before the trial \u2014 plaintiff suffered from swelling of the ankle. But he was then \u201cno longer totally disabled.\u201d His physician expressed the opinion that at that time he was laboring under a disability of only ten or twelve per cent, of total; that he was able to pursue his occupation to some extent; and that he \u201ccould resume his usual occupation in four or five months.\u201d This evidence was adduced by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The accident occurred on September 11th, 1933. PlaintifE testified (on February 7th, 1935) that, for a period of ten months thereafter, he was required to use, first, a crutch, and then a cane, and during that interval was unable to do any work at his calling, except \u201cone job.\u201d But this, he later explained, was in October, 1934, when he \u201cwas the contractor\u201d for the painting of a house. The work was done by hired painters under his supervision; he also painted the doors. He said that, during this ten months\u2019 period, he could do \u201cnothing\u201d himself; that he was \u201ctired out,\u201d and suffered from a swelling of the foot; and that \u201ceven to-day it is swollen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Pertinent to the basic inquiry is the testimony of plaintiff that, prior to the accident, he was a \u201cboss painter;\u201d he worked \u201cboth as boss painter, and individually.\u201d He was also in the general \u201cbuilding and contracting business,\u201d and built the apartment house wherein he lived. At the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>trial, lie superintended this apartment house for the owner. Concededly, he was then able to conduct the general painting and contracting business carried on before he sustained the injuries in question. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Thus it is that the evidence does not warrant the conclusion that plaintiff was rendered wholly incapable of pursuing the occupation followed at the time of the issuance of the policy. But, assuming the contrary, the testimony affords no basis for the finding that it is \u201cpermanent\u201d within the intendment of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">To entitle plaintiff to the disability benefits awarded him, there must needs be a concurrence of both elements; neither alone will suffice. In the interpretation of such policies, the point of inquiry is, as in the case of all other integrated contracts, the intention of the parties expressed or apparent in the writing itself. Subject to certain qualifications not relevant here, the standard of interpretation of an integrated agreement is the meaning that would be attached to the integration by \u201ca reasonably intelligent person acquainted with all operative usages and knowing all the circumstances prior to and contemporaneous with the making of the writing, other than oral statements by the parties of what they intended it to mean.\u201d <em>Corn Exchange National Bank and Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Taubel, </em>113 <em>N. J. L. </em>605; <em>Clott </em>v. <em>Prudential Insurance Co., </em>114 <em>Id. </em>18; <em>affirmed, </em>115 <em>Id. </em>114.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In the absence of restraining statutory provisions, such insurers have the right to limit their liability; and the judicial function of exposition is not to be extended to the imposition of terms not within the plain sense and meaning of the language employed to express the common intention. This interpretative authority must be kept within its legitimate bounds; its exercise is not to be a guise for the foisting of a new contract upon the parties. Such contracts are to be given a reasonable and sensible interpretation consonant with the apparent object of the parties. The natural and ordinary significance of words, both singly and in collocation, is adhered to, unless a special meaning is shown by the context or the circumstances, or the language, viewed as a whole, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>gives rise to uncertainty or ambiguity. <em>Zurich General Accident and Liability Insurance Co., Ltd., </em>v. <em>American Mutual Liability Insurance Company of Boston, </em>118 <em>N. J. L. </em>317.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The word \u201cpermanent\u201d has different senses; and, in the interpretation of contracts, it takes its meaning from associated words and the context. Here, it is plainly used in the sense of \u201ccontinuing or enduring in the same state, status, place or the like, without fundamental or marked change; not subject to fluctuation or alteration; fixed or intended to be fixed; lasting; abiding; staple.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (second edition). Antonyms are \u201ctemporary, transient.\u201d Such is its normal significance; and the giving to the word, as used in the stipulation under review, a less extensive scope and meaning would do violence to the plain letter and spirit of the contract. We discover nothing in the context or the circumstances to serve as the occasion for invoking any of the secondary rules of construction in aid of the application of the primary standard of interpretation. Of this more hereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The apposite principles were applied in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Van Kirk in <em>Ginell </em>v. <em>Prudential Insurance Co., </em>200 <em>N. Y. Supp. </em>261, adopted by the Court of Appeals on reversal of the judgment (237 <em>N. Y. </em>554; 143 <em>N. E. Rep. </em>740); and also in <em>Hawkins </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., </em>205 <em>Ia. </em>760; 218 <em>N. W. Rep. </em>313; <em>LeDuc </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em>65 <em>Q. L. R. </em>320; <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co., </em>8 <em>Tenn. App. </em>405; <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Blue, </em>222 <em>Ala. </em>665; 133 <em>So. Rep. </em>707; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. (La.), </em>142 <em>So. Rep. </em>262.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The cases of <em>Teitelbaum </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Accident Co., supra, </em>and <em>Nickolopulos </em>v. <em>The Equitable Life Assurance Society, </em>113 <em>N. J. L. </em>450, are not in point. They are not factually similar; and in the last cited case the contractual provisions were essentially different. Nor does the policy in suit contain, as in <em>Clott </em>v. <em>Prudential Insurance Co., supra, </em>a provision that continuous total disability for a given period raises a presumption of permanency entitling the insured to disability benefits until the termination of such incapacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>And the clause providing that the insurer \u201cshall have the right to require at any time, but not oftener than once a year, due proof of the continuance of the disability,\u201d as a prerequisite to continued liability for disability benefits, does not lead to a different result. This is a mere reservation of the right to terminate the insurer\u2019s liability for benefits where later developments demonstrate that the permanency testimonially categorized as a probability, upon which the law proceeds in the enforcement of the insurer\u2019s obligation to render such benefits, was but seeming and not real. This is plainly a reasonable exercise of the right of private contract, not violative of statute or public policy; and the courts have no alternative but to effectuate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">The evidence therefore fell far short of the standard of proof of the contractual liability sought to be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The judgment is accordingly reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded, costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
