The bureau awarded compensation, the amount of which is not now questioned; on the employer\u2019s appeal, the Court of Common Pleas affirmed; and the matter comes before us under this writ for a review on the law and the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-14\">As to the law: the petitioner was employed as a policeman, and was on police duty at the time of the alleged acei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>dent. He is therefore within the purview of section 1 of chapter 145 of the laws of 1913 <em>{Pamph. L., p. </em>230) as amended in 1927 <em>{Pamph. L., p. </em>239) and further amended in 1931 <em>{Pamph. L., p. </em>873). The important feature for present purposes, of the amendment of 19.31 is the addition of a clause reading \u201cwho may hereafter he injured in the line of duty.\u201d The question is suggested, that the clause is intended to bar cases not occurring \u201cin line of duty.\u201d The phrase is borrowed from pension legislation. Whether it means anything different from an accident arising out of and in the course of employment, need not be presently considered, as both parties frankly deal with the dispute as one to be settled in view of the Compensation act. The \u201caccident\u201d was this, as claimed: Petitioner, on patrol duty in the small hours of a windy gusty morning, felt the wind \u201cblow something into his eye.\u201d The chain of events thereafter was, a futile attempt to get the \u201csomething\u201d out, a visit to his doctor, who likewise tried to get it out, perhaps with only partial success; inflammation, hospitalization, operation, and in the end a sightless eye claimed to have resulted from an orbital abscess following infected conjunctivitis.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Granting the lodgment of foreign matter in the eye, and as to this there can be little or no dispute, we have the question whether this was an accident arising out of and in the course of the employment. That it was an accident, seems indubitable. That it arose in the course of the employment is equally clear. The real question, as usual, is whether it arose out of the employment. There is a well known contrariety of decision in cases of this class, some jurisdictions, particularly England, construing their statutes, with strictness, others, including Hew Jersey, inclining to a liberal view of injuries due to weather conditions where it fairly appears that the petitioner underwent an exposure to which the public generally was not subjected. The sunstroke case of <em>George </em>v. <em>Waldron, Inc., </em>111 <em>N. J. L. </em>4, is of this class, and is a decision of the Court of Errors and Appeals. Some stress is laid in the opinion in that case on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>the fact of working overtime, but in <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Woodbridge, </em>14 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>143, we have the case of a policeman injured by frostbite during his regular working hours in the early morning \u2014 -a pure case of severe weather conditions. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>3 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>924, a decision of the bureau, is a similar case. Prosecutor\u2019s counsel has shown commendable industry in collecting a number of outside cases similar on the facts, some of which we note here for convenience: viz., <em>Amys </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>5 <em>B. W. C. C. </em>117, servant driving threshing machine stung by wasp; <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Needham, </em>7 <em>Id. </em>471, servant sent to mail a letter slipped on a banana peel in the street; <em>Bellamy </em>v. <em>James Humphries, </em>6 <em>Id. </em>53, weaver at work got dust in his eye. The cases of <em>McCoy </em>v. <em>Screw Co., </em>180 <em>Mich. </em>454; 147 <em>N. W. Rep. </em>572, and <em>Voelz </em>v. <em>Industrial Com., </em>161 <em>Wisc. </em>240; 152 <em>N. W. Rep. </em>830, seem to turn on the questions of proximate cause of the ultimate damage. The cases cited are not controlling here, and we consider that they, as well as the Massachusetts case of Shaw <em>v. </em>Association, of the street railway conductor on the running board getting dust in his eye, run directly counter to the theory of decision obtaining in this state based in large part on the proposition that the statute is remedial, and therefore should be liberally construed. <em>Jersey City </em>v. <em>Borst, </em>90 <em>N. J. L. </em>454; <em>Combination Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Olser, </em>95 <em>Id. </em>43; 96 <em>Id. </em>544; <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Tidewater Building Co., </em>96 <em>Id. </em>103; <em>affirmed, </em>97 <em>Id. </em>324. The ease of <em>Zabriskie </em>v. <em>Erie Railroad Co., </em>86 <em>Id. </em>266, one of our earlier decisions, involved an accident to an employe crossing a public street, where, as we held, there was \u201cthe subjection of the employe to [the] danger by the conditions of his employment.\u201d The petitioner in the case at bar was not incidentally as in that ease, but permanently, subjected to weather conditions during his tour of duty; and foreign matter getting into one\u2019s eye because of a sudden gust of wind is not so uncommon an occurrence as to be beyond the pale of reasonable anticipation as a risk of employment, unavailable of course at common law as against the master, but expressly and designedly provided for by the statute. Assuming this as a premise, irritation, infection, and loss of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>sight are not in any way unreasonable as <em>sequela </em>of dirt in the eye. In a recent insurance ease the insured died because of pulling a hair out of one nostril and consequent infection. It does not seem to be seriously suggested that the infection resulted from petitioner\u2019s very natural and apparently careful attempt to remove the foreign matter with his handkerchief, while still on duty. He consulted a physician at once after going off duty, and after that, the responsibility was that of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">We conclude that neither in law nor fact did the bureau or the Pleas err in holding that petitioner was injured by an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment, and that the judgment of the Pleas under review should therefore be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
