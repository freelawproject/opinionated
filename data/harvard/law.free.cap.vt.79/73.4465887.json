and that defendant\u2019s motion to strike out the witness\u2019s direct testimony, as-far as it was offered as impeaching evidence, was properly denied.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b90-7\">In assumpsit for rent of a farm, the defendant testified that the farm was rented to his wife.

She-testified to what was done and said on several occasions when she saw Mr. Dodge. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney asked her the-following question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-8\">. Q. Now on any of these occasions when you saw Mr. Dodge and talked with him, or when you were present when, your mother was talking with him, did he make any claim that the farm was leased to his wife? A. No, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-9\">This question and answer were admitted subject to objection and exception by the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-10\">All the information given by the bill of exceptions about the bushel of potatoes is: \u201cIt appeared that the claim of the-plaintiff was barred by the Statute of Limitations, unless there had been a 'payment of one bushel of potatoes within six years before the commencement of this action. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that she with her daughter went to the-defendant\u2019s on only one occasion when the defendant was at home and procured a bushel of potatoes, that she claimed was-applied as a payment. The defendant\u2019s evidence tended to-show that no such payment by way of a bushel of potatoes was ever made and that the only time when the plaintiff and her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>daughter came to his house was during the absence of the defendant and his wife.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-5\"><em>John W.

The plaintiff claimed that a written lease was executed specifying rent at one hundred twenty-five dollars a year, and introduced in evidence what she claimed to be a copy of it. Regarding the existence of such a written contract there was a dispute, and the defendant claimed that the annual rent agreed on was one hundred dollars instead of one hundred twenty-five dollars. Before the defendant had introduced any evidence pertaining to the yearly value of the premises, the plaintiff was permitted to show, subject to exception, that during the term of the lease they were fairly worth one hundred twenty-five dollars. The evidence was admissible as showing the probable rent agreed on. 1 Wigmore Ev. \u00a7 392; <em>Kidder </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>34 Vt. 294; <em>Bedell </em>v. <em>Foss, </em>50 Vt. 94. In <em>Bradbury </em>v. <em>Dwight, </em>3 Met. 31, where the terms of a lost written contract for the sale of timber were in dispute, the value of the timber by the cord was received to show the probable terms of the. contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Exception 4. The plaintiff testified that a lease was drawn up and the defendant signed it, but that she had lost it. She did not give any evidence tending to show how she lost it, or that she.had made diligent search for it, she simply stated that she had lost it. The copy referred to under exception 3 was then produced by the plaintiff as a copy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>lost lease. The court found that the original lease had been lost and admitted the copy in evidence, to which defendant excepted on the ground (i) that a proper foundation for secondary evidence had not been laid; (2) that the paper produced did not, under the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony, purport to be a copy, because she claims that the original paper was signed by the defendant, while this one is not signed by either party. The record of the trial is referred to for a full statement bearing upon this exception, but it has not been furnished. Manifestly it was deemed necessary for that record to be before this Court to give a fair understanding of the ruling made. Otherwise the record would not thus have been made a part of the bill of exceptions. Since a part of this portion of the case is not before us, the questions there raised are not considered. The same is true regarding exceptions 11 and 14, and they are not considered. <em>Hathaway </em>v. <em>Goslant, </em>77 Vt. 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\">Exceptions 5 and 6. The defendant had testified that the contract renting the farm was made with his wife. The plaintiff testified that it was made with the defendant, and that the payments of rent were made by him, and that he transacted all the business concerning the place with the plaintiff and her daughters. Plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that at no1 time when defendant was transacting this business with her and her daughters, did he make any claim that the contract was not made with him, or that it was made with his wife; that the defendant himself transacted all business connected therewith and never before made any such claims in this respect as he made at the trial. Mrs. Vesta Drown, a daughter of the plaintiff, who claimed to have been present on an occasion referred to in the exceptions when Mrs. Walker, another daughter of the plaintiff, had conversation with the defendant about giving a note for the rent, was used as a witness by the plaintiff. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>\u25a0claimed to have heard only a part of the conversation. She was asked whether during any of the conversation which she 'heard, the defendant claimed that the place had been rented to 'his wife, or made any claim of that kind. Subject to exception, the witness answered that she heard nothing of the kind. \u25a0On the occasion to which the evidence relates, the matters under consideration pertained to the farm transaction and the .giving of a -note for rent. This being so, the fact that he then made no claim that his wife had leased the place, was inconsistent with his claim on the trial and admissible as tending \u25a0to contradict his testimony. <em>Seward </em>v. <em>Garlin, </em>33 Vt. 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Mrs. Walker was also called by the plaintiff. After testidying to what was said and done on several occasions when she \u25a0saw the defendant, she was asked whether on any of those -occasions when she talked with him, or was present when the plaintiff was talking with him, he made any claim that the farm was leased to his wife, to which the witness answered that 'he did not. Neither the subject-matter of the conversations \u25a0nor what was said on the different occasions to which refer\u2022ence was made, is shown by the exceptions. Hence we can-mot say that the evidence was not properly received.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Exception 18. It appeared that the plaintiff left a top \u2022carriage or wagon at the leased premises during the occupancy by the defendant and his family, and that the agent of the plaintiff took the nuts off. No claim was made in this case by the defendant because he did not have the use of the wagon. Subject to exception, the plaintiff was permitted to show as a \u2022matter of right by way of rebuttal, that the agent had some talk with the defendant about the use of the wagon. It is \u25a0argued by the defendant\u2019s counsel that this evidence was immaterial .and irrelevant. Assuming it to be so, merely showing that talk was had between them on that subject without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>showing what the talk was could not have been otherwise than harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Exception 19. Without showing the circumstances attending the occasions, the plaintiff was permitted, subject to exception, to ask a witness whether on these occasions (referring to the occasions when the witness, a daughter of the plaintiff, saw the defendant and asked him for rent) he ever made any claim that the rent was to be one hundred dollars a year, and whether he ever made any statement to the witness as to what the rent was to be. Both of these questions were answered in the negative. We understand the latter question to have reference to the same occasions as the former. On those occasions the business of the witness with the defendant pertained to the rent and was of such a nature that had he understood the agreed sum to be different from that claimed by the plaintiff, it would have been natural for him to assert it. Evidence of the fact that he did not do so was properly received. <em>Coolidge </em>v. Ayers, 77 Vt. 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Exception 20. The defendant claimed that by the contract, he was to have from the place fire-wood enough for his own family use, and he sought to be allowed a setoff by reason of his not having had the agreed amount. The plaintiff contended that this defence was manufactured for the purpose of the trial. She was permitted in rebuttal, subject to exception, to show by her daughter, Mrs. Walker, that on none of the occasions when she talked with the defendant on the subject matter of rent did he make any claim that he had not had firewood enough. The witness had previously given a full statement of the conversations had by her with the defendant on those occasions, and no reference to fire-wood was made by either of them. We think it was a circumstance proper for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>the jury to consider in deciding whether the defence was a manufactured one or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The plaintiff was permitted to show in rebuttal by a daughter of the defendant that she did not know at the time the defendant was on the leased premises that he claimed anything by reason of the defective pump, or insufficient amount of fire-wood, or on account of the damages accruing by laying of water pipes across the leased premises, or on account of the manure, or the breach of warranty as to the amount of hay the place produced. There had been no evidence introduced by the defendant as to what the witness knew about these things. The admission of this evidence has been argued as exception 22, but it does not appear that any exception was saved in connection therewith, and none is considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Exception 27. The plaintiff called one Munson as a witness, and inquired of him whether the defendant had a general reputation in his community for truth and veracity, to which the witness answered, \u201cWhy, in some respects he has.\u201d The witness was then asked whether that reputation for truth and veracity was on a par with men in general in that community. The witness answered \u201cTruth and veracity on any subject?\u201d To this the examining counsel said, \u201cYes, sir, general reputation for truth and veracity.\u201d The witness answered, \u201cI think he has.\u201d The witness was then asked whether that reputation was above or below par with men in general. He answered, \u201cIn the respect I have referred to, I think it is below.\u201d The examining counsel then said, \u201cWell, I m\u00e9an generally on that subject,\u201d and the witness answered, \u201cI would have to say below, if I was \u2014 .\u201d The witness was then interrupted by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">In cross-examination in response to questions asked by defendant\u2019s attorney, the witness testified that when he spoke in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>direct examination of defendant\u2019s general reputation \u201cin certain respects,\u201d he referred to his reputation \u201cin respect to finances,\u201d \u2014 that he was a man who did not meet his financial obligations as promptly as men in general, \u2014 \u201cI mean that his reputation is in making these debts \u2014 promises to pay more than what he knows he can.\u201d Thereupon the defendant offered to show by the same witness that there were no instances where the defendant had not paid dollar for dollar in the course of time for debts he had contracted, and to' the exclusion of the evidence, an exception was saved. It is a sufficient answer to this exception, that the examination in chief of the witness, fairly understood, had been confined to the defendant\u2019s general reputation and the offer was to show his actual character. Nor was it error to refuse to strike out the testimony of the witness as far as it was offered as impeaching evidence. It cannot be said that the testimony in chief had no tendency to show the general reputation of the defendant for truth and veracity. Consequently the plaintiff was entitled to have it considered by the jury for what it was worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\">Exception 28. The court charged the jury, \u201cThere is no claim here on the part of anyone who has testified, as I recollect, to the use of any language in the conducting of these negotiations that directly points to the fact of the contract being made with the wife. * * * We recall no evidence, that is, we recall no evidence of any conversation that was had in regard to it, that is inconsistent with the fact of the contract being made with the husband; but the whole thing is a matter for you, considering what was said, the subsequent conduct of the parties, all that happened in regard to it, to say who was really the party to the contract \u2014 what was the real understanding as to who was the party with whom Mrs. Green <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>was dealing.\u201d The defendant excepted to the statement made therein that there was no language testified to inconsistent with the trade being made with the husband. But the statement of the presiding judge in this respect was not in an unmodified form. It is very apparent from the language used that he was particular to give the jury only his memory of the matter, and that they must have so understood it; for the \u201cwhole thing\u201d was distinctly left to them to say, \u201cconsidering what was said, the subsequent conduct of the parties, and all that happened in regard to it.\u201d In such circumstances, even though the court overlooked some evidence, was mistaken, it cannot be assigned as error. <em>Dow </em>v. <em>School </em>District, 46 Vt. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Exception 29. It was conceded that the account was barred by the Statute of Limitations unless, as the plaintiff claimed by her evidence, a payment was made by way of a bushel of potatoes within the six years\u2019 time that renewed the account. With reference thereto the court charged the jury, in part,-that whether the claim was barred by the Statute of Limitations depended upon whether the sack of potatoes was delivered as claimed by the plaintiff and her witnesses; that the account was conceded to be barred unless that sack of potatoes was delivered upon it, and if they found \u201cthat the potatoes were delivered as claimed, then there is a live claim against this defendant,\u201d etc. The defendant excepted to the portion of the charge where the court said if the potatoes were delivered upon the account, as claimed by the plaintiff and her witnesses, it would make the account alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">It is argued that the mere delivery upon an account does not revive a debt nor amount to a payment that would renew it. If the potatoes were delivered by the defendant to the plaintiff upon her account as she claimed upon her evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>then they would constitute a proper item of credit to the defendant on the account, which is equivalent to a payment, and would prevent the operation of the statute. The charge in this respect was therefore without error. <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Woodward\u2019s Estate, </em>61 Vt. 571; <em>Bates v. Sabin, </em>64 Vt. 511; <em>George </em>v. <em>Vermont Farm Machine Co., </em>65 Vt. 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\">The instruction to the jury that on the question of the Statute of Limitation the burden of proof was with the defendant is in accordance with the settled law of this State, and the exception thereto is also unavailing. <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Courser, </em>69 Vt. 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">No other points are made in defendant\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
