The only evidence as to liability of the trustee was that of the said attorney, who testified that the trustee was an Illinois corporation, and the policy an Illinois contract, but that the insured\u2019s application therefor was made in this State, <em>ffeld, </em>that there was nothing in this to show that the said statement made to the plaintiff was false.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b82-11\">Since the liability of the trustee could be honestly questioned, and was the matter in dispute, the disposition of that question afforded a sufficient consideration for the settlement of the suit, though for a sum of money less than the judgment debt.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b82-12\">Since the record does not show that the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys had an unpaid bill against their client, their claim that they had a lien on said judgment for their services and disbursements in procuring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>it, and that said settlement could not he made in disregard of their rights, is not considered.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-5\">Debt on Judgment.

The Catholic Order of Foresters, in which the life, of defendant\u2019s son had been insured for defendant\u2019s benefit, was summoned as trustee.1 The settlement with plaintiff was effected by defendant\u2019s attorney without the knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and plaintiff claims that it was obtained by false and fraudulent representations. The representation made was that the plaintiff could get nothing by a contest, as the trustee could not be held. The only evidence touching the liability of the trustee was that of the attorney who made the representation, who- testified that the trustee was an Illinois company and the contract an Illinois contract, but that the application was made in this State. There is nothing in this to show that the statement made to the plaintiff was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Plaintiff contends further that the settlement was invalid for want of consideration. It is argued that the judgment was a liquidated and incontestible demand, and that there could be no binding settlement of it for less than the full amount. But the right to hold the trustee was the matter in dispute, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>that was a claim that could be honestly questioned, and the circumstances were such that the disposition of it afforded a consideration for the settlement made. The matter was in suit, and an adverse judgment on the trustee process would have subjected the plaintiff to the payment of costs already incurred, and a contest would have increased the costs involved. An unquestioned judgment may be satisfied by a payment of less than its amount, in the settlement of a disputed matter collateral to the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s attorneys also claim that they had a lien on the judgment for their services and disbursements, and that a settlement could not be made in disregard of their rights. It is not necessary to consider the legal aspect of this claim. It is assumed in argument that the attorneys had an unpaid bill against their client, but there is nothing in the case to show that they did have.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
