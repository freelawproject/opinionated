Defendants denied both said negligence and that the contract confined them to using the horses together. <em>Held </em>that, it appearing that defendants continued to work the surviving horse for a week after the other died, and that plaintiff claimed . that this was not under the terms of the original bailment, but that \u201cit was under a different arrangement, that the road was made passable, and that then the other horse remained there to work,\u201d it was. proper to allow plaintiff to show that after the accident defendants repaired the road leading to the dump, not as tending to show defendants\u2019 antecedent negligence, but only as bearing on the question why the surviving horse was allowed to remain and work singly.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b400-6\">The court properly refused to direct a verdict for defendants; because whether they had converted the horse, and if not, whether it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>injured through their negligence, were questions of fact for1 the jury under proper instruction.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b401-3\">Since, upon &gt; defendants excepting \u25a0 to certain improper statements made by plaintiff\u2019s counsel in argument to the jury, the matter was promptly and adequately dealt with by the court, and the statements fully retracted by the counsel, there is not sufficient cause for setting the verdict aside for improper argument.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-4\">Trover and Case.

Under the first count the plaintiff claimed that he let a pair of horses to the defendants to work together upon a dump-cart in operating their quarry, and that in violation of the contract they worked them separately and put them to1 a different use than the contract contemplated and thereby converted them to their own use. One of the horses was injured while working alone and died of his injuries. The jury found by a special verdict that the defendants were not guilty of trover, and therefore they must have failed to' find the contract claimed by the plaintiff. The verdict was that the defendants were guilty of negligence under <em>the </em>counts in case.'</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">1. The plaintiff was permitted to testify that directly after the accident he had a conversation with defendant Bout-well, who' directed him to take the horse to his, Boutwell\u2019s, stable for treatment. This evidence was objected to, and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel being inquired of by the presiding judge, said that it was offered to show that Boutwell appreciated the situation and considered the defendants liable for the injury\u2014 that they had not worked the horses together according to the agreement. The offered evidence was incompetent to show negligence on the part of the defendants in the use of the horse <em>(Sias </em>v. <em>Consolidated Lighting Co., </em>73 Vt. 35), and it is difficult to see how it could have borne upon the issue whether the contract was as the plaintiff claimed, namely, that the horses were to' be worked together and not separately. But pending the question the presiding judge asked the defendants\u2019 counsel if they made any question but that the horse died <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>from the injuries received, and he replied \u201cI do not want to concede \u2014 whether there was any negligence afterwards in the care of the horse I don\u2019t know. I suppose the first trouble with the horse was this accident\u201d * * * The judge then directed the witness to answer the question and for the evident purpose of showing whether or not any negligence Was imputable to the plaintiff in his treatment of the horse after the accident, or whether the horse died of his injuries. The statement made by the defendants\u2019 counsel before the question was answered, that he did not question but that the horse died of the injuries received, did not meet the court\u2019s inquiry. The answer was clearly admissible as bearing upon any claim that might be made that the horse died from the plaintiff\u2019s negligence. The exception taken cannot avail the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">2. The plaintiff was asked by his counsel what was the fair value of the horse, and he improperly answered: \u201cI valued him at $300.\u201d To the court\u2019s inquiry he made'the same answer, but upon the question being put the third time he seemed to understand what was a proper answer, and said, \u201cwell, between $275 and $300.\u201d It is inconceivable that the plaintiff\u2019s first two' answers could have harmed the defendants. That the jury were not influenced by them is shown by the fact that the verdict was for a much smaller sum than any estimate of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">3. The witness Smith testified that he owned and used the horses a year and sold them to the plaintiff. Upon being asked to state the value of the horse that died he answered: \u201cIf he was as sound as I should say he was without seeing him for a year or so and examining him closely, I should say from $200 to $225.\u201d He had previously stated that the plaintiff paid for the horses in part by working with them for him, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>that he occasionally met them upon the highway after the sale. There was no\u00a1 error in the admission of the evidence. The witness\u2019 estimate of value was predicated upon the horse remaining as sound as when he sold him. The remoteness of the times when the witness had last seen the horse only affected the weight of his testimony. Its admission or exclusion on that ground was discretionary with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">4. The plaintiff was permitted to show*, under the defendants\u2019 exception, that after the accident the defendants repaired the road that led fo the dump. The rule is- that repairs of a highway by the selectmen -of a town, after an accident, cannot 'be shown for the purpose of proving antecedent negligence. But here the evidence was offered not only to show that the defendants considered the roadway unsafe, but for the further purpose of showing, from the fact that the surviving horse remained there and worked a week after the other one 'died, that the contract was as the plaintiff claimed in respect to the horses being worked together.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The declaration was framed and the case was tried and submitted to the jury upon two grounds, \u2014 one, that by the defendants working the horse singly in violation of the contract, they converted him to their use, \u2014 the other, that he was injured through their .negligence. The defendants denied both claims. Upon the first ground, if made out, the contract ended with the injury to one horse, and the other was worked thereafter under a new agreement. The plaintiff\u2019s offer was, \u201cto show that it was under a different arrangement, \u2014 that the road was made passable, and that then the other horse remained there to work,\u201d and not under the original agreement. The court inquired of counsel if the evidence was offered to show that the road was soon repaired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>and that that was the reason why the other horse remained there to- work, and counsel replied that that was the purpose. It was admitted for that purpose only, and the court at the close of all the evidence instructed the jury that they were to consider it only as bearing upon the question why the horse was allowed to remain there and work singly for a week, and not as an admission by the defendants that the road needed repairing. With this restriction and instruction there was no \u2022error in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\">5. The court properly refused to- direct a verdict for the defendants for the reason that whether there had been a \u2022conversion of the horse by the defendants, and if not, whether it was injured through their negligence, were questions of fact for the jury under proper instructions. The court\u00bb carefully explained to the jury the two- grounds upon which the action was brought, and when they rendered their verdict, inquired upon what ground they found the defendants liable, whether for negligence or under the count in tro-ver, and the foreman replied, \u201cnegligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">6. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel said in his argument that the defendants did not care what became of the horse; that what they wanted was to get all they could out of him; that they didn\u2019t care whether he went .over the dump or not; that they had money enoug'h to- fight, etc. The remarks were improper, but upon exception being taken thereto- by the defendants\u2019 \u25a0counsel they were fully retracted and the matter was so ^promptly and adequately dealt with by the court that we think there is not sufficient cause for setting the verdict aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
