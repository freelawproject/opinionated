Heard at Chambers, April 22, 1905, on demurrer to the bill. <em>Rowell, </em>Chancellor. Demurrer sustained, bill adjudged insufficient and dismissed with costs, and case referred to a master to determine the injunction damages. The orator appealed.

That the defendant has, without right or authority, built a fence on a part of the line as he claims it, and threatens to complete the same along the entire length of the same, thereby cutting off a strip of her land several feet in width. There are allegations regarding a suit at law, but they add nothing to the equities of the bill. The prayer is for an injunction and \u201cfor such other and general relief as to the court shall seem meet.\u201d A temporary injunction was issued and dissolved, and the case comes before us on the demurrer incorporated into the defend* ant\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Passing over the question whether this is anything more than an injunction bill which should be dismissed upon the dissolution of the injunction prayed for, we take up the question whether equity has, under the allegations, jurisdiction to determine the controversy referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">In answering this question in the negative, it is sufficient to'say that the law court affords the oratrix a plain and adequate remedy. The existence of a dispute as to the boundary between independent proprietors of adjoining lands does not afford sufficient ground for the interposition of a court o\u00a3 equity to ascertain and fix such boundary. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Leslie, 90 </em>Ky. 642. Nor will equity interfere to determine the question of title involved. 1 Pom.
