S. 2698, providing that at any time thereafter, on the petition of either party, that court may make such further or additional orders concerning such care and custody as it may deem expedient, is that the county court retains the jurisdiction of that subject-matter which it acquired in the divorce proceeding; and a proceeding under that statute will be treated as a further proceeding in the original case, which should be brought forward on the docket.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b382-5\">Of courts having concurrent jurisdiction of the same subject-matter, the one that first acquires jurisdiction retains it to the end, to the exclusion of the others.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b382-6\">Where the father and mother of a minor child were divorced by the county court for the fault of the mother, but with no order as to the custody of the child, notwithstanding that a judgment, rendered in a habeas corpus proceeding subsequently brought before a judge of ,the Supreme Court, took the custody of the child from the mother and gave it to the father, and ordered that \u201cthese proceedings shall stand open for such further action as may hereafter be adjudged by this Court to be right and proper in relation to the custody of said minor,\u201d said county court had jurisdiction of a petition thereafter brought, under Y.

These allegations are not denied by the plea in abatement, hence they stand admitted. The plea sets forth in substance that habeas corpus proceedings were brought before a judge of the Supreme Court to determine the same questions involved in this case, a hearing had and a judgment rendered therein, and that by said judgment those proceedings are still pending before said judge with full and complete jurisdiction in the premises, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">This plea was properly adjudged insufficient on demurrer; The court by which the divorce was granted, at the time of granting\u2019 it, had the power to make such order or decree concerning the care, custody and maintenance of the minor child as the circumstances required, and by statute it retained jurisdiction of this subject-matter and could at any time thereafter, on petition of either party, annul, vary or modify the order \u00e1o made, or make such other or further decree respecting the care, custody and maintenance of the child as it might deem expedient.

If this be true, \u2014 a question we do not decide, \u2014 it will not avail the petitionee in this case; for it is a well established rule that in cases of concurrent jurisdiction the court first acquiring it will retain it to the end, to the exclusion of other tribunals. <em>Bank of Bellows Falls </em>v. <em>The Rutland and Burlington R.
