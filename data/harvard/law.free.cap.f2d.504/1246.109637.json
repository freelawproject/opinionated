Severe malnutrition causes permanent brain damage,' stunted physical growth, and increased susceptibility to disease.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-22\">Senator Mondale pointed out to the Senate in 1972 that in Mississippi, the first state to aggressively implement EPSDT, \u201cexamination of 1,178 youngsters revealed 1,301 \u2018medical abnormalities.\u2019 \u201d These included 305 cases of multiple cavities, 241 cases of anemia, 97 cases of faulty vision, 217 cases of enlarged tonsils, and significant numbers of hernia, intestinal parasites and poor hearing cases.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>Most childhood handicaps can be prevented or cured or corrected if detected early enough.

They commence by providing that \u201c[a] State plan for medical assistance under Title XIX of the Social Security Act <em>must </em>[sjpecify that at least the first five items of medical and remedial care and services, set forth in paragraph (b)(1) through (5) of this section, <em>will be provided </em>to the categorically needy.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1312-13\">Paragraph (b) (4) (ii), which provides for EPSDT,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> falls within the mandatory category. Paragraph (a)(3) then states that any plan must provide, with respect to the item of care set forth in paragraph (b) (4) (ii), four areas of coverage.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>The regulations seek \u201cto assure that individuals under 21 years of age who are eligible for medical assistance may receive the services of such facilities . \u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and \u201cassuring that such individuals are informed of such services. . \u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> States are required to enter into \u201cagreements to assure maximum utilization of existing screening, diagnostic, and treatment services provided by other public and voluntary agencies. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> State plans are to assure that the necessary services \u201cwill be available to all eligible individuals under 21 years of age. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">The final regulation guidelines for the EPSDT program were issued by HEW on June 28, 1973, as part of the Medical Assistance Manual, Part 5, Sections 5-70-00 et seq. (MSA-PRG-21). The guidelines begin with the following introduction :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-8\">The 1967 amendments to title XIX of the Social Security Act added a requirement to Medicaid that was intended to direct attention to the importance of preventive health services and early detection and treatment of disease in children eligible for medical assistance. This corresponded to a similar amendment to title V of the Act. Through this amendment <em>Congress intended to require States to take aggressive steps </em>to screen, diagnose and treat children with health problems. Congress was concerned about the variations from State to State in the rates of children treated for handicapping conditions and health problems that could lead to chronic illness and disability. Senate and House Committee reports emphasized the need for extending outreach efforts to create awareness of existing health care services, to stimulate the use of these services, and to make services available so that young people can receive medical care before health problems become chronic and irreversible damage occurs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1313-13\">MSA-PRG-21, \u00a7 5-70-20(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-14\">There follows comprehensive descriptions of what is required in the nature of case finding, screening, diagnosis and treatment. Th\u00e9 guidelines include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-15\">The State agency must have an outreach program to inform AFDC families and other eligible individuals about the screening program and to encourage them to take advantage of this service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-16\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2T\">The State agency must seek out and develop agreements with facilities and practitioners throughout the State that can provide screening and diagnostic services for early casefinding purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-18\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-19\">To actively seek out eligible individuals for the EPSDT program, the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>agency should develop procedures: (a) to inform parents that these services are available for their children, and when and where they are provided ; (b) to make sure that they understand the nature and purpose of the screening program; (c) to enlist the help of other community agencies in casefinding activities; and (d) to assure that families are helped, if they need such assistance, to obtain transportation to the screening center and for diagnostic studies and treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5-70-20(B) (6), (B)(7), (D)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">Congress, as part of the Social Security Amendments of 1972, enacted a penalty for failure to provide child health screening services under Medicaid:<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-1\">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the amount payable to any State under this part for quarters in a fiscal year shall with respect to quarters in fiscal years beginning after June 30, 1974, be reduced by 1 per centum ... of such amount if such State fails to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1314-6\">(1) inform all families in the State receiving aid to families with dependent children under the plan of the State approved under this part of the availability of child health screening services under the plan of such State approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1314-7\">(2) provide or arrange for the provision of such screening services in all cases where they are requested, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1314-8\">(3) arrange for (directly or through referral to appropriate agencies, organizations, or individuals) corrective treatment the need for which is disclosed by such child health screening services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1314-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-10\">The mandatory obligation upon each participating state to aggressively notify, seek out and screen persons under 21 in order to detect health problems and to pursue those problems with the needed treatment is made unambiguously clear by the 1967 act and by the interpretative regulations and guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-12\">Indiana is a participating state. On May 17, 1973, defendant Wayne A. Stanton, administrator of the Indiana Department of Public Welfare, issued that department\u2019s General Administrative DPW Bulletin No. 70, in which he advised all of the state\u2019s 92 county departments of public welfare:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1314-13\">An approved plan for early and periodic screening, diagnosis and treatment of those persons under age 21 was to have been in effect as of February, 1972. Indiana did not meet that deadline. However it is now mandatory that immediate steps be taken to implement this Federal law in order to satisfy the question of compliance that has been repeatedly raised by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare regarding this matter ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1314-14\">The implementation will be gradual. Eight County Departments will begin operation of the plan during <em>May, 1973. </em>The remaining County Departments will move into the process on a planned basis until the program is in effect in all 92 County Departments by around <em>January 1, 1974. </em>[Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1314-15\">Subsequently, letters were sent to Medicaid recipients which advised that caseworkers would visit the recipient and that \u201cthe caseworkers will want to know if you feel that <em>your </em>children have any health problems.\u201d Medicaid providers were advised that caseworkers would give each recipient a form \u201cwith instructions to contact their choice of appropriate Medicaid providers, should a health problem be reported by the recipient, observed by the caseworker, or should the recipient request any type of medical service . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-16\">In defendants\u2019 reply brief, they summarize the nature of Indiana\u2019s compliance with EPSDT:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1314-17\">Any of the eligible children in this state can secure all of the requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>services merely by requesting them from their local health provider . [Recipients] need merely take their children to the health providers of their choice and obtain for their children the required services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A09U\">On March 22, 1974, the district court in its memorandum opinion granting in part plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1315-5\">A careful reading of the original and supplemental materials filed in this case indicates, in a clear and convincing fashion, that little, if any, headway has been made by the State as far as the implementation of the EPSDT program is concerned. From the information supplied by the Lake County Welfare Department as well as that supplied by the state, it appears to a certainty that the welfare procedures are nearly the same as they were last year. No special training is required for the caseworkers and there have been only minimal attempts to communicate this program to either the caseworkers or to the ultimate recipients. A few letters and directives, clothed in bureaucratic prose, have been issued to the local units of the Department of Public Welfare of Indiana. In fact, there is no evidence of a comprehensive EPSDT program, nor even any semblance of any screening program however minimal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">The court enjoined defendants \u201cfrom continuing to administer EPSDT in violation of 42 U.S.C. Section 1396d (a)(4)(B) and the regulations established thereunder\u201d and ordered defendants to have a program meeting the minimum standards of, and in substantial compliance with, the regulations and guidelines, \u201cin effect in every county in Indiana by July 1, 1974.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-7\">There is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-8\">Indiana\u2019s somewhat casual approach to EPSDT hardly conforms to the aggressive search for early detection of child health problems envisaged by Congress. It is difficult enough to activate the average affluent adult to seek medical assistance until he is virtually laid low. It is utterly beyond belief to expect that children of needy parents will volunteer themselves or that their parents will vol-jujntarily deliver them to the providers of health services for early medical screening and diagnosis. By the time an Indiana child is brought for treatment it may too often be on a stretcher. This is hardly the goal of \u201cearly and periodic screening and diagnosis.\u201d EPSDT programs must be brought to the recipients; the recipients will not ordinarily go to the programs until it is too late to accomplish the congressional purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-10\">Defendants have argued that even if Indiana\u2019s EPSDT program is not in compliance with federal requirements, the sole remedy is reduction of federal payments to the state in accordance with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 603(g) \u201cwith respect to quarters in fiscal years beginning after June 30, 1974.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-11\">Declaratory and injunctive relief at the behest of \u201cthose individuals most directly affected by the administration of [a] program\u201d are available \u201cshould the State not develop a conforming plan within a reasonable period of time\u201d when using federal funds.
