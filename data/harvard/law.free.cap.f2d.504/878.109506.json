Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5th Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b942-23\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b942-24\">Appellant Sawyer was convicted by a jury of armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d). On appeal he challenges the admissibility of (i) his oral confession made after refusing to sign Miranda waiver forms and (ii) photographs that he asserts may have suggested to the jury that he had a prior criminal record. We find that appellant\u2019s challenges do not rise to the level of reversible error and, therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-27\">Appellant argues that the mere failure to sign a \u201cMiranda\u201d waiver form compels the conclusion that the subsequent statements were the product of involuntary interrogation. But this Court has repeatedly rejected the notion that a confession is per se inadmissible merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>because the defendant declines to sign the Miranda form. United States v. McDaniel, 5 Cir., 1972, 463 F.2d 129, cert. den., 413 U.S. 919, 93 S.Ct. 3046, 37 L.Ed.2d 1041; United States v. Devall, 5 Cir., 1972, 462 F.2d 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">There is nothing in the circumstances surrounding appellant\u2019s interview to indicate that his statements to the police regarding his participation in numerous robberies including that of the Biscayne Federal Savings and Loan charged here were not voluntarily given despite the fact that he said he was not going to \u201csign anything.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant was repeatedly given his warnings and, immediately before he made this statement, he read a Miranda card and said that he understood his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\"> Appellant next argues that a collection of photos from which his own picture was selected by the robbery witnesses should not have been admitted at the trial because the photos clearly suggested to the jury that appellant had a prior criminal record. Despite the fact that all identifying marks and police numbers were \u201ccropped\u201d from the pictures, we reject the Government\u2019s argument that it would be mere idle guessing on the part of the jury to draw this conclusion because pictures are clearly mugshots. But we find that in view of the identification of Sawyer by three witnesses later in a lineup and in court\u2014 one of whom had previously known him \u2014plus his own incriminating statement, the admission of the photographs was harmless error. Chapman v. California, 1967, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-17\">. Sawyer\u2019s statement, as introduced at the trial was explicit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-18\">\u201cQ.
