(In re Russo (9th Cir. 1971) 448 F.2d 369; <em>cf. </em>Ullmann v. United States (1956) 350 U.S. 422 [434], 76 S.Ct. 497, 100 L.Ed. 511.)\u201d Bursey v. United States (9th Cir. 1972), 466 F.2d 1059, 1073.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-17\">The immunity application in this case, together with its supporting documents, <em>prima, facie </em>complies with the statutory authority pursuant to which immunity was sought. The application contains the necessary request by the United States Attorney and approval by an Assistant Attorney General, who in this instance was designated by 28 C.F. R. \u00a7 0.175(a) as the person having authority thus conferred. We judicially notice that Henry E. Petersen, whose name appears on the authorization letter, was the Assistant Attorney General then in charge of the Criminal Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-18\">Adversary procedure is- not a part of the legislative scheme in connection with the district court\u2019s performance of its limited duties in granting or denying the application for immunity. Adversary process does not commence until the grand jury seeks an order compelling the witness to respond to questions that he or she has refused to answer after a prior grant of immunity. (Bursey v. United States, <em>supra, </em>466 F.2d at 1073-1075. <em>Cf. </em>Beverly v. United States (5th Cir. 1972), 468 F.2d 732, 746-747.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-19\">The petition for writ of mandate is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-14\">. The Government\u2019s reliance (both before the district court and before us) on Licata v. United States (9th Cir. 1970), 429 F.2d 1177, is misplaced. <em>Licata </em>was vacated by the Supreme Court. (Licata v. United States (1970), 400 U.S. 938, 91 S.Ct. 239, 27 L.Ed.2d 243.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
