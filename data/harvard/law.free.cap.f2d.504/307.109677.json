Kennedy Space Center, Florida, has spread far beyond the launch pad and into the exec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>utive bureaucracy, the halls of Congress, and several federal courtrooms. In other forums, the great issues of national labor policy and government contracting policy have been debated and determined in their ways. Ours is the more mundane, but nonetheless complex, task of defining the obligations of a successor employer to arbitrate claims submitted by a union on behalf of incumbent employees of a predecessor employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">From March, 1964, until April 1, 1971, Ti\u2019ans Woi\u2019ld Airlines, Inc. (TWA) performed \u201cinstallation support services\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at Kennedy Space Center under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The approximately 1100 nonsupervisory personnel employed by TWA were represented in collective bargaining by IA-MAW. A collective bargaining agreement between TWA and IAMAW,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> entered into on January 28, 1970, was in force at the time TWA\u2019s contract with NASA expired, and was to \u201cremain in full force and effect to and including December 31, 1971.\u201d Two subordinate IAMAW units, District Lodge 142 and Local Lodge 773, helped administer the TWA-IAMAW agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">In June, 1970, NASA invited bids for performance of the Kennedy Space Center installation support services duties for a one-year period commencing February 1, 1971 (performance to begin April 1, 1971), with option for NASA to extend the contract for four successive one-year periods. TWA, Boeing, and five other companies submitted proposals. Four of the offerors, including TWA, based their computations of labor costs on the wage rates and fringe benefits established by the existing TWA-IAMAW collective bargaining contract. Boeing based its computation of labor costs on the wage rates and fringe benefits provided under its own existing collective bargaining agreement with IAMAW, which covered some 287 Kennedy Space Center employees performing mission support services known as \u201chardware contracts\u201d on the Saturn V launch vehicle. The wages and benefits fixed by the Boeing-IAMAW agreement were substantially below those specified in the TWA-IAMAW agreement,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the Boeing-IAMAW agreement was administered through different local subordinates, District Lodge 166 and Local Lodge 2061.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">In November, 1970, NASA announced that Boeing had been selected to perform the installation support services at Kennedy Space Center. Although both TWA and IAMAW vigorously protested NASA\u2019s decision,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Boeing began per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>formance of the contract on April 1, 1971, with a work force of 981,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of whom 380 were TWA incumbents. On this appeal the parties have debated at length the reasons why a greater percentage of incumbents were not hired by Boeing. The district court\u2019s opinion provides a partial summary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">When Boeing first learned that it would get the contract for support services commencing April 1, 1971, it delivered over 1,000 job application forms to TWA\u2019s Industrial Relations office for dissemination to TWA employees. Boeing offered evidence that I AM [AW] officials \u2014 International and local \u2014 had discouraged TWA support service employees from seeking employment with Boeing and for that reason by April, 1971, of the approximately 1,000 Boeing employees hired to perform under the support .services contract less than 400 were formerly TWA employees. At first in the course of this suit the defendants contested that position . . . and contended there was discrimination by Boeing in its hiring. However, in its brief filed July 3, 1972, IAM[AW] withdrew for the purposes of this case that contention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Boeing Co. v. International Association of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, M.D.Fla.1972, 351 F.Supp. 813, 815. IA-MAW emphasizes here, however, that the TWA employees were dissatisfied with the wages and benefits offered under the Boeing contract and that the environment surrounding Boeing\u2019s takeover was highly unsettled. In particular the union argues that Boeing and NASA had not yet entered into a contract, and a TWA protest to the contract award was still pending, as of early February, 1971, so that it would have been premature for the incumbent work force to commit itself to a contractor whose selection was still in doubt. In any case, by February 19, 1971, when an IAMAW spokesman told Boeing representatives that the union would cooperate in distributing Boeing employment applications to TWA incumbents and in transmitting completed applications to Boeing, Boeing had extended offers to and received acceptances from 521 non-incumbents, more than half its workforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">When Boeing took over performance of the installation support services work on April 1, 1971, the TWA incumbents hired by Boeing reported for work as new employees with no seniority and at reduced wages. Boeing gave each of the IAMAW-represented employees a copy of the Boeing-IAMAW agreement and a notice stating that IAMAW was its employees\u2019 representative and that terms of employment were governed by the Boeing-IAMAW agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">On April 26, 1971, IAMAW advised Boeing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-12\">[i]n accordance with Article XI (b)(5) of the [TWA-IAMAW] collective bargaining agreement [it was] submitting the following grievance relating to matters general in character:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-13\">1. The Boeing action failed to retain in employment as of April 1, 1971, at least 602 members of the incumbent work force performing installation support services work at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and this failure constitutes a reduction in force out of seniority order, and/or a dismissal without just cause and without compliance with the procedures requisite to that action, in violation of the IAMAW/TWA agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>2. The Boeing Company failed and fails to accord to the members of the incumbent work force whom it did retain in employment on April 1, 1971, the seniority that each employee had as of April 1, 1971, but instead treats them as new hires with zero seniority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\">3. The Boeing Company failed as of April 1, 1971 and fails, to observe the wages, other benefits, and other employment terms of the TWA/IAMAW agreement as it applies to the performance of installation support service work at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and which governs for its duration the wages, hours and other employment terms at the Kennedy Space Center.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Boeing declined to consider the merits of the grievances, stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">As of April 1, 1971, the date on which Boeing assumed its responsibilities under the Installation Support Services contract, a substantial majority of the bargaining unit employees were from sources other than Trans World Airlines. Therefore, Boeing is of the opinion that it is not a successor to the TWA/IAM[AW] agreement. Furthermore, even if the majority of the Boeing work force was made up of former TWA employees, it is the position of the Boeing Company that a finding of successorship would be precluded because of the substantial change in the employing industry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">Consistent with our position that the contract on which,the purported grievances are based has no application to the Boeing Company or any of its operations or activities, we cannot and do not recognize your letter of April 26, 1971, as a grievance and decline to respond to it as such.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">During the pendency of this dispute IAMAW informed Boeing that, while it would continue to press for adoption of the TWA-IAMAW agreement, it would utilize the dues deduction authorization cards of Local Lodge 2061 (the IAMAW local affiliated with Boeing) until the issue was resolved. Boeing deducted union dues in accordance with the individual authorizations; instead of transmitting the checked-off dues to Local 2061 pursuant to the authorization, however, Boeing deposited the collected dues in an escrow fund on the ground that IAMAW had refused to-recognize the Boeing-IA-MAW collective bargaining agreement.'</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">On May 10, 1971, Boeing filed this suit under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, against IAMAW in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, seeking a declaratory judgment that Boeing \u201cis not a successor to and is not bound by the collective bargaining agreement executed by the defendant and Trans World Airlines.\u201d IAMAW filed a counter-claim seeking a declaration that Boeing is bound by the terms of the TWA-IAMAW agreement and an order compelling Boeing to arbitrate the grievances submitted by IAMAW, and an order requiring Boeing to remit the dues which the employees had authorized the company to check-off from their wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">Upon cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court declared that \u201cBoeing is not a successor and is not bound\u201d by the TWA-IAMAW collective bargaining agreement, and declined to order Boeing to arbitrate the grievances submitted under that agreement. The District Court did, however, require Boeing to remit the dues previously withheld and escrowed. IAMAW appeals the declaration that Boeing is not a successor; Boeing cross-appeals the order that it turn over the checked-off dues. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">SUCCESSORSHIP</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">Had 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 353(c) been in effect at the time when the events giving rise to this controversy occurred, this matter would have been much simpler of resolution. That section provides in effect that a government service contractor, such as Boeing, which succeeds to a contract under which it furnishes substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>tially the same services as its predecessor, shall not pay its employees less than its predecessor paid under its collective bargaining agreement, unless such terms are found by the Secretary of Labor to be substantially at variance with the going rate in the locality.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 353(c) was not in effect at the time of the events which gave rise to this controversy, however; it was added to the Service Contract Act of 1965, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 351 et seq., by amendment in 1972, 86 Stat. 789.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor does \u00a7 353(c) apply retroactively. We are thus left to the guidance and direction of the developing case law regarding successorship controversies.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Before approaching these cases we note that we cannot rest upon the formal concepts of merger, successorship, or alter egoism developed in fields alien to labor law. In the sprawling workaday world of employer-employee relationships we go to the plant to find human continuity and pragmatic identity of enterprise; we are not pinned by the precisions and precedents fixed and formulated in the law of taxation, securities, or real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</p>\n<p id=\"A_g\">The district court reasoned in this case, 351 F.Supp. 813, 816, that NLRB v. Burns Int\u2019l Security Servs. Inc., 1972, 406 U.S. 272, 92 S.Ct. 1571, 32 L.Ed.2d 61, had established that an employer will not be bound as a successor to arbitrate under its predecessor\u2019s labor contract unless it has employed a majority of its predecessor\u2019s personnel; since Boeing did not meet that standard, the district court determined that Boeing was not bound to arbitrate. While we ultimately conclude as well that IAMAW had made out an insufficient case on the law here, we are concerned that the district court has misapprehended <em>Burns. </em>Thus, with the. additional benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Howard Johnson Co. v. Detroit Local Joint Exec. Bd., 1974, 417 U.S. 249, 94 S.Ct. 2236, 41 L.Ed.2d 46, which was undecided at the time of the district court\u2019s opinion, we proceed at some length to elaborate our understanding of the relevant case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">The course through the cases on which the parties dispatch us leads over ground both dense and largely uncharted. This case requires the resolution of difficult issues regarding the contractual freedom and expectations of employers and the expectations and reliance of employees. We determine our conclusions by reference to landmarks set by the Supreme Court; but its positions have been too few to survey the entire landscape, and we explore here a largely shadowed spot.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">The reference points which the Supreme Court has established lie chiefly in three cases: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, 1964, 376 U.S. 543, 84 S.Ct. 909, 11 L.Ed.2d 898; <em>Burns, </em>supra; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>and <em>Howard Johnson, supra. </em>These three cases not only offer three different perspectives on the successorship problem, but at times they seem to illuminate a different background. Thus, it is necessary to consider them individually and chronologically in order to determine the coordinates of established principles. Indeed, as the Supreme Court has coun-selled, \u201cIn our development of the federal common law [in this area] we must necessarily proceed cautiously, in the traditional ease-by-ease approach of the common law.\u201d <em>Howard Johnson, </em>417 U.S. at 256, 94 S.Ct. at 2240, 41 L.Ed. 2d at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The primary case on which IAMAW relies, and which Boeing seeks to distinguish, is <em>Wiley, supra, </em>in which the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe disappearance by merger of a corporate employer which has entered into a collective bargaining agreement with a union does not automatically terminate all rights of the employees covered by the agreement, and that, in appropriate circumstances, . the successor employer may be required to arbitrate with the union under the agreement.\u201d 376 U.S. at 548, 84 S.Ct. at 914, 11 L.Ed.2d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In <em>Wiley </em>a small publishing house, In-terscience, with 80 employees, 40 of whom were union-represented, merged into Wiley, a firm with larger assets and commitments and a premerger total of about 300 employees. Interscience ceased to exist in its own right after the merger, and almost all <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the 40 union-represented employees of Interscience stayed on with Wiley and were mingled with the existing work force at Wiley\u2019s plant, where they pursued the same kind of work as before. The employees\u2019 union and Wiley were unable to agree on the effect of the merger on the existing collective bargaining agreement between Interscience and the union. The union asserted grievances concerning \u201cconditions of employment typically covered by collective bargaining agreements and submitted to arbitration if other grievance procedures fail. Specific provision for each of them [was] made in the In-terscience agreement.\u201d 376 U.S. at 554, 84 S.Ct. at 916, 11 L.Ed.2d at 907. Wiley refused to arbitrate, however, protesting its freedom from a contract which it had not joined. Ultimately the union sued under \u00a7 301 to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">The Supreme Court recognized that ordinary contract law would not bind Wiley to the Interscience agreement. Under \u00a7 301, however, the controlling principles were held to be a matter of federal law, to be developed from the policies embedded in the \u201cnational labor laws.\u201d <em>See </em>Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, 1957, 353 U.S. 448, 77 S. Ct. 912, 1 L.Ed.2d 972. The Court rested its conclusions regarding the requirement of arbitration on two such policies. First:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-12\">[e]mployees, and the union which represents them, ordinarily do not take part in negotiations leading to a change in corporate ownership. The negotiations will ordinarily not concern the well-being of the employees, whose advantage or disadvantage, potentially great, will inevitably be incidental to the main considerations. The objectives of national labor policy, reflected in established principles of federal law, require that the rightful prerog\u00e1tive of owners independently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>to rearrange their business and even eliminate themselves as employers be balanced by some protection to the employees from a sudden change in the employment relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">376 U.S. at 549, 84 S.Ct. at 914, 11 L.Ed.2d at 904. Second:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">The transition from one corporate organization to another will in most cases be eased and industrial strife avoided if employees\u2019 claims continue to be resolved by arbitration rather than by \u201cthe relative strength of the contending forces,\u201d [United Steelworkers v.] Warrior &amp; Gulf [Navigation Co., 1960], 363 U.S. [574,] at 580, 80 S.Ct. 1347, at 1352, 4 L.Ed.2d [1409,] 1416.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">The preference of national labor policy for arbitration as a substitute for tests of strength between contending forces could be overcome only if other considerations compellingly so demanded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Furthermore, the Court considered that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADq\">a collective bargaining agreement is not an ordinary contract. \u201c. [I]t is a generalized code to govern a myriad of cases which the draftsmen cannot wholly anticipate The collective agreement covers the whole employment relationship. It calls into being a new common law\u2014 the common law of a particular industry or of a particular plant.\u201d Warrior &amp; Gulf, <em>supra, </em>363 U.S. at 578-579, 80 S.Ct. at 1351, 4 L.Ed.2d [at 1415]. Central to the peculiar status and function of a collective bargaining agreement is the fact, dictated both by circumstance and by the requirements of the National Labor Relations Act, that it is not in any real sense the simple product of a consensual relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">376 U.S. at 550, 84 S.Ct. at 914, 11 L.Ed.2d at 905. \u201cTherefore,\u201d the Court concluded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-14\">although the duty to arbitrate . must be founded on a contract, the impressive policy considerations favoring arbitration are not wholly overborne by the fact that Wiley did not sign the contract being construed. This case cannot readily be assimilated to the category of those in which there is no contract whatever, or none which is reasonably related to the party sought to be obligated. There was a contract, and Interscience, Wiley\u2019s predecessor, was party to it. We thus find Wiley\u2019s obligation to arbitrate this dispute in the Inter-science contract construed in the context of a national labor policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-16\">376 U.S. at 550-551, 84 S.Ct. at 915, 11 L.Ed.2d at 905 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-17\">Consonant with its reasoning, the Court limited application of its holding to cases in which there was \u201csubstantial continuity of identity in the business enterprise before and after a change,\u201d so that the duty to arbitrate was not \u201csomething imposed from without, not reasonably to be found in the particular bargaining agreement and the acts of the parties involved.\u201d 376 U.S. at 551, 84 S.Ct. at 915, 11 L.Ed.2d at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-18\">The broad principle of employee protection against sudden changes in the employment relationship which the Court first sketched in <em>Wiley </em>is not, however, the complete picture. Most significantly, the Supreme Court has somewhat shifted its view of the policy framework on which the <em>Wiley </em>result hung, as evidenced by its opinion in NLRB v. Burns Int\u2019l Security Servs., Inc., <em>supra, </em>on which Boeing relies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-19\"><em>Burns </em>involved an NLRB action to enforce an order requiring a successor employer (1) to recognize and bargain with the union representing its predecessor employer\u2019s employees, and (2) to adhere to the collective bargaining agreement which had bound the predecessor employer. The predecessor-successor relationship was of the service contract type involved in the case at bar: on submitting the best bid in an annual rebidding, Burns was chosen to replace its predecessor, Wackenhut, as the supplier of plant protection services for the Lockheed Aircraft Service Co. at a California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>airport. When Burns took over the security operation, employing 42 workers, 27 of whom had been with Wackenhut in identical jobs, Burns refused to recognize the United Plant Guard Workers of America (UPG), which had been certified four months earlier as the exclusive bargaining representative of Wacken-hut\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">The Court\u2019s opinion, which turned \u201cto a great extent on the precise facts involved here,\u201d 406 U.S. at 274, 92 S.Ct. at 1575, 32 L.Ed.2d at 65 was in two parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">First, the Court held, 5 to 4, that, assuming the appropriateness of the bargaining unit,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">it was not unreasonable for the Board to conclude that the union certified to represent all employees in the unit still represented a majority of the employees and that Burns could not reasonably have entertained a good-faith doubt about that fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">406 U.S. at 278, 92 S.Ct. at 1577, 32 L. Ed.2d at 68. Four Justices dissented to this holding on the grounds that a continuing union majority had not been shown with mathematical certainty and that notions of suceessorship such as underlay <em>Wiley </em>ought not apply even to require the union recognition here, given the nature of the predecessor-successor relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Second, the Court held unanimously that Burns was not bound to observe the substantive terms of the Wackenhut-UPG agreement. Stressing the fundamentally of the freedom of contract principle in the national labor laws, <em>see generally </em>Howard K. Porter Co. v. NLRB, 1970, 397 U.S. 99, 90 S.Ct. 821, 25 L.Ed.2d 146, the Court emphasized that the existence of a duty to bargain did not enable the Board to bind either side to agree to any particular term of contract. The Board argued that the interests in the \u201cpeaceful settlement of industrial conflicts and \u2018protection [of] the employees [against] a sudden change in the employment relationship\u2019 \u201d 406 U.S. at 285, 92 S.Ct. at 1581, 32 L.Ed.2d at 72, recognized in <em>Wiley </em>\u201crequire that Burns be treated under the collective-bargaining contract exactly as Wackenhut would have been if it had continued protecting the Lockheed plant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court found the <em>Wiley </em>case distinguishable, however, on two grounds.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">First, <em>Wiley </em>held only that the agreement to arbitrate survived the merger there, and left for the arbitrator to decide, subject to judicial review, the extent to which the successor employer was bound by the remaining provisions of the predecessor\u2019s collective bargaining agreement. In <em>Burns, </em>however, arbitration was not in issue, and the interest in labor stability was insufficiently substantial to outweigh the policy against governmental imposition of specific contract terms. Second, the <em>Burns </em>Court distinguished the predecessor-successor relationship in the <em>Burns </em>annual rebidding situation from that in <em>Wiley, </em>which involved</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-12\">a merger occurring against a background of state law that embodied the general rule that in merger situations the surviving corporation is liable for the obligations of the disappearing corporation. . . . Here there was no merger or sale of assets, and there were no dealings whatsoever between Wackenhut and Burns. On the contrary, they were competitors for the same work, each bidding for the service contract at Lockheed. Burns purchased nothing from Wackenhut and became liable for none of its fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>nancial obligations. Burns merely hired enough of Wackenhut\u2019s employees to require it to bargain with the union .... But this consideration is a wholly insufficient basis for implying either in fact or in law that Burns had agreed or must be held to have agreed to honor Wacken-hut\u2019s collective-bargaining contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aybh\">406 U.S. at 286-287, 92 S.Ct. at 1581, 32 L.Ed.2d at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Whatever the possibility of distinguishing the precise holdings of the two cases, however, there remains a fundamental difficulty in reconciling their approaches, as we have remarked elsewhere, United Steelworkers v. United States Gypsum Co., 5 Cir. 1974, 492 F.2d 713, 725 n. 20, and as the Supreme Court has itself subsequently observed, <em>Howard Johnson, </em>417 U.S. at 253-259, 94 S.Ct. at 2239-2241, 41 L.Ed.2d at 52-53. <em>Wiley\u2019s </em>expansive approach to the reach of a collective bargaining agreement remains in stark contrast to the <em>Burns </em>Court\u2019s emphasis on traditional principles of consent to be bound by contract, which emphasis culminated in the statement that \u201c[s]trife is bound to occur if the concessions that must be honored do not correspond to the relative economic strength of the parties.\u201d 406 U.S. at 288, 92 S.Ct. at 1582, 32 L.Ed.2d at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The Supreme Court has not yet found it necessary to resolve these differences in approach. We are confident, however, that even at the most <em>Burns </em>has not overruled the principles of <em>Wiley. See e. g., </em>Golden State Bottling Co. v. NLRB, 1973, 414 U.S. 168, 94 S.Ct. 414, 38 L.Ed.2d 388 (a <em>post-Burns </em>case applying principles of <em>Wiley </em>in enforcing an NLRB unfair labor practice remedy against successor employer, where it had notice of predecessor\u2019s unfair labor practice litigation); <em>see </em>United Steelworkers v. United States Gypsum Co., 5 Cir. 1974, 492 F.2d at 725-726.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The matter at bar resembles both <em>Wiley </em>(in that the remedy sought is an arbitration order under \u00a7 301) and <em>Burns </em>(in that the link between the predecessor and successor is the tenuous one of replacement under a periodic rebidding service contract arrangement). While we need not determine the precise remaining vitality of <em>Wiley\u2019s </em>reach, we are required to measure its application to the matter at hand, in light of the approach more recently adopted by the Supreme Court. In this effort we extract some guidance from the Court\u2019s most recent discussion of these issues in <em>Howard Johnson, supra. </em>There Howard Johnson leased the real property and purchased the remaining assets of a restaurant and motor lodge of one of its franchisees, and proceeded to operate the unit itself. Determining to establish its own work force, Howard Johnson hired 45 employees, only 9 of whom had been its former franchisee\u2019s personnel. The union which had represented the former franchisee\u2019s work force and entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the former franchisee brought a \u00a7 301 action to compel arbitration under the predecessor\u2019s bargaining agreement; its principal grievance was that Howard Johnson was obligated under that contract to continue the employment of all of the franchisee\u2019s employees because they had not been discharged in accordance with the terms of the union-franchisee contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">While the <em>Howard Johnson </em>Court explicitly declined to resolve the differences between <em>Wiley </em>and <em>Burns, </em>it did make three points significant here. First, it established that <em>Wiley </em>should be read restrictively, as a \u201cguarded, almost tentative statement,\u201d 417 U.S. at 256, 94 S.Ct. at 2240, 41 L.Ed.2d at 53. Second, it held that even under <em>Wiley </em>the arbitration .sought could not be ordered because of the lack of \u201csubstantial continuity of identity in the business enterprise,\u201d which requirement it read to include a showing of a \u201csubstantial continuity in the identity of the work force across the change in ownership.\u201d 417 U.S. at 259, 94 S.Ct. at 2241, 41 L.Ed.2d at 57. Third, the Court articulated the balance which must be struck in determining whether an employer is obliged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>to fulfill any given obligation of \u201csue-cessorship\u201d;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\">The answer to this inquiry requires analysis of the interests of the new employer and the employees and of the policies of the labor laws in light of the facts of each case and the particular legal obligation which is at issue, whether it be the duty to recognize and bargain with the union, the duty to remedy unfair labor practices, the duty to arbitrate, etc. There is, and can be, no single definition of \u201csuccessor\u201d which is applicable in every legal context. A new employer, in other words, may be a successor for some purposes and not for others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">417 U.S. at 262 n. 9, 94 S.Ct. at 2243, 41 L.Ed.2d at 56-57.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">SUBSTANTIAL CONTINUITY IN THE IDENTITY OF THE BUSINESS ENTERPRISE</p>\n<p id=\"AkH\">The Supreme Court opinions are consistent on the one proposition that there is no simple checklist for decision; none could exhaust the factors relevant to determining whether a successor employer is bound to arbitrate under its predecessor\u2019s contract. We are in essence called upon to pragmatize the corporate and labor relationships to determine whether the past is part of the present, or the present the beginning of tomorrow. In a given case it may be clear that some one indicator of continuity is so weak as to allow a simple conclusion of no duty to arbitrate; but in more closely balanced cases, ownership, contracts terminated and germinated, purity and impurity of motives, and an encyclopedia of other variables must be equiponderated. We conclude here that despite the fact that there is no doubt on this record that Boeing has pursued its business in a manner substantially congruent to TWA\u2019s patterns,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Boeing </em>cannot be ordered in this \u00a7 301 action to arbitrate IAMAW\u2019s grievances under the TWA-IAMAW contract, given (1) the extent of the continuity in the identity of the work force across the change in employers, and (2) the relation between Boeing and TWA themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">\n<em>Continuity in the Identity of the Work Force</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\"><em>Howard Johnson </em>establishes that \u201ccontinuity of identity in the business enterprise necessarily includes . a substantial continuity of identity of the work force across the change in ownership.\u201d 417 U.S. at 263, 94 S.Ct. at 2244, 41 L.Ed.2d at 46.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>think that any precise definition of \u201csubstantiality\u201d in work force continuity can be distilled from the particular language of <em>Howard Johnson, </em>however. The Court found support for its \u201csubstantial\u201d standard in the \u201cwholesale transfer\u201d of employees from predecessor to successor in <em>Wiley </em><footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and from \u201cthe emphasis most of the lower courts have placed on whether the successor employer hires a majority of the predecessor\u2019s employees in determining the legal obligations of the successor in \u00a7 301 suits under Wiley\u201d 417 U.S. at 263, 94 S.Ct. at 2244, 41 L.Ed.2d at 46. We believe that these statements in <em>Howard Johnson </em>are descriptive rather than prescriptive and do not, in themselves, establish any \u201cmajority\u201d criterion, such as Boeing argues in favor of here.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> IAMAW argues in the other direction that the Supreme Court\u2019s enunciation of a \u201csubstantiality\u201d test when it might have adopted a \u201cmajority\u201d standard establishes that a \u201cmajority\u201d employee continuity cannot be prerequisite to a duty to arbitrate. We find this argument as unimpressive as its rejected converse. Rather, we regard the Supreme Court\u2019s emphasis in <em>Howard Johnson </em>of the necessity for pursuing a \u201ctraditional case-by-case approach\u201d in this area, 417 U.S. at 256, 94 S.Ct. at 2240, 41 L.Ed.2d at 53, as an assurance that it intended to establish no precise benchmark at this stage in the law\u2019s development, even assuming that a strict standard would ever be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\n<em>Computation of Continuity in the Identity of the Work Force</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Boeing argues, and IAMAW denies, that even if the Supreme Court has not committed itself to any precise definition of \u201csubstantiality,\u201d case law from the lower courts establishes \u201cmajority status\u201d as the test of substantial continuity in the identity of the work force. Before addressing the appropriateness of a \u201cmajority\u201d standard, we consider what group it is that this \u201cmajority\u201d is to be computed from: that is, whether the more significant factor in determining the continuity in the identity of the work force for the purpose of determining whether a successor employer must arbitrate under its predecessor\u2019s contract is the percentage of the predecessor\u2019s employees who have continued to work for the successor, or whether it is the percentage of the successor\u2019s employees who had earlier worked for the predecessor.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">The parties here have debated the substantiality of the continuity in the identity of the work force largely in terms of the 39% of Boeing\u2019s employees who had worked for TWA. We conclude, however, that the percentage of TWA employees who became Boeing employees, which we determine to be about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>35%, is the more significant figure in considering whether Boeing is obliged to arbitrate under the TWA-IAMAW contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">To begin with, the showing of employee continuity is relevant in establishing \u201cthe continuity of identity in the business enterprise.\u201d As a matter of principle, since the duty to arbitrate arises from an application of the contract between the predecessor employer and his organized employees, the entity whose identity is to be the reference point for judging continuity ought to be the predecessor enterprise. Accordingly, in judging the continuity in the identity of the work force, the incumbent component of the successor\u2019s work force ought to be compared against the predecessor\u2019s staff, not the successor\u2019s.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">This method of computation is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions. In <em>Wiley </em>the Court required arbitration where the predecessor\u2019s employees comprised a much smaller percentage of the successor\u2019s employees after the merger (40 of 340 = 12%) than the corresponding ratio in <em>Howard Johnson </em>(9 of 45 = 20%), in which no arbitration was required. Rather, the <em>Howard Johnson </em>Court found it most significant that \u201cin <em>Wiley </em>the surviving corporation <em>hired all of the employees of the disappearing </em>corporation,\u201d 417 U.S. at 258, 94 S.Ct. at 2241, 41 L.Ed.2d at 54 (emphasis altered). Moreover, it found support for its conclusion in what it perceived to be \u201cthe emphasis most of the lower courts have placed in determining the legal obligations of the successor in \u00a7 301 suits under Wiley\u201d on the percentage of the predecessor\u2019s employees hired by the successor employer, 417 U.S. at 263, 94 S.Ct. at 2244, 41 L.Ed.2d at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Thus, while the figure most significant in determining the successor\u2019s duty under <em>Burns </em>to bargain with the union representing the predecessor\u2019s organized employees may be<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the percentage of the successor\u2019s employees who are incumbents from the predecessor, <em>see e. g., Burns, </em>406 U.S. at 279, 92 S.Ct. at 1577, 32 L.Ed.2d at 68; Emerald Maintenance, Inc., 5 Cir. 1972, 464 F.2d 698, 701; Goldberg, The Labor Law Obligations of a Successor Employer, 63 Nw.U.L.Rev. 735, 793-794 (1969), we find those cases \u2014 where the basic question to be resolved by examination of employee continuity is simply whether the union represents a majority of the successor\u2019s employees, <em>see Burns, </em>406 U.S. at 278-281, 92 S.Ct. at 1577-1579, 32 L.Ed.2d at 68-69; NLRB v. Auto Ventshade, Inc., 5 Cir. 1960, 276 F.2d 303, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>307 \u2014 unpersuasive examples in this context.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\n<em>Regarding \u201cMajority\u201d Work Force Continuity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Having established the reference point from which to compute the ratio of substantial continuity in identity of the work force, we turn to the substance of the question: whether the fact that Boeing hired only about 35% of the incumbent TWA work force determines that Boeing is not obligated to arbitrate under its predecessor\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">We are not prepared at this point in the development of the law of successor employers\u2019 obligations to arbitrate either to accept or to reject Boeing\u2019s argument that \u201cmajority status\u201d is prerequisite to the obligation to bargain. In the first place, as we have already expressed, we do not find that the Supreme Court has established any benchmark. Furthermore, we are convinced that reliance on bargaining cases, such as <em>Burns, </em>is misplaced. There is much, though not unanimous, authority for the proposition that a successor employer will be required to bargain with the union representing his predecessor\u2019s employees only when predecessor\u2019s personnel comprise a majority of the successor\u2019s work force.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> But the federal labor law policies underlying such conclusions are analytically distinct from those involved in succes-</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">sorship arbitration suits under \u00a7 301. The majority requirement in duty to bargain cases is premised upon notions of majority selection of organized employees\u2019 collective bargaining agents. In the duty to arbitrate cases under \u00a7 301, however, the incumbent employees fulfill no such representative function in the filing of their grievances.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Thus, in <em>Wiley </em>the Supreme Court noted that its finding of Wiley\u2019s duty to arbitrate did \u201cnot suggest any view on the questions surrounding a certified union\u2019s claim to continued representative status. This union . . . seeks to arbitrate claims based on [its contract with the predecessor employer], not to negotiate a new agreement,\u201d and stated that \u201c[t]he fact that the Union does not represent a majority of an appropriate bargaining unit in Wiley does not prevent it from representing those employees who are covered by the agreement which is in dispute and out of which Wiley\u2019s duty to arbitrate arises.\u201d 376 U.S. at 551 and n. 5, 84 S.Ct. at 915, 11 L.Ed.2d at 905. To the same effect, we have upheld a successor employer\u2019s duty to arbitrate with a union which had once represented the predecessor\u2019s employees, but lost its certification. United States Gypsum Co. v. United Steelworkers, 5 Cir. 1967, 384 F.2d 38, 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">For the purpose of resolving this case, however, we need not decide whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>principles underlying the <em>Howard Johnson </em>requirement of a substantial continuity in the identity of the work force is to be read as a generally applied \u201cmajority\u201d standard.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We conclude only that the continuity in the identity of the work force must be considered together with other indicia of enterprise continuity, and turn to a consideration of those factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><em>Nature of the TWA </em>\u2014 Boeing <em>Relationship</em></p>\n<p id=\"ac9-dedup-0\">It is well established that the principle of <em>Wiley </em>applies to corporate succes-sorships accomplished through purchase and sale rather than merger.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We consider here the extent to which the <em>Wiley </em>test of continuity in the identity of the business enterprise can be satisfied in a periodic rebidding service contract context \u2014 \u201chardly ... a typical suc-cessorship situation.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">We begin by distinguishing the cases finding sufficient continuity in the \u201cemploying industry\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> to support a duty to recognize and bargain with the predecessor employees\u2019 union in such a context.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The focus in these duty to bargain cases being whether \u201cthe unit still representes] a majority of the employees,\u201d <em>Burns, </em>406 U.S. at 278, 92 S.Ct. at 1577, 32 L.Ed.2d at 68, the primary consideration is naturally the work force continuity. <em>See generally </em>Goldberg, <em>supra </em>note 20, at 793-799. As a secondary matter, attention is given to whether the successor\u2019s \u201coperational structure and practices differed from those of [the predecessor, so that the successor\u2019s] bargaining unit was no longer an appropriate one.\u201d <em>Burns, </em>406 U.S. at 280, 92 S.Ct. at 1578, 32 L.Ed.2d at 68. <em>See </em>Emerald Maintenance Inc. v. NLRB, 5 Cir. 1972, 464 F.2d 698, 701-702. <em>See, e. g., </em>NLRB v. Alamo White Truck Service, 5 Cir. 1959, 273 F.2d 238. <em>See generally </em>Goldberg, <em>supra </em>note 20, at 799-806. Thus, the nature of the predecessor-successor relationship is of relatively minor significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>In the duty to arbitrate context, however, it is the continuity in identity of the <em>enterprise </em>which makes the duty to arbitrate under the predecessor\u2019s collective bargaining agreement \u201creasonably related to the party sought to be obligated,\u201d and not \u201csomething imposed from without,\u201d <em>Wiley, </em>376 U.S. at 550-551, 84 S.Ct. at 915, 11 L.Ed.2d at 905; and the \u201ccontinuity in the identity of the work force across the change in ownership\u201d constitutes only a necessary but insufficient part of the enterprise continuity. <em>Howard Johnson. </em>Thus we think the relationship between the predecessor and successor employers far more critical here than in the duty to bargain cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">While we recognize that the Supreme Court spoke in <em>Howard Johnson </em>of substantial continuity in the identity of the work force across the change in <em>ownership, </em>we do not regard that oblique reference as a conclusion that a successor\u2019s duty to arbitrate under \u00a7 301 depends on a merger or purchase and sale connection between the predecessor and successor. Nor do we think that the <em>Burns </em>majority\u2019s \u201cstudious\u201d avoidance of the term \u201csuccessor,\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> while a significant gesture, should be taken to conclude the Supreme Court\u2019s thinking on the matter. More important, however, is the <em>Burns </em>Court\u2019s emphasis of the tenuous quality of the enterprise continuity in denying the application of substantive contract terms in <em>Burns:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">Wiley[\u2019s] . . . [narrow] holding dealt with a merger occurring against a background of state law that embodied the general rule that in merger situations the surviving corporation is liable for the obligations of the disappearing corporation. . . . Here there was no merger or sale of assets, and there were no dealings whatsoever between Wackenhut and Burns. On the contrary, they were competitors for the same work, each bidding for the service contract at Lockheed. Burns purchased nothing from Wack-enhut and became liable for none of its financial obligations. Burns merely hired enough of Wackenhut\u2019s employees to require it to bargain with the union . . .. But this consideration is a wholly insufficient basis for implying either in fact or in law that Burns had agreed or must be held to have agreed to honor Wacken-hut\u2019s collective bargaining contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATA\">406 U.S. at 286, 92 S.Ct. at 1581, 32 L. Ed.2d at 72.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> This factor was not, however, the critical basis of <em>Burns </em>conclusion that the service contract there was not bound to the terms of its predecessor\u2019s contract. Indeed, commentators have stressed that the most significant consideration in the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion was the inflexibility of the nonarbitrated enforcement of the precise and entire substance of the predecessor\u2019s contract through the NLRB\u2019s mechanisms.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we recognize that continuity in the identity of the business enterprise is more strongly shown where the predecessor employer-successor employer relationship is one of purchase and sale, or merger, than in this replaeement-under-periodic-rebid-ding situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">We are not prepared at this stage in the development of successor-ship principles, however, to say \u2014 when we need not do so to resolve this case\u2014 that there cannot be \u201cany substantial continuity of identity in the business enterprise\u201d in the absence of a transfer of ownership of tangible assets between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>employers, even when the most substantial assets involved in both the predecessor and successor enterprises may be the relationship to the primary employer and the collection of the work force, both of which have passed from the predecessor to the successor employer.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Rather, in keeping with the case-by-case approach the Supreme Court has advised, we conclude at this time only that where the relationship betwen the predecessor and successor employers is one of replacement in the periodic rebidding context, so that demonstration of continuity in the identity of the enterprise depends completely upon the continuity of the employee complement, the continuity in the identity of the work force must be more substantially established than would be required were the relationship between the predecessor and. successor employers one of merger, or purchase and sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">This conclusion is consistent with the <em>Howard Johnson </em>Court\u2019s injunction that <em>Wiley </em>ought to be expanded only with caution, and with the <em>Wiley </em>Court\u2019s balancing of employee interests in protection from \u201ca sudden change in the employment relationship\u201d (which exists regardless of the form of employer substitution), against the \u201crightful prerogative of owners independently to rearrange their businesses.\u201d 376 U.S. at 549, 84 S.Ct. at 914, 11 L.Ed.2d at 904.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We regard the substantiality of continuity from neither the employers\u2019 nor the employees\u2019 standpoint alone.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">We hold, then, that given the nature of the relation between TWA and Boeing, the extent of the continuity in the identity of the work force established here is not sufficiently substantial to oblige Boeing under \u00a7 301 to arbitrate under its predecessor\u2019s contract. <em>Howard Johnson, </em>417 U.S. at 263-264, 94 S.Ct. at 2244, 41 L.Ed.2d at 58. <em>Cf. </em>Hoisting, Eng\u2019rs Local, 701 v.

IAMAW contends that if the TWA-IAMAW contract does not control here, then the BoeingIAMAW contract does.

With our holding here that Boeing is obliged neither to adhere to nor to arbitrate under the TWA-IAMAW collective bargaining agreement, that dispute is resolved, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Boeing\u2019s argument is left without any foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">The judgment and order entered below are</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\">.

There is no suggestion, however, that retention of a predecessor\u2019s employee is in itself a sufficient basis on which to found an obligation under \u00a7 301 to arbitrate; if, for example, a successor employer radically changed the type of product manufactured and the ways of doing business of a plant and retained the former employer\u2019s personnel solely in order to preserve stability in the local economy, we expect that the successor would not be obliged to arbitrate under his predecessor\u2019s contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b382-4\">. <em>Bui sea </em>noto 9 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b382-5\">. None of the cases cited in the <em>Howard Johnson </em>opinion (save the district court opinion in the matter <em>s^lh judice, </em>which we determine in any event to have been the product, of a misapprehension of Burns) articulates a general standard for the quantum of employee continuity prerequisite to an order the arbitrate under a predecessor\u2019s contract. Indeed, in one of the cited cases, Local Joint Exec. Bd., Hotel, Employees v. Joden, Inc., D.Mass.1966, 262 F.Supp. 390, a duty to arbitrate was found despite the fact that (contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s apparent reading of the case) a majority of the predecessor\u2019s employees were <em>not </em>retained by the successor (12 of \u201c29 or 30\u201d were retained).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b382-10\">. The differences between the two majorities are illustrated by the facts of Local Joint Exec. Bd., Hotel, Employees v. Joden, Inc., DMass.l966, 262 F.Supp. 390, 392: \u201cPrince [the predecessor] was employing twenty-nine or thirty people. Of these thirty, Joden [the successor] retained twelve to make a total complement of eighteen or nineteen people working for Joden . . . . \u201d Thus, the percentage of the predecessor\u2019s employees who remained at the restaurant was 12/30 = 40%; while the percentage of the successor\u2019s employees who had been working for the predecessor was 12/18 or 12/19 = 67% or 63%.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b383-9\">. Additionally, the percentage representing those of the predecessor\u2019s employees who were retained by the successor decreases according to the successor\u2019s trimming of his total work force, while the figure representing the percentage of the successor\u2019s employees who are incumbents increases as the size of the successor\u2019s total work force diminishes. (Where the total employee complement is the same under both predecessor and successor the percentages will be equal.) Since a net decrease in the total number of personnel indicates a lesser continuity in the identity of the business enterprise, the percentage of the predecessor\u2019s employees remaining with the successor seems a better general indicator of the enterprise continuity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b383-10\">. The cases do not always consider which ratio is most significant. <em>See </em>Note, Contract Rights and the Successor Employer: The Impact of <em>Burns Security, 71 </em>Mich.L.Rev. 571, 575 n. 35 (1973). <em>Compare Burns, </em>406 U.S. at 281, 92 S.Ct. at 1579, 32 L.Ed.2d at 68 (\u201ca majority of the employees hired by the new employer\u201d) <em>with </em>the Supreme Court\u2019s later recitation of <em>Burns, </em>Golden State Bottling Co. v.

No doubt a large part of this obscurity is owing to the fact that in the case \u2014 probably the usual case \u2014 where the predecessor and successor employ the same number of personnel or close to the same number, the figures will be the same or close, so that it does not matter which figure is consulted. <em>See, e. g., </em>NLRB v.

Our conclusion as to which ratio is more significant in determining whether a successor is obliged to arbitrate does not, of course, preclude all consideration of the other ratio. For example, an arbitrator may consider that the work force of an absorbed enterprise has been diffused in such a way as to preclude the application of the predecessor\u2019s collective bargaining agreement. <em>See Howard Johnson, </em>417 U.S. at 258, n. 4, 94 S.Ct. at 2241, 41 L.Ed.2d at 54.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b384-9\">.

IAMAW argues against this conclusion that to determine the continuity of identity of the work force, as we have done, by reference to the quantum of employees who actually were hired by Boeing, rather than by the number who would have signed on with Boeing liad Boeing initially offered a contract identical to TWA\u2019s, is incorrect, since it allows Boeing to avoid the contract in the end by simply ignoring it in the beginning. We are not convinced. We do not think that a successor in Boeing\u2019s shoes can be required to assume its predecessor\u2019s contract even before it is established that it will succeed in lacing up its predecessor\u2019s work force. <em>Burns, </em>406 U.S. at 287-288, 92 S.Ct. at 1582-1583, 32 L.Ed.2d at 73. Moreover, the rationale behind the requirement of demonstrating a substantial continuity in the identity of the work force in order to make out a ease of substantial continuity of the enterprise is, as we have understood it, to establish that an employer\u2019s <em>securing </em>the continuity in the work force is a factor to be considered in determining the continuity of the enterprise. It is quite apparent that Boeing did not ultimately secure a sufficiently substantial continuity of the work force here, although at one point Boeing expected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>to inherit the bulk of TAVA\u2019s staff and undoubtedly it thought it could benefit from having the experienced personnel. Nor is there any suggestion in this ease that Boeing discriminated against TAArA incumbents, as the opinion below makes clear, 351 F.Supp. at 815. <em>See generally Howard </em>Johnson, 417 U.S. at 262, n. 8, 94 S.Ct. at 2243, 41 L.Ed.2d at 56; <em>Burns, </em>406 U.S. at 280 n. 5, 92 S.Ct. at 1578, 32 L.Ed.2d at 69. AVe hold that where, as in the circumstances of this case, the employee complement is perhaps the prime identity link between the successor and predecessor employers, a successor employer cannot be forced under \u00a7 301 to arbitrate under its predecessor\u2019s contract when the successor did not take the necessary steps to secure his enjoying, and consequently did not enjoy, a sufficiently substantial continuity in the identity of the work force.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">In light of this conclusion, we need not consider the relevance, if any, to the resolution of IAMAAY\u2019s rights against Boeing, of the continuing existence of TAYA. <em>Cf. </em>Goldberg, <em>supra </em>note 20, at 754-755; <em>but cf. also Howard, Johnson, </em>417 U.S. at 257, 94 S.Ct. at 2241, 41 L.Ed.2d at 54.
