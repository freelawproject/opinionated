Ferguson, United States District Judge, Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b1121-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1121-8\">This is an appeal filed pursuant to \u00a7 24 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 47) from a judgment of the district court holding that a valid and enforceable security interest was created under the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-9\">We adopt the following opinion of the Honorable George B. Harris, United States District Judge for the Northern District of California:</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-10\">\u201cThis matter is on review from an Order of the Referee which declared invalid a security interest claimed by petitioner Plant Reclamation, a creditor of the bankrupt, in certain personal property in the possession of the bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-11\">\u201cPlant Reclamation had sold equipment to the bankrupt on open account, but on October 16, 1972, substituted a promissory note for the open account indebtedness and caused a financing statement to be signed and filed. The parties intended to create a security interest in the property sold as collateral for the note, and the Referee so found.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-12\">\u201cThe promissory note included the following line: \u2018This note is secured by a Security Interest in subject personal property as per invoices.\u2019 The words \u2018subject ... as per invoices\u2019 were handwritten in an otherwise typewritten sentence; the testimony before the Referee established that such words were added by an officer of the bankrupt in order to tie the security interest to the personal property that had been sold to the bankrupt by Plant Reclamation. The invoices referred to in the promissory note were the only ones submitted by Plant Reclamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-13\">\u201cThe financing statement named Plant Reclamation as the secured party and recited that it covered the following types or items of property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-14\">1 \u2014 Dorr Oliver 100 Sq. Ft. Vacuum Filter</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-15\">1 \u2014 Chicago Pheumatic [sic] Vacuum Compression</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-16\">1 \u2014 Stainless Steel Augar and Drive 1 \u2014 Nichols Micro <em>7\" </em>dryer 1 \u2014 Tolhurst Centerfuge [sic] 26 inch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1121-17\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-18\">I. Did the Promissory Note \u2018Create or Provide for\u2019 a Security Interest?</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-19\">\u201cThis issue turns on whether there has been compliance with the following pertinent sections of the California Commercial Code [\u2018Cal.Com.C.\u2019] which govern the creation and enforcement of a security interest:</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-20\">Section 9105(1) (h):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-21\">\u2018Security agreement\u2019 means an agreement which creates or provides for a security interest;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1121-22\">Section 1201(37):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-23\">\u2018Security interest\u2019 means an interest in personal property or fixtures which secures payment or performance of an obligation. * * * * Section 9203:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-24\">(1) Subject to the provisions of Section 4208 on the security interest of a collecting bank and Section 9113 on a security interest arising under the division on sales, a security interest is not enforceable against the debtor or third parties unless</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-25\">(a) The collateral is in the possession of the secured party; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-26\">(b) The debtor has signed a security agreement which contains a description of the collateral ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1121-27\">* * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-28\">\u201cThe Referee denied the claim of Plant Reclamation on the single ground that no security interest had been \u2018grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>ed\u2019 pursuant to the language of the promissory note, as a result of which there had been a failure to comply with the \u2018creates or provides for\u2019 requirement of Cal.Com.C. \u00a7 9105(1) (h). The Referee concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-4\">Creative words do not exist in the note before me. The language relied upon is passive, descriptive and informative, much like a financing statement; it is not active or creative ; it does not grant or provide for. As such it is analogous to Needle [v. Lasco Industries, Inc., 10 Cal.App.3d 1105, 89 Cal.Rptr. 593 (1970)] and Shelton [v. Erwin, 472 F.2d 1118 (8th Cir. 1973)] rather than Nunnemaker [Transp. Co. v. United California Bank, 456 F.2d 28 (9th Cir. 1972)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-5\">Accordingly, I conclude that the promissory note is not a security agreement under \u00a7 9105(1) (h) and that a security agreement enforceable under \u00a7 9203(1) (b) has not been proven. * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">\u201cThe court recognizes that, pursuant to General Order 47 in Bankruptcy, it is bound to accept the Referee\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. Here, however, the facts are not in dispute, and the court remains free to examine the legal conclusions of the Referee and to reject them if they are erroneous. In re Gregory Mobile Homes, Inc., 347 F.Supp. 528, 529 (M.D.Ga.1972); In re Christian and Porter Aluminum Company, 316 F.Supp. 1340, 1342 (N.D.Cal.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-7\">\u201cCal.Com.C. \u00a7 9105(1) (h) defines a security agreement as one which \u2018creates or provides for\u2019 a security interest. The Referee found the above-quoted words to be synonymous with the word \u2018grant\u2019 and therefore to require active language. A fair reading of the statute, however, will not bear such a restrictive interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-8\">\u201cIt is a matter of basic statutory construction that statutes are to be given \u2018such effect that no clause, sentence or word is rendered superfluous, void, contradictory, or insignificant.\u2019 Ruiz v. Morton, 462 F.2d 818, 820 (9th Cir. 1972). In addition, absent persuasive reasons to the contrary, statutory words are to be given their ordinary meanings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1122-11\">\u201cCal.Com.C. \u00a7 9105(1) (h) nowhere uses the word \u2018grants\u2019 nor is that word a synonym for either \u2018creates\u2019 or \u2018provides for\u2019 or for all of the quoted words together.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-12\">\u201cWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (3d ed. 1965) defines \u2018create\u2019 as a transitive verb with the following meanings <em>inter </em>alia:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-13\">1: to bring into existence * * * * 2: to cause to be or to produce by fiat or by mental, moral, or legal action * * * 3: to cause or occasion * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1122-16\">\u2018Provide\u2019 is defined as a transitive verb with the following meanings <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-17\">2a: to fit out or fit up * * * 3: STIPULATE * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHeC\">and as an intransitive verb with the following meanings <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-19\">la: to take precautionary measures: make provision \u2014 used with <em>against </em>or <em>for * </em>* * 2: to make a proviso or stipulation * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1122-21\">\u2018Grant\u2019 is defined as a transitive verb with the following meanings <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-22\">la: to consent to carry out for a person: ALLOW, ACCORD * * * 2: GIVE, BESTOW, CONFER * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1122-23\">\u201cThus the requirement of Cal. Com.C. \u00a7 9105(1) (h) may be satisfied not only when a security interest is caused to be or brought into existence, but also when provision or stipulation is made therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-24\">\u201cNo magic words or precise form are necessary to create or provide for a security interest so long as the minimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>formal requirements of the Code are met. <em>See </em>Barney v. Rigby Loan &amp; Investment Co., 344 F.Supp. 694, 697 (D.Idaho 1972); Evans v. Everett, 279 N.C. 352, 183 S.E.2d 109, 113 (N.C.1971). This liberal approach is mandated by an expressed purpose of the secured transaction provisions of the Code:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-5\">The aim of this Article is to provide a simple and unified structure within which the immense variety of present-day secured financing transactions can go forward with less cost and with greater certainty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-6\"># # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-7\">The Article\u2019s flexibility and simplified formalities should make it possible for new forms of secured financing, as they develop, to fit comfortably under its provisions..... Comment to U.C.C. and Cal.Com.C. \u00a7 9101.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1123-9\">\u201cThe court in In re Center Auto Parts, 6 U.C.C.Rep. 398 (C.D.Cal.1968) upheld the validity of a promissory note as a security agreement by reading the two together. The promissory note merely recited that, \u2018This note is secured by a certain financing statement,\u2019 and the court found that such was sufficient to \u2018create or provide for\u2019 a security interest within the meaning of \u00a7 9105(1) (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-10\">\u201cA similar result was reached in a case involving the North Carolina version of the U.C.C., Evans v. Everett, <em>supra, </em>wherein the debtor gave a promissory note which recited: \u2018This note is secured by Uniform Commercial Code financing statement of North Carolina\u2019 and wherein a similarly worded financing statement was thereafter filed. The court found that since a security agreement could serve as a financing statement, there was no sound reason why the converse should not be true. The court held that the financing statement before it qualified as a security agreement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-11\">By the same token any written agreement signed by a debtor which recites that certain personalty is being encumbered as security for a debt ought to operate as a security agreement under Code \u00a7 25-9-105(1) (h). 18 Ark. L.Rev. 30, 34.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-13\">While there are no magic words which create a security interest there must be language in the instrument which \u2018leads to the logical conclusion that it was the intention of the parties that a security interest be created.' In Re Nottingham, 6. U.C.C.Rep. 1197, 1199 (U.S.D.C.Tenn.1969), 183 S.E.2d 113.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1123-14\">\u201cOther cases which have reached a like result and which support the position taken here include In re Wambach, 343 F.Supp. 73, 75 (N.D.Ill.1972), and cases cited therein; Cheek v. Caine &amp; Weiner Company, 335 F.Supp. 1319, 1320 (C.D.Cal.1971); In re Carmichael Enterprises, Inc., 334 F.Supp. 94, 104-105 (N.D.Ga.1971), affirmed, 460 F.2d 1405 (5th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-15\">\u201cThe cases relied upon by the trustee and cited by the Referee are not persuasive. Shelton v. Erwin, <em>supra, </em>dealt with the contention that an automobile bill of sale or a title application, therefor or both together adequately set forth the intent of the parties to create or provide for a security interest and did in fact create or provide for same under pertinent Missouri statutes. In finding no security agreement, the court simply reaffirmed the principle that a single piece of paper \u2014 here the title application and later certificate of title were being treated as a financing statement \u2014 could not serve as a security agreement without containing the requirements for such. There was not, as here, two documents: a promissory note which provided for a security interest and a financing statement which gave notice of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-16\"><em>\u201cShelton, </em>together with other cases relied upon by the trustee, stem from the ruling in American Card Company v. H. M. H. Co., 196 A.2d 150 (R.I.1963), and therefore share its infirmities. There the court found that a financing statement which did not contain a \u2018grant\u2019 of a security interest could not also serve as a security agreement. There is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>support in legislative history or grammatical logic for the substitution of the word \u2018grant\u2019 for the phrase \u2018creates or provides for.\u2019 This case has been subject to harsh criticism, see G. Gilmore Security Interests in Personal Property \u00a7 11.4 at 347-848 (1965); 6D Bender\u2019s Uniform Commercial Code Service 2-1680, and it cannot be relied upon as dispositive in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">\u201cAccordingly, the promissory note herein qualifies as a security agreement which by its terms \u2018creates or provides for\u2019 a security interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">II. Adequacy of Description of the Collateral</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\">\u201cThe trustee urges a second ground for sustaining the Order of the Referee complained of here, namely the inadequacy of the description of the collateral in the promissory note and hence the failure to comply with Cal.Com.C. \u00a7 9203(1) (b), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1124-7\">Cal.Com.C. \u00a7 9110 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-8\">For the purposes of this division any description of personal property or real estate is sufficient whether or not it is specific if it reasonably identifies what is described. Personal Property may be referred to by general kind or class if the property can be reasonably identified as falling within such kind or class or if it can be so identified when acquired by the debtor. * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1124-9\">\u201cAlthough the promissory note does not describe the collateral within the four corners of the document such description is provided (1) through incorporation by reference of the subject invoices, as well as (2) through reference to the more specific description of the collateral contained in the financing statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-10\">\u201cThe use of such extrinsic aids is clearly permissible to identify the collateral:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-11\">Under the Uniform Commercial Code there is no reason why parol evidence may not be admitted in aid of the description of the collateral, even where the collateral has been reasonably and sufficiently identified in the security agreement. In many instances, a description in a security agreement may be in general terms; parol evidence should therefore be admissible to explain or supplement the general description, or to resolve ambiguities. [Footnotes omitted.] 44 Cal.Jur.2d Rev. Secured Transactions \u00a7 107 at 386.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1124-13\">\u201cThe doctrine of incorporation by reference is likewise available in this area:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-14\">There is nothing in the Uniform Commercial Code to prevent reference in the security agreement to another writing for particular terms and conditions of the transaction. There is also nothing in the Uniform Commercial Code to prevent reference in the Security Agreement to another writing for a description of the collateral, so long as the reference in the security agreement is sufficient to identify reasonably what it described. In other words, it will at times be expedient to give a general description of the collateral in the security agreement and refer to a list or other writing for more exact description. In addition, the security agreement could itself consist of separate parts, one a general description of the obligation secured and the rights and duties of the parties, and the other a description of the collateral, both such writings being signed by the debtor and stated to comprise a single security agreement or referring to each other. [Footnotes omitted.] <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 109 at 387-388.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1124-15\">\u201cThus there is no requirement that the description of the collateral be complete within the four corners of the security agreement or other single document. The description in the security agreement is sufficient, however, if it provides such information as would lead a reasonable inquirer to the identity of the collateral. <em>See </em>In re Drane, 202 F.Supp. 221, 223 (W.D.Ky.1962), citing Sparks v. Deposit Bank of Paris, 115 Ky. 461, 74 S.W. 185, 78 S.W. 171, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>cited with approval in In re Anselm, 344 F.Supp. 544, 546 (W.D.Ky.1972). As summarized by one commentator:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1125-4\">A description need not be so comprehensive that it enables an interested party to determine exactly what the specific collateral is, from a reading of the security agreement or financing statement alone. It is enough if the description allows a third party, aided by information which the security agreement suggests, to identify the property. D. Lee, \u2018Perfection and Priorities Under the Uniform Commercial Code,\u2019 17 Wyo.LJ. 5-6 (1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">Instructive here is the decision in In re Nickerson &amp; Nickerson, Inc., 329 F.Supp. 93 (D.Neb.1971), affirmed, 452 F.2d 56 (8th Cir. 1971) on the issue of adequacy of description of the collateral. A security agreement in <em>Nickerson </em>described the collateral therein as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1125-6\">All gifts, novelties, souvenirs, and other merchandise inventory held for resale including but not limited to the following: See attached schedules for a list of property covered by this Security Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1125-7\">The financing statement filed in connection with the security agreement described the collateral in different terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1125-8\">gifts, novelties, souvenirs, and other merchandise inventory held for resale and situated in debtor\u2019s stores located in [each particular] state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1125-9\">The appellate court held that the description of the collateral in the security . agreement was adequate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1125-10\">As we have noted, the evidence establishes that the parties, by attaching the financing statements to the security agreement, incorporated the clarifying language of the financing statement into the security agreement, and clearly created a lien in Lugene\u2019s [the secured party\u2019s] favor upon the inventory in all of Nickerson\u2019s [the debt- or\u2019s] stores. 452 F.2d 57.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1125-11\">\u201cA similar conclusion was reached in In re Center Auto Parts, supra, at 399-400, wherein the court upheld the adequacy of the description of the collateral in a security agreement through reference to a financing statement by incorporation and the resulting suggestion of inquiry or the means of identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-13\">\u201cThe trustee properly cites Mitchell v. Shepherd Mall State Bank, 324 F.Supp. 1029, 1032 (W.D.Okl.1971), affirmed, 458 F.2d 700 (10th Cir. 1972) for the proposition that the description of collateral contained in a financing statement may have the effect of restricting the security interest created in a security agreement but cannot enlarge it. In the instant case a reference to the more specific description contained in the financing statement does operate to restrict, rather than to enlarge, the security interest between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-14\">\u201cA case relied upon by the trustee, Rusch Factors, Inc. v. Passport Fashion Ltd., 1 U.C.C. 507 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1971), may be readily distinguished. There the parties executed a security agreement (trust receipt) whereby the trustee acknowledged receipt of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1125-15\">the documents listed on the obverse hereof representing the goods therein specified (which, together with all improvements or additions to or accessories to or products of such goods, are all hereinafter called \u2018collateral\u2019) and . . . the existence of . . .a security interest in favor of [Itoh] in the \u201ccollateral.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 507-508.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1125-17\">The parties stipulated as to the nature of the subject documents, but in fact no such documents had been listed or attached to the security agreement. The court concluded that because of the absence of the documents, a reasonable inquirer, upon reviewing the security agreement with or without the financing statement, would not have discovered sufficient information to provide an adequate description of the collateral. <em>Id. </em>at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-18\"><em>\u201cRusch </em>is pertinent here because it approves the policy of looking beyond the security agreement to the financing statement in order to ascertain the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>scription of the collateral, but it is distinguishable on its holding because there the court found an absence of documentation. Here, however, the invoices were available but were not claimed to be physically attached to the security agreement; only if no invoices existed or could be found would the instant case be analogous to <em>Rusch.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\">\u201cThis last conclusion is bolstered by J. K. Gill Company v. Fireside Realty, Inc., 262 Or. 486, 499 P.2d 813 (1972), a case similar to <em>Rusch </em>which cited and relied upon <em>Rusch </em>as authority for a similar conclusion. A security agreement executed therein described the collateral as \u201cfurniture as per attached listing.\u201d No listing was in fact attached. The financing statement made the same description of the collateral; again no listing was attached. The court noted, however, that had the subject invoices which evidenced the furniture been attached to the security agreement, the description of the collateral would have been adequate, thus supporting the theory of description through incorporation by reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-5\">\u201cIt is manifest that the reference to the invoices in the subject promissory note, coupled with the existence of a financing statement containing a more specific description, satisfies the requirements of Cal.Com.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9203(1) (b) and 9110.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-6\">III. Validity of the Oral Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-7\">\u201cPlant Reclamation argued before the Referee, and has urged on this review, that its security interest can also be found to exist in the oral agreement of the parties which then became memorialized in the promissory note. Plant Reclamation finds this theory available under Nunnemaker Transp. Co. v. United California Bank, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1126-8\">\u201cThis court has been unable to find direct authority for the position taken by Plant Reclamation, but the Referee did not pass on this issue and, in view of the opinion of this court expressed here-inabove, no resolution need be made of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-10\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-11\">\u201cFor the reasons stated above, the petition of Plant Reclamation is hereby granted, and the Order of the Referee Declaring Lien Invalid, dated April 10, 1973, is hereby reversed. It is so ordered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-12\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1122-9\">. Webster\u2019s New International <em>Dictionary </em>(2d ed. 1939) lists as synonyms for \u2018create\u2019 the words \u2018make, build, produce, fashion ; invent, originate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
