We are called upon to determine whether it is within the summary jurisdiction of a .Chapter X reorganization court to order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>.a State Corporation Commission to reinstate a debtor\u2019s certificate of authority to do business. The district court\u2019s order of October 3, 1973 ordered reinstatement. We reverse and hold that jurisdiction to issue such an order was lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">In 1969, Dolly Madison Industries, Inc. (hereinafter \u201cDMI\u201d) was issued a certificate of authority to transact business in the State of Virginia by the State Corporation Commission (hereinafter \u201cSCC\u201d). Article IX, Section 2 of the Virginia Constitution (1971) provides that \u201c. . . the [SCC] shall be the department of government through which shall be issued all licenses of foreign corporations to do business in this Commonwealth.\u201d In 1970, a registration fee was assessed against DMI pursuant to Sections 58-450 and 58-451, 1950 Code of Virginia, as amended.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> DMI failed to pay the required registration fee and failed to file the annual report required by Sections 13.1-120 and 13.1-121, 1950 Code of Virginia, as amended.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-20\">On June 24, 1970, the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered an order approving DMI\u2019s petition for reorganization under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 501 <em>et seq. </em>That order, which authorized the trustee to operate the business of the debtor, included, among other provisions, authority to incur the expenses necessary to preserve, protect and conduct the affairs of the debtor;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>authority to pay, \u201cThe cost of maintaining the corporate existence of said debt- or . . . \u201d (Par. 10(c), order of June 24, 1970); and an injunction against interference with the trustee\u2019s management of the debtor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The trustee, having received notices from several states of the revocation of DMI\u2019s certificate of authority to do business, petitioned the district court for an order enjoining various secretaries of state from cancelling DMI\u2019s authorizations. The reorganization court, on the same day, December 4, 1970, issued the desired injunctive order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">In January 1971, the SCC mailed a notice of registration fee assessment and an annual report form to the debtor corporation, Neither the fee nor the completed 1971 annual report was received by the SCC before the March 1st due date. Accordingly, by letter dated April 30, 1971, the SCC notified DMI that its certificate of authority would be automatically revoked on June 1, 1971, pursuant to Section 13.1-117,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 1950 Code of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Virginia, as amended, for failure to file the required annual reports and to pay the related fees for two consecutive years. On May 31, 1971 (one day prior to the statutory revocation date), the SCC received from the trustee of DMI, the debtor\u2019s annual reports for the years 1970 and 1971. DMI did not remit any registration fees, contending that \u201c . . . the U.S. District Court has enjoined us from paying any obligations incurred prior to June 24, 1970 and has prohibited any public officials from instituting any actions or proceedings until further notice.\u201d (Letter from DMI to the SCC dated May 28, 1971). On June 4, 1971, the SCC returned the two annual reports, pursuant to \u00a7 13.1-121, 1950 Code of Virginia, as amended <em>(see </em>. n.2, <em>supra), </em>on the ground that the reports were inaccurate as filed. SCC further advised the debt- or that its certificate of authority was revoked by operation of law on June 1, 1971, and that the SCC had no discretion in the matter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Unwilling to proceed pursuant to Virginia\u2019s re-entry statute,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the trustee petitioned the district court on May 3, 1973 for an order to show cause why the certificate of authority should not be deemed in full force and effect. The order to show cause issued on May 4, 1973. The SCC argued that the certificate had been revoked automatically under Virginia law for failure of DMI to file annual reports for two successive years (since, when filed, the reports were inaccurate) and for failure of DMI to pay the required registration fees before the June 1, 1971 deadline. The SCC also denied the jurisdiction of the district court. The court, in its Memorandum Opinion and Order of October 3, 1973, implicitly rejected SCO\u2019s jurisdictional argument and interpreted its prior order of December 4, 1970, as precluding the SCC from taking into consideration pre-petition failures to comply with Virginia law (i.e., the delinquent 1970 filing and fees).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Concluding that at worst the debtor had failed to comply with Virginia\u2019s statutes for one year (1971), the court ordered the SCC to reinstate DMI\u2019s certificate of authority. The SCC appeals from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-13\"> Section III of the Bankruptcy Act confers on a reorganization court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>\u201c . . . exclusive jurisdiction of the debtor and its property, wherever located.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 511. Courts of bankruptcy are empowered to issue an injunction in a summary proceeding when necessary to prevent the defeat or impairment of their exclusive jurisdiction or to protect the property and assets of a bankrupt wherever situated. The power of a bankruptcy court to protect by injunction the subject matter of its jurisdiction is inherent in the court as a virtual court of equity and exists as well by virtue of Sec. 2, sub. (a) (15) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 11, sub. (a) (15). In re International Power Securities Corp., 170 F.2d 399, 402 (3d Cir. 1948). <em>See </em>First National Bank v. Lake, 199 F.2d 524, 528 (4th Cir. 1952); In re Standard Gas and Electric Co., 139 F.2d 149, 152 (3d Cir. 1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Summary jurisdiction is generally limited to the adjudication of questions concerning (1) the administration of the debtor\u2019s estate, and (2) the property in the court\u2019s actual or constructive possession. <em>See </em>Katchen v. Landy, 382 U.S. 323, 327, 86 S.Ct. 467, 15 L.Ed.2d 391 (1966). <em>See also </em>2 Collier on Bankruptcy, jf 23.02(1), <em>et seq., </em>6 Collier on Bankruptcy, f[ 3.03, <em>et seq. </em>(14th ed.). The trustee does not contend that the district court\u2019s order was based on the power of the court to <em>administer </em>the reorganization.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the district court\u2019s summary jurisdiction, if any, must stand or fall on whether that court was exercising control over the debtor\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">The trustee does not argue that the certificate of authority is <em>itself </em>a property right. Rather, the trustee points to DMI\u2019s Blackstone, Virginia manufacturing plant as the <em>res </em>required for the exercise of summary jurisdiction by the district court. The trustee then argues that revocation of the certificate of authority deprives DMI of the right to operate that plant; thus, constituting an interference with \u201cproperty\u201d within the jurisdiction of the reorganization court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We do not believe, however, that the scope of a bankruptcy court\u2019s summary jurisdiction is as broad as the trustee suggests.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">In the instant case, the reorganization court has <em>not </em>acted to preserve its power to adjudicate claims- relating to the trustee\u2019s property. Unlike the situation in which a bankruptcy court enjoins prosecution of a claim in a different forum,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> here the SCC has made no claim against \u201cproperty\u201d of the debtor corporation. The mere fact that the debtor\u2019s property may be affected by state law does not constitute a \u201cclaim\u201d against that \u201cproperty\u201d and absent such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>a \u201cclaim\u201d summary jurisdiction is unavailable.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">In Gillis v. California, 293 U.S. 62, 55 S.Ct. 4, 79 L.Ed. 199 (1934), the receiver of a corporation undergoing reorganization asked- the district court to sanction non-compliance with a California licensing law. The receiver contended that without such an exemption he would be unable to continue operating the business. The Supreme Court held that the bankruptcy court was powerless to authorize non-compliance with the state licensing statute, regardless of the consequences. Significantly, the Court concluded its opinion with this statement :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">We are not dealing here with the acknowledged power of courts to protect <em>property in their custody, </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">293 U.S. at 67, 55 S.Ct. at 6. In light of <em>Gillis, </em>the district court\u2019s order to reinstate DMI\u2019s certificate of authority to do business cannot be viewed as protective of a <em>res </em>within the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Since preservation of the debtor\u2019s property is the only theory advanced by the trustee in support of the district court\u2019s jurisdiction, it follows that the court lacked the summary jurisdiction necessary to issue the October 1973 order under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The cases relied upon by the trustee do not compel a contrary result. In re International Power Securities Corp., 170 F.2d 399 (3d Cir. 1948) involved the consolidation of claims against the debt- or\u2019s estate: As the court indicated, \u201cIt was impossible to administer the estate, or to reorganize the debtor, without determining the controversy between appellants and appellee.\u201d 170 F.2d at 405. In re Standard Gas &amp; Electric Co., 139 F.2d 149 (3d Cir. 1943) and In re Preston Mining Co., 203 F.Supp. 103 (E.D.Pa.1962) affirmed the power of the district court to enjoin direct interferences with potential choses in action of the debtor corporation. In each of these cases, unlike the instant case, the district court acted to preserve the \u201cproperty\u201d of the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">The district court\u2019s reliance on Stout v. Green, 131 F.2d 995 (9th Cir. 1942) and In re Hotel Martin Co., 41 F.Supp. 392 (N.D.N.Y.1941) was misplaced.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <em>Stout, </em>the Court upheld the issuance of an injunction against the enforcement of California\u2019s Alcoholic Beverage Control Act. Section 51 of that Act authorized the seizure of unlicensed stills. One of the debtor\u2019s assets consisted of such a still and the injunction, therefore, only prevented interference by State. Liquor Officers with property belonging to the debtor and clearly within the traditional summary jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. In <em>Hotel Martin, </em>the district court granted a motion for an order restraining the New York Department of Labor from holding a hearing to determine the debtor\u2019s liability for unemployment taxes. Once again the threatened state action was aimed directly at the property of the debtor corporation and warranted an exercise of summary jurisdiction to preserve the debtor\u2019s <em>res </em>for ultimate disposition in the bankruptcy court. Neither of these cases authorize an injunction against the operation of a state law absent a claim against a \u201cproperty\u201d interest of the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">Since the order of the district court, requiring the reinstatement of DMI\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>licate of authority to do business was based neither on the court\u2019s power over the administration of the debtor\u2019s estate nor on its power to preserve the debtor\u2019s property, the district court lacked summary jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The judgment of the district court will be reversed, with the direction that the order of October 3, 1973 be vacated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-8\">. \u00a7 58-450.

The SCC subsequently received from DMI a check in the amount of $26.25. Taking the position that revocation of DMI\u2019s certificate had not extinguished its liability for past due registration fees, the check was deposited to the credit of the Treasurer of Virginia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b566-8\">. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 13.1-115.1 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">A foreign corporation whose authority to transact business in this State has been surrendered or revoked shall, upon re-entering the State, comply with all the requirements of law applicable to an original application for a certificate of authority, including the payment of fees, except that it need not file again a copy of its charter or any amendment thereof that is then on file in the office of the clerk of the Commission. . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">The trustee\u2019s reluctance to comply with the statutory reinstatement procedure apparently stems from the fear that a $1,250. fee would bo imposed to obtain a new certificate of authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b566-15\">. The SCC argues that Virginia does not penalize a corporation\u2019s failure to file one annual report and to pay one registration fee. It is only when a second consecutive failure to comply with Virginia statutes occurs that revocation of a corporation\u2019s certificate of authority results. The post-petition filing requirement was an obligation of the trustee, contends SCC, and it was that second consecutive default, not the pre-petition default, that triggered revocation of DMI\u2019s authorization. (We note that the trustee had authority under paragraph 10(c) of the June 1970 order to file such reports and incur such expenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-16\">By reason of our disposition, holding that the district court did not have summary jurisdiction to issue its order of October 3, 1973, we need not reach this issue or other issues raised by the parties. In particular, we do not reach and, hence, we do not decide whether 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 959(b) bars a mandatory injunction against the State of Virginia such as the October 1973 order from which this appeal is taken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b567-7\">. In ordinary bankruptcy, \u201cadministrative\u201d control relates to such matters as \u201c. the allowance, rejection, and reconsideration of claims, the reduction of the estates to money, and its distribution, the determination of the preferences and priorities to be accorded to claims presented for allowance and payment in regular course, and the supervision and control of the trustees and others who are employed to assist them.\u201d United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v.

Appellant correctly points out that not every \u201caffect\u201d on the debtor\u2019s property constitutes proper subject matter for an exercise of summary jurisdiction by the reorganization court. As the Supreme Court indicated in Callaway v. Benton, 336 U.S. 132, 142, 69 S.Ct. 435, 441, 93 L.Ed. 553 (1949), \u201c. . .

While the Court recognized that the ultimate disposition of the \u201cproperty\u201d might cause \u201c[a] serious practical problem\u201d to the debtor\u2019s <em>res </em>(336 U.S. at 148, 69 S.Ct. 435), there is no suggestion that this practical problem would be legally sufficient to invoke the bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b568-12\">. In any event, In re Hotel Martin Co., <em>supra, </em>constitutes questionable authority in support of the district court\u2019s jurisdictional theory. In Hotel Martin, the New York State Department of Labor filed its claim for taxes (alleging priority) in the bankruptcy proceeding. Without regard to any other consideration, such a voluntary act by the claimant would necessarily submit it to the summary jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
