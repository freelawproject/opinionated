App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1), which makes it illegal for a convicted felon to possess any firearm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Jurisdiction is based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1353-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-18\">The essential facts of this case were established by stipulation. The defendant is the same individual who had been convicted of a felony in municipal court in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on March 25, 1954. The felony was the crime of carnal knowledge and abuse. On April 7, 1970, agents of the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service seized from the defendant\u2019s residence in Milwaukee three Winchester 30-30 Caliber lever carbines, which were at that time owned by the defendant. Thereafter this forfeiture action was commenced. The defendant is a member of the Menominee Indian Tribe who used the weapons for hunting in Menominee County, a former Menominee Indian reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-19\">The defendant appeals from the order of the district judge condemning as forfeited to the United States the three Winchester rifles, asserting two grounds for reversal: First, that there was no evidence from which the district judge could conclude that the seized firearms were involved in interstate commerce. Second, because of his status as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>an Indian and certain rights granted by-treaty to the Menominee Indians that the combined effect of 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(d) are not applicable to him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We see no merit in either contention and accordingly affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(d) provides that any firearm involved in a violation of a criminal law of the United States is subject to seizure and forfeiture. The criminal offense upon which the government has based its action is 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1), which prohibits a convicted felon from \u201creeeiv[ing], possess[ing], or transporting] in commerce or affecting commerce . . . any firearm.\u201d The defendant argues that there is no basis in the record upon which the district judge could ascertain that the rifles involved here moved in commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-7\">The record reveals that written in hand on the bottom of the typed stipulations submitted on behalf of the government and defendant is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ap3-dedup-0\">The three Winchester rifles were manufactured by the Winchester Western Corporation in New Haven, Connecticut, and were purchased by the claimant in December of 1969 and January of 1970, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1354-8\">Next to this paragraph is the handwritten entry \u201cAdded per stipulation \u2014 TSJ.\u201d At oral argument counsel for the government informed this court that TSJ were the initials of the district judge\u2019s law clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-12\">Also part of the record on this appeal is a letter from assistant United States Attorney, David J. Cannon to Judge Myron L. Gordon setting forth the above added stipulation, and representing that this addition was made by agreement of the parties. The letter bears a designation of \u201ccc: Attorney John A. Udovc\u201d who was defendant\u2019s trial counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At oral argument defendant\u2019s counsel on appeal told the court that \u201c[trial counsel] informed me that further stipulation was not made ... he informed me later that he did receive a copy of the letter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-13\">It is, of course, generally true that a stipulation is an agreement between the parties, and that there must be mutual assent by the parties. Winchester Drive-In Theater, Inc. v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Co., 232 F.Supp. 556 (N.D.Cal.1964), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 351 F.2d 925 (9th Cir. 1965), cert. denied. 382 U.S. 1011, 86 S.Ct. 620, 15 L.Ed.2d 526 (1966); Holland Banking Co. v. Continental National Bank, 9 F.Supp. 988 (W.D.Mo.1934). Here we have a case where it is admitted by defendant\u2019s attorney that trial counsel did in fact receive a copy of the letter containing the added stipulation which was sent to the trial judge. The defendant did not at that time object or inform the trial court that no stipulation had been made, and now on appeal claims that the trial judge should not have considered the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number> The failure to object to the introduction of evidence at trial waives most objections. United States v. Young, 471 F.2d 109 (7th Cir. 1972, cert. denied, 412 U.S. 929, 93 S.Ct. 2755, 37 L.Ed.2d 156 (1973); United States v. Richman, 369 F.2d 465 (7th Cir. 1966); United States v. Doran, 299 F.2d 511 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 370 U.S. 925, 82 S.Ct. 1563, 8 L.Ed.2d 504 (1962). In. this case timely objection on the part of defendant\u2019s counsel as to the form of the stipulation would have allowed the government to correct its technical error in not obtaining defendant\u2019s signature on the amended stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-4\">We cannot see how requiring trial counsel to object to a representation made to a trial judge that a stipulation of a material fact has been entered into, when it is claimed that it has not, is burdensome. <em>See generally </em>Bullock v. Northern Insurance Co., 331 F.2d 431 (10th Cir. 1964). Any other rule would be tantamount to allowing defendant\u2019s counsel to entrap the government in an error which could have been easily rectified and of which defendant\u2019s counsel was well aware.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-5\">In this ease there is no indication that defendant\u2019s counsel raised the issue before Judge Gordon and we believe it was proper for him to consider the added stipulation. We therefore conclude that there is a sufficient basis in the record to find that the firearms in question did move in interstate commerce.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1355-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-12\">The second question is whether the defendant\u2019s status as a Menominee Indian exempts him from the combined effect of 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1), making it a crime for a convicted felon to receive or possess a firearm, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(d), the federal forfeiture provisions. We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-13\">It is well settled that a federal statute of general applicability is applicable to the native American. FPC v. Tuscarora Indian Nation, 362 U.S. 99, 116, 80 S.Ct. 543, 4 L.Ed.2d 584 (1960); Walks on Top v. United States, 372 F.2d 422, 425 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 879, 88 S.Ct. 109, 19 L.Ed.2d 170 (1967). This is so unless there exists some treaty right which exempts the Indian from the operation of the particular statutes in question. <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Squire v. Capoeman, 351 U.S. 1, 6, 76 S.Ct. 611, 614, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>100 L.Ed. 883 (1956); Commissioner v. Walker, 326 F.2d 261, 263 (9th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">The defendant relies on the 1854 Treaty of Wolf River between the United States and the Menominee Indians. 10 Stat. 1064 (May 12, 1854). The treaty provides that the Indians are to be ceded a tract of land lying upon the Wolf River \u201cto be held as Indian lands are held . . . <em>.\u2019\u2019Id. </em>The Supreme Court has interpreted this language to mean that the Menominee Indians retain the right to hunt and fish upon the ceded land. Menominee Tribe of Indians v. United States, 391 U.S. 404, 406, 88 S.Ct. 1705,1707, 20 L.Ed.2d 697 (1968). It is the defendant\u2019s position that incidental to this right to hunt is the right to possess firearms, and therefore he should be exempt from criminal liability under 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(1)(a) and the forfeiture provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-6\">In <em>Menominee Indian, </em>the Supreme Court affirmed a Court of Claims judgment that the State of Wisconsin could not through the enforcement of its hunting and fishing regulations extinguish the hunting and fishing rights of the Menominee Indians. The Menominee Termination Act of 1954, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 891-902 removed the Menominee reservation from federal control, and gave to the state general jurisdiction over the area. One of the reasons why the Court rejected the argument that the Termination Act gave authority to the State of Wisconsin to impose hunting and fishing regulations was because of the existence of Public Law 280, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1162. Public Law 280 provides that the State of Wisconsin should have jurisdiction over offenses committed by Indians, with the exception that the State is not authorized to deprive any Indian or tribe of any federal treaty right with \u201crespect to hunting, trapping or fishing . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1162(b). Thus, it is clear that the <em>Menominee Indian </em>decision rests primarily on the fact that a state, contrary to federal law, was imposing restrictive regulations on the hunting and fishing rights as established by the treaty with the Menominee tribe. In the present case federal criminal laws are involved and nothing in Public Law 280 or any other law precludes their application to Menominee Indians.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-9\">Furthermore, the Menominee Indian Termination Act was not a law of general applicability, but rather one of special application to the Indians. It is not surprising that the Supreme Court limited its effect so it would not place Indian treaty rights regarding hunting and fishing at the whim of a state legislature. In this case we deal with federal laws of general applicability which have nothing to do with the regulation of any Menominee Indian treaty right. Any effect on the defendant\u2019s right to hunt is merely incidental, and applicable only to him. The treaty rights allegedly abridged belong to the tribe as a whole and not to any one individual. Whitefoot v. United States, 155 Ct.Cl. 127, 293 F.2d 658, 663 (1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 818, 82 S.Ct. 629, 7 L.Ed.2d 784 (1962). Here the government has not made the exercise of a treaty right illegal, but rather the defendant\u2019s own actions have limited him from participating fully in his tribe\u2019s hunting rights. Thus, this case is unlike <em>Menominee Indian </em>and others where governmental regulations affected the entire tribe\u2019s treaty rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-10\">The defendant further contends that his right to hunt and fish can only be limited by laws that are reasonable and necessary to serve a legitimate government interest, <em>See </em>Puyallup Tribe v. Department of Game, 391 U.S. 392, 88 S.Ct. 1725, 20 L.Ed.2d 689 (1968) ; Tulee v. Washington, 315 U.S. 681, 62 S.Ct. 862, 86 L.Ed. 1115 (1942), and that since the state conviction underlying his violation of 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1) did not involve the use of firearms, it is not \u201creasonable or necessary\u201d for the government to institute forfeiture proceedings against his three rifles pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-11\">If there is a legitimate governmental interest in applying 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>1202(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(d) to the defendant and his rifles, the treaty of Wolf River will not prevent its application. <em>Puyallup, supra; Tulee, supra. </em>In the instant case the Congress has made a reasonable determination that convicted felons should not be able to possess, receive or transport firearms. United States v. Craven, 478 F.2d 1329 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 866, 94 S.Ct. 54, 38 L.Ed.2d 85 (1973); United States v. Weatherford, 471 F.2d 47 (7th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 411 U.S. 972, 93 S.Ct. 2144, 36 L.Ed.2d 695 (1973); United States v. Donofrio, 450 F.2d 1054 (5th Cir. 1971); United States v. Synnes, 438 F.2d 764 (8th Cir. 1971), vacated on other grounds, 404 U.S. 1009, 92 S.Ct. 687, 30 L.Ed.2d 657 (1972). We can see no basis on which to hold that that decision is only reasonable and necessary when applied to non-Indian felons. Defendant\u2019s Indian status does not remove him from the operation of the challenged statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1353-11\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7401 provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-12\">No civil action for . . . forfeiture, shall be commenced unless the Secretary or his delegate authorizes or sanctions the proceedings and the Attorney General or his delegate directs that the action be commenced.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1353-14\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(d) provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-15\">Any firearm or ammunition involved in or used or intended to be used in, any violation of the provisions of this chapter or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, or any violation of any other criminal law of the United States, shall be subject to seizure and forfeiture . . ..</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1353-20\">. 18 U.S.C.

Apparently at the district court level the defendant argued that 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202 was invalid as an \u201cinfringement of the second amendment\u2019s protection of the right to bear arms, the first amendment\u2019s prohibition of bills of attainder and ex post facto laws, and the fourteenth amendment\u2019s due process clause.\u201d These arguments were appropriately rejected. Cody v. United States, 460 F.2d 34 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1010, 93 S.Ct. 454, 34 L.Ed.2d 303 (1972) ; United States v. Synnes, 438 F.2d 764 (8th Cir. 1971), vacated on other grounds, 404 U.S. 1009, 92 S.Ct. 687, 30 L.Ed.2d 657 (1972). These issues have not been raised on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1354-15\">. Defendant argues that this letter to Judge Gordon is not properly before this court because it was not part of the original record in this case. We note that the letter to Judge Gordon was sent to this court from the clerk of the district court with instructions that it be included in the appeal record. Eed.R.App.P. 10(e) provides in part: \u201cIf anything material ... is omitted from the record by error or accident . . . the district court either before or after the record is transmitted to the court of appeals . . . may direct that the omission ... be corrected . . ..\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1355-6\">. At oral argument the defendant argued that the stipulation did not indicate whether the movement in interstate commerce occurred after the effective date of 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202. No such proof is necessary. In United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 350, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971), the Supreme Court said \u201cthe Government meets its burden . . . if it demonstrates that the firearm received has previously traveled in interstate commerce.\u201d The Sixth Circuit has interpreted both <em>Bass </em>and the statute as requiring no proof that the firearms in question moved after the effective date of the Act. United States v. Day, 476 F.2d 562 (6th Cir. 1973). <em>See also </em>United States v. Walker, 489 F.2d 1353 (7th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 982, 94 S.Ct. 1574, 39 L.Ed.2d 879 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1355-9\">. There is considerable authority for the proposition that a federal statute enacted subsequent to a treaty supercedes any provisions of the treaty that are inconsistent. Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 18, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1 L.Ed.2d 1148 (1957). There is, however, authority on the other side holding that an intention to abrogate or modify a treaty is not to be lightly imputed to the Congress. Pigeon River Improvement, Slide &amp; Boom Co. v. Charles W. Cox, Ltd., 291 U.S. 138, 54 S.Ct. 361, 78 L.Ed. 695 (1934) ; Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U.S. 553, 23 S.Ct. 216, 47 L.Ed. 299 (1903) ; Ward v. Race Horse, 163 U.S. 504, 511, 16 S.Ct. 1076, 41 L.Ed. 244 (1896).</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-15\">Neither plaintiff nor defendant have referred us to any legislative history of either 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a) (1) or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(d) which indicates that Congress gave any special consideration to the status of Indian treaties when it passed either of these statutes (both of which passed subsequently to the Treaty of 1854 with the Menominee Indians). This being so we do not rely on either presumption in reaching our decision. Instead, we consider whether in fact any treaty right has been abrogated, the extent of any such abrogation, and finally the purpose to be served by the challenged congressional acts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
