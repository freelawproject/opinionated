One regula-lation, entitled Part 125 \u2014 Label Statements Concerning Dietary Properties of Food Purporting To Be Or Represented For Special Dietary Uses, would replace corresponding parts of an existing regulation issued in 1955, 21 C.F.R. Pt. 125. The other, entitled Part 80 \u2014 Definitions And Standards Of Identity For Food For Special Dietary Uses, embodies a new concept in regard to this type of \u201cfood.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both were published in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Federal Register of August 2, 1973, 38 F.R. 20708-18, 20730-40, to become fully effective January 1, 1975. The primary statutory authority invoked for the Regulations lies in the first sentence of \u00a7 401:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-4\">Whenever in the judgment of the Secretary such action will promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers, he shall promulgate regulations fixing and establishing for any food, under its common or usual name so far as practicable, a reasonable definition and standard of identity, a reasonable standard of quality, and/or reasonable standards of fill of container.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 341, and in \u00a7 403, which provides <em>inter alia </em>that a food shall be deemed to be misbranded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-6\">(j) If it purports to be or is represented for special dietary uses, unless its label bears such information concerning its vitamin, mineral, and other dietary properties as the Secretary determines to be, and by regulations prescribes as, necessary in order fully to inform purchasers as to its value for such uses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">The proceedings which culminated in these regulations began with a Notice of Proposal To Revise Regulations published in the Federal Register of June 20, 1962, 27 F.R. 5815. Extensive revisions were made in response to comments, but numerous parties filed objections to the proposed revised regulations \u25a0 and requests \u2019for a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 701(e)(2), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 371(e) (2). The proposed regulations were accordingly stayed for an evidentiary hearing under \u00a7 701(e)(3), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (e)(3). This lasted ,for more than 22 months and developed a transcript of 32,405 pages, together with hundreds of exhibits and other record materials. In \u2022the Federal Register of January 19, 1973, the FDA published proposed findings and conclusions and tentative versions of the regulations for a final round of exceptions and comments, 38 F.R. 2143 (1973). After considering these, the agency promulgated the final regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">As indicated, the novelty of the regulations lies in the FDA\u2019s invoking, with respect to the many vitamins and minerals and the myriad combinations thereof, its power to prescribe a standard of identity under \u00a7 401. The new Part 80 begins, \u00a7 80.1(a), by describing as its object \u201cdietary supplements of vitamins and/or minerals\u201d which \u201cpurport to be or are represented for special dietary use by man to supplement his diet by increasing the total dietary intake of one or more of the essential vitamins and/or minerals specified in paragraph (f) of this section.\u201d The regulation then goes on as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-12\">(b) Classifications of dietary sup- . plements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-13\">(1) A dietary supplement shall contain only those vitamins and/or minerals listed in paragraph (f) of this section and shall be offered for its vitamin and/or mineral content only in the following combinations, with the provision that any vitamin or mineral defined as optional in paragraph (f) of this section may be omitted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-14\">(i) All vitamins and minerals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-15\">(ii) All vitamins.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-16\">(iii) All minerals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-17\">(iv) All vitamins and the mineral iron.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-18\">(v) Inclusion of the optional ingredients vitamin D and/or phosphorus in a multivitamin, multimineral, or multivitamin and multimineral supplement does not require inclusion of any additional optional ingredients. Inclusion of the optional ingredients biotin and pantothenic acid and/or copper and zinc in such products does not require inclusion of vitamin D and/or phosphorus when the latter two nutrients are optional. The inclusion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>any of the other optional ingredients (biotin or pantothenic acid for vitamins and copper or zinc for minerals) requires the inclusion of both such optional ingredients if the product is a multivitamin or multimineral supplement, and requires the inclusion of all four such ingredients if the product is a multivitamin and multimineral supplement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-4\">(2) A dietary supplement may also be composed of any single vitamin or mineral listed in paragraph (f) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Before going further it is necessary to refer to another major innovation in the regulations. The previous regulation had required, 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 125.3(a) (1) and (2), \u00a7 125.4(a)(1) and (2), that in the case of certain vitamins and minerals the label of a food represented for special dietary use should disclose the percentage of the designated \u201cminimum daily requirement\u201d which would be \u201csupplied by such food when consumed in a specified quantity during a period of one day\u201d; for other vitamins and minerals the requirement was merely that the label state the quantity of the nutrient contained in a specified quantity of such food. The regulations here under challenge substituted for \u201cminimum daily requirements\u201d a new concept of \u201cU.S. Recommended Daily Allowances.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These are'stated, \u00a7 80.1(f)(2), to have been derived by the FDA from the Recommended Dietary Allowances published by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council, and to be \u201csubject to amendment from time to time as more information on human nutrition becomes available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Section 80.1(f)(1) sets forth \u201cthe permissible qualitative and quantitative composition of dietary supplements of vitamins and/or minerals\u201d in the form of a table, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">\n<img class=\"p\"

If the provisions of both this section and \u00a7 1.17 apply to a food, the labeling ot such food shall conform to the labeling established in this section except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>that the labeling established in paragraph .(c) of \u00a7 1.17 of this chapter, including the order for listing vitamins and minerals established in paragraph (c)(7)(iv) of that section, shall be used in lieu of the labeling established in paragraph (i) (1) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-4\">(6) Raw agricultural commodities (including marine products) which by their nature are sources of a specific vitamin(s) and/or mineral(s) at a level that, if it had been added, would have brought them within the definition of a dietary supplement. Such shall meet all the requirements of this section if they are represented as dietary supplements. Such foods may also be used as a source of specific vitamins and/or minerals in dietary supplements meeting the requirements of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-5\">(7) A food with nutrients restored to pre-processing levels or added pursuant to \u00a7 1.8(e) of this chapter so that it is not nutritionally inferior to the food for which it substitutes and which it resembles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Finally, two provisions of \u00a7 125.1 are parts of this basic regulatory scheme. Starting with a reference to \u00a7 125.1(b), which sets out the same vitamins and minerals as listed in the table reproduced above along with the U. S. RDA\u2019s for the three classes of consumers there listed and a fourth class of \u201cinfants,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u00a7 125.1(c) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-7\">(c) In addition to the vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (b) of this section, vitamin K, choline, and the minerals chlorine, potassium, sodium, sulfur, fluorine, and manganese are recognized as essential in human nutrition, but no U. S. Recommended Daily Allowance (U. S. RDA) has been established for these nutrients. These nutrients are not appropriate for addition to general purpose foods or dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals but may be added to such other foods for special dietary use as infant formulas, and foods represented for use solely under medical supervision to meet nutritional requirements in specific medical conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">And \u00a7 125.1(h) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-12\">(h) Any product containing more than the upper limit of the U. S. RDA per serving (or where appropriate, per daily recommended quantity) of a vitamin or mineral as specified in \u00a7 80.1 (f) (1) of this chapter is a drug, except for conventional foods which contain naturally-occurring amounts in excess of these limits or which contain added amounts in excess of these limits pursuant to \u00a7 1.8(e) of this chapter so that it is not nutritionally inferior to the food for which it substitutes and which it resembles, and except as provided for in a specific regulation for such special dietary foods as infant formulas or foods which are represented for use solely under medical supervision to meet nutritional requirements in specific medical conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-13\">It will be more convenient to defer description of other relevant provisions of the Regulations until subsequent discussion of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">I. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">We must first deal with the claim of National Nutritional Foods Association, Solgar Co., Inc., and National Association \u2022 of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers that we lack jurisdiction to review eight provisions which these very petitioners have challenged. These are (1) \u00a7 80.1 (b)(2), which has the effect of restricting the quantity of a single vitamin or mineral that may be sold in a dietary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>supplement; (2) \u00a7 80.1(b) (5), which exempts certain foods from the operation of \u00a7 80.1 if those foods are sold in servings not exceeding 50% of the U. S. RDA\u2019s and satisfy special label and labeling requirements; (3) the definition of \u201cspecial dietary use\u201d in \u00a7 125.1(a); (4) \u00a7 125.1(c), quoted above, which limits the inclusion of various nutrients for which RDA\u2019s have not been established; (5) \u00a7 125.2(a), which requires the principal display panel of the label of food for special dietary use to bear a statement of the usefulness of the food, a requirement which these petitioners consider, in light of one of the Commissioner\u2019s findings of fact (No. 3, 38 F.R. 20713 (1973)), to have the effect of prohibiting the listing and thus the inclusion of certain types and amounts of ingredients; (6) \u00a7 125.2(b), which prohibits six categories of statements in the labeling (as distinguished from the label) of foods for special dietary use, as well as \u00a7 80.1 (m), which incorporates by reference the label and labeling prohibitions contained in \u00a7 125.2(b); (7) \u00a7 125.2(b) (5), one of the six categories just mentioned, which prohibits the marketing of otherwise allowable foods for special dietary use if they contain ingredients the need for which in human nutrition has not been established; and (8) \u00a7 125.1(h), quoted above, which, with some exceptions, classifies as a drug any product containing in one serving or in the daily recommended quantity more than the upper limit of the U. S. RDA\u2019s specified in the table.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">The basis for the challenge to our power to review the eight provisions is this: The jurisdiction of a court of appeals under \u00a7 701(f) to review orders of the FDA is limited, so far as here pertinent, to orders promulgated under \u00a7 401, authorizing prescription of standards of identity, and \u00a7 403(j), authorizing the prescription of regulations concerning the labels of foods purporting to be or represented for special dietary uses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A regulation issued under other sections, such as \u00a7 403(a), which deems a food \u201cmisbranded\u201d if its labeling \u201cis false or misleading in any particular,\u201d or \u00a7 701 (a), the FDA\u2019s general authority \u201cto promulgate regulations for the efficient enforcement\u201d of the statute, must be challenged by an action in a district court. Compare Gardner v. Toilet Goods Ass\u2019n, 387 U.S. 167, 87 S.Ct. 1526, 18 L.Ed.2d 704 (1967), sustaining a suit in the district court attacking a general regulation promulgated under \u00a7 701(a) concerning color additives despite the availability of review of a decision refusing to approve a particular additive in a court of appeals by a combination of \u00a7 706(d), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 376(d), and \u00a7 701(f). See also Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967). Any authority to promulgate the eight provisions, say these petitioners, must have arisen from sections of the Act other than \u00a7\u00a7 401 or 403 (j).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">Petitioners\u2019 argument in the main confuses the question of jurisdiction with the merits. If the Commissioner rested his action on an arguable interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 401 or 403(j), our jurisdiction is not defeated by the possibility, even the probability, that we may ultimately reject his interpretation. As Mr. Justice Black pointed out in Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682-683, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946), such a decision would be an exercise of jurisdiction, not a refusal to exercise it. And the case would not stand differently if, having rejected the Commissioner\u2019s position under the cited sections, we should find his action sustainable under others. Having acquired jurisdiction on the basis of the Commissioner\u2019s arguable invocation of \u00a7\u00a7 401 or 403(j), we would be bound to decide the case as required by law. The situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>is <em>a fortiori </em>to that where a federal court, having acquired jurisdiction of a suit challenging state action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) because of a substantial constitutional claim, may decide pendent statutory claims over which it might not otherwise have jurisdiction because of lack of the required jurisdictional amount. See Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U.S. 397, 90 S.Ct. 1207, 25 L.Ed.2d 442 (1970); Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974); Almenares v. Wyman, 453 F.2d 1075 (2 Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 944, 92 S.Ct. 962, 30 L.Ed.2d 815 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">With the possible exception of \u00a7 125.1(h), all the provisions, review of which is claimed to lie outside our jurisdiction, were rested at least in part on \u00a7\u00a7 401 or 403 (j). At this stage mere statement is practically sufficient to show that the FDA\u2019s position was fairly arguable,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as our subsequent discussion will demonstrate in greater detail. If \u00a7 125.1(h) stood alone, it would seem indeed that this was a regulation issued under the general rulemaking authority of \u00a7 701(a), interpreting the term \u201cdrug\u201d in \u00a7 201(g)(1)(B), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(g) -(1) (B),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that the petition to review should be dismissed as was done in an unreported order, Citizens for Truth in Nutrition v. Food and Drug Administration, No. 73-2826 (2 Cir., Mar. 4, 1974), where the court dismissed a petition to review an interpretive regulation issued under \u00a7 701(a), 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.94 and 3.95, requiring that preparations of vitamins A and D in dosages in excess of 10,000 and 400 international units, respectively, should be restricted to sale as \u201cprescription drugs\u201d under \u00a7 503(b) (1)(B), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 353(b)(1)(B), and labeled accordingly. See National Nutritional Foods Ass\u2019n v. Weinberger, 366 F.Supp. 1341, 1343-1344 (S.D.N.Y.) [denial of temporary injunction], aff\u2019d, 491 F.2d 845 (2 Cir. 1973), 376 F.Supp. 142 (S.D.N.Y.1974) [dismissal of complaint], appeal pending. But here the provision stands as an integral part of a regulation colorably alleged to rest on \u00a7\u00a7 401 and 403(j). The same important policy considerations of economy in judicial time which underlie the doctrine of \u201cpendent jurisdiction\u201d as viewed in other contexts apply <em>a fortiori </em>when the issue is whether a federal court of appeals with clear jurisdiction to review almost all provisions of a comprehensive set of regulations should finish the job or relegate a single provision to suit in a federal district court, possibly in another circuit, whose decision, of course, would be subject to appeal to a court of appeals.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>We hold that we have jurisdiction to consider all issues tendered.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">II. <em>Standards of Identity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The hardest issues in the case are (1) whether the FDA has power to set standards of identity for dietary supplements in such a way that vitamin and mineral products containing vitamins and/or minerals in nonstandardized combinations or whose daily dosage of any nutrient as specified in their labels exceeds the upper limit of the U. S. RDA\u2019s<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> will be deemed misbranded under \u00a7 403(g), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343(g), <em>see </em>p. 775 <em>infra, </em>if they are offered for sale as foods; and, if so, (2) whether there was substantial evidence to support what the agency did. In this part of the opinion we shall deal with the issues generally, deferring to Part IV more detailed discussion of the evidentiary question with respect to the quantitative limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">We should make clear at the outset that we do not at all join in the vituperation showered on the FDA by some of the petitioners.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Confronted with a difficult problem, the agency developed an innovative solution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The questions for us are whether, giving the agency full credit for good intentions and according appropriate weight to its expertise, its action was within the powers that Congress has chosen to confer and is supported by substantial evidence. The conflicting considerations are neatly framed in two opinions of Mr. Justice Frankfurter. Writing of both the Food and Drugs Act of 1906 and the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 in United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277, 280, 64 S.Ct. 134, 136, 88 L.Ed. 48 (1943), he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-11\">The purposes of this legislation thus touch phases of the lives and health of people which, in the circumstances of modern industrialism, are largely beyond self-protection. Regard for these purposes should infuse construction of the legislation if it is to be treated as a working instrument of government and not merely as a collection of English words.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">But eight years later he warned in 62 Cases of Jam v. United States, 340 U.S. 593, 600, 71 S.Ct. 515, 520, 95 L.Ed. 566 (1951):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-13\">In our anxiety to effectuate the congressional purpose of protecting the public, we must take care not to extend the scope of the statute beyond the point where Congress indicated it would stop.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-14\">We begin by rejecting the argument of some petitioners that the FDA could not proceed simultaneously under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 401 and 403(j). Section 403(g) says that a food shall be deemed misbranded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-4\">If it purports to be or is represented as a food for which a definition and standard of identity has been prescribed by regulations as provided by section 341 of this title, unless (1) it conforms to such definition and standard, and (2) its label bears the name of the food specified in the definition and standard, and, insofar as may be required by such regulations, the common names of optional ingredients (other than spices, flavoring, and coloring) present in such food.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343(g). The claim is that this exhausts the FDA\u2019s power with respect to a label when a definition and standard of identity have been prescribed and that, conversely, label regulation under \u00a7 403(j) exhausts the agency\u2019s power with respect to foods purporting to be or represented for special dietary uses. It is argued that the two subsections represent two contrasting and mutually exclusive regulatory philosophies, each appropriate only within its limited sphere: With respect to \u201cfoods with long histories of use,\u201d the approach was to hold manufacturers to a \u201c \u2018time-honored\u2019 standard\u201d by use of the standard of identity power and the accompanying limited authority of \u00a7 403(g); but with respect to the less familiar foods for special dietary use, \u201cwhere there are no time-honored recipes and where the knowledge of the importance of vitamins and minerals to health is changing rapidly,\u201d a requirement of full disclosure was thought better protection for the consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">This argument finds support neither in the language of the statute nor in its legislative history. In sharp contrast to \u00a7 403(i),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> nothing in \u00a7 403(j) restricts its applicability to cases where no standard of identity has been prescribed. The fair reading of the statute is rather that, in the case of foods for special dietary uses for which standards of identity have been prescribed, Congress wished to authorize the FDA to require label disclosure not only of optional properties, as in the case of other foods with standards of identity, but of mandatory ones as well. Nothing in the legislative history is persuasive to the contrary. The statement in Federal Security Administrator v. Quaker Oats Co., 318 U.S. 218, 230, 63 S.Ct. 589, 596, 87 L.Ed. 724 (1943), that the purpose of Congress was \u201cto require informative labeling only where no such standard [of identity] had been promulgated, where the food did not purport to comply with a standard, or where the regulations permitted optional ingredients and required their mention on the label,\u201d <em>see also </em>318 U.S. at 232, 63 S.Ct. 589, was made with a view only to the interrelationship of subsections 403(g) and (i), and has no bearing on subsection 403 (j).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">The evidence supporting the need for both a qualitative and a quantitative standard of identity was impressive. We set out below the more important findings of fact (omitting references):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-11\">3. The establishment of a standard of identity and quantitative limits for the nutrient ingredients in dietary supplements will reduce consumer confusion concerning choice of dietary supplements by insuring a basically rational formula for all products.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-12\">7. The sale and use of vitamin/mineral preparations in the United States are extensive, running into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>hundreds of millions of dollars annually in wholesale bulk value, and involve three-fourths of American households. The majority of such preparations differ qualitatively and quantitatively from each other, presenting a bewildering variety to the consumer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-4\">8. Many dietary supplements are nutritionally irrational, in that they provide quantitative levels and qualitative combinations of nutrients for which no human individual need could possibly exist, if the products are used only as dietary supplements. Lay persons are incapable of determining, by themselves, whether they have or are likely to develop vitamin or mineral deficiencies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-5\">9. Although approximately 20 percent of the users of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals actually use those articles to supplement or balance their diet, more than 40 percent of those persons admit they have no idea which vitamins or minerals, if any, are not sufficiently supplied by their diet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-6\">10. Certain basic vitamins and/or minerals should be included in all articles offered as multivitamin and/or multimineral supplements. The remaining group of appropriate vitamins and/or minerals are considered to be scientifically optional for inclusion. The mandatory group of vitamins and/or minerals found in multivitamin and/or multimineral supplements should include all those listed in the table entitled \u201cRecommended Daily Dietary Allowances, Revised 1968\u201d in publication 1694 of the National Academy of Sciences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">38 F.R. 20734-35 (1973). And again:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-8\">22. The establishment of qualitative and quantitative limits on the composition of dietary supplements will reduce consumer confusion concerning choice of dietary supplements by ensuring a basically rational formula for all products.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 20735. Although some petitioners have pointed up record references in these findings of fact which the FDA is mis-citing or misreading, and could have pointed up many more, nevertheless the agency had ample evidence to conclude that a consumer seeking a dietary supplement of a given vitamin or mineral, whether singly or in combination with others, is faced with a dazzling array of recommended daily dosages and that a consumer seeking a multiple supplement is faced with an equally dazzling array of combinations; that neither consumer is given any basis for intelligent selection ; and that it would \u201cpromote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers,\u201d Conclusion of Law |f 1, 38 F.R. 20737 (1973), quoting \u00a7 401, to promulgate the qualitative and quantitative standards of identity of new Part 80, <em>see </em>Conclusions of Law jfjf 2, 3, 38 F.R. 20737 (1973). An FDA compliance officer submitted a chart, not purporting to be exhaustive, showing 59 multivitamin and/or multimineral products he had found on the market. The number of ingredients ranged from a low of 9 to a high of 57, with all kinds of intermediate variations. The dosage per tablet or capsule of vitamin C, for example, ranged from 30 to 500 mg., and the compliance officer referred to hundreds of instances of labels showing a daily dosage of a given mineral or vitamin in excess of the RDA. Offering a specially acute example of this, Dr. Herbert, an FDA witness, cited a particular <em>B12 </em>supplement sold as a general dietary supplement which had 25 times the strength even a strict vegetarian would need. There was evidence from which the agency was entitled to conclude that consumers are ill-equipped to choose from this galaxy of offerings<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>\u2014as if the point would be in doubt in any event. And if expert testimony on the precise question of the usefulness of the standards of identity in overcoming all this was necessary, the FDA took the precaution of getting some \u2014 albeit of a conclusory nature.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">The FDA considers, with what seems to us, at least in general, <em>cf. </em>p. 783 <em>infra, </em>entirely sufficient reason, that neither the new label requirements nor additions that might be made to these will suffice to eliminate consumer confusion. The subject matter is simply too recondite and the offering of products too diverse for a label alone to be \u201cclear enough so that, in the words of the prophet Isaiah, \u2018wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein\u2019 . . .,\u201d General Motors Corp. v. FTC, 114 F.2d 33, 36 (2 Cir. 1940) (A. N. Hand, J.), cert. denied, 312 U.S. 682, 61 S.Ct. 550, 85 L.Ed. 1120 (1941). Thus, again passing to Part IV of this opinion special problems with respect to the propriety of using the U. S. RDA\u2019s to set maximum daily dosages, and passing to Part V an important and related procedural objection, we hold the agency was justified, as a matter of good sense, in concluding that the stated purposes of \u00a7 401 would be furthered by promulgating qualitative and quantitative standards of identity in this area so as to allow for some 30-odd products (each with limited variability of daily dosages) rather than the hundreds now on the shelves of food and drug stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">There remain, however, the questions whether the standards promulgated are within the agency\u2019s general statutory power and, if so, whether they are \u201creasonable\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 401. Before considering these questions, it will be useful to review the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">The Supreme Court has dealt with \u00a7 401 on only two occasions in the 36 years of the statute\u2019s history. The first was Federal Security Administrator v. Quaker Oats Co., <em>supra, </em>318 U.S. 218, 63 S.Ct. 589, 87 L.Ed. 724. Quaker Oats had been marketing a concededly wholesome and accurately labeled product as \u201cQuaker Farina Wheat Cereal Enriched with Vitamin D\u201d or \u201cQuaker Farina Enriched by the Sunshine Vitamin.\u201d The Administrator promulgated a standard of identity for farina which made no provision for the addition of any ingredient; he promulgated another standard for enriched farina which required the addition of prescribed minimum quantities of vitamin Bi, riboflavin, nicotinic acid and iron, ingredients of natural wheat lost in modern milling processes, and which allowed enrichment by vitamin D or certain minerals, <em>see </em>Quaker Oats Co. v. Federal Security Administrator, 129 F.2d 76, 78 (7 Cir. 1942), only as optional additional ingredients. The Quaker Oats product thus could not be sold either as \u201cfarina\u201d since it contained the additional ingredient vitamin D, or as \u201cenriched farina\u201d since it did not contain the prescribed enrichment. The Court sustained the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">The decision could perhaps have been rested on the basis that Quaker Oats had no real intention of marketing its product as farina <em>simpliciter </em>or as something clearly <em>sui generis, </em>and that its joinder of the words \u201cfarina\u201d and \u201cenriched\u201d was misleading; the Administrator, this argument would run, was entitled to encourage and safeguard a belief on the part of consumers that \u201cenrichment\u201d would replace all the elements removed from natural wheat by the milling process, of which vitamin D is not one. But Chief Justice Stone preferred to uphold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>directly the barring of the product from sale as <em>either </em>enriched farina <em>or </em>farina.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Court began by mentioning that \u201c[t]he composition of these enriched products [flours and farinas] varies widely,\u201d 318 U.S. at 225 &amp; n. 5, 63 S.Ct. at 594, although the cited variants were eight rather than the hundreds at issue here. It referred, in language entirely applicable here, to testimony by nutritionists that \u201csuch products, beca\u00fase of the variety and combination of added ingredients, are widely variable in nutritional value; and that consumers generally lack knowledge of \u2022 the relative value of such ingredients and combinations of them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226, 63 S.Ct. at 594. As here, there was expert testimony tending to support a conclusion of consumer confusion and recommending the adoption of the definitions and standards. <em>Id. </em>at 226, 228-229, 63 S.Ct. 589. Thus, after referring to the statutory criterion of promoting \u201chonesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers,\u201d Chief Justice Stone said that \u201c[t]aking into account the. evidence of public demand for vitamin-enriched foods, their increasing sale, their variable vitamin composition and dietary value, and the general lack of consumer knowledge of such values,\u201d there was sufficient evidence \u201cto support the Administrator\u2019s judgment that, in the absence of appropriate standards of identity, consumer confusion would ensue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228-229, 63 S.Ct. at 595. In the most critical passage of the opinion, the Chief Justice summed up, <em>id. </em>at 230-231, 63 S.Ct. at 596 (footnote omitted) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-3\">The provisions for standards of identity thus reflect a recognition by Congress of the inability of consumers in some cases to determine, solely on the basis of informative labeling, the relative merits of a variety of products superficially resembling each other. We cannot say that such a standard of identity, designed to eliminate a source of confusion to purchasers\u2014 which otherwise would be likely to facilitate unfair dealing and make protection of the consumer difficult \u2014 will not \u201cpromote honesty and fair dealing\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARMv\">Turning finally to the argument that \u201cit is unreasonable to prohibit the addition to farina of vitamin D as an optional ingredient while permitting its addition as an optional ingredient to enriched farina,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 231, 63 S.Ct. at 597, the Court said, <em>id. </em>at 232-233, 63 S.Ct. at 597:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-6\">We must reject at the outset the argument earnestly pressed upon us that the statute does not contemplate a regulation excluding a wholesome and beneficial ingredient from the definition and standard of identity of a food. The statutory purpose to fix a definition of identity of an article of food sold under its common or usual name would be defeated if producers were free to add ingredients, however wholesome, which are not within the definition ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-7\">Since the definition of identity of a vitamin-treated food, marketed under its common or usual name,' involves the inclusion of some vitamin ingredients and the exclusion of others, the Administrator necessarily has a large range of choice in determining what may be included and what excluded. It is not necessarily a valid objection to his choice that another could reasonably have been made. The judicial is not to be substituted for the legislative judgment. It is enough that the Administrator has acted within the statutory bounds of his authority, and that his choice among possible alternative standards adapted to the statutory end is one which a rational person could have made ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">Although some petitioners contend that 62 Cases of Jam v. United States, <em>supra, </em>340 U.S. 593, 71 S.Ct. 515, 95 L.Ed. 566, sounded a retreat from <em>Quaker Oats, </em>we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>do not consider it to be such.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The case turned on \u00a7 403(c), which says that a food shall be deemed misbranded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-4\">If it is an imitation of another food, unless its label bears, in type of uniform size and prominence, the word \u201cimitation\u201d and, immediately thereafter, the name of the food imitated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A28\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343(c). The Court held that a product labeled as an imitation jam was not misbranded simply because it contained less fruit than would have been dictated by the standard of identity for a fruit jam. We need not determine whether this would permit a manufacturer to market a product containing less than the prescribed minimum limits for vitamins and/or minerals \u2014 or containing more than the maxima or a nonstandard combination \u2014 as an imitation; none of the manufacturer petitioners has expressed any desire to do this and none of the consumer petitioners has intimated any interest in having such products available.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The cases in the courts of appeals certainly do not detract from <em>Quaker Oats, </em>as they hardly could, and may even go a bit beyond it in one particular hereinafter discussed, <em>see </em>note 20 <em>infra. </em>The leading ones are Libby, McNeill &amp; Libby v. United States, 148 F.2d 71 (2 Cir. 1945), upholding the seizure as misbranded of a product, sold as \u201ctomato catsup with preservative,\u201d which contained sodium benzoate in addition to the prescribed ingredients for catsup; United States v. 20 Cases . . . \u201cBuitoni 20% Protein Spaghetti,\u201d 130 F.Supp. 715 (D.Del.1954), aff\u2019d on the opinion below, 228 F.2d 912 (3 Cir. 1956), upholding the seizure of spaghetti containing 20% protein as against a permitted maximum of 13%; and, finally, a case which did not seriously test the limits of the agency\u2019s statutory authority, Corn Products Co. v. HEW, 427 F.2d 511 (3 Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 957, 91 S.Ct. 354, 27 L.Ed.2d 265 (1970), upholding a regulation which required a 90% peanut content in peanut butter.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">So far as concerns the statutory text, petitioners\u2019 main argument is that, in fixing a standard of identity for \u201cdietary supplements\u201d of vitamins and/or minerals, the FDA has gone beyond its authority since this is not a \u201ccommon or usual name\u201d of a particular food but rather an imposed functionally oriented denotation of a class of foods. The statute says, however, that a reasonable definition and standard of identity shall be prescribed for a food \u201cunder its common or usual name <em>so far as practicable\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied); Congress thus seems to have envisioned the possible need to prescribe a reasonable definition and standard of identity for a food or a class of foods under something other than \u201cits common or usual name.\u201d Moreover, our examination of the record discloses that, despite the enormous variations of content within the class of dietary supplements, vitamin and/or mineral preparations and multivitamin and/or multimineral preparations are commonly sold under the shared rubric \u201cdietary supplement.\u201d While this may initially have been due to a desire of the producers to make clear that they were operating under the label requirements of Part 125 rather than of \u00a7 502, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352, relating to drugs, nevertheless the name has become \u201ccommon and usual\u201d for the full range of such products. Indeed in light of this, given a product of the kind here at issue and giving the manufacturer credit for not harboring a therapeutic intent so that his product is not thereby classifiable as a drug, <em>see </em>Part III <em>infra, </em>the agency had every reason to conclude that such a product by its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>very existence \u201cpurports to be\u201d what most people now know as a \u201cdietary supplement.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>Libby, McNeill &amp; Libby v. United States, <em>supra, </em>148 F.2d at 72-73; United States v. 20 Cases . \u201cBuitoni 20% Protein Spaghetti,\u201d 130 F.Supp. at 717-718; note 20 <em>infra. </em>The conclusion is in no way rebutted by a claim that \u201cdietary supplement\u201d describes a class of foods rather than a single food, since it is in the very nature of a standard of identity that it standardizes to a single formula (or here a selected group of formulae) what used to be a varied class of products. Any remaining objection must rather be to the purposes and consequences of delineating the class in a particular way, which brings us to petitioners\u2019 second line of attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">This is based on legislative history. As petitioners correctly point out, Congress\u2019 dominant concern in enacting \u00a7\u00a7 401 and 403(g) was to combat \u201ceconomic adulteration.\u201d One of the Senate Reports, S.Rep.No.361, 74th Cong. 1st Sess. (1935), in Dunn, Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 237, 245-46 (1938) [hereinafter cited as Dunn], noted, for example, that \u201c[b] utter [before enactment of the earlier Butter Standards Act] was found on the market with a fat content varying from about 66 to 85 percent or more. Some manufacturers deliberately worked water into their product, thus obtaining butter prices for water and at the same time curtailing the market for the dairy-farmers\u2019 butterfat . . . Conditions similar to those which prevailed with respect to butter exist today with many other food commodities and can be corrected only by the action here authorized.\u201d A later House Report on the same bill, H.R.Rep.No.2139, 75th Cong. 3d Sess. (1938), in Dunn at 815, 819, said, \u201cOne great weakness in the present food and drugs law is the absence of authoritative definitions and standards of identity except in the case of butter and some canned foods. The Government repeatedly has had difficulty in holding such articles as commercial jams and preserves and many other foods to the time-honored standards employed by* housewives and reputable manufacturers. The housewife makes preserves by using equal parts of fruit and sugar. The fruit is the expensive ingredient, and there has been a tendency on the part of some manufacturers to use less and less fruit and more and more sugar. ... By authorizing the establishment of definitions and standards of identity this.bill meets the demands of legitimate industry and will effectively prevent the chiseling operations of the small minority of manufacturers . . . .\u201d Petitioners also place great reliance on a passage where the Senate Report went on to say that \u00a7 401 sought to prevent products with nonstandard \u2014 and generally cheapened \u2014 -recipes from being marketed under standard-product names, but was not intended to <em>bar </em>the marketing as a food of any recipe not proved harmful: \u201cIt should be noted that the operation of this provision will in no way interfere with the marketing of any food which is wholesome but which does not meet the definition and standard, or for which no definition and standard has been provided; but if an article is sold under a name for which a definition and standard has been provided, it must conform to the regulation.\u201d S.Rep.No.361, <em>supra, </em>in Dunn at 246. The same thought appears in the House Report: \u201cUnder this a single reasonable standard of quality can be prescribed for any food and if the product falls below this standard it must be labeled as substandard [but can still be marketed].\u201d H.R.Rep.No.2139, <em>supra, </em>in Dunn at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">Again we find several answers. The most obvious is that Congress was not focusing on any such problem as is presented here. Even if Congress\u2019 paramount concern in enacting \u00a7 401 was with cases of economic adulteration, any limitation of the section\u2019s scope to such instances would run afoul of the portion of <em>Quaker Oats </em>which sustained the banning of the vitamin D enriched product <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>from sale even as farina.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> A rule that a standard of identity may never totally ban the sale of a product, provided only that it be labeled as substandard, may also have gone by the board with <em>Quaker Oats; </em>in 62 Cases of Jam, <em>supra, </em>340 U.S. at 598, 71 S.Ct. 515, Mr. Justice Frankfurter seems to have read that case as holding that the product \u201ccould not be sold\u201d in any form.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Moreover, even if a prohibition of total bans might make sense in some situations, the present case is precisely the type of case where, under the logic of <em>Quaker Oats, </em>it would not apply. For while that decision establishes beyond question that Congress wanted \u00a7 401 to be read to cover some nonadulteration cases such as that here' in issue, so much of the legislative history earlier quoted as suggests a rule against total bans by use of the \u00a7 401 power <em>was </em>directed narrowly to adulteration and similar problems. The remarks in <em>the </em>Senate and House Reports to the effect that there will be no total bans thus say nothing more than that <em>cheapened </em>products may still be marketed, provided they are properly marked. But here, as in the \u201cfarina\u201d branch of <em>Quaker Oats, </em>not cheapening but the <em>variety </em>of available products is the problem; to allow the total array to continue to be marketed under some other name \u2014 for example, by avoiding use of the term \u201cdietary supplement\u201d or any equivalent \u2014 -would, in such a special situation, render useless the \u00a7 401 power which we believe Congress intended to have available to the agency in a variety of unanticipated circumstances such as that now presented. The remarks in the legislative history regarding total bans simply do not speak therefore to cases such as that before us.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>The petitioners also argue that the standard of identity is not \u201creasonable\u201d as required by the language of \u00a7 401 or, for similar reasons, is \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201ccapricious\u201d within the terms of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706. Much of their fire here is directed at the upper limits; they say essentially that there can be nothing wrong in giving a consumer more of a good thing when there is no claim of toxic effect. But the argument ignores that the purpose of a standard of identity is not simply to protect against unwholesomeness or adulteration but to \u201cpromote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers.\u201d Advertising a potency in excess of the upper limits is bound to make consumers think they are getting a superior product when, in .the FDA\u2019s view, they are not; furthermore, particularly in light of experience to date with the minimum daily requirements and passing still the appropriateness of the use of the RDA\u2019s for this purpose, the agency was far from irrational in concluding that, at least in general, <em>see </em>p. 783 <em>infra, </em>the problem would not be fully obviated by prescribing a label statement that the potencies exceeded the RDA\u2019s by particular amounts. Petitioners argue also that it is unreasonable to prevent a purchaser from obtaining any combination he may desire by restricting him to the FDA\u2019s list of all vitamins and minerals, all vitamins, all minerals, or all vitamins and iron. So far as concerns the sophisticated purchaser this may well be so. But the FDA was entitled to give thought to the ordinary consumer, who may be harmed, for example, by purchasing a less inclusive combination while believing that he is getting everything he needs. Again it was far from irrational, at least as a general matter, for the agency to conclude that no label statement could fully meet this problem. Striking a proper balance among the interests of sophisticated and unsophisticated consumers is for the agency, not for a reviewing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Some petitioners urge that if a purchaser of a combination wishes more than the upper limit of some particular vitamin or mineral, he will be condemned to more than he wants of many others. But this ignores that such a purchaser, who by very statement is one of some sophistication, can avoid the problem by taking both the combination and the single vitamin.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> To be sure, even this may give him a dosage somewhat exceeding precisely what he desires,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> but again the FDA was entitled to weigh such disadvantages against what it considered the larger good.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Concededly, in each of the situations we have just discussed, the consumer who is disappointed by not being able to obtain precisely the dosage or combination he seeks in the standardized products is likely to find his costs somewhat increased if he sets about achieving the same result by purchasing larger numbers of a particular type of pill, or even by purchasing a little of this and a little of that. Such an increase in effective price, and the likely consequential de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>crease in unit sales by the manufacturers, is, however, a paradigmatic example of the kind of consideration the agency may find outweighed by public needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">Finally, the fact that the agency chose not to extend the standard of identity requirements to the nonessential nutrients listed in \u00a7 125.2(b)(5), <em>see </em>n. 68 <em>infra, </em>when individually marketed in the limited manner permitted by that subsection, or, \u00a7 80.1(b)(5), <em>supra, </em>to vitamins and minerals in daily dosages less than 50% of the adult U. S. RDA not represented as dietary supplements and labeled in accordance with 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.17, <em>cf. </em>38 F.R. 6951, 6959-61 (1973), in no way renders the regulation unreasonable or arbitrary within its selected sphere. The Agency might well have believed that the preclusion from marketing the exempted products as dietary supplements, together with the present and possible future provisions of \u00a7 1.17 specifically invoked by \u00a7 80.1(b) (5), would prevent these products from causing the same problems of consumer confusion presented by those products to which the Part 80 standards do apply; it might at the same time have believed that no such limitations on marketing technique could obviate the problem of confusion with respect, for example, to products which could honestly be said to contain very large dosages of essential nutrients, or even that it was precisely because of the drastic simplification of product displays sought by Part 80 as a whole that the limited \u00a7 125.2(b)(5) and \u00a7 80.1(b)(5) exemptions would be tolerable. In any event, it was for the agency to decide how far to reach with this particular remedial effort.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Despite all this we are concerned that the all-or-nothing attitude adopted by both sides in this long and bitter controversy may have led the FDA into proscribing some combinations whose sale should be permitted under the standards of \u00a7 401 and into prescribing some max-ima where a good case can be made for allowing an excess. <em>Cf. </em>Staley Mfg. Co. v. Secretary of Agriculture, 120 F.2d 258, 260-261 (7 Cir. 1941). Without intending either to prejudge or to be exclusive, vitamin B complex may represent an example of the former and vitamin C, sold as a single vitamin, of the latter. It is hard for us to see how a bottle plainly and simply labeled vitamin B complex contributes sufficient confusion that the goal of honesty and fair dealing should require a consumer who desires the various types of vitamin B to purchase several bottles rather than one; similarly, and in light of the testimony as to particularly wide variations in philosophy concerning the optimal intake of vitamin C, we are not convinced as things stand that a consumer who believes a 500 milligram pill of vitamin C, a quantity now frequently sold, will maintain his optimal body stores should be required to purchase five or six pills of ninety milligrams each, at greatly enhanced cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">Although the FDA has evinced some small concern for the need for such differentiation \u2014 and it was not particularly encouraged in this regard by petitioners \u2014\u2019we do not believe that it has gone far enough. In regard to the maxima, the agency did attempt, largely on the testimony of Dr. Sebrell, <em>see </em>pp. 797 <em>infra, </em>to update in scientific terms what was then the latest edition of the RDA\u2019s with respect to particular nutrients, and there was also other sporadic testimony pro and con with regard to the upper limits for particular ingredients. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>the agency made no effort to draw the parties into a comprehensive study of the possibility of raising some upper limits, and particularly of raising them even if scientific considerations were somewhat against it simply because such moves in selected cases might meet real and not altogether irrational market demands without contributing appreciably to consumer confusion, nor any particular effort to deal in its findings with such testimony on particular upper limits as did happen to arise. Neither has provision been made for ready flexibility along these lines in the future: The upper limits are to be responsive to RDA changes based on new nutritional knowledge, \u00a7\u00a7 80.1(f)(2), 125.1(b)(1); but there is no provision that they be responsive, for example, to a demonstration that (1) vast multitudes of consumers and significant numbers of nutritionists reject, <em>e. g., </em>the FDA\u2019s view that 500 mg. per day of vitamin C is without nutritional value, and that (2) the availability of such dosages as foods, clearly marked and flagged with necessary warnings, may not confuse anyone. On the present record it seems to us distinctly possible that such a demonstration could be made.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">With respect to combinations of less than all essential ingredients, the agency itself apparently recognized that it had given at most sporadic consideration to the possibility that some exceptions might be in order. Hence greater and procedurally more particularized future flexibility is presumably provided by \u00a7 80.1(b)(4), which we set out in the margin.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It has long been settled that an agency may adopt a rule shown to be appropriate for the generality of instances and leave the correction of injustices to applications by those concerned, <em>see </em>The New England Divisions Case, 261 U.S. 184, 204, 43 S.Ct. 270, 67 L.Ed. 605 (1923), and we would, of course, expect the FDA to apply this subsection in good faith and with dispatch. However, while paragraph 3 of the preamble to the final regulation, 38 F.R. 20731 (1973), implicitly suggests that some petitions seeking such particularized amendments may have been received with the exceptions to the proposed regulations, the agency has not provided us with the relevant exceptions, nor with a listing of those (if any) which included \u00a7 80.1(b)(4) petitions, nor does the preamble contain any real assurance that the agency separately considered any such particularized applications that did come in. Compare 38 F.R. 20710, U 10 (1973). Moreover, even apart from the important point that the escape clause relates only to combinations and not to the maxima, it is not sufficiently clear to us on the wording of \u00a7 80.1(b)(4), and certainly not on the cryptic wording of paragraph 3 of the preamble, that the agency intends to evaluate \u00a7 80.1(b)(4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>petitions in light of a balancing of freedoms infringed against the increased dangers of consumer. confusion which would be triggered by allowance of each additional product \u2014 as we believe the reasonableness requirement of \u00a7 401 requires it to do, in a manner set forth in greater detail below. Rather \u00a7 80.1 (b)(4) may suggest an absolute insistence on new scientific data similar to what would be required to modify the RDA\u2019s. Finally, even if the FDA would apply the appropriate criteria in this area should \u00a7 80.1(b)(4) petitions now begin to flow, it would be commercially disruptive for a product to have to be withdrawn from sale in January 1975 only to be returned to the market in July.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">In light of all these considerations, we direct that \u00a7 80.1(b)(4) be modified to permit upward revisions in the maxima for particular vitamins' or minerals and that the criteria be broadened to conform to the standards of \u00a7 401. We also believe the agency should receive and deal explicitly with applications for increases in particular upper limits and applications under the present \u00a7 80.1 (b)(4) before the regulations become effective. To this end we think it necessary to stay the regulations in their entirety, and not just those parts establishing the standard of identity, since, for example, a stay affecting only the standard of identity would force a Beomplex manufacturer to change over to the new label imposed by the new regulations while knowing full well that if his \u00a7 80.1(b)(4) application was denied his line would be off the shelves when the limited stay expired. We therefore order a stay of the regulations until six months after our judgment becomes final or June 30, 1975, whichever is later, a period which should be sufficient for the FDA to pass on at least the most meritorious applications both as to dosages and as to additional combinations.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">The FDA should establish dates for the filing of such applications and, if these should prove to be numerous, procedures to screen out the most meritorious for early hearing and decision. In determining whether it is \u201creasonable\u201d to deny a particular application, the primary consideration must of course be the degree of increase in potential consumer confusion. Since the sheer variety of products is a central problem here, the applications will in a real sense be in competition with one another, and we do not expect a very large number to be granted. It would be reasonable in resolving this competition to favor products which, because of widespread prior publicity or even just because of simplicity of terminology, are unlikely to confuse many consumers when properly labeled. Indeed, we specifically direct that the FDA consider any such applications as to vitamin C in larger dosages and vitamin B complex supplements. Moreover, against any danger of slight increases in confusion should be weighed such factors as the following: (1) how large is the consumer demand for the product at present, and how widespread any expert belief that it is not an irrational product for a significant number of consumers;<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> (2) how effectively could any potential confusion with respect to the particular product be reduced or eliminated by requiring on the label (A) with respect to a high dosage product, a legend to the effect that the FDA has determined this product contains quantities of such-and-such nutrient not normally essential to human health, or (B) with respect to a combination, a legend to the effect that the FDA has determined this product does not contain all the nutrients essential to human health;<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and (3) in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>of applications to exceed the upper limits, how dependable, if this can be determined, is the particular NS A RDA on which the upper limit is based relative to other RDA\u2019s, <em>cf. </em>Part IY <em>infra. </em>We wish to make clear that, while it would defeat the purposes of Part 80 for a very-large number of such applications to be granted, either with respect to dosage limitations or with respect to combinations of less than all essential ingredients, we expect each application to receive the most serious consideration on its merits relative to the criteria just outlined. At the same time it should be obvious to the petitioners that we are broadly sustaining the regulations and that any attempt to convert the procedures we are here directing into something like a nearly complete reopening of the proceeding will be counter-productive. Indeed, if an avalanche of petitions for exceptions should occur, the agency would be justified in denying all applications (except those as to increased dosages of vitamin C and vitamin B complex supplements), without prejudice to subsequent renewal, on this ground alone. What we are doing is to provide the industry with another chance for individualized consideration of the most meritorious cases for exceptions. An exercise of responsibility on the part of the industry will be necessary if this is to confer the benefits we intend.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">III. <em>The Banning of Certain Essential Nutrients and the Classification </em>As <em>a Drug of Any Product Containing Quantities in Excess of the Upper Limits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Before examining the validity of the U. S. RDA\u2019s for the purposes for which the FDA has used them, we shall consider two other matters which, although more comfortably seen in our view as elements of the standard of identity scheme, appear in Part 125 relating to Label Statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Section 125.1(c) recognizes that, in addition to the 12 vitamins and 7 minerals approved as mandatory or optional ingredients, <em>cf. </em>table at p. 769 <em>supra, </em>two other vitamins and six other minerals are essential to human nutrition. Nevertheless, because no U. S. RDA\u2019s have yet been established for them, these are banned \u201cfor addition to general purpose foods or dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals,\u201d although they \u201cmay be added to such other foods for special dietary use as infant formulas, and foods represented for use solely under medical supervision to meet nutritional requirements in specific medical conditions.\u201d If this language left open any possibility that these vitamins and minerals could be separately sold as foods, this would be foreclosed by \u00a7\u00a7 80.1(b)(1) and (2), and 80.1(f)(1), which effectively ban the sale as dietary supplements of any vitamins or minerals not on the approved list.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">We see no sufficient basis for such drastic treatment. At argument, government counsel sought to defend it both as a labeling requirement under \u00a7 403(j) or (a), and as a \u00a7 401 standard of identity. The regulation and the appurtenant findings of fact, however, contain no suggestion of implicit misrepresentation with respect to these nutrients comparable to the asserted basis of \u00a7 125.2(b)(5), discussed at pp.' 804-805 <em>infra, </em>so as to justify \u00a7 125.1(c) under the labeling sections; and indeed, even where such a basis was asserted in \u00a7 125.2(b) (5), it evidently was not thought sufficient to justify a ban on separate sale. Thus, the only satisfactory view of \u00a7 125.1(e) is as part of the standard of identity scheme. As such, we hold the subsection is not \u201creasonable\u201d within the terms of \u00a7 401. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that bans on separate sale of nontoxic individual nutrients may at times be within the agency\u2019s statutory authority, <em>see </em>note 21 <em>supra, </em>the agency has articulated no basis for invoking such an extreme remedy here \u2014 particularly when it is not invoked as to the \u00a7 125.2(b)(5) elements, which the agency considers of far lower, indeed of negligible, nutritional rank. Moreover, even if \u00a7 125.1 (c) were viewed exclusively as a ban on certain <em>combinations, </em>like \u00a7 125.2(b)(5), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>the evidence cited in support of the relevant finding of fact, If 3 at 38 F.R. 20713 (1973), would not suffice to make the subsection reasonable. The relevant cited evidence concentrates almost exclusively on the lack of need for supplementation of the \u00a7 125.2(b)(5) elements; indeed, the cited evidence would support \u00a7 125.1(c) with regard to the vitamin choline at most \u2014 although petitioners in number 73-2175 point to one piece of .additional testimony which might conceivably have supported it with regard to potassium and sodium as well. Finally, the failure of the FDA, after twelve years of proceedings, to fix U. S. RDA\u2019s for the vitamins and minerals listed in \u00a7 125.1(c) cannot in itself render the provision \u201creasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Perhaps in the year that has elapsed since the regulations were promulgated the FDA has now arrived at these figures and the list of optional ingredients with U. S. RDA\u2019s established can be readily expanded on remand. But in the meantime we shall enjoin enforcement of so much of the regulations as prohibits the inclusion of the vitamins and minerals listed in \u00a7 125.1(c) in general purpose foods,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> or as optional ingredients in dietary supplements, including dietary supplements for separate sale under \u00a7 80.1(b) (2). We leave it to the agency on remand to integrate these nutrients into \u00a7 80.1(b) (1) (v), by determining whether addition of one of them shall require addition of all, or shall require addition of .the other \u00a7 80.1(b) (1) (v) nutrients, and so forth.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>Petitioners also object, both as a matter of statutory authority and as a question of substantial evidence,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> to \u00a7 125.1 (h), providing, with certain exceptions intended to conform to the standard of identity exemptions in \u00a7 80.1(e), <em>supra, </em>that preparations containing more than the upper limits of the U. S. RDA per serving are drugs. This would implicate the many provisions of subchapter V of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, including the more elaborate label requirements of \u00a7 502, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352, and, potentially, the burdensome provisions of \u00a7 505, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355, for approval of \u201cnew drugs\u201d; would involve petitioners in an elaborate investigation now being conducted by the FDA into the composition, labeling and sale of over-the-counter drugs, including \u201c[vjitamin-mineral products,\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.301(b)(8), with the possible result that their products could be sold only on prescription or under other limiting conditions, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 130.301(a) (5) (i); and might, we were informed at argument by counsel in numbers 73-2826 and -2834, result in various restrictions on sale in some states which automatically impose limitations on any product deemed a \u201cdrug\u201d under federal law. In addition to defending on the merits,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> the FDA says that this provision was inserted <em>ex gratia, </em>since, without it, preparations exceeding the upper limits could not be sold at all. Whatever the purpose, petitioners attack the provision and are entitled to our judgment about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">Section 201(g)(1) of the Act says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-9\">The term \u201cdrug\u201d means (A) articles recognized in the official United States Pharmacopoeia, official Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, or official National Formulary, or any supplement to any of them; and (B) articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals; and (C) articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals; and (D) articles intended for use as a component of any article specified in clauses (A), (B), or (C) of this paragraph; but does not include devices or their components, parts, or accessories.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(g)(1). Although the findings on which the FDA apparently sought to rest \u00a7 125.1(h) were evidently based on subdivision (B) of \u00a7 201(g) (1), <em>see </em>38 F.R. 20170, ff 12 (1973); <em>cf. id. </em>at 20715, ff 44; <em>id. </em>at 20735, ff 11, government counsel now suggest that they could properly have been based on subdivision (A), since all the vitamins and presumably all the minerals with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>which we are here concerned are recognized in the official United States Pharmacopoeia or the official National For-mulary. If this argument be seriously advanced, a sufficient answer is the statement in Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168, 83 S.Ct. 239, 246, 9 L.Ed.2d 207 (1962), that \u201c[t]he courts may not accept appellate counsel\u2019s <em>post hoc </em>rationalizations for agency action.\u201d Moreover, the argument would prove too much, for it would lead to the conclusion that all vitamin and mineral preparations even within the limits are drugs \u2014 a position which would run counter to the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">The FDA\u2019s decision to handle as drugs all vitamin and mineral products in excess of the upper limits of the U. S. RDA\u2019s rested essentially on the thought expressed in paragraph 12 of the preamble to Part 125, 38 F.R. 20710 (1973): \u201cThe hearing record discloses no known food or nutrition use of nutrients at such high levels, and no such uses were shown in the exceptions.\u201d We believe that this mischaracterizes the record. As will emerge more fully in the next section of the opinion, dealing with the RDA\u2019s as a basis for the upper limits in the standards of identity, a significant number of persons have indisputable nutritional need for potencies exceeding the upper limits; in particular, and by no means exclusively, this includes the large number of women taking oral contraceptives.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In light of this, it cannot be said even as an objective matter that a given bottle of pills, each containing more than the upper limit of one or more nutrients, is not being used for nutritional purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\"><em>A fortiori </em>it follows that the vendor of such a product can in good faith intend it for nontherapeutic use. Section 201(g)(1)(B) makes the vend- or\u2019s intent the crucial element in the definition of \u201cdrug\u201d here at issue, <em>see also </em>S.Rep.No.361, <em>supra, </em>in Dunn at 240, and the cases consistently have read that language for its plain meaning. While we agree that a factfinder should be free to pierce all of a manufacturer\u2019s subjective claims of intent and even his misleadingly \u201cnutritional\u201d labels to find actual therapeutic intent on the basis of objective evidence in a proper case, such objective evidence would need to consist of something more than demonstrated uselessness as a food for most people. We therefore hold that \u00a7 125.1(h) is invalid.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Our invalidation of this subsection in no way prevents high-dosage products properly labeled from being marketed as over-the-counter drugs. But under our ruling \u00a7 125.1(h) will cease to have any independent restrictive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">IV. <em>The U. S. RDA\u2019s and the Prescription of Upper Limits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">As has already appeared, the U. S. RDA\u2019s serve two different purposes in the FDA\u2019s regulatory scheme. One is the requirement, \u00a7 125.3(a), <em>see </em>note 4 <em>supra, </em>that \u201cthe label shall bear a statement of the percentage of the U. S. RDA of such vitamins and minerals, as set forth in \u00a7 125.1(b), supplied by such food when consumed in a specified quantity during a period of 1 day.\u201d The other consists of the substantive provision, \u00a7 80.1(c)(1), that \u201cdietary supplements described in this section shall contain in the specified daily quantity no less than the lower limit nor more than the upper limit of any nutrient specified in paragraph (f) of this section for the group(s) for which the supplement is offered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>There is little controversy over the label requirement.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Counsel for petitioners in Nos. 73-2746 and -2747 say expressly in their brief, p. 30 n. 33, \u201cno one contests FDA\u2019s power to require such a [label] statement pursuant to Section 403 (j).\u201d And the reply brief of counsel in No. 73-2824, which, as we shall see, leads the attack on the RDA\u2019s in other contexts, states at pp. 2 and 12:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1U\">Petitioner, Federation of Homemakers, supports and commends the agency for the development of a [sic] informational device which, if properly regulated and dearly explained to consumers, can be a major tool in eliminating much of the confusion and misunderstanding which pervades the vitamin market. . . It is the position of Petitioner, Federation of Homemakers, that when properly used as an information tool as indicated in in the NAS comment on the U. S. RDA the FDA has made a useful contribution to informing consumers and helping to provide clarifying information in the marketplace.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Similarly, as earlier mentioned, <em>see </em>note 10 <em>supra, </em>there is, and probably could be, no serious and separate objection, on an evidentiary basis or otherwise, to so much of \u00a7 80.1(c)(1) as proscribes the sale of a dietary supplement containing less than the lower limits of the U. S. RDA\u2019s. In contrast there are violent objections to the use of the RDA\u2019s to prescribe upper limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">As indicated by our discussion in Part II, <em>supra, </em>any attempt to prescribe an effective standard of identity had to deal in quantitative as well as in qualitative terms. The bewildering array of products confronting the consumer varied in terms of potency as much as in terms of specific nutrients contained. Although petitioners loudly criticize the U. S. RDA\u2019s they suggest nothing to take their place in a standard of identity; rather, as suggested most pointedly by petitioners\u2019 reply brief in numbers 73-2746, 73-2747, and 73-2748, they would relegate the whole matter to a label which would say, at most, something like this: \u201cThe quantity of vitamin . . . contained in this product is five times what the FDA considers necessary for proper nutrition.\u201d Yet, in light of experience with what amounted at least implicitly to a similar statement concerning the MDR\u2019s, the FDA might well have entertained doubt that, at least in general, <em>cf. </em>p. 783 <em>supra, </em>such a warning would turn purchasers off rather than turn them on. While it was for the FDA to justify the regulations, not for the petitioners to show the agency what to do, we must be aware that invalidation of the upper limits would seriously impair, if not destroy, the value of the standards of identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">Perhaps the central evidentiary attack on the maxima, which are generally 150% of the U. S. RDA\u2019s<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> is that the FDA misapprehended the purpose' of the National Academy of Sciences in promulgating the NAS RDA\u2019s on which the U. S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>RDA\u2019s are based. This argument is most effectively presented in the reply brief in No. 73-2824, where counsel have reprinted a section entitled \u201cGeneral Considerations\u201d from the NAS 1974 edition of Recommended Dietary Allowances, which, of course, was not available to the agency when it promulgated the regulations.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Sample extracts from this are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-4\">RDA are estimates of \u201cacceptable daily nutrient intakes\u201d in the sense that, although the needs of most, individuals will be less than the RDA standard, there may be a small number who require more. . . . It is not possible to be more explicit about the relationship between RDA and the requirements of an individual; thus, it is only within the framework of statistical probability that RDA can be used legitimately and meaningfully.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-6\">This has important implications. It means that such general statements as \u201cRDA include a large safety factor; therefore a diet that meets two thirds of the RDA standard should be adequate\u201d have no validity. It will be adequate for some, inadequate for others and \u2014 without elaborate studies \u2014 there is no way of knowing who falls into which category.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">All the \u201cappropriate uses\u201d of the RDA\u2019s envisioned by the NAS involve evaluation of adequacy of food supplies or consumption patterns over a large population, and not for individuals. Thus, the categories of uses listed are \u201cPlanning and Procuring Food Supplies for Population Groups,\u201d \u201cInterpretation of Food Consumption Records in Relation to Assessment of Nutritional Status,\u201d \u201cNutritional Allowances as Guidelines in Establishing Policy for Health and Welfare Programs,\u201d \u201cUse of RDA in Nutritional Surveys and Their Relation to Government Policy,\u201d and \u201cNutrition Education.\u201d Only in a final category, \u201cProduct Development, Nutritional Labeling, and Regulation of Nutritional Quality,\u201d does the possibility of any kind of individual application emerge. And that possibility is confined to informational labeling and to the establishment of minimal levels of fortification for foods which lose nutritional value in processing.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> By way of demonstrating that the RDA\u2019s are objectively inappropriate for uses other than these envisioned by the NAS, petitioners also emphasize that, on the basis of the FDA\u2019s own findings, RDA\u2019s provide an adequate intake of essential nutrients only for \u201cessentially all of the normal healthy persons in the United States,\u201d more specifically 95% to 99% of the \u201cnormal healthy\u201d population; <footnotemark>40</footnotemark> that even this 95-99% range is apparently derived by excluding certain needs which petitioners regard as nutritional but the FDA considers therapeutic <em>(e. g., </em>increased needs for vitamins and/or minerals on the part of women taking oral contraceptives and persons who do not absorb vitamins well), and is derived by partially ignoring what is now a fairly widespread if minority belief that the \u201coptimal\u201d level of nutrition considerably exceeds that necessary to avoid clinical deficiencies; and that the experimental and other methods for developing the RDA\u2019s are admittedly far from perfect and the state of current knowledge far from complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">If the FDA had sought to prohibit ingestion of more than the maxima insofar as it could, even with the considerable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>safety factor arising from increasing the limit to <em>150%, </em>which is superimposed upon the vitamins and minerals contained in the consumer\u2019s basic food diet, <em>see </em>note 37 <em>supra, </em>we should indeed have found it impossible to sustain the regulations.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> But the agency has done nothing of the sort. Beyond the possibility that some applications for relief from the upper limits will be granted pursuant to Part II of this opinion, anyone who is not satisfied with the quantity of a vitamin or mineral permitted in a combination or in a separate pill can take as many more tablets as he likes. He will doubtless find this more expensive, but, as previously suggested, <em>see </em>p. 782 <em>supra, </em>the additional payment required in such cases had to be weighed by the agency against the savings from useless expenditures by purchasers of supplements containing far higher potencies than they require.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The percentage of the population, whatever it be, who even under accepted scientific doctrine require dosages in excess of the upper limits have a similar recourse. Expert testimony on the advisability of adopting the maxima, in this limited way, was conflicting. Although the opinions of those experts who favored the maxima may seem to us somewhat the less thoroughly reasoned or at least the less thoroughly articulated, they were explicitly and not irrationally based on the fact that the RDA\u2019s are the best tool of their kind available and are subject to constant revision; resolution of the conflicting expert evidence was therefore for the agency. Indeed, since anyone who wishes is free to take dosages in excess of the maxima, these may readily be viewed as just a very pointed informational device \u2014 and therefore as an application of the RDA\u2019s which is explicitly approved, rather than effectively disapproved, by the NAS\u2019 new edition, and which is by no means unreasonable, however imperfect the state of current nutritional knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">In short, we cannot fault the agency, procedural issues apart, for adopting upper limits, generally 150% of the U. S. RDA\u2019s, in its standard of identity.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">V. <em>Refusal to Allow Dr. Robinson to Cross-Examine Dr. Sebrell</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">Section 701(e)(3) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act is one of the relatively few federal regulatory statutes which require rules \u201cto be made on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing\u201d within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(c). See United States v. Florida East Coast Ry. Co., 410 U.S. 224, 238, 93 S.Ct. 810, 35 L.Ed.2d 223 (1973). Instead of being governed by the rather lenient standards generally imposed by \u00a7 553 with respect to rulemaking, such cases are subject to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 556, the same section which governs adjudication. Subsection (d) of \u00a7 556 provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-10\">[a] party is entitled to present his case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">During the presentation of the FDA\u2019s case, all parties were permitted liberal cross-examination.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> However, after the opposition began to offer its evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>almost eighteen months after the hearing commenced, the Hearing Examiner, evidently concerned about the length of the proceeding, decided to limit the rights of Participants to cross-examine the witnesses called by other Participants. In an order dated December 24, 1969, the Hearing Examiner \u201cconcluded that said Participants are in opposition to the said Stayed Regulations and that witnesses offered by such Participants would not ordinarily be considered to be hostile to the opposition to the said Stayed Regulations of any other such Participant.\u201d If any Participant wished to cross-examine the witness of another, he was to serve a notice of intention to do so. The notice had to state that the written direct testimony of the witness was adverse to the interest of the Participant, make specific reference to the portion of the testimony considered to be adverse, and state the reasons therefor. The Hearing Examiner would determine whether to grant permission to cross-examine in his discretion. If such permission were granted, the Participant\u2019s cross-examination was to be limited to those portions of the witness\u2019 written direct testimony specified in the notice. On its face this was fair enough. As the Committee Report on the APA indicated, \u201cThe provision [\u00a7 556(d)] on its face does not confer a right of so-called \u2018unlimited\u2019 cross-examination. Presiding officers will have to make the necessary initial determination whether the cross-examination is pressed to unreasonable lengths.\u201d Sen.Doc.No.248, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. 271 (1946). <em>See also, 2 </em>Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 14.15 (1958); Hamilton, Rulemaking on a Record by the Food and Drug Administration, 50 Texas L.Rev. 1132, 1149 (1972).<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The problem was created by the Hearing Examiner\u2019s application of the order in the case of a particularly important witness, Dr. William H. Sebrell, Jr., who had been Chairman of the Committee on Recommended Dietary Allowances of the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council, the body which had prepared the 1968 RDA\u2019s whence the U.S. RDA\u2019s were drawn. The scientific validity of the RDA\u2019s was, of course, a question of central importance to the agency\u2019s promulgation of the regulations and to this Court\u2019s review of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">Dr. Sebrell\u2019s name had been included in the FDA\u2019s list of witnesses in support of the proposed regulations. He was not called for the reason, as we were told at argument, that he was unwilling to support all of the FDA\u2019s regulatory proposals.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> However, this change of plan was not made known in advance to the Participants,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> who had justifiably with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>held cross-examination of other FDA witnesses because these witnesses had less personal knowledge of the process by which the RDA\u2019s were developed and, in many cases, testified before the final form of the 1968 RDA\u2019s were made public.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">One of the principal opponents of the regulations was Dr. Miles H. Robinson,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> representing the National Health Federation (NHF). He had cross-examined the FDA witnesses persistently, doubtless too persistently.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> When Dr. Sebrell was ultimately called as a witness by the American Medical Association (AMA), Dr. Robinson served two notices of his desire to cross-examine Dr. Sebrell. It was explained to the Examiner that the interests of the NHF and the AMA were antithetical rather than identical, since the NHF was opposing substantially all the proposals, whereas the AMA was generally favorable, proposing only a few modifications <footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The Examiner declined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>to permit Dr. Robinson to cross-examine Dr. Sebrell, although he did allow such examination by Mrs. Janie A. Meeter (one of a group of individual consumer opponents), counsel for pharmaceutical manufacturers and a trade organization, and, of course, the FDA. The Examiner also denied permission to appeal his adverse ruling to the FDA. He later said he was standing by his ruling \u201cso that we will have a clear-cut issue which can eventually be determined by the courts.\u201d We must gratify his ill-chosen wish.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">We recognize that a hearing examiner must be allowed, indeed encouraged, to take steps to avoid repetitious or aimless cross-examination, particularly in a rulemaking proceeding which had become so gargantuan as this. As the Administrative Conference has recommended, Recommendations and Reports of the Administrative Conference of the United States, vol. 2, Recommendation 71.7, If D (3), at 46,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-9\">If several participants with common interests desire to cross-examine a witness, the hearing examiner should encourage the participants to select a lead attorney or attorneys to conduct the cross-examination. In the absence of a showing of prejudice, participants with common interests should be grouped by the hearing examiner, and participants in a group should not be permitted to cross-examine witnesses called by other members of the group.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">But here the NHF and the AMA clearly did not have \u201ccommon interests\u201d; the NHF was substantially as adverse to the AMA as it was to the FDA. Moreover, those who were permitted to cross-examine Dr. Sebrell either did not share common interests with NHF or were ineffective. Mr. Dym, counsel for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PMA), cross-examined Dr. Sebrell after counsel for the FDA completed his cross-examinations.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> As the Hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>Examiner noted, Mr. Dym\u2019s interest was limited \u201cto develop [ing] with Dr. Sebrell aspects of the testimony which affected over-the-counter therapeutic preparations.\u201d Indeed, the interests of NHF and PMA were in many respects adverse.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Neither can the Examiner\u2019s ruling be defended on the basis that cross-examination by another consumer representative was allowed. Mrs. Meeter, a housewife, lacked the professional skills essential for effective cross-examination of Dr. Sebrell. Whereas Dr. Sebrell\u2019s expertise relating to the RDA\u2019s was what greatly concerned NHF,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Mrs. Meeter concentrated mainly on the problems of excluded nutrients and special individual nutritional needs and even in those areas had a great deal of difficulty in framing questions that could survive the objections of FDA counsel. In 21 pages of transcript she obtained answers to fewer than ten distinct questions; objections were sustained as to at least a dozen more and on four occasions the Examiner had to caution Mrs. Meeter about the drift of her questions. So far as concerned the RDA\u2019s she succeeded only in obtaining from Dr. Sebrell general statements that they were up-to-date, that they will be periodically revised, and that they are based upon the best available information. This is in sharp contrast to the skills of Dr. Robinson, whose \u201cability to ask scientific questions\u201d was recognized early in the hearings by the Hearing Examiner. Of course the Examiner could have limited the time to be allowed Dr. Robinson for cross-examination or taken other means to control Dr. Robinson\u2019s persistence. But one must wonder at the brinksmanship that would imperil a hearing which had already lasted for some eighteen months and was to continue for almost five more by what the Examiner himself recognized to be an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>exclusionary ruling of dubious validity\u2014 even to the point of denying permission to appeal to the agency itself.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">A court reviewing an agency rule-making determination, even when governed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 556, is naturally disinclined to order a remand for failure to allow cross-examination, particularly on a record as enormous as this. Apart from the point which most trial lawyers have learned, through sad experience, that early dreams of confounding experts by cross-examination usually are dreams indeed, the court wonders how much more there would have been for the agency to learn. But Dr. Sebrell was no ordinary witness.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The FDA had presented no other witness who was a member of the Food and Nutrition Board, which adopted the 1968 RDA\u2019s, except Dr. Bernard Schweigert, whose direct examination was limited by the FDA to nutrient losses which occur as a result of the processing, transportation, storage, and cooking of foods and to a proposed regulation dealing with food fortification to overcome any such losses.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> When Dr. Robinson attempted to question Dr. Schweigert about the scientific validity of the RDA tables, the Hearing Examiner sustained the objection of FDA counsel that the question \u201cis beyond the scope.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> In contrast, Dr. Se-brell had been chairman of the committee that had prepared the RDA\u2019s and on his own account had made many changes in adapting the RDA\u2019s into the U. S. RDA\u2019s that were incorporated into the .regulations; and his testimony is the sole authority cited in the findings for the validity of these derivations.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>only other Board members who testified (except for Dr. Schweigert) were called by other Participants, and were thus as unavailable for cross-examination by Dr. Robinson as was Dr. Sebrell himself.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">The FDA is now fertile with suggestions how Dr. Robinson could have overcome the Examiner\u2019s egregious error, <em>e. g., </em>by calling Dr. Sebrell as his own witness. But apart from other problems, we are not to take so lightly the command of Congress, whether wise or not, that in a rulemaking hearing governed by \u00a7 566 \u201ca party is entitled . to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The opponents of the regulations were entitled to probe into such important matters as how the RDA's were prepared,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> whether thos\u00e9 who prepared them had any biases that might affect their judgment,<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> what doubts they entertained, what inconsistencies there were,<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> and how far the formulators intended the RDA\u2019s to be applied for the purposes to which they have been put. It is no sufficient answer that this court now has a good deal of such information, particularly on the last point, in the General Observations to the 1974 edition, to which we have \u2022referred in Part IV, and has not considered this to require invalidation of the regulations. The question rather is whether there is a significant probability that vigorous cross-examination of Dr. Sebrell might have caused the agency to adopt regulations differing from those that it adopted or have provided a record that would have affected the judgment of a reviewing court on the question of sufficiency. Since we cannot say in good conscience that there is not,<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> we must, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>therefore, remand the case to the FDA with instructions to reopen the record for the limited purpose of permitting reasonable cross-examination of Dr. Sebrell (or, if he is not available, some other qualified member of the Board) by Dr. Robinson or counsel of some other similarly interested Participants.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">VI. <em>Label and Labeling Requirements</em></p>\n<p id=\"abu-dedup-0\">We next consider the validity of portions of Part 125 not directly related to the problems heretofore discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">As earlier noted, several petitioners do not object to the basic requirement of \u00a7 125.3(a), that \u201cthe label shall bear a statement of the percentage of the U. S. RDA of such vitamins and minerals, as set forth in \u00a7 125.1(b), supplied by such food when consumed in a specified quantity during a period of 1 day,\u201d to which we have referred at the beginning of Part IV. In any event we see no infirmity in it. Whatever objections there may be to the U. S. RDA\u2019s when used as a basis for prohibiting the sale as dietary supplements of products exceeding the upper limits \u2014 and we have sustained these only because of the blatantly erroneous Restriction on the cross-examination of Dr. Sebrell, see Part V, <em>supra </em>\u2014 they have no such force when the U. S. RDA\u2019s are used simply as measuring rods to inform the consumer what he is getting.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">In contrast, there is a chorus of objections concerning the requirements of \u00a7 125.2(b) with respect to labeling which we set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>The most general objection is that \u00a7 403(j) authorizes the FDA only to prescribe contents for a \u201clabel,\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> whereas \u201clabeling\u201d is defined by \u00a7 201 (m), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321 (m), to mean \u201call labels and other written, printed, or graphic matter (1) upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers, or (2) accompanying such article.\u201d It could be strongly argued that the power to prescribe the contents of a label must include the power to prevent labeling that would destroy the label\u2019s integrity. However, it is unnecessary to decide whether \u00a7 125.2(b) could be supported on this ground since the FDA could and did draw on \u00a7 403(a), which provides that a food shall be misbranded \u201cif its labeling is false or misleading in any particular.\u201d We .therefore turn to the specific provisions of \u00a7 125.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">(1) We shall not tarry long over \u00a7 125.2(b)(1). The FDA marshalled evidence that past sales of dietary supplements have often involved highly questionable claims as to effectiveness in the prevention, cure, mitigation, and treatment of diseases and symptoms; that consumers of these products have been confused and misled by. such claims; and that even more moderate claims of effectiveness have no scientific validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">The FDA presented an impressive case, based largely on the records in seizure actions, of the exaggerated claims made on behalf of various vitamin and mineral products. \u201cGolden 50 Tablets\u201d were said by their sellers to give pep to the poSt-50 generation, to assist them in constipation problems, and even to enable them to withstand the noise of children! \u201cVitamins Concentrated Honey Alfa Tea\u201d was said to be useful in connection with gout, ulcers, migraine, alcoholism, and bed-wetting. \u201cCatalyn\u201d was said to give one resistance to overweight, underweight, dropsy, prostate enlargement, and St. Vitus\u2019 Dance. \u201cComfrey,\u201d derived from a vigorous plant, was said thereby to increase virility. And another substance was claimed to be adequate in the treatment, <em>inter alia, </em>of mental disorders, cretinism, and poor teeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-12\">Evidence of consumer confusion about the efficacy of vitamins and minerals in the prevention, cure, mitigation, and treatment of diseases and symptoms was also clear. Ironically, some of the most effective evidence was provided in the form of about 50,000 letters received by the FDA.in protest against the proposed regulations, apparently as a result of a campaign by NHF, which showed that many people were taking dietary supplements to remedy ailments which their physicians had been unable to diagnose or cure and that some had been urged to do so by claims of therapeutic value made in the promotion of such supplements. There was also evidence that even truthful claims, such as that vitamin C would prevent scurvy and that vitamin Bi would prevent beriberi, were harmful and misleading.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> It was difficult to imagine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>a person in the United States whose diet would give rise to scurvy, and beriberi, which has ordinarily resulted from a diet consisting almost exclusively of rice, is equally rare in the United States; yet the broadcasting of such claims might frighten consumers into purchasing dietary supplement products they did not need. Finally, there was ample expert testimony of lack of any scientific basis for promoting vitamins or minerals as useful in the prevention, cure, mitigation, or treatment of any \u201cdiseases\u201d or symptoms except nutritional deficiencies themselves and of gross exaggeration of the extent of the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">Against all this, petitioners relied upon evidence that many persons failed to ingest adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals; that vitamin and mineral deficiencies were associated with many diseases and symptoms; that physicians are often unable to identify some of the milder forms of vitamin deficiencies; and that it was therefore reasonable for consumers to purchase dietary supplements as \u201cinsurance\u201d against the deficiency maladies brought to their attention by past promotional efforts. Petitioners also take issue with the FDA\u2019s evidence of consumer confusion by attacking the competency of the witnesses presenting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Taking petitioners\u2019 evidence in the light most favorable to them, it merely posed an issue and did not dictate a decision. Petitioners may still make some rather broad types of statements about the importance of essential nutrients of health.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> While the FDA might have presented more convincing witnesses on the subject of consumer confusion, still the witnesses who testified gave sufficient testimony on this score. We hold that there was substantial evidence to support \u00a7 125.2(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">(2) Much of the attack on \u00a7 125.2(b)(2) is bottomed on reading it to say more than it does. This is notably true of petitioners\u2019 evidence that many Americans \u2014 careless eaters, the elderly, the poor, and persons enrolled in many weight-reducing programs \u2014 who <em>do not eat a balanced diet </em>are deficient in various nutrients. Nothing in the challenged regulation prevents a manufacturer from saying so.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> The regulation was aimed rather at scare advertising typified by a drug store counter sign which proclaimed, \u201cThe physician is faced, more and more, with the problem of restoring proper combinations of vitamins and minerals to the devitalized foods of the nation.\u201d Such promotional techniques have been commonplace, as testimony and exhibits offered by the FDA amply demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">On the other hand, the portions of th\u00e9 record that have been presented to us<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> do not contain much evidence either to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>support or to controvert the FDA\u2019s conclusion that a balanced diet of, ordinary foods <em>can </em>supply adequate amounts of nutrients.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Perhaps the strongest support for this conclusion is that it is a tautology; since nature admittedly furnishes all the needed nutrients, a diet of \u201cordinary foods\u201d that does not provide them is not \u201cbalanced.\u201d Beyond that is the known fact that millions of Americans get along quite nicely without \u201cdietary supplements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Nevertheless we are obliged to fault \u00a7 125.2(b)(2) with respect to iron, for there was strong and uncontradicted evidence that it was very difficult for women of child-bearing age and for children to obtain an adequate supply of this even from a balanced diet.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> On the remand we are directing, the FDA may either adduce further evidence on this point, or, as might be preferable, insert a proper qualification in \u00a7 125.2(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">(3) This provision was likewise aimed at scare advertising, of which the record contains several examples. However, in view of the, paucity of evidence that consumers have thereby been induced to purchase unnecessary dietary supplements, we shall examine whether the prohibited statement would be false.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">The relevant findings of fact are as . follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-11\">37. Scientifically it is inaccurate to state that the quality of soil in the United States causes abnormally low concentrations of vitamins or minerals in the food supply produced in this country.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-12\">38. There is no relationship between the vitamin content of foods and the chemical composition of the soil in which they are grown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">38 F.R. 20715 (1973). Our review of the record makes clear that there was substantial evidence to support finding 38 and so much of finding 37 as relates to vitamins. The case with respect to minerals is closer since one of the FDA\u2019s two witnesses cited in support of the validity of the statement contained in finding 37,<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Dr. William Allaway, later conceded that iodine and selenium contents in crops vary with soil composition,<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> although iron content does not, and agreed that the following statement on dietary supplement labeling would be reasonable: \u201cPlants grown on boron deficient soil may be deficient in Carotene or pro-Vitamin A.\u201d However, such recondite exceptions, even if important in the context of the regulatory scheme pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>posed by the FDA,<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> would not seem to require us to invalidate \u00a7 125.2(b)(3) in view of the FDA\u2019s interpretation that the regulation would not prohibit \u201c[a]ny truthful claims, supported by adequate scientific data,' relating to the specific nutrient value of a product,\u201d but would only proscribe \u201cunsupported generalization that there is <em>a general deficiency in the daily diet </em>because of soil in which the food was grown.\u201d ' 38 F.R. 20711 (1973) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> We therefore uphold \u00a7 125.2(b)(3) on the understanding that the FDA will apply it in that light.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">(4) This provision was supported by findings which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-6\">39. Mineral nutrients in foods are not significantly affected by storage, transportation, cooking, and other processing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-7\">40. While some vitamins are susceptible to partial destruction through the effects of heat, light, oxidation, and other physical and chemical reactions . , loss of nutrients from the ordinary effects of cooking, processing, transportation, and storage have not significantly impaired the nutritional quality of food in the United States. There is no need or scientific justification for recommending, for example, the routine use of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals to offset losses that occur as a result of these processes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-9\">41. It is reasonable to prohibit representation or suggestions in labeling, promotional material, or advertising of foods offered for special dietary use based on vitamin and mineral qualities, that imply that a dietary deficiency of vitamins or minerals exists or is threatened in the United States by virtue of loss of nutrients which occur [sic] from processing, transportation, storage, and cooking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">38 F.R. 20715 (1973).,</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">The evidence that minerals in food are not affected by transportation, cooking, processing, and storage was clear and substantial. The case with respect to vitamins, however, was otherwise. FDA witness, Dr. Bernard Schweigert, testified that, while some vitamins are stable (vitamins D and K), others may be destroyed by oxidation during storage (vitamins A, C, and E), light (riboflavin), and heat (many B vitamins).<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Consequently, if the regulation prohibited any statement that vitamins are lost during the storage, transportation, processing, or cooking of a food, we could not sustain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-14\">Once again, however, petitioners read the regulatory proscription too broadly. The FDA has said that it is not the intent of this provision to \u201cpreclude factually supportable statements that certain losses [in nutrient content] may be due to improper handling;\u201d the target is rather the \u201cunsupported generalization that there is a general deficiency in the daily diet because of . transportation, or processing methods used in preparing food.\u201d 38 F.R. 20711 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-15\">The important point in this connection is not whether certain foods may suffer important nutrient losses but whether the overall daily diet, consisting of a number of foods each with its own nutrient levels, is inadequate. The expert opinion of Dr. Olaf Mickelsen was that, while diets consisting solely of a food seriously deficient in nutrients can lead to nutritional disorders, the inclusion of the wide variety of foods normally found in the daily diet eliminated any signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>cant danger. It is thus immaterial that, as one of the petitioners\u2019 witnesses testified, 60% of the vitamin C in snap beans is lost in transportation and refrigeration. No one lives on a diet of snap beans, and citrus fruits are rich in vitamin C.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">(5) This prohibition presents a special problem in that, while the first and fourth sentences and the proviso, like all the other provisions in \u00a7 125.2(b), deal only with labeling, the second and third sentences are substantive in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Basic to the validity of all parts of \u00a7 125.2(b)(5) is the question whether there is substantial evidence that the four named ingredients or products \u201care of no significant value or need in human nutrition.\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Stated as such, the proposition is questionable as to some of the substances.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> However, the FDA\u2019s real meaning is made clearer in finding 3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARb\">Many dietary supplements include named ingredients <em>which are of no value as supplements to the human diet.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">38 F.R. 20713 (1973) (emphasis added). With respect to the four substances named in this provision, this proposition was supported by testimony that, even when such substances do play some role in nutrition, there was no known evidence of need for supplementation.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> As to many others that have been included in dietary supplements there was no evidence of nutritional value at all. If subsequent research should show the need for such supplementation, the case would be appropriate for action under \u00a7 80.1(b) (4); if the standard of identity were modified to allow these as optional ingredients, \u00a7 125.2(b)(5) could not prohibit references to them in labeling.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">With this much established, the validity of the first sentence of \u00a7 125.2 (b) (5) requires little further discussion. There was ample evidence that labeling of dietary supplements making reference to included nonessential substances was misleading. The FDA found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-11\">3. . . [M]any consumers will purchase such products with long lists of ingredients, believing them to be of better value than products with a lesser number of ingredients. Such consumers believe that if an ingredient is listed, it must significantly contribute to the value of the product as a dietary supplement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-14\">22. The establishment of qualitative and quantitative limits on the composition of dietary supplements will reduce consumer confusion concerning choice of dietary supplements by ensuring a basically rational formula for all products.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-15\">38 F.R. 20713 (1973). The record contains substantial evidence to support this part of the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-16\">While one would have predicted loud protest against the proviso in the third sentence, apparently there is no direct challenge. In any event, as evidenced by United States v. An Article of Food . . . Labeled . . . Nu-clomin, 482 F.2d 581 (8 Cir. 1973) (where the product included inositol and para-amino-benzoic acid, two of the nonessential substances specifically mentioned in this provision), the FDA\u2019s experience had shown that disclaimers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>value did not solve the problem of the misleading effect of including such ingredients in combinations. Thus the FDA could well conclude that in the sale of products consisting solely of such nonessential ingredients a disclaimer could have the effect of calling attention to the potential nutritional value of the product, and it could therefore proscribe such disclaimers as misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">This leaves the substantive provisions of the second and third sentences. Since the named substances are reasonably deemed nonessential and since the first sentence is valid, the second and third sentences are easily sustained, for the power to establish a reaspnable standard of identity for dietary supplements necessarily includes the power to exclude from combinations ingredients that have not been shown to be useful for the purpose for which they are offered, even though they are harmless.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">(6) Most of the argument over this prohibition stems from petitioners\u2019 reading into it language that is not there; they fear that the regulation would prohibit labeling that would merely disclose that the vitamin was natural and what its source was.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> However, the</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">Government\u2019s brief construes the regulation as prohibiting only \u201crepresentations that a natural vitamin is <em>superior </em>to an added or synthetic vitamin, or that there is a difference between vitamins naturally present and those that have been added,\u201d Brief for Respondent at 44-45 (emphasis in original), and calls attention to a passage in the preamble to the regulations, 38 F.R. 20711 (1973), where the agency stated: \u201cA factual and true statement of the origin of a nutrient is permitted, and only a claim of superiority is prohibited. This prohibition was , included because of widespread claims that nutrients of natural origins are superior to synthetic nutrients.\u201d This is surely a permissible, indeed we think the only permissible, reading of the regulation. Since there was abundant evidence to sustain finding 26 :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-13\">There is no nutritional difference between a vitamin produced by a synthetic source and the same vitamin provided by a natural source, but the natural source may contain other ingredients which may limit the absorb-ability of the vitamin provided by the natural source.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">20714 (1973),<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> we uphold this regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>The upshot is that we sustain \u00a7 125.2 (b) in its entirety save for so much of \u00a7 125.2(b)(2) as prohibits appropriate statements about the adequacy of a balanced diet of ordinary foods to provide needed amounts of iron for women and children. On this the FDA on remand must either adduce additional probative evidence or include an appropriate qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">VII. <em>Fresh Fruits and Vegetables</em></p>\n<p id=\"Asnr\">Sunkist Growers, Inc., petitioner in No. 73-2753, a cooperative of many citrus fruit growers in California and Arizona, complains in effect that <em>any </em>application of Part 80 to fresh fruits and vegetables, see \u00a7 80.1(e)(5), (6), <em>supra, </em>would contravene the two provisos of \u00a7 401 which we set out in the margin;<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> Sunkist also complains that the definition of \u201cspecial dietary use\u201d in \u00a7 125.1 (a), which we likewise set out in the margin,<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> is so broad as to include fresh fruits and vegetables, which, it is argued, would also be unauthorized, or at least arbitrary or capricious and thus violative of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706. On December 12, 1973, the Assistant General Counsel of the FDA wrote counsel for Sunkist, offering to stipulate that the regulations would not prevent advertising or labeling claims concerning vitamin or mineral content naturally occurring in fresh fruit or vegetables and would apply to such produce only in two eventualities.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">One was that if vitamins or minerals were added to fresh fruits or vegetables so that the total level of any added vitamin or mineral per single serving (whatever that might be in the case of a vegetable) exceeded 50% of the U.S. RDA, <em>cf. </em>\u00a7 80.1(e)(5), <em>supra, </em>the product would be subject to Part 80. Since we cannot imagine natural produce, even as fortified, conforming to the standards of identity in that Part, the effect of this interpretation surely was to forbid such addition of vitamins or minerals to fresh fruits or vegetables offered for sale as foods. However, while the FDA could well have refrained from this refinement, we agree that such fabricated products are not within the intent of the provisos to \u00a7 401. Moreover, petitioner\u2019s grievance seems theoretical since there is no evidence that any such practice has occurred or is intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">The other set of qualifications was this: If fresh fruits or vegetables were represented as dietary supplements of vitamins and/or minerals', <em>e.g., </em>if oranges were sold as vitamin C supplements rather than with a simple state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>ment that they are a source of vitamin C, Part 80 would apply, <em>cf. </em>\u00a7 80.1(e)(6), <em>supra; </em>again, we take it that the consequence of this interpretation \u2014 given that nature has not conformed oranges to the FDA\u2019s standard of identity \u2014 is that no such representation may be made with respect to fresh produce sold as foods. Also, if a fruit or vegetable were offered for sale for a particular dietary use, <em>e.g., </em>if lemons were advertised as a source of flavoring for persons on low sodium diets, Part 125 (but apparently not Part 80) would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">We think all this goes too far. The first proviso to \u00a7 401 rules out any standard of identity for most fruits and vegetables, and the second permits this for citrus and several other fruits only as to maturity and the effects of freezing. Nothing indicates that the making of promotional claims, <em>e.g., </em>that oranges are vitamin C supplements, should detract from the force of the provisos. And Part 125 simply does not fit fresh fruits and vegetables in their natural state. As petitioner says, the sheer variation in the content of oranges would seem to. make compliance with Part 125 impossible. On March 14, 1973, the FDA promulgated a new provision, \u00a7 1.17, <em>cf. </em>p. 783 <em>supra, </em>dealing with food labeling, 38 F.R. 6951, 6959; but, on November 28, 1973, in response to an attack on \u00a7 1.17 in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by Sunkist and another organization, Civ. No. 633-73 (complaint filed April 2, 1973), the agency exempted fresh fruits and vegetables pending further rulemaking, 38 F.R. 32786. We think that proceeding rather than this one is the proper place in which to deal with claims as to the value of fresh fruits, or vegetables in their natural state as dietary supplements or to fulfill special dietary needs. We therefore enjoin enforcement of Parts 80 and 125 against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">VIII. <em>Other Procedural Matters</em></p>\n<p id=\"Asc\">In this final section we deal briefly with a number of procedural objections in addition to the important one considered in Part V.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">The most basic is the claim that the Hearing Examiner was appointed in violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3105 and 3344. These provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">\u00a7 .3105. Appointment of hearing examiners.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-9\">Each agency shall appoint as many hearing examiners as are necessary for proceedings required to be conducted in accordance with sections 556 and 557 of this title. Hearing examiners shall be assigned to cases in rotation so far as practicable, and may not perform duties inconsistent with their duties and responsibilities as hearing examiners.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">\u00a7 3344. Details; hearing examiners.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-11\">An agency as defined by section 551 of this title which occasionally or temporarily is insufficiently staffed with hearing examiners appointed under section 3105 of this title may use hearing examiners selected by the Civil Service Commission from and with the consent of other agencies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-12\">The contention is baseless, as was ruled six years ago in unreported opinion of Judge Tenney, National Dietary Foods Association, Inc. v. Cohen, No. 68 Civ. 2364 (S.D.N.Y., Aug. 29, 1968), with which we agree.- When it became apparent in early 1967 that a lengthy hearing' on .the proposed regulations would be required, the FDA had only one hearing examiner, who was otherwise engaged. \u201cRotation\u201d of hearing examiners for purposes of \u00a7 3105 was thus not \u201cpracticable.\u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> The detailing of an examiner from another agency similarly was not feasible because the Civil Service Commission discouraged the borrowing of examiners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>from other agencies under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3344 where the hearing was expected to exceed six months.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> With these statutory alternatives thus unavailable, the FDA determined that it was necessary to hire another hearing examiner on a more permanent basis. Accoi'dingly, the FDA requested the Commission to certify a list of eligible candidates. Of the seven who were recommended, only two manifested interest; the FDA selected David A. Harris,<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> and his designation to hear this proceeding was announced on April 2, 1968, 33 F.R. 5268 (1968). Since the other examiner was occupied, Mr. Harris\u2019 assignment complied with both the letter and the spirit of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3105.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Complaint is made that on several occasions the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and other FDA officials met with the Hearing Examiner without the presence of the parties or their counsel. The examiner prepared memoranda of these meetings, as well as of all other communications he had had with any party, and placed thes.e in a public file. The memoranda show that the objective of the meetings with the Commissioner and other FDA officials was not to influence the examiner\u2019s decision on the merits but to get the protracted proceeding moving. The Hearing Examiner was directed to proceed expeditiously, hardly an unreasonable direction on its face, and petitioners make only conclusory allegations that such a direction had prejudicial effect upon them. It would scarcely have been practicable to invite all 104 participants to such meetings, although it might have been wise to secure the presence of a few representatives. We find no basis for reversal here.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">A number of other challenges are made: that the Examiner invoked the provision of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 556(d),-which permits a requirement that direct testimony be submitted in written form, only after the FDA had finished its own presentation; that he increased the number of hearing days from three to four per week and extended the closing hour from 4 to 5 p. m.; that some of his rulings on the admissibility of evidence prejudiced petitioners; that he displayed unwarranted hostility to Dr. Robinson and certain other representatives of petitioners; and that his policy of not allowing Dr. Robinson to cross-examine witnesses of other Participants, <em>see </em>Part V, <em>supra, </em>deprived petitioners of their rights of confrontation with respect to witnesses in addition to Dr. Sebrell. The first three challenges, involving matters well within the Hearing Examiner\u2019s reasonable exercise of discretion, do not warrant discussion. It would have been better if the Examiner had shown more restraint with respect to petitioners\u2019 representatives, but their examination had been needlessly long and argumentative, see note 45, <em>supra, </em>and a reviewing court should not be overly critical of an examiner who had to preside over a hearing of this length. Finally, whatever may be said of the propriety of the restriction of cross-examination of witnesses other than Dr. Se-brell, petitioners have made no sufficient showing that this could have affected either the agency\u2019s action or our decision on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">The petitions to review are granted in part and denied in part, enforcement of the regulations is'stayed as provided in Part II, and the cause is remanded to the FDA for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

While there was expert disagreement as to the scientific meaningfulness of classifying ingredients as \u201cmandatory\u201d and \u201coptional\u201d rather than simply as \u201cessential,\u201d the agency was entitled to chose between the conflicting views.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b842-4\">. On the question whether Quaker Oats might still market the cereal in some way clearly differentiating it from either farina or enriched farina \u2014 a question of little or no real commercial <em>significance </em>\u2014 see p. 781 and note 20 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b843-7\">. Mr. Justice Frankfurter, the author of <em>62 Gases of Jam, </em>had concurred in <em>Quaker Oats.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b843-8\">. Indeed, although at argument government counsel, apparently on the spur of the moment, mentioned the possibility of such marketing, his intention being to demonstrate that the regulations here at issue are not as restrictive as they might at first appear, the word \u201cimitation\u201d would be commercial death in an industry where naturalness is next to godliness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b845-4\">. It might well also run counter to the <em>Bmtoni </em>case cited earlier in the text \u2014 \u2022 although it is not altogether clear that that court would have considered the issue to be before it, <em>see </em>130 F.Supp. at 717, 718. There does not appear to have been evidence that the additional 7% of protein supplied by gum gluten was cheaper than an equivalent content of other items; for all that appears, it was just different.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Similar considerations, and in particular the very facts of the <em>Quaker Oats </em>case, suffice to refute the contention of some petitioners that, at least as to beneficial as distinguished from dilutant ingredients, the agency has authority only to prescribe minimum content levels and not maxima. See 318 U.S. at 232, 63 S.Ct. at 597 (\u201cThe statutory purpose . . . would be defeated if producers were free to add ingredients, however wholesome, which are not within the definition.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b845-7\">. Shortly thereafter, Justice Frankfurter intimated a slight retreat from this reading, suggesting that the possibility may have remained of Quaker Oats\u2019 marketing its product as an \u201cimitation,\u201d 340 U.S. at 599, 71 S.Ct. 515; as previously noted, however, this refinement is of no consequence to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">The <em>Libty </em>and <em>Bmtoni </em>cases, <em>supra, </em>may suggest even more strongly than <em>Quaker Oats </em>the legitimacy \u2014 apart from the special exception for \u201cimitations\u201d \u2014 of barring a wholesome product altogether from sale as a food. Although both were seizure actions, and therefore could not raise such questions in quite the same direct and general way as does a petition for review, <em>see </em>130 F.Supp. at 717, 718; note 19 <em>supra, </em>the language of the two opinions makes it difficult to imagine that the courts deciding these cases would have allowed the two products there at issue to be marketed under any name and in any fashion that would have exempted them from the relevant standards of identity. Libby\u2019s only interest was in marketing \u201ca product that looks, tastes, and smells like catsup, which caters to the market for catsup, which dealers bought, sold, ordered, and invoiced as catsup <em>. \u201d </em>148 F.2d at 73. Similarly, no changes in merchandising technique would have altered the fact that Buitoni\u2019s product \u201clooks like spaghetti in form, length and diameter. It is similar in color to other brands of spaghetti. Its retail packages are the same general size, shape, and physical appearance as those used by other spaghetti manufacturers. It is manufactured from the same raw material as spaghetti.\u201d 130 F. Supp. at 717-718 (footnotes omitted). Although in each case the product name included the standard word \u201ccatsup\u201d or \u201cspaghetti,\u201d we do not read the opinions as resting at all heavily on that ground. The fact is that, as a practical matter and the \u201cimitation\u201d exception aside, the Libby and Buitoni products were effectively banned from the market by those two decisions under \u00a7 401.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b845-13\">. It is to be noted in this regard that with one, or possibly two, sets of exceptions discussed in the next section of this opinion, the FDA does not seek altogether to bar any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>individual nutrients (as distinguished from particular dosages thereof) from separate sale. Therefore, while we shall find that in those two particular sets of instances any such total ban is unreasonable, it is not necessary for us to decide whether total bans on sale as foods of nontoxic individual nutrients would in all cases be beyond the agency\u2019s statutory authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b846-5\">. If the agency determines that the procedure of taking multiple dosages of the stand\u2019 ardized combination pills will appeal or is appealing to some unsophisticated purchasers as a means of getting more than the upper limit of some particular nutrient or nutrients, it may impose additional warning requirements concorning the wastage involved and, as to tlie fat-soluble vitamins, possible toxicity. The point is, however, that the agency has full discretion to determine that <em>thin </em>is a problem adequately met by a fully informative label (if it requires action at all), and that the problem of unsophisticated consumers confronting a dazzling array of combinations and dosages, on the other hand, is a more severe one requiring a more drastic solution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"awn-dedup-0\">. J\u00a3 dissatisfaction on this score is at all widespread, we can count on the free market to take full advantage of the \u00a7 80.1(b)(5) exemption and provide individual nutrients in finely gradated dosages up to 50% of the adult U.S. EDA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b847-6\">. Even more clearly, there is nothing arbitrary or unreasonable, as some petitioners urge, in the agency\u2019s exempting raw agricultural commodities and fortified substitutes therefor which are not represented as dietary supplements. Even apart from the question of statutory authority in this regard, compare Part YII <em>infra, </em>the fact that such products may offer enormous dosages of some nutrients does not compel a conclusion that they contribute to the same kind of consumer confusion that motivated promulgation of the Part 80 standards of identity \u2014 particularly when modes of use with regard to them are significantly regulated by longstanding dietary habits and by the sheer limitations of appetite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b848-5\">. The exceptions of the parties to the tentative regulations, with which no one seems to have provided us, do not appear to have tested the agency\u2019s flexibility in this regard. Apart from a special attack on the maximum (and minimum) figure for folic acid, 38 F.R. 20732, K 17 (1973), the only discussion we find in the preamble to the final regulation of the possibility of needing to increase the maxima appears in paragraph 14, <em>id. </em>This paragraph in no way suggests that the exceptions of particular parties urged increases in particular maxima, nor reflects agency consideration of sucli possibilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b848-6\">.

Our holding, of course, has no bearing on standards of identity separately promulgated for individual general purpose foods.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b851-5\">. This order extends also to any nutrients recognized as essential in human nutrition but not mentioned <em>anywhere </em>in the regulations\u2014 neither in the list of mandatory or optional nutrients, nor in \u00a7 125.1(c) (and of course not in \u00a7 125.2(b)(5), <em>see </em>note 68 <em>infra). </em>Counsel in number 73-2175, both in his briefs and at argument, has said that many such ingredients, such as cobalt and celenium, are implicitly banned from all sale as foods just as the list in \u00a7 125.1(c) is explicitly so banned. Government counsel began by denying at argument that this was the impact of the regulations even with respect to the \u00a7 125.1(c) list; when in the end he conceded that this was the import of \u00a7 125.1(c), he did not make clear whether he also conceded that a number of unmentioned, presumably essential <em>(but see </em>findings of fact <em>n </em>11, 12, at 38 F.R. 20713 (1973), discussed immediately <em>infra) </em>nutrients are banned as well. Any such ban, if the affected nutrients were in fact essential, would have even less basis than \u00a7 125.1(c) itself, since there is <em>no </em>indication that the agency has given tlie unmentioned nutrients any separate thought, <em>but of. </em>38 F.R. 20710, 1f 10 (1973), and since with respect to them there would not even be provision for the infant-formula and medical-supervision exceptions incorporated in \u00a7 125.1(c) ; indeed, even if the affected elements were not essential, we would have difficulty finding such a ban \u201creasonable\u201d under \u00a7 401 in light of the unexplained contrast that would be presented to the treatment of the \u00a7 125.2(b) (5) elements. With the agency evidently not having entertained these considerations, and indeed with its counsel uncertain as to whether it has banned the unmentioned substances at all, we see no point in our pursuing the matter further at this time; we do not propose, for example, to review the record as it bears on the essen-tiality of all the unmentioned substances, and thus to determine whether the ostensibly comprehensive listing of essential nutrients in paragraphs 11 and 12, 38 F.R. 20713 (1973), is supported by substantial evidence, since it is not clear what the impact of any such determination on our part would be. Rather we order the agency, evidently for the first time in any comj&gt;rehensive way, compare If 10, 38 F.R. 20710 (1973), to direct its attention specifically to the unmentioned ingredients. It should first determine, based on the evidence in the record or additional evidence on remand and bearing in mind that \u00a7\u00a7 80.1(b) (1), (2) and 80.1(f)(1) appear to ban any ingredients not specifically listed even from individual sales, whether it has omitted any essential nutrients. If so, these must be integrated, as we have already ordered with respect to the \u00a7 125.1(c) nutrients, into the list of optional ingredients and into \u00a7 80.1(b)(1) (v), pending the establishment of U.S. RDA\u2019s for them. Beyond this, the agency should articulate its intentions with respect to those unmentioned elements which it finds not to be essential. If it means to handle all of them under the \u201csuch as\u201d language of \u00a7 125.2(b) (5), then it should expand the list of examples in that subsection or in some other way more clearly delineate its scope. If, on the other hand, the agency does mean to ban some unmentioned, nonessential ingredients even from individual sale, then it must articulate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>the basis of distinction of such substances from those now listed in \u00a7 125.2(b)(5). Judicial review of the handling of the unmentioned substances cannot even begin until the FDA has clarified matters at least to the extent just outlined. We expect the agency to complete this process before expiration of the stay granted in Part II <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b852-5\">. Some petitioners direct a procedural attack as well, primarily concerning lack of notice, at \u00a7 125.1(h). In view of our holding that the x&gt;rovision is substantively invalid, we need not consider this procedural argument \u2014 which we find of questionable merit in any event.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b852-6\">. The FDA claims <em>inter alia </em>that the issue of statutory authority, <em>of. </em>note 35 <em>infra, </em>has already been settled in its favor by the decisions, cited in Part I, <em>supra, </em>upholding other regulations, 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3.94 and 3.05, requiring that preparations of vitamins A and D in dosages exceeding 10,000 and 400 international units, respectively, shall be restricted to sale as prescription drugs. But the dominant consideration in both those cases was the determination that the FDA had properly provided by rule that these preparations could be dispensed only on prescription by a physician under \u00a7 503(b)(1)(B), authorizing this in the case of a drug intended for use by man which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARkq\">because of its toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect, or the method of its use, or the collateral measures necessary to its use, is not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drug.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 353(b) (1) (B). The decision that vitamins A and D in dosages above a given level were \u201cdrugs\u201d at all was reached in the first opinion with a degree of ease obviously dictated by Judge Frankel\u2019s view that they had properly been placed in the even more restrictive prescription category, and was reached in the second opinion without explicit treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b853-10\">. It is to be noted also, although this is of course not dispositive, that many common foods contain potencies per serving considerably above the upper limits. We are told, for example, that six ounces of fried beef liver contains 18 times the upper limit of vitamin A and that a glass of orange juice contains 140% the upper limit of vitamin C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"Aki\">. While we thus reach this holding as a question of insufficient evidence, we must agree with petitioners that an administrative interpretation in such direct conflict with a legislative definition might also be invalidated on the ground of exceeding the agency\u2019s statutory authority,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b854-7\">. Petitioner in number 73-2748 does attack the reasonableness of imposing such a requirement with respect to products within the upper limits sold as foods while not at the same time imposing it with respect to higher dosage products sold as over-the-counter drugs. In context, however, we understand this argument to be intended not as an assault on \u00a7 125.3(a), but rather as part of the more general reasonableness attack, <em>see </em>pp. 782-783, <em>supra, </em>on the upper limits and on the standards of identity as a whole. In any event, it was perfectly reasonable for the agency to rely on the drug labeling provisions and the future course of the pending over-the-counter drug proceedings, <em>see </em>Part III <em>supra, </em>to handle the informing function with respect to high-dosage products which it chose not to reach with \u00a7 125.3(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b854-12\">. There are occasional exceptions to this ratio with regard to children under 4 and with regard to the category of older children and adults, and the general ratio does not apply at all with respect to the category of pregnant or lactating women.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-13\">Since for most people-with balanced diets, ordinary foods will supply all necessary vitamins and minerals (except perhaps sufficient iron, <em>see </em>p. 802 infra) without need of supplementation, supplementation by the maxima will provide them with 250% of what is deemed necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b855-8\">. Although the Government\u2019s brief says that the new edition \u201creduc[es] the RDA\u2019s for several nutrients,\u201d the publication makes a number of adjustments in each direction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b855-9\">. The further suggestion of the NAS at the very end of its discussion of \u201cProduct Development, Nutritional Labeling, and Regulation of Nutritional Quality\u201d that \u201cfor new products that are not identified in any way with traditional products but which might become important sources of energy, RDA expressed per 100 kcal could provide a standard for nutritional formulation,\u201d and that this might include the setting of maxima per 100 kcal \u201cto guard against possibility of hazardous excesses,\u201d is irrelevant to the products at issue in the current proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b855-14\">. The record apparently contains no data showing how far these percentages might be increased as a result of the FDA\u2019s having set the maxima at generally 150% rather than 100% of the RDA\u2019s.

Scientists and professional witnesses were asked to return on numerous occasions for additional cross-examination.

Indeed the Participants were affirmatively, although we assume unintentionally, misled.

FDA experts Filer, Grollman, Boehne, Hodges, Gyorgy, and Olson were available for cross-examination before the 1968 RDA\u2019s were public.

That Dr. Robinson was caught by surprise by the sudden change in rules is apparent in the forcefulness of his objection to it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-7\">You have never denied this right to anyone before in this hearing. . . . You gave no notice of this. The precedent has been established that we would have the right to cross-examine these so-called friendly opponents . . . .

And I move that I be allowed to cross-examine this witness.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b858-10\">. At one point, obviously exasperated by Dr. Robinson\u2019s persistence in cross-examination, the Hearing Examiner made perfectly clear his view of Dr. Robinson\u2019s efforts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-11\">Let me add one more word. Doctor, I have been extremely patient with you now for several months. If I arrive at the conviction that you are doing this deliberately and that it is your purpose to unduly extend this public hearing and in that way disrupt it and inconvenience all the people here involved I will not hesitate to exclude you. I am warning you.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b858-12\">. In an argument to the Examiner, Dr. Robinson explained what he considered to be the contrariety of the positions of the NHF and the AMA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-13\">They are AMA witnesses, Mr. Examiner, and anybody with half an eye to see knows that the AMA wants these regulations to entrench its monopoly in the field of the practitioners of health. The chiropractors, Christian Scientist practitioners, and naturo-paths, every practitioner not [approved] by the AMA uses these food supplements in his work. If these are barred and taken off the market in full variety and full potency the AMA\u2019s monopoly in the field of health is thereby further entrenched, and the National Health Federation has known this for many years now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-16\">Furthermore, Mr. Examiner, the AMA is against do-it-yourself treatment [with] high potency harmless vitamins. That competes with the AMA doctors that want people to come to their office and pay, pay well, pay $15 for the visit, pay up to 30 times as much for the vitamin on prescription. There is a deadly collusion here, Mr. Examiner, between certain elements in the AMA leadership and the 101 billion-dollar food industry. If you carry out your prohibition to stop me from cross-examining on this, you are aiding and abetting that collusion, Mr. Examiner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-17\">While Dr. Robinson\u2019s rhetoric may have exaggerated the differences between the Participants, even the FDA acknowledged \u201cthat all non-government parties may not have been aligned in all respects.\u201d Brief for Respondents at 80. Indeed, with regard to the Participant sponsoring Dr. Sebrell as a witness, the AMA, FDA counsel stated that \u201cin large part they support the very type of regulation that we are issuing here and debating about.\u201d A distinterested observer of the proceeding was moved to note, \u201cIn connection with this limitation on cross-examination, the examiner tended to treat all opponents of the proposed regulations as having parallel interests and denied most requests to cross-examine, even in situations where the general positions of the two parties were clearly antagonistic .\u201d Hamilton, <em>supra </em>at 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-18\">The reasoning process by which the Hearing Examiner arrived at his conclusion that the Participants to the proceeding could be divided into but two groups \u2014 the FDA and all the others \u2014 for purposes of determining which Participants were to be deemed to have the requisite adverseness for cross-examination is tortured and bears out Professor Hamilton\u2019s observation that selection of so inexperienced a hearing examiner was \u201cunfor-nate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1148. Since each non-FDA Participant was opposed to at least one part of the proposed regulations, reasoned the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>Hearing Examiner, all had a common interest \u2014 to oppose the adoption of the regulations as then written. It was perhaps his prior experience as a trial lawyer with the Government, suggests Professor Hamilton, that \u201ctended to cause him to view the proceeding as a trial and the various parties to the proceeding as adversary litigants,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1148, for in explaining his ruling on the cross-examination issue the Examiner noted that \u201cthe proponent is the Government, while the participants, as adversaries of the proponent, are now presenting their defense to the proposed regulations . . . . The fact that the defense is not a joint defense is a matter of choice by the participants. That choice \u2014 that is, to present their cases in defense severally \u2014 does not operate to somehow make them [adverse] to each other, and entitle them to the right to cross-examine each other\u2019s witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">That the AMA and NHF did not work out a \u201ccommon defense,\u201d however, was not a matter of \u201cchoiceno such \u201ccommon defense\u201d was possible. Much trouble would have been avoided if the Hearing Examiner liad recognized this obvious fact or if FDA counsel had tried to prevent him from falling into error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b859-8\">. The FDA\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Se-brell, a witness offered by a Participant whose interests, under the Hearing Examiner\u2019s scheme, were \u201cadverse\u201d to the FDA, was something short of aggressive. With respect to the crucial question of the scientific basis for the figures contained in the RDA tables, the FDA\u2019s cross-examination yielded only the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-12\">Q. Now, Doctor, with respect to these tables . . . , generally, would you explain for us the method and rationale whereby you arrived at these figures? A. I believe this was explained fairly well in my direct testimony. These figures were derived from the recommended dietary allowances of the National Research Council, National Academy of Sciences ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxS\">The- direct testimony to which Dr. Sebrell referred was merely descriptive and conclusory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-14\">Q. In your opinion, is the table [containing the 1968 RDA\u2019s] a suitable basis for a system of regulations of vitamin and mineral supplements, fortified foods, and other foods offered for special dietary use because of vitamin and mineral content? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-15\">Q. What is the basis for your opinion? A. Because it is the concensus of the best scientific opinion in this country. This document was prepared by about 15 subcommittees consisting of about 200 people. It was then approved and accepted by the entire Food and Nutrition Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-16\">The short of it is that at no time did the FDA attempt to go behind Dr. Sebrell\u2019s assertion of the prestige of the Board as a basis for adopting the RDA figures and ask harder questions about the basis for the figures in scientific fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b860-4\">. Counsel for PMA noted generally that the division of Participants was \u201cfoolhardy,\u201d \u201cinaccurate,\u201d and \u201ctends to suggest that all parties other than the Government have similar interests, because the wording [in the Hearing Examiner\u2019s order of December 24, 1969] is \u2018other participants,\u2019 which suggests all other parties are in one basket with similar interests, which obviously is not the case.\u201d More specifically, Mr. Dym said that \u201cit is obvious Dr. Robinson and his client and the client I represent are not united in interest in this proceeding.\u201d Indeed, the Hearing Examiner himself appears to have agreed with Mr. Dym\u2019s assessment in this respect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b860-6\">. The EDA suggests that Dr. Robinson\u2019s particular interest in cross-examining Dr. Sebrell was not apparent at the time to the Hearing Examiner. \u201c[F]rom the record it is obvious that Dr. Robinson . . . simply desired to ask each and every witness to the proceeding repetitious questions . . . . \u201d Brief for Respondent at 83. The Hearing Examiner\u2019s exercise of his discretion in refusing to allow Dr. Robinson to cross-examine Dr. Sebrell was reasonable, therefore, \u201csince it is apparent that the cross-examination related to nothing more than argument on matters already sufficiently developed by the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">Aside from the fact that NHF served two notices (January 6, 1970, and January 20, 1970) of its intent to cross-examine Dr. Sebrell, each notice naming him individually, Dr. Robinson made very clear in oral argument that NHF regarded Dr. Sebrell\u2019s testimony to be of particular importance for sustaining the validity of the RDA tables:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-14\">In more detail, Mr. Examiner, why this testimony is adverse to the interests of the National Health Federation, Dr. Sebrell has testified extensively on 125.1 which upholds the FDA position that there shall be no more variety and no greater potency allowed than these stayed orders provide. ......[T]he main interest of the National Health Federation has been that the variety and potency of harmless vitamins not be restricted [Dr. Sebrell knows] a great deal . about how scientific the RDA\u2019s are. And we challenge the scientific nature of these RDA\u2019s, and we will argue that they are arbitrary ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-17\">The FDA also suggests that Dr. Robinson\u2019s notices of intent to cross-examine were virtually identical for all witnesses and were therefore justifiably given routinely negative treatment. While certain patterns of language do recur in the notices, nevertheless Dr. Robinson did identify specific and differing parts of the testimony of each witness in his notices. They cannot be said to be identical in this important respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-18\">Moreover, the Hearing Examiner could hardly be heard to confess surprise at Dr. Robinson\u2019s special interest in Dr. Sebrell in view of the Examiner\u2019s own observation during Dr. Sebrell\u2019s testimony that \u201cwe are talking to a man who is one of the outstanding authorities in this country.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b861-6\">. The fact that the FDA ultimately upheld the Hearing Examiner scarcely shows it would have done so if the issue had been presented at a time when reversal would not have been so costly.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The practice of agency hearing of appeals from truly critical evidentiary rulings by hearing examiners appears to have worked admirably in the SEC and NLRB. <em>See </em>17 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.12 (codification of SEC Rule XII(a)), 201.11(e) (1973); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 102.26, 102.41 (1972) ; Gellhorn and Larsen, Interlocutory Appeal Procedures in Administrative Hearings, 70 Mich.L.Rev. 109, 119-24, 130-34 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b861-8\">. Dr. Robinson had made this very clear. <em>See </em>note 54, <em>supra. </em>Counsel for petitioners in Nos. 73-2129 and 73-2166 also objected strenuously to being denied an opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Sebrell about the \u201crationale for the table prepared by\u201d him. When counsel persisted in his objections, he was threatened with expulsion from the hearing room.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b861-9\">. The fortification program was to appear in \u00a7 80.2, a section which is not a part of the regulations here at issue. According to Dr. Schweigert, the program envisioned fortification of some foods at levels between 25 and 100 percent of the RDA\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"58\">\n<p id=\"b861-10\">. In fact, Dr. Schweigert did give some testimony about the validity of pre-1968 RDA\u2019s for purposes of the food fortification program mentioned in note 57. He testified that those RDA\u2019s, if met by the diet, would provide adequate nutrition for the majority of the population and that their use as a foundation for a food fortification program was reasonable. It is thus arguable that there was some basis in his direct testimony for questions during cross-examination about the scientific validity of the pre-1968 RDA tables, though his direct testimony in this respect was limited to the relationship between the then-existing RDA\u2019s and a now defunct regulatory proposal for fortifying food. However, he was not permitted to respond to cross-examination questions about the validity of the tables.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"59\">\n<p id=\"b861-12\">. Dr. Sebrell\u2019s personal role in the development of the derivations is apparent in his testimony. With respect to a change in the recommended level of thiamin, he said that the change was necessary \u201csince in my opinion the proposed quantities are a little bit too low for safety and the slight increase indicated more nearly meets the physiological need.\u201d In support of its finding (contained in Finding of Fact 36 for Part 80, 38 C.F.R. 20737 (1973)), that the table incorporated into \u00a7 80.1(f)(1) \u201crepresents a reasonable and scientifically accurate adaptation\u201d of the 1968 RDA\u2019s, the FDA cites only Dr. Sebrell\u2019s testimony. Similarly the findings (contained in Finding of Fact 19 for Part 80, 38 F.R. 20735 (1973)) that the Food and Nutrition Board\u2019s 1968 RDA\u2019s \u201cshould be used as the source of authentic and reliable information on which to base a standard of identity for dietary supplements\u201d and that the U.S. RDA\u2019s \u201cmay reasonably be derived\u201d from those 1968 figures rely entirely on the testimony of Dr. Sebrell. Finding of Fact 6 for Part 80, which lists ten essential minerals, relies only upon Dr. Sebrell\u2019s testimony. Dr. Sebrell is also cited with others in support of the following Findings: 4, 5, 11, 12, 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>16, 17, 19 (Part 80, 38 F.R. 20734-35 (1973)); 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 44, 45 (Part 125, 38 F.R. 20713-15 (1973)). With respect to Part 125, Finding 12, listing the thirteen essential minerals, relies solely on Dr. Sebrell\u2019s testimony (38 F.R. 20713 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"AX8\">To be sure, other FDA witnesses generally supported the validity of the RDA tables in the regulations, <em>see </em>Finding of Fact 9 (Part 125, 38 F.R. 20713 (1973)), but none had the personal experience of Dr. Sebrell upon which to base such an endorsement and some of the critical Findings could be supported only by Dr. Sebrell among the FDA\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b862-7\">. The other Board members who were witnesses were Dr. Darby, Dr. Hand, and Dr. Mueller. Dr. Robinson gave notice of intent to cross-examine all three because, in his view, their testimony supported the FDA\u2019s position on the RDA issue. His requests were turned down.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b862-8\">. In the words of the Senate Committee, \u201cTo the extent that cross-examination is necessary to bring out the truth, the party should have it.\u201d Sen.Doc.No.248, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. 209 (1946), quoted in 2 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 14.15, at 328 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"62\">\n<p id=\"b862-9\">. Dr. Robert Harris, Emeritus Professor of Nutritional Biochemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, characterized the Food and Nutrition Board\u2019s efforts as guesswork.

Petitioners in No. 74-1055 assert that, because Dr. Sebrell was never under cross-examination by counsel for truly adverse Participants, his financial connections with the food industry (which arguably has an interest in lower RDA\u2019s) through the Nutrition Foundation, which is dominated, we are told, by food interests and which subsidizes certain expenses of the Food and Nutrition Board, could never be explored. Any bias on his part, say petitioners, thus remains undiscovered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b862-13\">. One apparent set of inconsistencies involves the number of minerals deemed to be \u201cessential.\u201d With respect to Part 125, the FDA has determined that there are thirteen essential minerals, <em>see </em>Finding of Fact 12, 38 F.R. 20713 (1973) ; for purposes of Part 80, essential minerals \u201cinclude\u201d only ten, <em>see </em>Finding of Fact 6, 38 F.R. 20734 (1973). In both cases, the same testimony by Dr. Se-brell is cited. While there is no inherent inconsistency between the two findings, one might wonder why there should be a difference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"65\">\n<p id=\"b862-14\">. It can be argued that, to borrow Mr. Justice Fortas\u2019 language in NLRB v.

The FDA\u2019s approach on this question was passive and seems to reflect the assumption that its conclusion must be taken as true until proven otherwise. <em>See </em>38 F.R. 20710 (1973) (\u201cNo evidence, except for testimony which related to specific segments of the population, such as that contained in paragraph 45 of the Proposed Findings of Fact [relating to the iron needs of women and children, of which more <em>infra], </em>is contained in the Hearing Record to establish that a diet of ordinary foods cannot satisfy all nutrition needs.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"75\">\n<p id=\"b866-9\">.. Indeed, the FDA made a finding of fact that \u201cit is often impractical to supply the iron needs of adult women with conventional foods, and iron supplementation is often advisable. ... In addition, the iron requirements of infancy and of the latter half of pregnancy are clearly in excess of what may be obtained from a conventional unfortified diet.\u201d 38 F.R. 20715 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"76\">\n<p id=\"b866-14\">. The FDA\u2019s other witness, Dr. Victor Herbert, was never seriously shaken from his testimony that evidence compiled by the Department of Agriculture does not support any contention that a dietary deficiency in minerals may be the result of loss of nutritive values in foods as a consequence of the soil on which the food is grown and that persons making such claims are staking out a position \u201ccontrary to the vast body of literature.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"77\">\n<p id=\"b866-15\">. This concession is supported by a number of other witnesses and by a proposed finding of the Hearing Eixaminer that soils in different parts of the United States are deficient in one or more nutrients and that a soil deficient in iodine, selenium, or zinc would produce plants with lesser concentrations of these minerals.

It should be noted that the substances referred to in the proi&gt;osed statement are not seen as essential nutrients by the FDA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"79\">\n<p id=\"b867-11\">. Since, as the Hearing Examiner found, <em>see </em>note 77 <em>supra, </em>soil deficiency is very much a local matter and since most people eat foods grown in a variety of locales, it is difficult to believe that even a national patchwork of local areas with soils in varying degrees deficient in various minerals could give rise to a \u201cgeneral deficiency in the daily diet.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"80\">\n<p id=\"b867-17\">. Such losses can be quite substantial.

In the absolute sense, there is little question that some of the substances which may not be combined with essential nutrients are of significant value in human nutrition. There was evidence, for instance, that inositol \u201cdefinitely\u201d played \u201ca significant role\u201d in human nutrition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"83\">\n<p id=\"b868-19\">. Inositol may reasonably be deemed nonessential because, according to the testimony of Dr. Olaf Mickelsen, even when persons were deprived of outside sources of it in an experiment, no inositol deficiency developed. The body is evidently capable of manufacturing its own supply of this substance. Similarly, biotin, a vitamin in the vitamin B group, was deemed nonessential because there is no known deficiency condition which could require supplementation by it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"84\">\n<p id=\"b869-6\">. <em>Of. </em>United States v.

Counsel for National Nutritional Foods Association, Solgar Co., Inc., and National Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers fear that this provision \u201cis so broad as to suggest that any statement in the labeling, other than a mere listing of the ingredients on the label of a vitamin product that it is made from natural sources, would constitute a prohibited claim, suggestion or implication that natural vitamins are superior to synthetic vitamins.\u201d Their fears are perhaps understandable in light of finding 27:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-10\">A large number of dietary suplements on our domestic market advertise or otherwise call attention to the claim that their ingredients are \u201cnatural\u201d or derived from \u201cnatural sources.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-16\">which makes no reference to claims of superiority, and finding 28:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-17\">More than half of the people in the United States are likely to choose foods for special dietary uses that contain ingredients described as \u201cnatural\u201d or derived from \u201cnatural sources\u201d in the belief that \u201cnatural\u201d foods are superior to \u201csynthetic foods.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-18\">38 F.R. 20714 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"86\">\n<p id=\"b869-19\">. Some petitioners also argue that the source of vitamins is relevant for a consumer choosing among vitamin supplements because natural vitamins are often accompanied by other known nutrients or unidentified nutritional factors which may eventually be found useful in human nutrition. With respect to the independent nutritional importance of many such substances accompanying natural vitamins, however, Dr. Victor Herbert pointed out that those substances could as easily be harmful as beneficial.
