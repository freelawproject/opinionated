The Board found that the Company had violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act by coercively interrogating employees about their own and other employees\u2019 union activities and by threatening job loss if employees chose union representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Upon consideration of the record as a whole, we are of the opinion that substantial evidence supports the finding as to violation of Section 8(a)(1), though we find no coercive interrogation in the conversations between foreman Simpson and employee Clark or supervisor Whittle and employee Rigsby which were relied upon in part by the Administrative Law Judge and the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">It is therefore ordered that enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
