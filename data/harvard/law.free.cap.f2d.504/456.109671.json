Count I of the indictment charged that Bath had knowingly reported payments of union money to hired pickets as \u201cstrike benefits\u201d to union members in violation of section 209(b) of the LMRDA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 439(b); Count II charged that he willfully made false entries in records required to be kept for the purpose of verifying or clarifying the local union\u2019s annual financial reports to the Secretary of Labor in violation of section 209(c), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 439(c). Following conviction, Bath was sentenced to 18 months\u2019 probation for each violation, to run concurrently. We affirm his conviction under section 209(b) and decline to reach the issues raised with respect to his conviction under section 209(c) since reversal on that count would not alter the sentence imposed by the court below; nor are we able to discern the possibility of any adverse consequences to Bath from our refusal to treat his appeal from the second conviction. <em>See </em>Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707; Barnes v. United States, 412 U.S. 837, 848 n. 16, 93 S.Ct. 2357, 37 L.Ed.2d 380; United States v. Sawyer, 10 Cir., 485 F.2d 195, 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>In 1970, Local 961 struck the Centennial Turf Club, a racetrack in Denver, Colorado. Local 961 established a picket line at Centennial which was manned during the strike by at least 31 persons none of whom worked at Centennial. Four of the pickets were not members of the Teamsters union; the rest were either other members of Local 961 or members of sister Teamster locals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In order to pay the pickets an hourly wage and expenses, Local 961 sent to the Teamsters International office and subsequently to the Western Conference of Teamsters a list of 80 names for whom the local purported to request \u201cout-of-work benefits,\u201d that is, union money for members affected by a labor dispute. Of the 80 names on the list sent in request of benefits, only about 20 worked at Centennial in 1970; the rest were persons previously employed at the racetrack.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The list did not name the pickets to whom the requested funds were eventually paid. In response to Local 961\u2019s requests for money, which were renewed weekly during the strike, the International and later the Conference sent a series of checks drawn on the union\u2019s strike fund. Each check was accompanied by the union\u2019s \u201cOut-of-Work Benefits Report\u201d form, which listed the 80 names previously submitted by the local and required signature by the listed persons acknowledging their receipt of funds. Bath and other Local 961 personnel forged these signatures on the reports, disbursed a total of $17,730 to the pickets, and then returned the reports to the International and Conference respectively. As the pickets were paid, the local\u2019s officials obtained accurate signed recepits from the actual payees and kept them in the local\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Bath testified that he used this method of channeling union money to his pickets in order to save time. Negotiations with Centennial had continued until immediately before its season opening. To establish quickly an effective picket line, Bath considered it necessary to obtain money by out-of-work benefits applications rather than by the slower process of applying for a grant of union funds to pay pickets. On cross-examination, he conceded that accounting for the $17,730 as payments to hired pickets rather than as benefits payments to members would have increased the local\u2019s .1970 operating losses from approximately $35,000 to approximately $52,000. Whatever Bath\u2019s purposes, however, none of the funds obtained from the International or the Conference was diverted to the personal use of Bath or any other union official.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Section 209(b) of the' LMRDA prohibits . any person from making a false statement or representation of a material fact in any report required under the LMRDA. Section 201(b) of the LMRDA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 431(b), requires every labor organization through its president and treasurer to file an annual financial report (form LM-2) with the Secretary of Labor. The LM-2 form requires disclosure, <em>inter alia, </em>of receipts and disbursements of union funds; its Schedules 8 through 12 and Schedule 14 require particularization of cash disbursements under the categories \u201cDisbursements to Officers,\u201d \u201cDisbursements to Employees,\u201d \u201cPurchase of Investments and Fixed Assets,\u201d \u201cBenefits,\u201d '.\u2018Contributions, Gifts and Grants,\u201d and \u201cOther Disbursements.\u201d Labor Department instructions accompanying form LM-2 define \u201cBenefits\u201d as \u201call disburse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>ments for the direct\u2019or indirect benefit of officers, employees, or members.\u201d The form\u2019s Schedule 11 which requires specification of the union\u2019s benefits disbursements requires a general disclosure of the recipients of benefits. Here Local 961\u2019s accountant entered the word \u201cMembers\u201d beside the $17,730 figure. The instructions define \u201cDisbursements to Employees\u201d as \u201cthe total salaries . . allowances, and other direct and indirect expenses . . . for all employees.\u201d \u201cOther Disbursements\u201d is defined as disbursements that do not fit under the other more particular categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Count I of Bath\u2019s indictment charged that besides falsely reporting $17,730 as \u201cstrike benefits\u201d to members under the LM-2 form\u2019s \u201cBenefits\u201d category, Bath knowingly failed to disclose that the money \u201cwas a strike expense paid to hired pickets.\u201d In this appeal Bath argues that even if his 1970 LM-2 form improperly listed-the money under \u201cBenefits,\u201d still his conviction cannot stand unless the evidence supports the conclusion that the sum <em>must </em>have been listed under the catch-all \u201cOther Disbursements\u201d category since the term \u201cstrike expenses\u201d contained in the indictment does not appear on the LM-2 or in the accompanying instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">We believe that this argument entails an overly technical reading of the indictment. The essence of the charge is that Bath knowingly reported the money as having gone to members on strike when it was actually used to pay hired pickets for their time. Reading the indictment, as Bath urges, to require proof that the $17,730 could only have been reported as a strike expense under the LM-2 form\u2019s \u201cOther Disbursements\u201d category therefore ignores the import of Count I.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such a requirement of proof, moreover, would unnecessarily defeat the purpose of the LMRDA to insure that union officers accurately report to union members the details of all' disbursements of union money. In this respect the Senate Report on the bill that became the LMRDA remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-11\">Labor organizations are creations of their members; union funds belong to the members and should be expended only in furtherance of their common interest. . \u2022 . . The members who are the real owners of the money and property of the organization are entitled to a full accounting of all transactions involving their property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-13\">\u2022X- -X- -X- -X- -X- -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-14\">[U]nion members armed with adequate information and having the benefit of secret elections . . would rid themselves of untrustworthy or corrupt officers. (S.Rep.No.187, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 U.S.Code Cong, and Admin. News, 1959, at pp. 2324, 2325.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-16\">Certainly the members of Local 961 had an interest in knowing whether members or nonmembers received union money and in knowing the purposes for which such money was paid. We believe this is precisely the interest that Congress intended to protect by enacting the LMRDA and therefore reject any reading of the indictment that unnecessarily prevents vindication of that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-17\">Bath next contends that the court erred in failing to instruct the jury that it must determine whether the statements on the LM-2 form were false based upon the Labor Department\u2019s definitions as contained in its instructions to form LM-2. Instead the court instructed the jury to decide whether the disbursements \u201cwere falsely reported as strike benefits paid to members.\u201d We believe that the court\u2019s instruction as given substantially conformed to the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>\u201cstrike benefit\u201d that follows from the express definitions contained in the Labor Department\u2019s instructions. Accordingly, we hold that the court below provided the jury with a correct standard by which to test the falsity of the entries on the LM-2 form.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Bath finally contends that as a matter of law he could not have possessed the guilty state of mind required by section 209(b). He reasons as follows. Since the question whether the $17,730 should have been entered as a \u201cbenefit\u201d was a matter of dispute among experts,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Bath could not have <em>willfully </em>intended to make a false entry. Bath, moreover, was advised by Teamsters officials to rely on the advice of his accountant in the preparation of the LM-2 form; his good faith reliance negated the possibility of his own guilty intent. Bath observes that the local\u2019s 1970 LM-2 report made no attempt to intermingle the $17,730 figure with other entries or otherwise to obscure the nature of the disbursements. He also notes that his local kept accurate written receipts from the paid pickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">We do not believe these circumstances absolve Bath of the crime charged in Count I. Contrary to the assumption of Bath\u2019s counsel, the state of mind expressly required by section 209(b) is not willfulness but <em>knowledge </em>that the statement made in the LM-2 was false. Although statutory terms designating culpability are sometimes elastic and often used confusingly, it is clear that the government need only have proved that Bath knew that the LM-2 falsely listed as benefits paid to members money actually paid to hired pickets. Bath\u2019s signature on the LM-2 raised the presumption that he knew its contents and the evidence does not as a matter of law destroy that presumption. Nor does Bath\u2019s alleged reliance on the advice of his accountant insulate him from criminal liability. In United States v. Oates, 3 Cir., 467 F.2d 129, cert. denied, 410 U.S. 909, 93 S.Ct. 965, 35 L.Ed.2d 271, the court acknowledged reliance on the advice of an accountant as a defense to a charge under section 209(b), but refused to recognize the defense where the defendant supplied the accountant with false information with which to prepare the report. In the present case the accountant preparing the LM-2 was given access both to the receipts from the pickets to whom funds were paid and also to copies of the falsified Out-of-Work Benefits Reports. Since Bath did not offer evidence to prove that the accountant relied solely on the receipts from the pickets as the basis of the \u201cBenefits\u201d entry in the LM-2, the jury was free to believe that the accountant relied rather upon the falsified Out-of-Work Benefits Reports. Bath is simply foreclosed from asserting his good faith reliance upon his accountant.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-5\">. Donald Espeland, the Labor Department investigator who audited Local 961\u2019s LM-2 report, testified that 31 persons manned the picket lines in addition to an undetermined number of pickets from Teamsters Local 13. Espeland further testified on cross-examination by Bath\u2019s' counsel that Local 961\u2019s bookkeeper, Mary Butler, had informed him that four of the 31 pickets were not Teamsters and eight were Teamsters. He had no further knowledge of the pickets\u2019 union status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b522-10\">. Local 961 officials testified that they did not have access to the names of Centennial\u2019s 1970 employees at the time the local applied for union benefit funds. Business agent Charles Hasslock therefore compiled the list from union dues ledger cards collected from Centennial employees between 1967 and 1969.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b523-9\">. Even assuming we adopt Bath's reading of the Indictment, the government\u2019s failure to prove that the $17,730 could only have been reported as strike expenses under \u201cOther Disbursements\u201d need not be fatal to Bath\u2019s conviction. \u201cIt is not essential that everything in an indictment be proved. It is only necessary <em>to prove so </em>mud) thereof as establishes, <em>prima facie, </em>that there has been a violation of the statute involved.\u201d United States v. Archer, 10 Cir., 455 F.2d 193, 194, <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 856, 93 S.Ct. 135, 34 L.Ed.2d 100.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b524-6\">. Joseph Ballew, assistant director of the Western Conference of Teamsters, defined \u201cstrike benefits\u201d as payments to \u201c[m] embers of the local union involved who are employees wherever the dispute has developed into a strike activity.\u201d John P. Linn, professor of law at University of Denver College of Law, testified that disbursements to hired pickets could be categorized as \u201cbenefits\u201d to union employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b524-9\">HOLLOWAY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AQx\">(concurring and dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">I agree with the opinion as to the af-firmance of the conviction on count I, but am unable to agree as to count II and would reverse the conviction on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">The opinion reasons that we should decline review of count II because no possible adverse consequences can be discerned from refusal to treat the second conviction, the sentences of 18 months\u2019 probation on each count being concurrent. However, as the Special Findings of the District Court made after trial point out, probation is not the only consequence involved here. Under 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 504 appellant also is barred from serving as an officer (he is President of Local 961 and holds other union offices) director, etc., of a labor organization for 5 years after such conviction, unless the Board of Parole determines that such person\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>service would not be contrary to the purposes of the statute. The Supreme Court has pointed specifically to the effect of this bar of \u00a7 504 against serving as an official of a labor union in rejecting the contention of mootness where a sentence has already been served. Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U.S. 234, 237, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 554. I feel that similar considerations apply here, calling for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In its Special Findings the District Court, after referring to the bar of \u00a7 504 on holding office, made several observations favorable to appellant, stating that the penalty is one the Court would not impose if it lay in its discretion, although the Court subscribed heartily to the general purpose o,f the statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In these circumstances I feel we cannot say that adverse circumstances may not result for appellant from refusal to review count II. The Board of Parole will have power to determine whether or when appellant is to be relieved from the penalty of being unable for 5 years to serve in such positions as he has held. The District Court\u2019s Special Findings will serve as a factor favorable to him. Whether there are one or two separate convictions will be another factor before the Board. I am not satisfied that the circumstance of two convictions, instead of one, might not affect the Board\u2019s judgment and feel we should review count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">As to this count, I am persuaded by appellant\u2019s argument that the Government proof did not show a violation of 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 439(c). Among other things, that portion of \u00a7 439 prohibits wilfully making a false entry in any books, records, reports or statements required to be kept by the statute. Section 436 imposes a requirement to maintain records on the matters required to be reported which will provide in sufficient detail the necessary basic information and data from which the documents filed may be verified, explained or clarified, and checked for accuracy and completeness, including \u201cvouchers, worksheets, receipts, and applicable resolutions. . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">Here the proof as to count II was that there were false entries in the \u201cOut-of-Work Benefits Report\u201d forms sent down to Local 961 by the International and the Conference. The entries made were the signatures (which were forged) by persons acknowledging their receipt of funds. These reports were sent to the International and the Conference, but copies were kept in the Local\u2019s files. The Reports were used by the International and the Conference to plan for disbursements of cash to local union members. As the opinion points out, the Local also obtained accurate signed receipts from the actual payees and kept them in the Local\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">To me the statute should not be construed to cover these Reports. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>were initiated from the other union offices and served their planning purposes. Section 436 seems to be aimed at those vouchers, worksheets, receipts and the like which are the basic papers initiated and used by the reporting unit \u2014 here the Local. The statute\u2019s application has been made to such vouchers, financial statements and cash disbursement journals of the reporting unit. <em>E. g., </em>United States v. Budzanoski, 462 F.2d 443 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 949, 93 S.Ct. 271, 34 L.Ed.2d 220; United States v. Haggerty, 419 F.2d 1003 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1064, 90 S.Ct. 1502, 25 L.Ed.2d 686. While the statute might in other circumstances reach reports having connection with two offices and their purposes, here it does not seem to me that the statute applies. As a -criminal statute it must be strictly construed and any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of lenity. United States v. Enmons, 410 U.S. 396, 411, 93 S.Ct. 1007, 35 L.Ed.2d 379. Therefore I would set aside the conviction on count II.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-7\">. Among other things the Special Findings state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">In rhe view of the Court, the evidence presented during the trial of this case disclosed a technical violation of the provisions of 29 U.S.O. \u00a7 439. , There was no evidence of personal gain or profit to defendant and there was no evidence that defendant intended personal gain or profit. The evidence disclosed an intent on defendant\u2019s part to benefit the local union and the members of the local union represented by defendant. In substantial part, defendant\u2019s wrongful acts were the result of poor judgment, carelessness or reliance on the advice of others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">Read in the context with the crimes mentioned in the statute, the statutory penalty here imposed is fairly comparable to the imposition of statutory mandatory minimum sentences sometimes required by Congress under circumstances a court does not believe warrant such mandatory minimum penalties. The harsh penalty here imposed is one required by Congress, and the Court is given no power or discretion to lessen the impact of what will probably mean five years of economic hardship on defendant and his family. The penalty is one the Court would not impose if the penalty lay within the Court\u2019s discretion. The Congressional purpose in enacting this statute is clear, and it is one to which the Court heartily subscribes, but in the Court's opinion, the facts proven as to this defendant do not fit the intended pattern of the declared Congressional purpose, although the conviction does come within the statutory provisions.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
