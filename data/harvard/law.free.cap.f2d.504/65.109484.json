Has any promise been made to you by anyone at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-17\">Defendant Forrens: No, Your Hon- or.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-18\">The Court: Your [sic] are not</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-19\">pleading because of any promise by anyone at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-20\">Defendant Forrens: No, Your Hon- or.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-21\">The Court: You understand that a promise is not binding on this judge. The judge is the only one that can sentence you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-22\">Defendant Forrens: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-23\">The Court: The only one in the world. You understand that I can give you the limit, the twenty-five years and the fine ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-24\">Defendant Forrens: Yes, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-25\">The Court: Has anything hap-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-26\">pened prior to today to cause you to enter this plea other than the fact that you are guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-27\">Defendant Forrens: No, Your Hon- or.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-28\">The Court: If you have any reason to claim that this guilty plea is not freely and voluntarily and understanding^ made, now is your time to speak out. Do you understand ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-29\">Defendant Forrens: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-31\">The Court: By your guilty plea you are now saying to this Court that you are not pleading because of any promises or any threats or any mistreatment of any kind whatsoever but because you desire to admit that you are guilty, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-32\">Defendant Forrens: Yes, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-33\">The Court: Can you think of any reason at all why I should not accept this plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Defendant Forrens: No, Sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">The record clearly demonstrates that petitioner\u2019s claim that he did not understand the proceedings conducted in English is patently frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Petitioner\u2019s claim that he entered his plea on the promise and expectancy of a lighter sentence is also completely refuted by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The colloquy quoted above occurred with the petitioner under oath. In some cases the solemn affirmation that the plea is not induced by a promise of leniency is not conclusive, because a petitioner might claim that \u201che thought that this was all part of the game, and that honest answers would destroy the deal.\u201d United States v. Tweedy, 419 F.2d 192, 193 (9th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">But no such claim is made here, nor, in the face of the record, could it have been. Petitioner entered his plea in February of 1971. Shortly thereafter, and before sentence, he wrote a long letter to the judge, making no mention of any promised leniency, but asking only that his place of confinement be in Southern California.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">It was not until more than two years later, when this petition was filed in August 1973, that any mention was made of the promise of a lesser sentence. It is beyond belief that one who received a twenty-five year sentence instead of the seven years he had been promised would wait so long before complaining. Where the petitioner has sworn, under oath, that no deal has been made and that he has not been induced to plead guilty by any promises or threats, his subsequent claim that a promise had in fact been made must be supported by stronger contentions than those offered in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">We agree with the District Court that the records and files in this case conclusively show that petitioner is not entitled to the relief which he seeks. Therefore, no hearing was required. United States v. Tweedy, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b130-34\"> Honorable Robert H. Schnacke, United States District Judge for the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b131-12\">HUFSTEDLER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ADG\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b131-13\">The possibility is minimal that petitioner could prove that he lacked sufficient proficiency in English to understand the nature and consequences of his plea. But I cannot agree with the majority that the record conclusively shows that his petition was frivolous. He should have been accorded an eviden-tiary hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
