SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"A71\">Appellant DeLoach and a co-defendant, Harry Jackson, were tried on an indictment charging each with the first degree murder<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of two individuals, Francis Harper and Brenda Willis, and with carrying an unlicensed pistol.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury acquitted Jackson of all charges but convicted DeLoach of two counts of second degree murder <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and of the weapons charge. This appeal proceeds on three theories: that the conduct of closing arguments prejudiced DeLoach\u2019s case, that the trial judge\u2019s instruction to the jury on \u201caiding and abetting\u201d was unclear, and that the judge erred in summarily denying appellant\u2019s pretrial motion challenging the jury selection system then in force in the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">We find that certain restrictions imposed on the closing argument of appellant\u2019s counsel were erroneous and that, in the context of this case, the errors were not harmless. Accordingly, we reverse the convictions. As for appellant\u2019s claim regarding the instruction on \u201caiding and abetting,\u201d we find no lack of clarity when, the jury charge is considered as a whole. The jury selection motion was properly denied by the District Court for the motion was not timely filed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">I. THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">The Government relied almost entirely on the testimony of a confessed accessory to the homicides, Stephen Davis, whose appearance was compelled under a grant of immunity pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6002 (1970). To demonstrate the importance of his testimony, we precede it with a brief summary of the other evidence introduced by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-16\">The police found the murder victims at about 6:40 p.m., September 26, 1971, near an intersection in the Northeast section of the District of Columbia. Brenda Willis, in the front passenger seat of a parked Cadillac, had two bullet wounds in the head, fired at close range, and a third wound in her shoulder; a .38 caliber slug was later found in her sinus cavity. She never recovered consciousness and died at the scene. Francis Harper, lying in the street nearby, had five bullet wounds. Two .38 caliber slugs and one .22 caliber slug were removed from his body. The .22 slug had entered the right side of Harper\u2019s face from extremely close range. He told officers he knew who had shot him; the name he mumbled before he died sounded to an observer like \u201cLloyd\u201d or \u201cFloyd.\u201d The police never found the murder weapons, nor could any fingerprints be lifted from the car. On the front seat of the Cadillac officers found a large bowl containing heroin and co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>caine valued at $4,000. Narcotics paraphernalia was found in the car, and autopsies revealed drugs in the blood of both victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The Government put on several eyewitnesses but conceded in opening argument that none would be able to identify the defendants; none was asked to do so. <em>While the witnesses\u2019 descriptions of persons glimpsed at the murder scene did not appear to fit DeLoach, several of the descriptions did appear to fit Stephen Davis.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Within about ten minutes of finding the victims, the police issued a radio call for a truck which several of the witnesses had observed leaving the scene. Almost immediately, responding officers stopped a nearby truck driven by Davis in which Jackson was a passenger. The two men were released after brief questioning since the truck did not precisely fit the description in the radio call. That night Harper\u2019s brother visited DeLoach, a friend of Harper, to tell him about the murders. While DeLoach professed surprise and sorrow, he kept a gun near him during the conversation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Such would have been the case absent Davis\u2019 testimony. The day after the murders, however, Davis engaged a lawyer and made a voluntary statement to the police about the affair. He was charged with first degree murder but released on bond. On April 28, 1972 an indictment issued charging Davis, Jackson, DeLoach, and Joseph Jackson, Davis\u2019 employer, with murder, conspiracy to murder, and possession of unlicensed weapons. But on the day of trial, August 21, 1972, the Government secured dismissal of all charges against Joseph Jackson and.Stephen Davis and of the conspiracy charge against all defendants. Davis was granted immunity and ordered to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">His testimony matched his earlier statement to the police; DeLoach had asked Davis and Jackson to drive him in the truck to Chillum, Maryland on the day of the murders. Along the way DeLoach got out to make a phone call and returned to tell his friends that the people he wished to see were not at home. A few minutes later, however, DeLoach saw a Cadillac several car lengths ahead and said, \u201cThere is the people that I want to see.\u201d Appellant got out of the truck and instructed Jackson to accompany him. As these two approached the Cadillac from opposite sides, Davis drove the truck around the corner. A moment later Davis heard gunshots and, at the same time, Jackson got back into the truck. Through the side mirror Davis saw DeLoach running up the street with a gun in his hand and also saw a body lying on the sidewalk. DeLoach reboarded the truck and the three drove off. DeLoach got out after several blocks, before the truck was stopped by the police, and Davis did not see him again until several months later, in court. Such was the story of the murders as told by Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">II. THE CONDUCT OF CLOSING ARGUMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">A. <em>The Restrictions on the Argument of Appellant\u2019s Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">Appellant\u2019s counsel used the bulk of his closing argument to show that none <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>of the evidence and testimony other than Davis\u2019 story incriminated DeLoach. This was necessary spadework, but it left unanswered why the jury should doubt Davis\u2019 testimony and how the murders occurred if not as Davis recounted. At the climax of his argument, counsel addressed these questions by attempting to show that Davis may have committed the murders himself. This attempt foundered in a sea of prosecution objections. To show the impact of these objections, we must resort here to rather lengthy quotations from the record.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\">MR. TREANOR [appellant\u2019s counsel at trial]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">\u2022X- -X- -X- X X- X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">Without Mr. Davis, there is no evidence against Mr. DeLoach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">And, what do you think of his story? We can start with the 28th of September when Officer Fickling saw the Defendant DeLoach in his own home and didn\u2019t make an arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Objection, your Honor. That is not in evidence. There is no evidence of that whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">THE COURT: Come to the bench.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">Tr. 878-879. After much haggling at the bench, the prosecutor conceded that appellant's counsel had indeed introduced the evidence to which he had ad-vented. The court properly overruled the prosecutor\u2019s objection. Several moments later appellant\u2019s counsel began to argue how the murders might have occurred :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-11\">[By Mr. Treanor] * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-12\">This is what happened that weekend ladies and gentlemen. This is Defendant DeLoach\u2019s theory of the case * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-13\">X * X X -X- X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-14\">So Davis stops the truck, and he gets out and goes back and gets in Harper\u2019s car. And, he has no thought in his mind of killing anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, I hate to object again, but there is nothing in the record to support that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-16\">THE COURT: I sustain that. We can\u2019t get into his mind. Disregard that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-17\">MR. TREANOR: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-18\">He had been drinking. He got into the back of the vehicle. Mr. Harper was there. Miss Willis was there. They were using narcotics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-19\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, I object again. He is speculating to something that there is nothing in the record about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-20\">MR. TREANOR: Well, we know they are in the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-21\">THE COURT: Where did you get this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-22\">MR. TREANOR: May we come to the bench?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-23\">THE COURT: Come to the bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-24\">(At the bench.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-25\">THE COURT: This is speculation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-26\">MR. TREANOR: My theory of the case is that Davis went back\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-27\">THE COURT: You have to get evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-28\">MR. TREANOR: He turns state evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-29\">THE COURT: He may have turned state\u2019s evidence. You may have wonderful theories, but you need evidence. I have ruled against you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-30\">MR. FOGEL [Jackson\u2019s counsel]: When he is through, can we take five minutes ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-31\">THE COURT: We will see. Keep going.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-32\">(In open Court.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-33\">THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, disregard that last statement of Mr. Treanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-34\">MR. TREANOR: There was a</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-35\">quarrel of some kind inside this vehicle. He said that Mr. Harper was on the driver\u2019s side and Miss Willis was on the other side. Whatever happened, the defense would argue to you that Miss Willis had in her possession the .22.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, I object. There is nothing to support that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-4\">THE COURT: Come to the bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">(At the bench.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">THE COURT: Where is there evidence that she had a 22 in her possession?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">MR. TREANOR: The bullet went from right to left, which meant it was fired from the passenger\u2019s side of the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-8\">THE COURT: You have no evidence that she had in her possession a 22.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-9\">MR. TREANOR: Your Honor, the inference came from the fact that there were open bags on the se[a]t, and they were selling narcotics. They would have carried weapons for their own protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-10\">THE COURT: I am sustaining the objection. You quit this fantasy you are getting into.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-11\">(In open court.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-12\">THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, disregard that last statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP4\">Tr. 882-885.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">Obviously flustered, appellant\u2019s counsel quickly wound up his argument by suggesting, in several sentences, that the Government had not shown DeLoach\u2019s \u201cmotive\u201d for the murders. Counsel then moved for a mistrial, which motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">B. <em>The Restrictions Were Erroneous</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-15\">A criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to counsel and to a jury trial encompass a right to have his theory of the case argued vigorously to the jury. United States v. Sawyer, 143 U.S.App.D.C. 297, 298 n. 5, 443 F.2d 712, 713 n.5 (1971); Matthews v. United States, 145 U.S.App.D.C. 323, 449 F.2d 985 (1971); United States v. Ham-monds, 138 U.S.App.D.C. 166, 425 F.2d 597 (1970).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-22\">The trial court has broad discretion in controlling the scope of closing argument. That discretion is abused, however, if the court prevents defense counsel from making a point essential to the defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-23\">In regulating the scope of argument, the court should be guided by criteria that are related to the function of argument, <em>i.e., </em>to help the jury remember and interpret the evidence. The prosecutor and the defense counsel in turn must be afforded a full opportunity to advance their competing interpretations * * *. The court should exclude only those statements that misrepresent the evidence or the law, introduce irrelevant prejudicial matters, or otherwise tend to confuse the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-25\">United States v. Sawyer, <em>supra, </em>143 U.S.App.D.C. at 298-299, 443 F.2d at 713-714. (Footnotes omitted.) <em>See </em>Loveless v. United States, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 157, 260 F.2d 487 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-26\">The trial judge was apparently concerned that appellant\u2019s counsel was trying to present facts or representations of fact <em>dehors </em>the record, which would of course be impermissible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But this concern was misplaced. Counsel\u2019s plain intent was not to supplement or misstate the record but, as was quite proper, to suggest that the jury draw certain inferences from it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus he began his analysis with the clear statement that \u201c[t] his is Defendant De-Loach\u2019s theory of the case,\u201d a formula <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>repeated moments later at a bench conference. Similarly, counsel did not state that the record definitely showed Brenda Willis\u2019 possession of the .22; rather, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\">Whatever happened, the defense <em>would argue to you </em>that Miss Willis had in her possession the 22.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">(Emphasis added.) Concededly, counsel could have decorated his argument more liberally with such <em>caveat </em>phrases as \u201cwe would argue,\u201d \u201cwe submit,\u201d \u201cyou may infer,\u201d and the like<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>; the judge could have properly reminded him to distinguish for the jury in each instance what was in the record from what might be inferred from it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But the rulings here were not such reminders. Rather they entirely precluded counsel from arguing for the several inferences on which his case crucially depended.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">This was error, for the record contained sufficient support for these inferences. <em>Compare </em>United States v. Dixon, 152 U.S.App.D.C. 200, 469 F.2d 940 (1972). Counsel\u2019s theory that Davis had been in the Cadillac was supported by eyewitness testimony that a man roughly fitting Davis\u2019 description had jumped from the car and run up the street.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Counsel\u2019s theory that Willis and Harper \u201cwere using narcotics\u201d was supported by the autopsy report and by the cache of drugs found on the car\u2019s front seat. Counsel\u2019s theory that Brenda Willis, the passenger in the Cadillac, may have possessed the .22 was supported by the fact that Harper was shot by the .22 in the right side of his face at very close range, and by the eommon-sense inference that drug dealers would very likely arm themselves before driving about the city with $4,000 worth of narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\"> A trial judge may not impose on a jury his own notion of which inferences are reasonable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-14\">Now in this domain of logic, it is conceded, the counsel is free from restraint during argument. His desired inferences may be forced, unnatural, and untenable; but as to this the jury are to judge; that is precisely their function. To declare the desired inference irrational is to beg the question, by prejudging what the jury may believe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-15\">6 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1807(3), p. 272 (3d ed. 1940). This rule has special force in the present case, for \u201c[i]f an accomplice has testified against the defendant, defense counsel may argue that the accomplice is seeking to protect himself or a friend.\u201d ABA Project, <em>supra </em>note 8, Commentary to \u00a7 7.8(b). But in every criminal case, defense counsel should have wide latitude in drawing inferences from the record. <em>See </em>United States v. Chas. Pfizer <em>&amp; </em>Co., 2 Cir., 426 F.2d 32 (1970), affirmed by equally divided Court, 404 U.S. 548, 92 S.Ct. 731, 30 L.Ed.2d 721 (1972); <em>cf. </em>United States v. Gorostiza, 9 Cir., 468 F.2d 915 (1972); Wakaksan v. United States, 8 Cir., 367 F.2d 639, 646 (1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 994, 87 S.Ct. 1312, 18 L.Ed.2d 341 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-16\">Arguing both first and last, the prosecutor has ample opportunity to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>but the inferences suggested by defense counsel.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Furthermore, the presumption of innocence, the reasonable doubt standard, and the prohibition on directed verdicts of guilty combine to leave standing few if any limitations on the factual inferences which a jury may properly draw in the defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">C. <em>The Error Was Not Harmless</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The restrictions imposed upon the argument of appellant\u2019s counsel were not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> They cut to the core of counsel\u2019s theory of the ease,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and their impact was aggravated by the wide-ranging summations which the prosecutor and Jackson\u2019s counsel were able to make to the jury. That some of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were improper added to the prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The restrictions prevented appellant\u2019s counsel from suggesting to the jury that Davis may have committed the murders and lied about DeLoach to cover up his own guilt. Whether this argument would have convinced the jury cannot be known. But the theory had support, however fragmentary, in the record, and without it DeLoach was \u201cdeprived of the substance of his defense.\u201d United States v. Sawyer, <em>supra, </em>143 U.S.App.D.C. at 299, 443 F.2d at 714; <em>see </em>United States v. Chas. Pfizer &amp; Co., <em>supra, </em>426 F.2d at 43-45. The Government reminds us that the erroneous rulings amputated only the \u201cfinal few minutes of argument.\u201d Brief for appellee at 16. But it is these minutes which probably have the greatest influence on the jury,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> especially where, as in this case, counsel has reserved his major points until the very end. If these concluding remarks by counsel had really been unimportant, the prosecutor would not, we think, have objected to them so strenuously; nor would he have devoted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>much of his rebuttal to ridiculing the theory of Davis\u2019 sole culpability.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\">[A prosecutor\u2019s] own estimate of his case, and of its reception by the jury at the time, is, if not the only, at least a highly relevant measure now of the likelihood of prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Garris v. United States, 129 U.S.App.D.C. 96, 100, 390 F.2d 862, 866 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Because of the erroneous restrictions on appellant's counsel, the closing argument phase of the trial was not well balanced. Appellant\u2019s counsel could not speculate about Davis\u2019 state of mind and motives, but the prosecution freely engaged in similar speculation about the defendant\u2019s.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s counsel could not speculate about Willis\u2019 possession of the .22 but the prosecution freely argued its own theories about the murder weapons.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> And Jackson\u2019s counsel met no prosecutorial objection in making some of the arguments specifically foreclosed to DeLoach\u2019s counsel.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Obviously, the trial judge intended no partiality. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that the jury inferred from the asymmetry in closing arguments that the judge approved the theories of the prosecutor or of Jackson\u2019s counsel and disapproved those foreclosed to De-Loach\u2019s counsel.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-21\">It is obvious that under any system of jury trials the influence of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>judge on the jury is necessarily and properly of great weight, and that his lightest word or intimation is received with deference, and may prove controlling. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Starr v.

United States, 134 U.S.App.D.C. 188, 189, 413 F.2d 1095, 1096 (1969). The prosecutor also insisted on characterizing the murders as \u201cexecutions\u201d and \u201cassassinations.\u201d This court recently made clear that \u201cwe do not condone\u201d use of the former term.

In determining . whether an error is \u201charmless\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111 (1970) and Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Crim.P., a court must use the \u201creasonable doubt\u201d test where the error is of constitutional dimensions. Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). The errors here impaired appellant\u2019s constitutional right to closing argument in his behalf. <em>See </em>United States v. Sawyer, 143 U.S.App.D.C. 297, 443 F.2d 712 (1971) ; Matthews v.

However, we would reverse here even if the error lacked constitutional overtones, for we cannot say that \u201cthe judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\u201d Kotteakos v.

When an error appears during closing argument, the centrality or importance of the issue infected by error is a significant factor in determining whether jjrejudice resulted. Gaither v.

Yet the prosecutor argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-23\">* * * Is that not consistent with when Francis Harper was fired at with that first 22 round that she started to turn around to see what was happening, and she was on the left hand side of that car, and Mr. DeLoach who was on the passenger\u2019s seat reached over with his 38 and took care of her. * <em>* *</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-24\">Tr. 842.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-25\">And, they get in a truck and they drive eight miles, taking approximately 20 to 25 minutes driving time, with a loaded 38 and a loaded 22 in their possession. * <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-26\">Tr. 931.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b256-27\">. Jackson\u2019s counsel was permitted to suggest that Davis had left the truck and entered the Cadillac, and also that the .22 pistol belonged to Brenda Willis. The Government does not claim that these remarks ben-efitted appellant sufficiently to cure the erroneous restrictions placed on his own counsel\u2019s argument. Jackson\u2019s counsel stated to the jury before beginning argument, that he represented only Jackson. The two defendants had distinct interests in the closing argument phase of the trial, for Davis\u2019 story had assigned them very different roles in the murders. Thus it cannot be assumed that Jackson\u2019s counsel made his argument in a fashion well calculated to further DeLoach\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b256-28\">. As the trial court\u2019s error lay in restricting appellant\u2019s counsel, rather than in failing to restrict the prosecutor or Jackson\u2019s counsel, the asymmetry cannot \u2014 as the Government urges \u2014 be blamed on the failure of ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>pellant\u2019s counsel to object to tlie broad arguments of the prosecutor and of Jackson\u2019s counsel. The broad arguments on all sides were proper and thus invulnerable to objection. At any rate, interruptions and bickering are to be discouraged during closing arguments. <em>See </em>note 10 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b257-13\">. Counsel failed to object to use of the terms \u201cexecution\u201d and \u201cassassination.\u201d Objection was raised to the phrase \u201cshot down like a dog,\u201d and the trial court instructed the jury to disregard the phrase. We need not decide whether, in this context, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were sufficient in themselves to warrant reversal. We view them merely as factors to be weighed in assessing the prejudicial impact of the court\u2019s erroneous rulings on the argument of appellant\u2019s counsel. But we remind the Government that some remarks cause prejudice which is not eradicable by subsequent judicial instructions, Gaither v. United States, <em>supra </em>note 14; King v. United States, <em>supra </em>note 14, and that a defendant\u2019s failure to object is not dispositive, Viereck v. United States, 318 U.S. 236, 248, 63 S.Ct. 561, 87 L.Ed. 734 (1943) ; United States v. Jones, <em>supra </em>note 14, 157 U.S.App.D.C. at 164, 482 F.2d at 754; United States v. Young, 150 U.S.App.D.C. 98, 104, 463 F.2d 934, 940 (1972). It is obviously unrealistic to expect defense counsel to object when the prosecution characterizes a murder as an \u201cexecution\u201d or \u201cassassination\u201d ; the objection would make the counsel, and his client, seem at once callous and overly fussy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
