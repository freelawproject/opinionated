Under \u00a7 2013 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2013, a decedent\u2019s estate is entitled to a tax credit for the amount of federal estate tax paid with respect to property transferred to the decedent from a person who died within a specified number of years before or after the death of the decedent. The purpose of the law is to alleviate the oppressiveness of successive taxation of a family\u2019s property within a relatively short period of time. H.R.Rep. No.1337, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. 90 (1954); S.Rep.No.1622, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. 463 (1954), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 4025. Upon this appeal the issue is whether the Tax Court correctly held that amounts paid by a husband\u2019s estate to children in settlement of a will contest were never transferred to his wife, the sole beneficiary under his will, who later died, and that his wife\u2019s estate was therefore not entitled to a credit under \u00a7 2013 for taxes paid by the husband\u2019s estate on the property transferred to the children. We agree with the Tax Court\u2019s analysis and accordingly affirm its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-8\">The facts are simple and undisputed. In 1965 Frederick F. McGauley died, leaving his entire estate to his wife, Lorraine A. McGauley, who also qualified as Executrix of his estate. His four daughters by a prior marriage objected to the admission of his will to probate, which was sought in the County of Schenectady, New York. The will contest was settled by an agreement between Frederick\u2019s estate, signed by Lorraine as preliminary Executrix and by the four daughters. Pursuant to its terms his estate paid $27,500 to each of the four daughters, plus their attorney\u2019s legal fee of $5,000, or a total of $115,000. Lorraine, as Executrix, eventually paid the entire estate tax due on her husband\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-12\">In 1967, approximately 29 months after her husband Frederick\u2019s death, Lorraine A. McGauley died. Her estate claimed a credit under \u00a7 2013 for 80% of the federal tax paid on Frederick\u2019s estate. The Commissioner disallowed any credit based upon the portion of Frederick\u2019s estate used to make the $115,000 payment to the four daughters and to their attorney on the ground that this property had never been \u201ctransferred\u201d to the decedent, Lorraine. Upon a petition by Lorraine\u2019s estate for a redetermi-nation of the deficiency the Tax Court, in an opinion filed December 12, 1973, upheld the Commissioner\u2019s determination and the resulting assessment of a deficiency of $18,393.04 against her estate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> From this decision Lorraine\u2019s estate appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-13\">In order to qualify-for a \u00a7 2013 tax credit with respect to the payments made by Frederick\u2019s estate to the four daughters and to their attorney, Lorraine\u2019s estate was required to show that this property had been \u201ctransferred\u201d to her. This her estate failed to do. The agreement in settlement of the will contest, to which Lorraine was a party in her capacity as preliminary Executrix of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>her husband\u2019s estate, expressly provided that the payments were to be made out of the assets of Frederick\u2019s estate, not by Lorraine individually or from some other source, and the payments were accordingly made from his estate. Furthermore, decisions adjudicating the issue under analogous circumstances have made it clear as a matter of substantive federal law that payments in settlement of a bona fide will contest represent transfers from the estate to the recipient rather than from the devisees or legatees. Lyeth v. Hoey, 305 U.S. 188, 59 S.Ct. 155, 83 L.Ed. 119 (1938) (property received by heir in settlement of will contest is taken by inheritance from decedent and not as taxable income); United States Trust Co. of New York v. Commissioner, 321 F.2d 908 (2d Cir. 1963), aff\u2019g 38 T.C. 670 (1962), cert. denied sub nom. Estate of Davenport v. Commissioner, 376 U.S. 937, 84 S.Ct. 792, 11 L.Ed.2d 658 (1964) (property left by decedent\u2019s will to his widow and relinquished by her to settle dispute with daughters over probate of another will does not qualify for marital deduction for federal estate tax purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">Only the net amount of the husband\u2019s estate after payment of all claims against his estate (including the settlement paid to the children) was property \u201ctransferred\u201d to Lorraine McGauley. See Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 159 F.2d 167 (2d Cir. 1947); Bahr v. Commissioner, 119 F.2d 371 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 314 U.S. 650, 62 S.Ct. 95, 86 L.Ed. 521 (1941). Our holding with respect to this issue is consistent with the purpose of \u00a7 2013, which is to avoid oppressive successive taxation of the same property. The property transferred from Frederick\u2019s estate to the children in settlement of the will contest has not been subjected to double taxation, since it never became part of Lorraine\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">Appellant contends that the payments to the children should be deemed to have been made by Lorraine rather than out of her husband\u2019s estate for the reason that under New York law her husband\u2019s estate vested in her immediately upon his death. See Matter of Cook, 187 N.Y. 253, 79 N.E. 991 (1907); N.Y. Estates, Powers and Trusts Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 17-b, \u00a7 1-2.-18. <em>Matter of Cook </em>is distinguishable from the present case for the reason that the settlement of the will contest in that case, which took the form of an assignment of a legatee\u2019s interest to the contestant, did not change the will, whereas the contesting daughters here received payment directly from their father\u2019s estate despite his bequest of his entire estate to his wife. In addition to this significant difference in form we are here guided by the principle that the construction of a federal statute such as \u00a7 2013 should be governed by federal law, which will apply uniformly throughout the land, rather than by local rules which may vary from state to state and present the risk of inequity and conflict having their roots solely in geographical vagaries. See Lyeth v. Hoey, <em>supra, </em>305 U.S. at 193-194, 59 S.Ct. 155. This principle was recognized in United States Trust Company of New York v. Commissioner, <em>supra, </em>321 F.2d at 910, where we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1096-7\">\u201cWe find no merit to the appellant\u2019s theory that, because under New York law Mrs. Davenport acquired vested rights in the trust property, this property passed to her from the decedent and her subsequent relinquishment of her power of appointment did not affect [the] marital deduction. For federal tax purposes, the federal regulations govern, Lyeth v. Hoey, 305 U.S. 188, 59 S.Ct. 155, 83 L.Ed.2d 119 (1938).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1096-8\">Since the $115,000 paid by Frederick\u2019s estate to the daughters and their attorney was not transferred to Lorraine, her estate is not entitled to a credit under \u00a7 2013 for the estate tax paid by his estate upon this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-9\">The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AU_\">. Section 2013 provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-10\">\u201c\u00a7 2013. <em>Credit for tax on prior transfers </em>\u201c(a) <em>General rule. </em>\u2014 The tax imposed by section 2001 shall be credited with all or a part of the amount of the Federal estate tax paid with respect to the transfer of property (including property passing as a result of the exercise or non-exercise of .a power of appointment) to the decedent by or from a person (herein designated as a \u2018transferor\u2019) who died within 10 years before, or within 2 years after, the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1095-14\">. The Commissioner had also assessed a deficiency in the sum of $8,275.00 based upon transfers by Lorraine out of property received from her husband\u2019s estate to her son Frederick F. McGauley, Jr., who did not contest his father\u2019s will. The Tax Court, however, found that this property had been transferred from the husband\u2019s estate to his wife and then transferred by her as a gift to her son. Accordingly, it held that this property was properly included by her estate in the property which was entitled to inclusion for purposes of a credit under \u00a7 2013.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
