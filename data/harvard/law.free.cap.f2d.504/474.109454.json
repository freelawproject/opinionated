The district court dismissed plaintiff\u2019s complaint for failure to state a cause of action. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"AoR\">Plaintiff alleged that, in addition to his fine academic and military record, he had extensive legal experience. This included employment at various legal aid clinics, where he litigated cases (see 111. S.Ct. Rule 711), interviewed clients and prepared legal documents, and as \u201cLegal Advisor, special policeman and Project Director\u201d of the Gary, Indiana, Police Department, where he drafted search warrants and directed searches. Plaintiff argued that an applicant with his background clearly has the capacity and fitness to practice law; and, if the Illinois Bar Examination had a \u201crational connection\u201d to such capacity and fitness, he would have passed it. He therefore concluded that, under Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U.S. 232,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 77 S.Ct. 752, 1 L.Ed.2d 796, the examination is unconstitutional.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">We may assume <em>arguendo </em>that plaintiff\u2019s background does establish his ability to practice law. The fact that the bar examination has prevented one even exceptionally qualified individual from practicing is not, however, a sufficient reason to declare it violative of the Fourteenth Amendment. It is well settled that the question of whether a classification passes constitutional muster cannot be answered simply by assessing chance effect upon a particular individual. <em>See, e. g., </em>Colgate v. Harvey, 296 U.S. 404, 436, 56 S.Ct. 252, 80 L.Ed. 299. As the Supreme Court has concluded :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">\u201c[T]he fact that the Rules [concerning admission to the bar] may result in \u2018incidental individual inequality\u2019 [does not] make them offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Martin v. Walton, 368 U.S. 25, 26, 82 S.Ct. 1, 2, 7 L.Ed.2d 5. Since plaintiff\u2019s attack on the Illinois Bar Examination is based solely upon such a chance effect, it is plainly insubstantial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Plaintiff further alleged that, in light of his background, it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for him to have failed a bar examination five times; thus, he must have passed and should be so certified. It was un-controverted that the Board actually determined that plaintiff failed each of his five examinations. His contention, however, was that the Board made \u201cserious mistakes\u201d in grading.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Admission to practice in a state and before its courts is primarily matter of state concern. <em>Schware, supra, </em>353 U.S. at 248, 77 S.Ct. 752 (Frankfurter, J., concurring). And the determination of which individuals have the requisite knowledge and skill to practice may properly be committed to a body such as the Illinois Board of Law Examiners.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Douglas v. Noble, 261 U.S. 165, 43 S.Ct. 303, 67 L.Ed. 590. A federal court is not justified in interferin'g' with this determination unless there is proof that it was predicated upon a constitutionally impermissible reason. <em>See Schware, supra, </em>353 U.S. at 238-240; <em>id. </em>at 248-249, 77 S.Ct. 752 (Frankfurter, J., concurring); <em>cf. </em>Theard v. United States, 354 U.S. 278, 281, 77 S.Ct. 1274, 1 L.Ed.2d 1342. Since nothing in plaintiff\u2019s complaint indicates that he was denied admission for such a reason, the district court correctly rejected plaintiff\u2019s request to overrule the judgment of the Board of Examiners.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-15\">Plaintiff, of course, did allege that defendants acted arbitrarily in grading his examination. There may very well be situations in which a capricious denial by state officials may give rise to a federal remedy. <em>See Schware, supra, </em>353 U.S. at 239; <em>id. </em>at 249, 77 S. Ct. 752 (Frankfurter, J., concurring). But, as Justice Brand\u00e9is observed for a unanimous Court in Douglas v. Noble, <em>supra, </em>\u201cit is not to be presumed that powers conferred upon the administrative boards will be exercised arbitrarily .. \u2022 \u2022 . \u201d 261 U.S. at 170, 43 S.Ct. at 305. In this case plaintiff has merely alleged, in essence, that an essay-type examination requires subjective evaluation and that the standards of grading are not susceptible to precise definition. We agree with the Eighth and Ninth Circuits that such an allegation is not sufficient to state a claim for federal relief. <em>Feldman, supra </em>note 5; <em>Chaney, supra </em>note 5.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-18\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-19\">Finally, plaintiff alleged<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that procedural due process requires that he be permitted to see his examination papers and to compare them with model answers or answers of successful applicants.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We may assume that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>due process clause requires the state to employ fair procedures in processing applications for admission to the bar and, therefore, that an applicant who has failed the bar examination is entitled to some procedural protections. Nevertheless, we do not believe that, in the context of this case, the procedures requested by plaintiff are required by the Constitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Plaintiff argues that these procedures were absolutely necessary to expose errors in the grading process and to discern his various strengths and weaknesses. Plaintiff, however, had been given five opportunities to write a bar examination which was offered biannually. Ill.S.Ct. Rule 704(c). There is no allegation that in the future, he will be denied the same opportunity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As the Attorney General persuasively argues, reexamination provides an adequate means of exposing grading errors.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In addition, at least one of the examiners personally discussed with plaintiff his general performance in the exam and even graded sample answers which plaintiff wrote. Given the availability of these alternative procedures, the requested procedures were not constitutionally required.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">Furthermore, merely seeing his examination or comparing it with others would not allow plaintiff to expose errors or discern his abilities. These procedural rights would be virtually meaningless unless plaintiff also was able to confront the bar examiners and obtain from them explanations of their grades.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Several hundred applicants fail the Illinois Bar Examination annually. Requiring an explanation for each of these applicants would place an intolerable burden upon the bar examiners. It also would place at an unfair disadvantage those applicants who were taking the exam for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">As plaintiff notes, several state courts have determined, either by rule or decision, that a failing applicant should be afforded the proced\u00fares which he seeks. <em>See, e. g., </em>Application of Peterson, 459 P.2d 703 (Alaska 1969). These determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>nations, however, were made in the exercise of the courts\u2019 supervisory powers. It is axiomatic that the Fourteenth Amendment does not necessarily require those same procedural safeguards which a legislature or court may consider desirable as a matter of policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Plaintiff has raised two other contentions. The first, which apparently was never considered by the district court, is that defendants violated Article I, \u00a7 12 of the Illinois Constitution.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As plaintiff recognizes, this purely state claim is pendent to his federal claims. Since we have concluded that the district court' properly dismissed all of these claims, it was within the court\u2019s discretion to refuse consideration of the state claim. <em>See </em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Second, plaintiff contends that the district court should have entered a default judgment against defendants because their pleading in response to his complaint was filed three days late. In Duling v. Markun, 231 F.2d 833, 836 (7th Cir. 1956), cert. denied, 352 U.S. 870, 77 S.Ct. 96, 1 L.Ed.2d 76, this court stated that, whether a default judgment should be entered, is \u201ca matter resting in the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d We find no abuse of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">The judgment of the district court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-11\">. Plaintiff alleged that his action arose under the Fifth, Sixth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution, Article I, \u00a7 12 of the Illinois Constitution S.H.A., and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1982 and 1983. Jurisdiction was predicated upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343(3) &amp; (4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b540-12\">. Only the defendant Smith was served with process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b540-13\">. In <em>Schware </em>the Supreme Court held :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-14\">\u201cA State can require high standards of qualification, such as good moral character or proficiency in its law, before it admits an applicant to the bar, but any qualification must have a rational connection with the applicant\u2019s fitness or capacity to practice law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-17\">353 U.S. at 239, 77 S.Ct. at 756.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b540-18\">. Plaintiff also cited as authority Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158. In <em>Griggs, </em>however, the Supreme Court was concerned solely with the scope of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b540-19\">. It might be noted that the Eighth and Ninth Circuits have further concluded that essay-type examinations, such as those taken by plaintiff, have a rational connection with the capacity to practice law. Feldman v. State Board of Law Examiners, 438 F.2d 699, 705 (8th Cir. 1971) ; Chaney v. State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Bar of California, 386 F.2d 962, 964-965 (9th Cir. 1967), cert. denied 390 U.S. 1011, 88 S.Ct. 1262, 20 L.Ed.2d 162. <em>See also </em>Application of Brewer, 430 P.2d 150, 152 (Alaska 1967). As Judge Tone, speaking for this court, recently observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">\u201cEducational requirements and proficiency examinations are time-tested means of assuring that practitioners meet minimum standards of competence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Rasulis v. Weinberger, 502 F.2d 1006, 1010 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b541-11\">. Ill.S.Ct. Rule 704(c) specifies the subjects upon which the Board may test. Precisely what proficiency is required in these subjects and whether an individual applicant possesses this proficiency are factual matters entrusted to the Board\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>Ill.S.Ct. Rule 709.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b541-12\">. State courts have also consistently approved essay examinations and have refused to perform the role of \u201csuper bar examiner\u201d by regrading them.

On appeal plaintiff has argued that he also should have been afforded a full-blown adversary hearing. It is not necessary that we specifically consider this contention. There is no allegation in the complaint that plaintiff ever requested a hearing. <em>Compare </em>Suckle v. Madison General Hospital, 499 F.2d 1364 (7th Cir., 1974). Indeed, there is no such request in the complaint itself. It should be clear, however, that, if the procedures requested by plaintiff are not required, a hearing certainly is not mandatory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b541-22\">. The Illinois Supreme Court has not published any rule which specifically prevents the bar examiners from releasing examination papers. The Attorney General, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>ever, stated at oral argument that this is the court\u2019s policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b542-6\">.
