Shortly thereafter the company brought suit in federal district court for a declaratory judgment under section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a), (c), and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, hoping that the court would find the clause violative of the Texas right to work law and thus void and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">After a full evidentiary hearing, the district court concluded that the Texas law did apply to this employment relationship and did render the agency shop provision invalid. On appeal, a panel of this court held that a justiciable controversy existed, that jurisdiction properly vested in the district court, and that there was no abuse of discretion by that court in declining to defer to the NLRB. But on the substantive issue the panel concluded that the district court had erred and that the agency shop clause is valid and enforceable with respect to all employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement. The panel held that the Texas right to work law does not apply to this employment relationship because these employees are not employees of Texas or of any other state, but are rather seamen whose job site is on the high seas. Because of the exceptional importance<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the unique nature of the question presented, we granted rehearing en banc to consider the question of the applicability of the Texas right to work law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">The parties to this suit, the district court, and the original panel approached the issue presented by analyzing this employment relationship in terms of its contacts with the state of Texas and other jurisdictions. It is conceded by all that employer/employee contacts with the state of Texas far outweigh contacts with any other <em>state, </em>and the evidence supporting that conclusion is neither conflicting nor ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-15\">The company operates eight oceangoing tankers which move principally between the state of Texas and the state of New York along the East and Gulf Coasts. Since 1962, the headquarters of the company has been located in Beaumont, Texas. All personnel and payroll records are maintained there; all payroll checks are written and mailed from the Beaumont offices; all state and federal taxes are deducted from the seamen\u2019s wages in Beaumont; all monthly check-offs of Union dues for all seamen is performed in Texas; and all grievances filed on the approved grievance forms by the seamen are submitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>and considered by the company\u2019s manager at his office in Beaumont, pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement. The state of Texas is the only state administering unemployment compensation for the company\u2019s seamen.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The company employs 289 unlicensed seamen; 123 of the 289 have reported Texas as their state of residence; and 152 of the 289 have requested the company to list Beaumont as their shipping port. All actual hiring of seamen occurs in Texas. While approximately 40% of the seamen first make application in New York and 60% make application in Beaumont, the final hiring decision is made only in Beaumont. As many as 60% of the applicants actually come from the Texas labor force. Furthermore, all terminations of seamen are finalized in Beaumont as a result of decisions made at the Beaumont headquarters. The evidence suggests that from the seaman\u2019s first encounter with the company to his last, the Beaumont headquarters is constantly in the picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The above contacts demonstrate that the state of Texas is intimately involved with this employment relationship. And the district court was clearly correct in its finding that a more substantial part of the administration and performance of the collective bargaining agreement occurs in Texas than in any other state.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We think it \u2022 not insignificant to note that this \u201cjusticiable controversy\u201d arose in Beaumont, for it was in the context of the hiring process there that the Union and the company began this battle.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">The panel, however, believed that the predominance of Texas contacts with this employment relationship was not decisive. Instead, the panel concluded that the determinative factor in deciding whether the Texas law is applicable is job situs. The record indicates that the seamen spend 80% to 90% of their working time on the high seas. Each seaman works roughly a 120 day cycle consisting of 90 days aboard ship and 30 days ashore \u201con vacation\u201d during which shore time he continues to be an employee of the company and to receive wages. The panel\u2019s theory is that, with so much of a seaman\u2019s working time reserved for the high seas, the Texas law, and for that matter the law of any state, is rendered inapplicable. The panel does not explain, however, why job situs is the singularly most significant, indeed the decisive, factor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">Rather than adopt the panel\u2019s limited approach, we choose to weigh all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>of the contacts in the context of our national labor policy. We disagree with the panel\u2019s conclusion that job situs has some talismanic quality. We would agree with the panel opinion that the district court\u2019s finding that a more substantial part of the administration and performance of the collective b\u00e1rgaining agreement occurs in Texas than in any other state is not decisive. The number of contacts is a highly relevant consideration, but the true importance of these contacts is to be understood not in a quantitative vacuum but in the qualitative background furnished by the Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Whether the agency shop clause in this collective bargaining agreement is valid or not depends entirely upon whether the Texas right to work law applies to this employment relationship.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In determining whether the Texas law is applicable, we must decide whether it was the intent of Congress in writing section 14(b) \u2019to permit a state to apply its right to work law to an employment relationship which has contacts with the state as described by the evidence presented to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Our task is made more difficult by the fact that there is nothing in the legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Act which expressly answers our question one way or the other. Nevertheless, we must determine as best we can what Congress would have intended on this point had it been presented for their explicit consideration. <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Our job is not to add up all of the contacts and to decide which jurisdiction has \u201cthe most.\u201d Our task is to discern whether application of the Texas right to work law would be in furtherance of the Taft-Hartley Act\u2019s expressed purposes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See </em>National Woodwork Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. NLRB, 1967, 386 U.S. 612, 87 S.Ct. 1250, 18 L.Ed.2d 357; Wirtz v. Local 153, Glass Bottle Blowers Ass\u2019n, 1968, 389 U.S. 463, 468, 88 S.Ct. 643, 646, 19 L.Ed.2d 705; NLRB v. Metallic Bldg. Co., 5th Cir. 1953, 204 F.2d 826, 828. And in arriving at a just, proper, and congressionally authorized conclusion, we invoke the eclectic approach of Chief Justice Marshall :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\">Where the mind labors to discover the design of the legislature, it seizes everything from which aid can be derived .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">United States v. Fisher, 1805, 2 Cranch (6 U.S.) 358, 386, 2 L.Ed. 304, 313; <em>see also </em>United States v. Dickerson, 1940, 310 U.S. 554, 562, 60 S.Ct. 1034, 1038, 84 L.Ed. 1356.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">Having done so, we conclude that it was not the intent of the Congress to prevent Texas from applying its right to work law in the context of this employment relationship. Indeed, in our judgment, application of the Texas law would be in furtherance of our national labor policies. For the reasons expressed below, we hold that the federal labor legislation, the predominance of Texas contacts over any other jurisdiction, and the significant interest which Texas has in applying its right to work law to this employment relationship warrant application of the Texas law and, consequently, invalidation of the agency shop provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">We begin with \u201cthe language of the statute itself.\u201d Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 1968, 392 U.S. 409, 420, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 2193, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189. Sections 7 and 8(a)(3) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157, 158(a)(3), specifically authorize employers and labor organizations to enter into union \u201chop agreements by whose terms membership in a union, after a short waiting period, is required as a condition of employment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has interpreted these sections to authorize an agency shop, a form of union security conditioning employment on the payment of regular union dues and initiation fees in lieu of actual union membership. NLRB v. General Motors Corp., 1963, 373 U.S. 734, 738-739, 83 S.Ct. 1453, 10 L.Ed.2d 670; Retail Clerk\u2019s Inter. Ass\u2019n v. Schermerhorn <em>[.Schermerhorn </em>I], 1963, 373 U.S. 746, 751, 83 S.Ct. 1461, 1464, 10 L.Ed.2d 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">In the same stroke, section 8(a)(3) was redrafted to prohibit the closed shop which its predecessor section, section 8(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, had permitted. H.R.Conf.Rep.No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 60, 1 Leg. Hist.L.M.R.A. 545, U.S.Code Cong.Serv. 1947, p. 1135. The closed shop differs from the union shop in only one regard: the closed shop requires that the job applicant be a member of the union before he is hired. 11 Hou.L.Rev. 709, 710, n. 7 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">Section 14(b) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 164(b), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-12\">Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as authorizing the execution or application of agreements requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment in any State or Territory in which such execution or application is prohibited by State or Territorial law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-13\">By enacting this provision, Congress desired to \u201cmake certain\u201d that section 8(a)(3) of the Act could not \u201cbe said to authorize arrangements of this sort [compulsory unionism] in States where such arrangements were contrary to the State policy.\u201d H.R.Conf.Rep.No. 510, supra, 1 Leg.Hist.L.M.R.A. at 564; <em>Schermerhorn I, </em>supra; U.S.Code Cong. Serv. 80th Cong., 1st Sess.1947, p. 1135. The language of section 14(b) as well as its legislative history suggests an intent on the part of the Congress to save to the states the right to prohibit the practical equivalents of compulsory unionism, including the agency shop. <em>Schermerhorn I, </em>supra; Retail Clerks Inter. Ass\u2019n v. Schermerhorn, 1963, 375 U.S. 96, 98, 84 S.Ct. 219, 220, 11 L.Ed.2d 179 <em>[Schermerhorn </em>II]; NLRB v. Houston Chap., Asso. Gen. Con. of America, Inc., 5th Cir. 1965, 349 F.2d 449, 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-14\">The national labor policy expressed in these sections of the Taft-Hartley Act is one which directly authorizes union shop arrangements, but only in those states which have not passed the right to work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>laws. In a sense, a conflict between state and federal law may thereby arise</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aji\">but it is a conflict sanctioned by Congress with directions to give the right of way to state laws barring the execution and enforcement of union-security agreements .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><em>Schermerhorn II, </em>supra, 375 U.S. at 103, 84 S.Ct. at 222, 11 L.Ed.2d at 184. In essence, the congressional judgment is that state right to work laws are in harmony with, and part of, the national labor policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The district court focused its attention on the \u201capplication\u201d of the agency shop clause requiring the payment of dues and fees \u201cas a condition of employment in\u201d Texas. Believing that the collective bargaining agreement received its most significant application in Texas, the district court concluded that the Texas law applied. The panel, however, began with the premise that state right to work laws are applicable only to employees of those particular states and concluded that the employees in this case are not for the purpose of their collective bargaining agreement employees of Texas or any other state because of their job situs. Fortunately, Congress has given us some indication of the approach it would favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">When the Congress prohibited the closed shop while permitting the union shop in the Taft-Hartley Act, the Congress was demonstrating its concern with the process by which men and women were hired. As conceived by that legislative body the closed shop enabled union hiring halls to control absolutely the pool of labor available to an employer. H.R.Rep.No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 Leg.Hist.L.M.R.A. 295, 300. The hiring decision was, in effect, made by the union hiring hall, for the employer never saw a job applicant unless the applicant had been referred by the union, and of course, only union members were referred. The Congress singled out the maritime industry as a serious problem area'.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The legislative history of the Act exhibits an express intent to give to the employer some measure of freedom in the hiring process. <em>See </em>H. R.Rep.No.245, supra; <em>see also, e. g., </em>93 Cong.Rec. A1297 (1947) (remarks of Representative Gerald Landis) and 93 Cong.Rec. A2011 (1947) (remarks of Representative Hugh Meade), infra at note 11. The union shop agreement permits an employer to hire a person who has not, at or before the moment of hiring, joined the union. With the proscription of the closed shop, union hiring halls are now required to refer job applicants on a nondiscriminatory basis, so that an employer may consider nonunion applicants on an equal basis with union applicants. NLRB v. Houston Chap., Asso. Gen. Con. of America, Inc., supra. In short, if the congressional discussion on compulsory unionism could be said to have any single reference point, it is not job situs but the hiring process.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>And in our judgment, the language of section 14(b) which looks to the \u201cexecution or application\u201d of agreements requiring membership as a condition of employment refutes the notion that Congress was suddenly singularly concerned with the job situs of the employee rather than with the effects of such an agreement on men and women seeking employment in a mobile society.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The language and history of section 14(b) suggest that a state may apply its right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>work law whenever the state has a significant interest in the process by which a union security agreement is applied. No one disputes the fact that this agency shop agreement receives its application in Beaumont, Texas. Indeed, it is the company\u2019s resolute refusal to apply the agreement in Beaumont, Texas, that has caused this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">The preamble to the Texas right to work law records the legislative judgment that because unions exercise great influence over the economic well-being and freedom of the Texas labor force, the state has an important interest in removing union coercion from the hiring process.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Each of the Texas right to work provisions expresses a concern with that process. Article 5207a, \u00a7 2, provides: \u201cNo person shall be denied employment on account of membership or nonmembership in a labor union.\u201d Article 5154a, \u00a7 8a provides: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any labor union, to collect . . . any fee . whatsoever, as a work permit or as a condition for the privilege to work from any person not a member of the union. . . .\u201d And, lastly, article 5154g, \u00a7 1, provides that \u201c . the right of persons to work shall not be denied or abridged on account of membership or nonmembership in any labor union.\u201d Again, if any single legislative focus can be discerned from the Texas provisions, it is not job situs or the place of job performance but the hiring process. Thus one triggering point for the application of these provisions is hiring within the state. As indicated earlier, this is consistent with the language and intent of section 14(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">If, as we have noted, the Texas laws were enacted to afford the Texas labor force protection from compulsory unionism, the fact that as many as 60% of the job applicants come from the Texas labor force gives Texas good reason for applying' its right to work provisions. But the state\u2019s interest goes far beyond its predominant association with the hiring process and its numerous other contacts with this employment relationship which have already been listed. During the one-fourth of the year when the employees are \u201con vacation\u201d in Texas, they presumably have homes and families; they pay taxes; they send their children to school; they eat, sleep, and move about; they act like other citizens of the state. In short, they are precisely the people whom the Texas law was designed to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">The high seas definitely have contact with the employees, but what is the interest of the high seas in preventing application of the Texas law? How is some important non-Texas, national, or international policy furthered by refusing to apply the Texas law? The fact that maritime work is interstate, or even international, in character does not imply that the Texas law is inapplicable since federal regulation in these matters is predicated upon interstate commerce. No one who studies the legislative history of section 14(b) can seriously argue that Congress intended to permit the states to prohibit compulsory unionism only in those instances where interstate commerce was not affected.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>quently, there is no uniformity principle at stake here since a national or international union may have a union shop in one state and find that arrangement prohibited in another by the state law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The panel opinion suggested that allowing Texas to apply its right to work law here would allow an employer to make an \u201carbitrary choice,\u201d could produce \u201cbizarre consequences,\u201d and could defeat the purposes of sections 7, 8, or 14(b) of the Act. On the contrary, as the legislative history indicates, allowing Texas to apply its laws here is in furtherance of the national labor policy expressed in the Act and in furtherance of the Texas legislative judgment. Furthermore, the panel\u2019s fear that employers might choose headquarter locations in states with right to work laws and thereby defeat national labor policy is, on this record, unfounded. First, the employer\u2019s headquarters is not the decisive factor, any more than job situs is. To reiterate, we have chosen to weigh all of the employer and employee contacts in the context of our national labor policy. Secondly, the Union has never even alleged that Mobil moved to Texas in order to seek the shelter of the Texas right to work law. We will have time enough to consider that factor in the proper case. We should note; however, that employers may set up their operations anywhere they choose, incurring the responsibilities and gaining the advantages of that locale as they do so. The Union has directed us to no language in section 14(b) or its legislative history which suggests that a company cannot freely choose to establish a substantive enterprise in a right to work state for the purpose of obtaining the benefit of the state\u2019s law.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">It is the antithesis of the method we use here to permit an employer to make a truly arbitrary choice of the state law to be applied. The applicability of a state right to work law will depend upon whether such application would further the policies and purposes of our national labor laws. For example, where an employer has artifically constructed its operations or its hiring process in such a way that the substance of its activities occurs in and the greatest part of its labor force comes from a non-right to work jurisdiction while a pro forma final hiring decision is made in a right to work state, application of the state\u2019s right to work law would be contrary to the national labor policy. We are not faced with that circumstance here.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">Moreover, we see no bizarre consequences flowing from the method used or the result reached today. Yet refusing to allow Texas to apply its law here would create the bizarre consequence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>exempting the maritime industry from the operation of section 14(b). We have found nothing in the legislative history or the language of any present labor legislation, and the Union has directed us to none, which suggests an intent on the part of the Congress to create a special rule for maritime workers. On the contrary, the legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Act indicates that Congress was aware of the problems in the maritime industry caused by compulsory unionism and sought to deal with them. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 Leg.Hist. 412-413; footnote 9, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">In the past, when Congress has decided to supersede section 14(b) and state right to work laws, it has done so expressly. Prior to 1951, the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq., prohibited union shop agreements. But in 1951, Congress amended the Act to permit carriers covered by the law and their employees to enter into union shop agreements</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">[notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, or of any other statute or law of the United States, or Territory thereof, <em>or of any State.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152, subd. 11 (emphasis added). Fully aware of the Taft-Hartley Act and its section 14(b), Congress used express language in the 1951 amendment precisely to defeat application of state right to work laws. Railway Employees\u2019 Dept. v. Hanson, 1956, 351 U.S. 225, 232, 76 S.Ct. 714, 718, 100 L.Ed. 1112; <em>see also </em>Sams v. Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, 4th Cir. 1956, 233 F.2d 263, 264; Inter. Ass\u2019n of Machinists v. Sandsberry, Tex.Civ.App.1954, 277 S.W.2d 776, 780-781, aff\u2019d, 1956, 156 Tex. 340, 295 S.W.2d 412, cert. denied, 1957, 353 U.S. 918, 77 S.Ct. 669, 1 L.Ed.2d 665. In our judgment, this instance of congressional action demonstrates that state right to work laws are not to be ignored unless the language or legislative history of the federal law permits such a course.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Railway Employees\u2019 Dept. v. Hanson, supra. State prohibition of compulsory unionism is a \u201ccongressional dispensation of grace, not the imperious right of a state,\u201d and thus Congress has always had the power to exempt seamen from the operation of state right to work laws. SeaPAK v. Industrial, Technical &amp; Pro. Emp., Natl. Maritime Union, S.D.Ga.1969, 300 F. Supp. 1197, 1201, aff\u2019d, 5th Cir. 1970, 423 F.2d 1229, aff\u2019d, 1971, 400 U.S. 985, 91 S.Ct. 452, 27 L.Ed.2d 434; Railway Employees\u2019 Dept. v. Hanson, supra. But it has chosen not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">If we were to carve out an exception for seamen here, in the absence of any suggestion to do so from Congress, we would be encroaching on the legislative authority. That course of action, in spite of Justice Cardozo\u2019s frank observation that judge-made law is \u201cone of the existing realities of life,\u201d is beyond our constitutional prerogatives. <em>See </em>Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process (1921 ed.),p. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">Alternatively, the Union contends that it is improper to strike out the agency shop clause in its entirety from the collective bargaining contract since some of the seamen have greater contacts with states other than Texas, states without right to work laws. The Union asks that we fashion a rule which renders the Texas right to work law inapplicable to those employees who have greater contracts with non-right to work states than with Texas. We decline the Union\u2019s invitation for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">The agency shop clause in the collective bargaining contract states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-13\">For the duration of the Agreement all employees hired shall, as a condition of employment, become members of the Union and/or in the alternative pay the regular union dues and initia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>tion fees within 31 days from the employment date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">This clause unambiguously demands that all employees hired join the union or pay the required fees. The clause makes no distinctions between job applicants who are to be protected by the Texas law and those who are not. As the panel majority noted, we cannot rewrite the contract to reflect these allegedly distinguishable classes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Secondly, even if we could rewrite the contract, on this record we are unwilling to hold that there is an identifiable group of employees who are not subject to the Texas law. The Union\u2019s brief admits that \u201cthe record before the court was insufficient to enable the court\u201d to authorize partial application of the agency shop provision. Since we are not the fact-finders in the judicial process, we have no basis for implementing the Union\u2019s alternative request.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">We have attempted a multi-dimensional analysis of the question presented for our disposition. On one level we have examined this employment relationship in terms of its contacts with the state of Texas and other jurisdictions. On another we have studied Congress\u2019 actions in passing the Taft-Hartley Act and the 1951 amendment to the Railway Labor Act in order to give meaning and context to the undisputed contacts. On still a third level we have scrutinized the interests of different jurisdictions in applying their laws to this employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">The resulting matrix offers a clear picture. Texas is intimately involved with this employment relationship. Texas has a more significant interest in applying its law than does any other jurisdiction. And the federal labor legislation suggests a congressional intent to allow Texas to apply its law, rather than to exempt the maritime industry from the operation of section 14(b). Having exhausted, as best we can, the reality before us, we are faced with but one result.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-11\">.

The only other state which arguably has any interest in this employment relationship is New York. Of the company\u2019s seamen, 60 have reported New York as their state of residence. The collective bargaining agreement was first negotiated and executed there. That agreement was prepared in final form and re-executed in Texas. .The agreement does not contain a choice-of-law provision. On this record, it is undisputed that Texas has quantitatively and qualitatively greater contacts with this employment relationship than does any other state, including New York.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\">. The company dealt the first blow by notifying all new seamen that it would not enforce the agency shop provision. The union response was sharp: \u201cAs far as this Union is concerned, any employee in our Division of Mobil must either join our Union or pay dues to the Union. We intend to exercise our right to have the employment of any unlicensed seamen terminated who does not join or pay dues to the Union.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b338-12\">. Two 1949 NLRB decisions furnish tlie focus of the panel\u2019s argument. In Western Electric Co., Inc., 84 NLRB No. Ill, and Northland Greyhound Lines, Inc., 80 NLRB No. 60, the Board was called upon to determine appropriate bargaining units for employees who performed their work in many states, some of which prohibited union security agreements. The Board recommended separate units which would be subject to the laws of the respective states according to the employee\u2019s job situs. The issue raised in those cases, however, was not whether some state law applied to the employment relationship but <em>which </em>state law applied, thus aborting the question with which we are now faced. As the panel noted, neither the Board nor the court has ever been faced with the precise issue now before us. <em>See </em>Seafarers International Union of North America, Atlantic, Gulf, Lakes &amp; Inland Waters District et al., 202 NLRB No. 91; Mobil Oil Corp. v.

It also concedes that the district court\u2019s finding that a more substantial part of the administration and performance of the collective bargaining agreement occurs in Texas than in any other state is not decisive and that the number of Texas contacts, while relevant, is likewise not determinative. It proceeds nevertheless to \u201cweigh all of the [Texas] contacts in the context of our national labor policy\u201d and devotes the greater part of its opinion to an academic dissertation on our national labor policy, congressional intent and the benefits foreseen by Congress in banning\"the closed shop, thereby allowing a greater measure of freedom to both employee and employer in the hiring process. The treatise, though interesting, is not relevant to the issues here.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">There is no dispute about what Congress did when it enacted the Taft-Har-tley Act and included therein section 14(b) which authorizes a state, at its option, to enact so-called right-to-work laws. Pursuant to this provision, Texas passed such laws. The question to be determined is not the validity of such legislative enactments, but whether they are applicable to the collective bargaining agreement in this case. Unfortunately, by focusing on uncertain legislative history rather than on the precise issue of whether federal or state law should apply to the employment contracts of maritime workers performing no work in any state,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the majority fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>nesses the issue and ignores the impact of the central dispute in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">It is undisputed that the combined effect of sections 7 and 8(a)(3) of the Labor Management Relations Act, as interpreted by the Supreme Court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act is to recognize the validity of an agency shop except in those states which prohibit them. The majority points out that Congress in passing section 14(b) carved out no exception for seamen. What the majority fails to discern, however, is that seamen have traditionally maintained an exceptional status in regard to the regulation and control of their employment, and that section 14(b) cannot reasonably be construed to remove them from that category. Seamen, particularly the type of blue-water seamen involved here, as wards of admiralty have been accorded a special status and protection under federal maritime law unknown to state law in the domain of the master-servant relationship.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Unlike the land-based worker, the seaman\u2019s employment and all of the rights and restrictions flowing therefrom, are determined by federal statutory and admiralty law, not state law. Hiring, discharge and various terms of employment are regulated by shipping articles mandated by federal statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Compensation to seamen for illness, injury, disability and death is provided through the unique admiralty doctrine of maintenance and cure,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and by special federal statutory enactments such as the Jones Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the Death on the High Seas Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Federal maritime law covers the gamut of a seaman\u2019s employment relationship, including wages,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> maritime liens for the collection therefor,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the protective pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>cedures against attachment and assignments of wages,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the rights accorded seamen to receive at every port half of unpaid wages earned<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and double payment for wages withheld without sufficient cause,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> physical qualifications and requirements for seaman,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and disciplinary problems.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In no employment field is the master-servant relationship so predominantly controlled by federal maritime law than in that existing aboard ship between the master of the vessel and the men who man it. Indeed, it does not appear that there is any aspect of the employment relationship which Texas law may properly control \u2014except, of course, for the novel injection of Texas\u2019 right-to-work law into the present labor contract. In practical effect, state regulation of this employer-employee relationship stops at the water\u2019s edge.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">The majority opinion places much emphasis on the legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Act, concluding that it indicates great concern with the hiring process and a willingness to substitute state law for federal standards where appropriate. Congress was in truth concerned about the adverse impact of compulsory unionism on the hiring process, but section 14(b) was not, as the majority suggests, designed to be the remedy for these ills. Section 14(b) was inserted into the Taft-Hartley Act merely to restate preexisting law, not to expand the jurisdiction of states relative to employment conditions involving maritime workers, traditionally the subject of federal law. The National Labor Relations Act (Wagner Act) itself was not intended to override state laws regulating the closed shop.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Congressional amendment of what is now section \u20198(a) (3) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U. S..C. \u00a7 158(a)(3), not the inclusion of section 14(b), was the chief tool designed to alleviate the perceived evils of compulsory unionism.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">A careful reading of the legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Act shows that Congress felt that section 8(a)(3) would curb problems in the hiring process by removing prior union membership ''as an employment prerequisite and by providing that expulsion from a union would not necessitate discharge from employment so long as initiation fees or dues were not delinquent.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Senator</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Taft noted in debate that a prime example of problems generated by the closed shop was in the West Coast shipping industry.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> He then outlined the changes that would be made by section 8(a) (3) and, with no reference whatever to section 14(b), concluded that the abuses in the hiring process would thereby be corrected.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Congress did indeed single out the maritime industry as a serious problem area, as noted by the majority opinion <em>{ante, </em>p. 277 &amp; n. 10). The cited provisions of the legislative history, however, make no reference to section 14(b) as a palliative for these problems; rather, the amendments to section 8(a)(3) were deemed fully capable of solving these problems.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Since the agency shop provision before us avoids the evils in the hiring process Congress was trying to correct, and since it is clearly valid under section 8(a)(3), it cannot be validly concluded that enforcement of this provision is contrary to federal labor policy.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The majority opinion bases its holding on (1) the predominance of Texas contracts, (2) federal labor legislation, and (3) the significant interest which Texas has in applying its right-to-work laws. The consistent and traditional control by federal law of every phase of maritime employment relationships and contracts refutes the proposition that Employer\u2019s contacts with Texas<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> justify injecting \u25a0 state law into federal maritime affairs. As to federal labor policy, it is clear from the previous discussion that the agency shop provision in question in the present contract is totally consistent with Congress\u2019 desire for a fair hiring process. Moreover, whatever Texas\u2019 interest, may be in applying its law to this contract, the State of Texas has not been sufficiently concerned either to invoke its laws itself or to intervene in these proceedings. Employer is seeking to avoid its own labor contract by vicarious assertion of Texas law. In any case, the admitted premise that the agency shop clause of the labor contract is in contravention of the law of Texas does not permit the conclusion that a clause contained in a New York contract and affecting employment performed solely outside of the State of Texas is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">The result which the majority reaches in this case is somewhat impractical. The attempt of the Court, at the behest of Mobil Oil Company, to give extraterritorial effect to Texas\u2019 right-to-work laws fails both in soundness and in logic. Here the majority has taken an employment relationship, traditionally one in admiralty, regulated in virtually all aspects by federal maritime law, involving seamen who are wards of admiralty, and has subjected this employment to state labor laws when none of the employees works in the state. How this can be done where all of the seamen\u2019s work is aboard vessels plying the high seas, and where most (57%) do not even reside in Texas, is not explained. \"Under the circumstances, the majority\u2019s conclusion is neither practical nor realistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">In my view, the original majority panel decision in this case is correct and should be reaffirmed. Under the circumstances, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>JOHN R. BROWN, Chief Judge, in which DYER, Circuit Judge, joins, concurring in the dissent of Judge AINS-WORTH :</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Because I think this is an ideal case for the exercise of the primary jurisdiction by the NLRB, I would rather see this Court defer its decision and require the parties to present to the Board for its determination the issue \u2014 whether the Texas right to work provisions should apply under the 14(b) exception to \u00a7 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act to this agency shop contract. Since the Court is not so disposed, I concur fully without reservation in the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The Court\u2019s opinion misplaces the emphasis of the Taft-Hartley Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2and this flaw in the ointment pervades the entire opinion. After tallying the almost due process-type contacts between the administration of the union agreement and the state of Texas, the Court rejects the job situs formula<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in favor of this multiple contacts rule because it finds direction in the legislative history of the National Labor Relations Act. In addition, the Court finds persuasive evidence for its conclusion from the fact that the Texas right to work law was designed to proscribe precisely this kind of agency shop agreement and to apply to these kinds of workers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-16\">After first agreeing that the legislative history of the statute has no express answers for this problem (see Court opinion page 273), the Court concludes that the job situs doctrine is, in any case, an improper rule of thumb because the intent of Congress in adopting the Taft-Hartley Act was to eliminate the much-abused <em>hiring </em>monopoly of the closed shop system. But the fallacy here \u2014as pointed out by the dissent \u2014 is that the adoption of \u00a7 14(b) was unrelated to this goal. Instead, it was \u00a7 8(a)(3) of the Labor Management Relations Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that served this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Section 8(a)(3) expressly sanctions as a matter of federal policy union shop agreements with the important limitation that such agreements will not be valid \u201cas a condition of employment in any State or Territory in which such execution or application is prohibited by State or Territorial law.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While noting this \u201ctension\u201d between federal and state policy, the Court starts and finishes with the tacit assumption that the Court must find <em>some </em>applicable state law- \u2014 almost in a conflicts-of-law analysis. The basis for that assumption is in no way discernible from the Act itself or its legislative history. Instead, the emphasis of the Act is that union security agreements are of such importance that absent state proscription outlawing union shop employment relationships within that state, they will be favored. The job situs rule, though never before applied in precisely this situation,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is merely a logical distillation of \u00a7 14(b). For that reason I think we should follow it here as did the panel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">Although I do concur fully in the dissenting opinion of Judge Ainsworth, under the circumstances I believe that it would be better administration and more consistent with sound legal principles for the Court to refer this case to the NLRB under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. This is so because essentially the question here is whether state right to work amendments should be applied to this union contract under the National Labor Relations Act. The Supreme Court has approved<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and this Court<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> has committed itself to this procedure repeatedly under various circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">Two of the most significant instances were FPC cases where we ordered reference to the Commission for it to decide whether it had jurisdiction over the sale and purchase of royalties.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Commission held that it did. It then went to the D.C. Circuit where it determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>that the FPC was in error and did not have jurisdiction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>' The significant thing here is that a Court may, and often should refer basic statutory construction problems \u2014 including even the agency\u2019s jurisdiction \u2014 to the agency for os initial determination as to its own jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In addition the <em>Southwestern Sugar &amp; Molasses Co. </em>case<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> is instructive on the scope and use of primary jurisdiction. There this Court referred an issue on the construction of the Interstate Commerce Act to the ICC. While the Supreme Court reversed this procedure because it thought that other issues should be reached first, they affirmed expressly in a very elaborate opinion that our primary jurisdiction reference was entirely proper and within the Court\u2019s power.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On remand the panel decided it on the merits and reached a result that made consideration by the administrative agency unnecessary.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Primary jurisdiction is particularly invaluable for this case because, however, one may view the merits, it is acknowledged that the record below is inadequate to enable this Court to determine what, if any, partial remedies would be appropriate. (See Court\u2019s opinion page 281). Where 57% of the employees covered by this agreement are not Texas residents, further findings of fact and exploration of alternative remedies would certainly appear to be mandated. No matter how it is sliced the Court is trying to divine congressional policy for a situation never before faced in accommodating \u00a7 8(a)(3) and \u00a7 14(b). That policy should first be explored by the agency charged with responsibility for administering the Act which contains as an integral part the quasi-judicial machinery for hearing and deciding cases by formal opinions which, until overruled by a competent Court, become as authoritative as the words of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"ATf\">it is not abdication \u2014 indeed it is performance of judicial duty in the highest sense \u2014 for us to defer to the NLRB the initial determination of the interpretation of the Act under the circumstances of this industrial situation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-9\">. Tire highly controversial nature of so-called right-to-work laws is well known. No subject of labor relationship between employers and unions causes greater bitterness. Without attempting here to take sides on this troublesome issue, a few of the pros and cons will serve to demonstrate the heat which is engendered when the subject of such laws is raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">For examide, the \u201cfree rider\u201d issue is hotly disputed :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-11\">The unions claim that the worker who refuses to join tile union is a free rider, since the union is obliged by law to bargain for the entire work force. The nonmember gets all the benefits of union representation without paying dues. Management retorts that the nonunion member under a right-to-work law is not a free rider, but a forced rider, since the union demands that it bargain for the entire work force. The union, in turn, maintains that the law must provide, as it does, for the union to represent all workers, union and nonunion, for if each worker were able to bargain individually, the employer could discriminate against the union by maintaining two wage scales \u2014 one for the union and a higher one for nonunion workers. Under this arrangement it would not be long before the union would be mustered out of the plant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-18\">Once again, the important consideration is not whether the nonunion worker is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>free rider or a forced rider, but what the workers believe the ease to be. When nonunion employees work side by side with union employees there is bound to <em>be </em>friction if the union workers believe the nonunion workers are free riders. This friction runs counter to the aim of our national labor policy, which places industrial stability as its prime objective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Marshal, \u201cRight-to-Work,\u201d Pro and Con, 17 Lab.L.J. 131, 136-137 (1966). As to more general aspects of the controversy, <em>see also </em>Dempsey, The Right-to-Work Controversy, 16 Lab.L.J. 387, 388 (1965), as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABU\">An analysis of the campaigns to pass right-to-work laws usually shows that there is a vast difference of viewpoint on the interpretation of the meaning of these laws between opponents and proponents of the laws. Before the public, the advocates of the right-to-work laws take what might be called a contractual viewpoint. They aim to prevent a clause in the labor management contract which would make membership in a union a condition of employment. In their minds, the issue is as simple as that. To make a man become a union member or forfeit his job or right to work is regarded as un-American and dictatorial. In fact, according to this view, unions would be stronger the more voluntary they were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">The opponents of the right-Jo-work laws marshall their arguments based not on the contractual approach but on what might be called the integral viewpoint of the law. According to the union, collective bargaining, unionism and union security (closed shop or union shop) are a unity. An attack on one is an attack on all. Moreover, union security usually involves at least three additional activities: organization, collection of dues and some form of job control. The union in its campaign to stop these laws usually claimed that their true purpose was to restrict some or all of these activities.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b347-11\">. The evidence shows that the collective bargaining agreement was negotiated and executed in New York; that since 1942 labor contracts for the employee unit involved here have been negotiated in New York and that present negotiations for a successor contract have been occurring in New York. Mobil\u2019s corporate headquarters remain in New York, and prior to 1962 its Marine Transportation Department was likewise headquartered there. Information extracted from vessel logs shows that of the eight tankers operated by the company, five of them making typical trips touching the port of Beaumont for a period of time in May and June 1972 were in that port only 5.5% of the total time. A sixth vessel did not touch the Texas port' during that period of time and part of July 1972. Many of the trips bypass Texas completely. For example, eight times a year a vessel travels from the East Coast to Puerto Rico and returns. At the time of the trial one of the vessels was en route to Guam on a 6-month charter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>and had not been in a Texas port for 50 days. All of the vessels are located on the high seas or in non-Texas ports 80% to 90% of the time; 57% of the seamen are residents of states other than Texas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b348-6\">.

The injury or illness need not arise out of his employment and the right to the remedy is irrespective of contributory negligence unless due to his own willful misbehaviour. A land worker who seeks an award under most compensation acts must show that the disability was caused by accidental injury or by an occupational disease. Under the general maritime law an illness which manifests itself during the period of employment (although perhaps an aggravation of a preexisting condition, the seriousness of which was not known to the seaman) entitles him to recover the cost of his maintenance and cure until the maximum cure is reached. The illness may be nothing more serious than a simple cold, but if it disables the seaman to an extent that he cannot resume his employment, he is entitled to be paid for his expenditures for medicines, nursing care and the cost of maintaining himself. Moreover, the per diem rate j&gt;resently allowed to seamen for the cost of maintenance and cure is generally on a more liberal scale than that accorded by compensation. Finally, a seaman is entitled to the cost of his maintenance and cure immediately following the onset of his illness or injury, whereas compensation laws generally include a hiatus prior to the accrual of weekly payments.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b348-14\">. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b348-15\">. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 761-768.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b348-16\">. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 682-685.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b348-17\">. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 953.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b349-5\">. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 601.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b349-6\">. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 597.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\">. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 596.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\">. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 672.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b349-9\">. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-710.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b349-10\">.

While it is true that <em>Northland Greyhound Lines, Inc. </em>and <em>Western Electric Co. </em>(see note 2, <em>supra) </em>were concerned with the application of state right to work laws to workers employed in <em>more </em>than one state, in order to determine which state\u2019s law should apply to a multi-state contract, some state had to meet the criteria of 14(b).
