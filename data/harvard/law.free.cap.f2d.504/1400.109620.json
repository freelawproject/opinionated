We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-4\">Involved in the controversy are jewelry boxes with metal musical movements which are wound by a key. The jewelry boxes were classified in item 654.20 TSUS. The relevant statutory provisions are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-5\">Jewelry boxes, silverware chests, cigar and cigarette boxes, microscope cases, tool or utensil cases, and similar boxes, cases, and chests, all the foregoing of wood:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-6\">\u2022X* 'X 'X* \"Jf 'X*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-7\">Other:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-8\">* * * * * x</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-9\">204.50 Lined with textile fabrics</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-10\">X X *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-11\">x x x * x x</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-12\">Articles not specially provided for of a type used for household, table or kitchen use; toilet and sanitary wares; all the foregoing and parts thereof, of metal:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-13\">X X X * X- X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-14\">Articles, wares, and parts, of base metal, not coated or plated with precious metal:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-15\">X- X X X X X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-16\">654.20 Other * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1465-17\">There is no dispute between the parties as to the fact that the metal musical movement is the component material of chief value.

No. 768, 68 Stat. 1136, 19 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1332 note, directed the Tariff Commission to compile a revision and consolidation of the customs laws to accomplish to the extent practical the following purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-31\">(1) - Establish schedules of tariff classifications which will be logical in arrangement and terminology and adapted to the changes which have occurred since 1930 in the character and importance of articles produced in and imported into the United States and in the markets in which they are sold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-32\">(2) Eliminate anomalies and illogical results in the classification of articles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-33\">(3) Simplify the determination and application of tariff classifications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>Section 101(b) of the Customs Simplification Act of 1954 provided that the Tariff Commission should seek to accomplish these purposes without suggesting changes in any rate or rates of duty on individual products. However, it was also provided that where, in the judgment of the Tariff Commission, the purposes could not be accomplished without such changes, the Commission was authorized to suggest incidental changes in rates. The Commission was required to hold public hearings in connection with any proposed rate changes. In fact, however, the Tariff Commission held public hearings in connection with every proposed schedule of classification <em>and </em>the general headnotes and rules of interpretation. It is to be noted that the hearings held by the Tariff Commission were much broader than were actually required. Tariff Classification Study, Submitting Report (1960), page 2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1466-4\">In discussing the general headnotes the Tariff Commission said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1466-5\">An important feature of the proposed tariff schedules not found in the existing schedules is a system of interpretive headnotes which specify certain special rules of interpretation, define important terms, prescribe special procedures, and, in general, clarify the realtionships between the various schedules, parts, and subparts and the classification descriptions incorporated therein. These headnotes replace cumbersome provisos and other provisions which intrude on the existing classification provisions and make their interpretation more difficult. Also, they contain much substantive matter presently buried in administrative and judicial rulings and in unwritten customs practices. The effort has been made to place these head-notes in closest proximity to the classification descriptions to which they relate. Thus . . . the most general provisions of all are made general headnotes to the entire set of schedules. [Submitting Report, supra, at 9.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1466-8\">Appellant in reviewing the legislative history, as found in the Tariff Classification Study, Schedule 2, supra, pp. 26-27, notes that products within item 204.50 must be \u201cmade of wood.\u201d Appellant contends that this means that products within item 204.50 need not be in chief value of wood. We do not agree. The statement that'products are produced \u201cof wood\u201d does not support appellant\u2019s position that \u201cof\u201d as defined in General Headnote 9(f) (i) does not apply to products within item 204.50. In construing a statute the duty of the court is to effect the intention of the legislature, which is to be searched for in the words the legislature has employed and in the legislative history. In view of the statutory language and the history of the statute it appears to us that Congress intended that products within item 204.50 be in chief value of wood. If Congress had made a choice of language which fairly brings a given situation within a statute, it is unimportant that the particular application may not have been contemplated by the legislators. Barr v. United States, 324 U.S. 83, 90, 65 S.Ct. 522, 89 L.Ed. 765 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-9\">In view of the statutory language and legislative history we hold that item 204.50 TSUS is limited by the definitions in TSUS General Headnote 9(f) to boxes in chief value of wood. Since the metal musical movement is the component material of chief value, the jewelry boxes in controversy cannot be classified under item 204.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-10\">Appellant further contends that jewelry boxes are <em>eo nomine </em>provided for within item 204.50 in a manner which permits the \u201cpredominant materials\u201d concept as an exception to the require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>ment that an article \u201cof\u201d a named material be in chief value of that material. This contention was carefully considered and was rejected by the trial judge. We have considered appellant\u2019s arguments and have concluded that we are in full agreement with the opinion of the trial judge in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-5\">The judgment of the Customs Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1466-6\">.
