The subject matter at issue embodied in a single count is a composition of matter which finds utility in its property of fluorescence. The emitted light has a narrow range of wavelengths in the blue to blue-green part of the visible spectrum when excited with ultraviolet radiation or cathode rays. Thus, radiation visible to the human eye is produced from that which is invisible.</p>\n<p id=\"AWU\">The sole count of the interference is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"axf-dedup-0\">A luminescent composition consisting essentially of a matrix of halophos-phate of alkaline-earth metal, wherein the alkaline-earth metal is calcium, barium, and/or strontium, the halogen is chlorine and/or bromine, and an activating proportion of divalent europium.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1215-7\">\n<em>Priority Proofs and Board Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AKG\">Both parties, attempting to prove priority of invention by actual reduction to practice, presented documentary evidence and relied on stipulated testimony in the form of affidavits. Also, appellant argues that appellee\u2019s reduction to practice of one \u201cspecies\u201d within the scope of the count was insufficient to support an award of priority to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-8\">On authority of Petisi v. Rennhard, 363 F.2d 903, 53 CCPA 1452 (1966), the board found August 14, 1967, the date of appellee\u2019s species reduction, to be its priority date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-9\">The heart of the controversy involves the proofs presented by appellants. Shaffer, Mikus\u2019 co-inventor, testified that he prepared certain phosphors within the scope of the count. As supporting evidence, Shaffer referred, <em>inter alia, </em>to certain exhibit which comprised pages from his Technical Notebook. None of the pages bears a witnessing signature but all are signed and dated by Shaffer. The pages fail to appear in precise numerical sequence and many gaps exist between the pages presented. Appellants say the missing pages relate to non-relevant work. Onto certain of the presented pages are stapled reports of tests performed by others on compounds alleged to be within the scope of the count. The tests involved studies of the phosphor\u2019s Spectral Energy Distribution and X-ray diffraction. Those studies provide an indication of the quantity of light produced for each wavelength and of the particular crystalline form of the phosphor, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-11\">Appellants argue that the notebook pages and the analytical reports, with the analysts\u2019 supporting testimony, adequately corroborate the testimony of Shaffer on reduction to practice of a phosphor within the count. Appellee counters that none of the evidence establishes that the phosphor seen by the analysts contained the recited activator.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-12\">The board found that appellants\u2019 proofs were insufficient to serve as independent corroboration of the testimony of reduction to practice of the invention. The board concluded that the analysts\u2019 testimony did not establish the presence of the specific phosphor activator recited in the count and, therefore, failed to corroborate Shaffer\u2019s testimony regarding reduction to practice. Accordingly, the board awarded priority of invention to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-13\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-14\">We agree with the board\u2019s view respecting appellee\u2019s actual reduction to practice of a species within the scope of the count. A prior reduction to practice of the species precludes another party from claiming that he is the first inventor of the genus containing the species.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-15\"> The primary question to be resolved is whether the evidence of record constitutes sufficient corroboration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>appellants\u2019 testimony directed to preparation of a composition within the scope of the count, including the specified activator. The requirement for independent corroboration exists to insure, by proof that could not have been fabricated or falsified, that the inventor actually prepared the composition and knew it would work. Gianladis v. Kass, 324 F.2d 322, 51 CCPA 753 (1963). However, to satisfy the spirit of the requirement for corroboration, all of the evidence must be considered, applying a \u201crule of reason\u201d standard rather than some mechanical standard. Berry v. Webb, 412 F.2d 261, 56 CCPA 1272 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">At oral argument appellants called attention to our recent opinion in Blicharz v. Hays, 496 F.2d 603 (CCPA 1974), which was not available to the board at the time of its decision herein. <em>Blicharz </em>involved an inventor\u2019s unsigned and un-witnessed notebook. Although we said that such a notebook <em>per se </em>would be insufficient to corroborate an inventor\u2019s testimony of actual reduction to practice, we held that a witnessed \u201cRecord of Invention,\u201d which was consistent with the notebook and had been promptly submitted to the patent department of Bli-charz\u2019s employer, together with testimony of a witness (Weidenheimer), who observed the experiments recorded in Blicharz\u2019s notebook, did provide sufficient corroboration of Blicharz\u2019s testimony of actual reduction to practice on the claimed date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">A careful review of the instant record reveals that appellants\u2019 Exhibit BH is a \u201cRecord of Invention.\u201d It was signed by the inventors and two witnesses and dated November 4, 1965. Both witnesses testified to having read, understood, and signed the document on its date. The parties treated Exhibit BH lightly before us and before the board. Appellants casually argue that Exhibit BH is one of several documents which corroborate Shaffer\u2019s testimony of actual reduction to practice. Appellee contends that the exhibit corroborates only conception, the witnesses testifying only to having read and understood the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-7\">The paucity of argument on the significance of Exhibit BH does not aid us in reaching a decision. The board\u2019s opinion does not mention the exhibit, and our review of the decision below is impeded by our lack of knowledge of the significance the board placed on Exhibit BH. Because the probative value accorded a similar document in <em>Blicharz, </em>supra, was significant, the avoidance of a possible miscarriage of justice requires that we have the benefit of the Board\u2019s position on Exhibit BH in this case. We do not infer that the result here should be either different from or the same as that reached in <em>Blicharz. </em>Instead, every case must be decided on its own merits. However, because of the potential significance of appellants\u2019 Exhibit BH, a decision at this juncture without benefit of argument or elucidation of the board position would risk injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-8\">Accordingly, we remand this cause to the Board of Patent Interferences to consider the extent of the significance of Exhibit BH and to take whatever further action it may deem advisable consistent with the present opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-9\">Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
