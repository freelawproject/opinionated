Following a dis-asterous miscalculation by the government trial counsel and a less than lucid argument to this Court by the taxpayer, the government asks us to extend existing precedents in order to correct a pretrial error. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-16\">Taxpayer, A. Duda &amp; Sons Cooperative Association, is an agricultural cooperative formed in 1946 for the purpose of marketing the agricultural products of its member-producers. Among its original members were four members of the Duda family who at that time were organized in a partnership named A. Duda &amp; Sons (hereinafter \u201cDuda Partnership\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-17\">In early 1948, taxpayer applied for a ruling recognizing its exemption from income tax under \u00a7 101(12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, the predecessor of \u00a7 521 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 521. This application was rejected by the Commissioner on the grounds the taxpayer\u2019s voting was on a patronage basis, that taxpayer transacted approximately 90% of its business with the Duda Partnership, and that the' patronage basis voting therefore contravened the requirements of mutuality of interest and equality of treatment under general cooperative law and was intended to protect the interests of the Duda Partnership. Taxpayer\u2019s attorney thereafter wrote the Commissioner protesting the rejection and stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Duda Partnership would not necess\u00e1rily have the largest vote in the cooperative every year, since favorable weather conditions might enable any of the other members to have the dominant share of the tonnage to be marketed by the cooperative. The Commissioner again rejected the ruling request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>On April 23, 1948, taxpayer filed a formal protest of the rejection of the ruling request pointing out that the taxpayer\u2019s accounting records, which showed the Duda Partnership entitled to 90% of the cooperative\u2019s voting shares, were \u201cin error.\u201d Hence, certificates issued to the Duda Partnership were recalled, and new certificates were issued to individual members of the Duda family. As a result, no one member of the cooperative held more than 25% of the total \u201cretain\u201d certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">On the basis of these and other representations of cooperative operation and equality of member treatment, the Internal Revenue Service issued an exemption letter cautioning that any changes in the character or method of taxpayer\u2019s operation should be reported immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">In 1953, apparently forgetting their previous \u201cerror,\u201d the Duda Partners formed a corporation, A. Duda &amp; Sons, Inc., (hereinafter \u201cDuda, Inc.\u201d). The shares previously held by the partners were withdrawn, and one share was issued to the corporation. The association operated as an exempt organization from 1948 through 1965, at which time a revenue agent was dispatched to audit taxpayer\u2019s records in light of the information returns it was required to file each year. In a letter and report to the taxpayer, the agent questioned the tax exempt status of the association in several respects, among which were the association\u2019s alleged failure to meet four \u201ctechnical\u201d requirements of \u00a7 521<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the association\u2019s alleged failure to \u201coperate as a cooperative,\u201d the latter by virtue of Duda, Inc.\u2019s dominance. The agent cautioned, however, that his findings were \u201cpreliminary\u201d and were designed to \u201cclarify the issues\u201d in the examination of the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>On December 29, 1965, the Acting District Director of the IRS sent taxpayer a determination letter revoking the association\u2019s tax exempt status. The letter cited only the failure to comply with the four technical requirements of the statutory exemption as the grounds for revocation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">The Acting Director\u2019s letter revoked the 1948 ruling \u201cas of September 1, 1956,\u201d and stated that the association would be \u201crequired to file federal income tax returns for the fiscal year ending August 31, 1962, and subsequent years.\u201d The association protested the inaccuracy of the factual conclusions relied upon to support the revocation but did not administratively appeal the decision,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for it had no immediate effect on the association\u2019s tax liabilities, since even non-exempt cooperatives are entitled to large deductions unavailable to other types of corporations. Thus, when the association filed the usual corporate income tax forms- for 1962 and subsequent years, it claimed deductions under Subchapter T of Chapter 1 of the Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 et seq., on the ground that it was operating on a cooperative basis, and continued to pay no taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">On September 2, 1966, the IRS sent a \u201c30-day letter\u201d to the association, \u25a0 assessing proposed deficiencies for the years 1962 through 1965. The IRS disallowed the deductions taken under Sub-chapter T on the ground that the association was not \u201coperating on a cooperative basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">On November 28, 1966, the association filed a protest of the report which led to the 30-day letter. On August 22, 1968, a notice of deficiency (\u201c90-day letter\u201d) was sent to the association. The notice disallowed the association\u2019s deductions again on the ground that during the years in issue the taxpayer was not operating as a cooperative. In 1969, taxpayer paid the additional assessed taxes and filed claims for refund with the IRS. After the requisite six months had passed (see 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6532(a)), taxpayer commenced the suit for refund of the taxes, claiming that the patronage deductions were improperly disallowed and alternatively that it was exempt from taxes under \u00a7 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-11\">During a pre-trial conference on May 11, 1971, the government trial attorney stipulated that the four technical reasons cited in the Service\u2019s 1965 revocation letter were factually erroneous and that the revocation was not based upon taxpayer\u2019s alleged failure to operate as a cooperative. Further discovery was conducted, and the government argued that all evidence relating to the association\u2019s past or present status as an exempt organization should be excluded by the court. The government further contended that the question of whether the revocation was proper was a question of law for the court to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-12\">The trial court considered the evidence and stipulations, reasoning that if the attempted revocation was based solely upon the taxpayer\u2019s alleged failure to comply with the four technical requirements and taxpayer in fact met these conditions, the revocation was without foundation and therefore a nullity. And if the revocation was void, there was no cause for considering the contested deductions, for taxpayer had no tax liability at all. Hence, on September 13, 1972, the district court ruled that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-13\">The 1965 revocation of the exempt status of plaintiff, A. Duda &amp; Sons Cooperative Association was invalid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>and the defendant cannot challenge the association\u2019s status as \u201coperating on a cooperative basis\u201d in this action. The court finds, therefore, that the association is entitled to a full refund of all taxes and interest paid for the suit years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">Then, on October 18, 1972, although no summary judgment motions had been filed and no documents or testimony had been admitted into evidence, the court entered judgment for the appellee. The government filed a notice of appeal on December 14, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">On July 10, 1973, upon a motion of the appellee to supplement the record, the district court set forth an order that at the May 11, 1971, conference counsel for the government stipulated that the revocation of the exemption</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1038-6\">was based solely on the asserted noncompliance by the plaintiff with the technical requirements of Section 521 and that the plaintiff in fact met the said technical requirements of Section 521. Defendant\u2019s counsel also admitted that the attempted revocation had not been based, in whole or in part, on the contention that plaintiff was not \u201coperating on a cooperative basis\u201d during fiscal years 1962 through 1965.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1038-7\">These admissions led the court to conclude that the revocation of taxpayer\u2019s exempt status was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-8\">Following the entry of the order supplementing the record, the government moved this Court to strike the order from the record or, in the alternative, to relieve the government of the concession. This Court denied the government\u2019s motion in all respects. A. Duda &amp; Sons Cooperative Association v. United States (No. 73-1246) (August 17, 1973). We now consider the propriety of the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-11\">The government frames the issue as whether the \u201cvariance\u201d between the grounds stated in the revocation letter and those asserted in the refund suit justify the dismissal. The government first argues that no \u201cvariance\u201d existed between the letter of revocation and the Service\u2019s defense in the refund suit. The government maintains that the final notice of revocation contained a general ground sufficient to sustain the refund suit defense. Alternatively, the government contends that the agent\u2019s letter gave the taxpayer ample notice that the government felt taxpayer was not operating as a cooperative, and the fact that the final revocation notice listed only the four grounds did not prejudice the taxpayer, for only a proposed revocation can be appealed. The government then concludes by asserting that since the final revocation need state no grounds, indicating the incorrect grounds should not prejudice the government\u2019s ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-12\">We find these arguments entirely without merit. We believe the government\u2019s erroneous approach stems from its incorrect statement of the issue upon appeal. First, we find no general ground for revocation in the district director\u2019s letter. The statement upon which the government relies <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was merely a summary of the four previously discussed technical violations and could in no way be expected to apprise the taxpayer that the revocation was based upon an alleged failure to operate as a cooperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-13\">Second, the unsatisfactory manner in which the revocation was attempted makes it difficult to ascertain whether the district director\u2019s letter was appeala-ble. Taxpayer received two letters, a preliminary letter from the auditing agent which indicated that it was intended to narrow the issues under dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>cussion, and a final letter of revocation from the district director. The Statement of Procedural Rules in effect at the relevant time indicated that the district director must send the taxpayer both a proposed letter of revocation setting forth the grounds relied upon and a final letter of revocation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Only the former is appealable. Hence, either the district director\u2019s single letter, in which the wrong grounds were indicated, is both the proposed and final revocation and therefore appealable, or the taxpayer never received the proposed revocation. In either case, the taxpayer was not properly informed of the government\u2019s intentions. We need not, however, base our conclusions upon the government\u2019s failure to abide by its own procedural rules, for as we indicate below, the government has not properly revoked the exemption and any issue of notice to the taxpayer is therefore rendered nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">Finally, the fact that the final letter need not set forth any grounds for revocation does not ameliorate the government\u2019s position. Regardless of the requirements for the final letter of revocation, the revocation itself must be legal and proper. Here, however, government trial counsel stipulated that the only grounds upon which the attempted revocation was based were erroneous. This stipulation had greater ramifications than a mere admission that the grounds stated in the final letter were incorrect; the government, in effect, conceded that the revocation itself was erroneous. Hence, the requirements of the final letter of revocation are of no consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-7\">The government next argues that even if some \u201cvariance\u201d existed between the letter of revocation and defense at trial, it was so insignificant in light of all the circumstances as not to warrant voiding the government\u2019s defense. The government concedes that the IRS is expected to follow both the letter and spirit of the law but explains that the proposed and final ruling revocations occurred at an early stage and a low level in the audit process and that taxpayer is generally entitled to several further administrative hearings before the tax is finally assessed and collected. The provision for numerous hearings in the Statement of Procedural Rules, contends the government, indicates that a change in the Service\u2019s position may be necessary as the case is more fully presented. Moreover, the government maintains that it would be unduly restrictive to bind the Service indefinitely to a legal position originally outlined at the District Director level.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-11\">The notion that the government should be able to change its defense in a tax refund suit as new and more detailed facts come to light is an appealing one. However, government counsel in the trial court stipulated that the attempted revocation was not based, in whole or in part, on the contention the taxpayer was not \u201coperating on a cooperative basis.\u201d The government now wishes to espouse the defense that it abjured by stipulation below. It is well settled that stipulations of fact fairly entered into are controlling and conclusive, and courts are bound to enforce them, <em>see e. g., </em>United States v. Righter, 400 F.2d 344, 351 (8th Cir. 1968); Osborne v. United States, 351 F.2d 111, 120 (8th Cir. 1965), even if the government is the party bound, <em>see </em>Fenis v. Finch, 436 F.2d 831 (8th Cir. 1971). Thus, the United States is bound by a statement of its attorney made at a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>trial conference to the same extent as any other litigant. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Fallbrook Public Utility District, 165 F.Supp. 806 (S.D.Cal.1958). This Court has already refused on a prior occasion to relieve the government of stipulations made by it to the trial court, A. Duda &amp; Sons Cooperative Association v. United States, No. 73-1246 (August 17, 1973), and we again refuse to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">In its oral argument and briefs to this Court the government makes much of its ability to retroactively revoke a taxpayer\u2019s income tax exemption. Indeed, the Supreme Court has held that the Commissioner may retroactively revoke a taxpayer\u2019s exemption if the original decision to grant the exemption was based upon a \u201cmistake of law.\u201d <em>See, </em>Automobile Club of Michigan v. Commissioner, 353 U.S. 180, 77 S.Ct. 707, 1 L.Ed.2d 746 (1957); Etter Grain Company, Inc. v. United States, 462 F.2d 259 (5th Cir. 1972). Likewise, the rules in effect in 1965 specify that a ruling or determination letter could be revoked retroactively \u201cif there has been an omission or misstatement of material fact\u201d or \u201cif the organization operated in a manner materially different from that originally represented.\u201d Rev.Pro. 62-30, 1962-2 Cum.Bull. 512 (26 C.F.R. \u00a7 601.-201(n)(10)(iii)); <em>see </em>Huff-Cook Mutual Burial Association v. United States, 327 F.Supp. 1209 (W.D.Va.1971). The government here contends that it can show both an omission of material fact and operation in a manner materially different from that originally represented and hence retroactive revocation should be permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-8\">The precise goal of the government\u2019s argument is unclear, as we have indicated the Service\u2019s attempted revocation of taxpayer\u2019s exemption was never effected because it was based on erroneous grounds. There has been no new letter of revocation from the Service prior to our decision. Therefore, there is no letter of revocation to be applied retroactively or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-10\">The government has had an adequate opportunity to properly deal with this taxpayer with regard to the years here in issue. Therefore, the government\u2019s request for additional time to issue a new letter of revocation retroactive to 1961 is also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 521 provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-7\">(a) <em>Exemption </em>From. <em>Tax. </em>\u2014 A farmers\u2019 cooperative organization described in subsection (b) (1) shall be exempt from taxation under this subtitle except, as otherwise provided in part I of subehapter T (sec. 1381 and following).
