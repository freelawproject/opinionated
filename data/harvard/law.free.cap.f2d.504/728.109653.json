Appellant requested that the wheeling requirement imposed by 43 C. F.R. 2851.1-l(a) (5), which requires that the grantee of a right-of-way across public lands agrees to wheel government power over surplus capacity in its own private power lines, be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">The Idaho Land Office of the Bureau of Land Management granted the permit, but informed appellant it would not consent to a waiver of the clause. The \u00a1Secretary of the Interior, through the Interior Board of Land Appeals, affirmed the decision of the Idaho Office on November 5, 1971 (R. 16), and Utah Power filed its complaint in the district court seeking to have the regulation declared invalid and in excess of the Secretary\u2019s authority. The district court issued its order on November 3, 1972, sustaining the Secretary\u2019s authority to promulgate the wheeling regulation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-14\">\u201cThe Court, after considering the arguments and briefs of counsel, and being fully advised in the matter, ruled that the \u2018wheeling\u2019 requirements and attendant provisions contained in 43 C.F.R. 2851.l-(a) (5) [2851.1-1(a)(5)] constitute a reasonable and lawful exercise of the Secretary of Interior\u2019s administrative discretion and that said regulation is within the scope of authority delegated to the Secretary under Title 43, United States Code, Section 961.\u201d (R. 63)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-16\">A timely notice of appeal was filed November 30, 1972. This Court\u2019s jurisdiction rests on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-17\">The sole issue presented on appeal is whether the Secretary of Interior has the authority to issue a right-of-way permit under 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 961, to a private utility company to construct electric transmission wires over public lands and condition the use of the right-of-way on the adherence to the wheeling privileges contained in 43 C.F.R. 2851.1-1 (a) (5). Appellant argues that the trial court was in error in ruling that: (1) the wheeling provision of the regulations is within the scope of authority delegated to the Secretary; (2) the wheeling provision constitutes a reasonable exercise of authority granted to the Secretary; (3) the wheeling provision was not in violation of appellant\u2019s Fifth Amendment protection against deprivation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>property without due process of law. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">I. <em>Analysis of Legislative History</em></p>\n<p id=\"acq-dedup-0\">The Act of February 15, 1901, 31 Stat. 790, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 959, for the first time provided for the issuance of revocable permits for rights-of-way through public lands under general regulations fixed by the Secretary of the Interior. In 1911 Congress amended the earlier enactment to allow the Secretary to grant permits for a period not exceeding fifty years from the date of issuance. The statute, as amended, now reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\">\u201cThe head of the department having jurisdiction over the lands be and he is, authorized and empowered, <em>under general .regulations </em>to be fixed by him, to grant an easement for rights-of-way, for a period not exceeding fifty years from the date of the issuance of such grant, over, across, and upon the public lands and reservations of the United States for electrical poles and lines for the transmission and distribution of electrical power . . .\u201d43 U.S.C. \u00a7 961 (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Pursuant to the statutory authority to promulgate general regulations, the Secretary of the Interior, on March 23, 1963 issued the wheeling regulation here in controversy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 43 C.F.R. 2234.4-1(a)(5), redesignated in 1971 as 43 C. F.R. 2851.1-l(a), (l)(a)(5) and (1) (b),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b794-13\">\u00a7 2851.1 <em>Nature of interest.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-14\">\u00a7 2851.1-1 <em>Terms and conditions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-15\">(a) By accepting a right-of-way for a power transmission line, the applicant thereby agrees and consents to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions, excepting those which the Secretary may waive in a particular case, in addition to those specified in \u00a7 2801.1-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-16\">(5) An applicant for a right-of-way for a transmission facility having a voltage of 33 kilovolts or more must, in addition to the requirements of \u00a7 2802, execute and file with its application a stipulation agreeing to accept the right-of-way grant subject to the following conditions :</p>\n<p id=\"b794-17\">(i) In the event the United States, pursuant to law, acquires the applicant\u2019s transmission or other facilities constructed on or across such right-of-way, the price to be paid by the United States shall not include or be affected by any value of the right-of-way granted to the applicant under authority of the regulations of this part.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-18\">(ii) The Department of the Interior shall be allowed to utilize for the transmission of electric power and energy any surplus capacity of the transmission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>facility in excess of the capacity needed by the holder of the grant (subsequently referred to in this paragraph as \u201cholder\u201d) for the transmission of electx\u00fcc power and energy in connection with the holder\u2019s operations, or to increase the capacity of the transmission facility at the Department\u2019s expense and to utilize the increased capacity for the transmission of electric power and energy. Utilization by the Department of surplus or increased capacity shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">(ex) When the Department desires to utilize surplus capacity thought to exist in the transmission facility, notification will be given to the holder and the holder shall furnish to the Department within 30 days a certificate stating whether the transmission facility has any surplus capacity not needed by the holder for the transmission of electric power and energy in connection with the holder\u2019s operations and, if so, the amount of such surplus capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">(6) Where the certificate indicates that there is no surplus capacity or that the sux\u2019plus capacity is less than that required by the Department the authorized officer may call upon the holder to furnish additional information upon which its certification is based. Upon receipt of such additional information the authorized officer shall determine, as a matter of fact, if surplus capacity is available and, if so, the amount of such sux\u2019plus capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">(c) In order to utilize any surplus capacity determined to be available, or any increased capacity provided by the Department at its own expense, the Department may interconnect its transmission facilities with the holder\u2019s transmission facility in a manner conforming to approved standards of practice for the interconnection of transmission circuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">(d) The expense of interconnection will be borne by the Department, and the Department will at all times provide and maintain adequate protective equipment to insure the normal and efficient operation of the holder\u2019s transmission facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">(e) After any interconnection is completed, the holder shall operate and maintain its transmission facilities in good condition, and, except in emergencies, shall maintain in a closed position all connections under the holder\u2019s control necessary to the transmission of the Department\u2019s power and energy over the holder\u2019s transmission facilities. The parties may by mutual consent open any switch where necessary or desirable for maintenance, repair or construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">(/) The transmission of electric power and energy by the Department over the holder\u2019s transmission facilities will be effected in such manner, as will not interf\u00e9re unreasonably with the holder\u2019s use of the transmission facilities in accordance with the holder\u2019s normal operating standards, except that the Department shall have the exclusive right to utilize any increased capacity of the transmission facility which has been provided at the Department\u2019s expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\"><em>(g) </em>The holder will not be obligated to allow the transmission of eleetx\u2019ic power and energy by the Department to any person receiving service from the holder on the date of the filing of the application for a grant, other than statutory preference customers including agencies of the Federal Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\"><em>(h) </em>The Department will pay to the holder an equitable share of the total monthly cost of that part of the holder\u2019s transmission facilities utilized by the Department for the transmission of electric power and energy, the payment to be an amount in dollars representing the same proportion of the total monthly cost of such part of the transmission facilities as the maximum amount in kilowatts of the power transmitted on a scheduled basis by the Department over the holder\u2019s transmission facilities bears to the total capacity in kilowatts of that portion of the transmission facilities. The total monthly cost will be determined in accordance with the system of accounts prescribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>by the Federal Power Commission, exclusive of any investment by the Department in the part of the transmission facilities utilized by the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">(i) If, at any time subsequent to a certification by the holder or determination by the authorized officer that surplus capacity is available for utilization by the Department, the holder needs for the transmission of electric power and energy in connection with its operations the whole or any part of the capacity of the transmission facility theretofore certified or determined as being surplus to its needs, the holder may request the authorized officer to modify or revoke the previous certification or determination by making application to the authorized officer not later than 36 months in advance of the holder\u2019s needs. Any modification or revocation of the certification or determination shall not affect the right of the Department to utilize facilities provided at its expense or available under a contract entered into by reason of the equitable contract arrangements provided for in this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\"><em>(j) </em>If the Department and the holder disagree as to the existence or amount of surplus capacity in carrying out the terms and conditions of this paragraph, the disagreement shall be decided by a board of three persons composed- as follows: The holder and the authorized officer shall each appoint a member of the board and the two members shall appoint a third member. If the members appointed by the holder and the authorized officer are unable to agree on the designation of the third member, he shall be designated by the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals of the circuit in which the major share of the facilities involved is located. The board shall determine the issue and its determination, by majority vote, shall be binding on the Department and the holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">(fc) As used in this section, the term \u201ctransmission facility\u201d includes (a) all types of facilities for the transmission of electric power and energy and facilities for the interconnection of such facilities, and (5) the entire transmission line and associated facilities, from substation or interconnection point to substation or interconnection point, of which the segment crossing the lands of the United States forms a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">(Z) The terms and conditions prescribed in this paragraph may be modified at any time by means of a supplemental agreement negotiated between the holder and the Secretary of the Interior or his designee.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">(b) Unless otherwise specified in a right-of-way granted under the act of March 4, 1911, and unless sooner canceled, the right-of-way shall expire 50 years from the date thereof. If, however, within the period of 1 year prior to the expiration date, the grantee shall file, in accordance with \u00a7 2802.1, a written application to renew the right-of-way, and shall agree to comply with all the laws and regulations existing at such expiration date governing the occupancy and use of the lands of the United States for the purpose desired, the right-of-way may be renewed for a period of not to exceed 50 years. If such application is filed, the existing right-of-way will be extended subject to then existing and future rules and regulations, pending consideration of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">(31 Stat. 790, 36 Stat. 1253; 43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 959, 961)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">Utah Power\u2019s argument that the Secretary 'of the Interior exceeded his statutory authority by issuing the wheeling regulation, which attaches a condition to grants of rights-of-way over public lands, places considerable emphasis on the regulatory authority delegated to the Federal Power Commission to control the activities of utility companies. It appears to be Utah Power\u2019s position that the Federal Power Act of June 10, 1920, 41 Stat. 1063, as amended by sections 201-213 inclusive, of the act of August 26, 1935, 49 Stat. 838, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 791-825r, pre-empts any authority given to the Secretary by the 1911 right-of-way statute, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 961, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>regulate the transmission and sale of electricity by placing the plenary jurisdiction for the regulation thereof in the Federal Power Commission (herein sometimes \u201cF.P.C.\u201d), rather than the Department of the Interior. (Appellant\u2019s Brief p. 21; <em>see also </em>pp. 11-12, 20-23, 32, 35-41 and Reply Brief p. 2, n. 1). With this we do not agree.'</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Included amont the regulations governing the conditions under which grants of rights-of-way are to be issued, is an explanation of. the relationship between the 1911 statute and the Federal Power Act. The latter superseded the earlier Acts, but twice specifically excepted distribution lines, <em>i. e., </em>non-primary transmission lines.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-6\">\u201c(c) The applicability of the acts of February 15, 1901, and March 4, 1911, to rights-of-way for power purposes over public lands, was superseded by the Federal Power Act of June 10, 1920 (41 Stat. 1063), as amended by sections 201 to 213, inclusive of the act of August 26, 1935 (49 Stat. 838; 16 U.S.C. 791-825r), as to power projects for the generation and transmission of hydroelectric power, defined in section 3(11) of the act, excepting distribution lines. Applications for hydroelectric power plant sites or rights-of-way for main or primary hydroelectric power transmission lines must be made to the Federal Power Commission, Washington, D. C. under the act of June 10, 1920, as amended. <em>Rights-of-way for transmission lines which are not primary lines must be secured under the act of February 15, 1901, or the act of March </em>J, <em>1911. </em>See 18 C.F.R. 2.2.\u201d 43 C.F.R. 2850.-0-3(c) (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Both parties agree that here we are concerned with a rigRt-of-way for non-primary transmission lines. (Appellee\u2019s Brief p. 22, n. 20, p. 44, n. 37; Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief p. 2, n. 1) Part I of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 791a-823h, limits the licensing jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission to power plants for the generation of hydroelectric power, and to main or primary hydroelectric transmission lines, while permits for steam plants and easements for steam power transmission lines and easements for hydroelectric power lines that are not primary or main lines are still governed by the 1901 and 1911 right-of-way acts. 18 C.F.R. 2.2.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cThus, an easement for the latter would not be granted by the Federal Power Commission but would be granted by the Secretary of the Interior or the departmental head having jurisdiction over the lands involved.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief, pp: 2-3, n. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">Utah Power argues that it is engaged in interstate commerce and under Parts II and III of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 824-824h, 825-825t, the F.P.C. has plenary authority to regulate various aspects of the transmission of energy in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">Utah Power\u2019s argument relying upon Part II of the Federal Power Act was explicitly met by the Supreme Court in the case of Federal Power Commission v. Idaho Power Co., 344 U.S. 17, 73 S.Ct. 85, 97 L.Ed. 15 (1952). In <em>Idaho Power </em>the Court considered a challenge to the authority of. the F.P.C. to impose a wheeling requirement upon a private utility seeking to construct primary transmission lines across public lands. The Court in concluding that the Commission had the authority under Part I of the Act, when granting a license for a primary line, to require wheeling when the proposed lines would cross public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>lands, observed that an express limitation upon the Commission\u2019s authority to require wheeling under Part II existed. <em>Id. </em>at 21, 73 S.Ct. 85. The reference was to \u00a7 201(f) of the Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824(f) which states: \u201cNo provision in [section 824-824h] [Part II] of this title shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States.\u201d This provision in Part II of the Act would appear to rebut appellant\u2019s argument that the F.P.C. through interstate commerce has the authority to regulate Utah Power by means of a wheeling requirement under Part II, and not the Secretary of the Interior.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Congress\u2019 intent to give the Secretary of the Interior broad authority under the 1911 right-of-way statute is not clearly demonstrated by reviewing the congressional debate surrounding its enactment. 46 Cong.Rec., 4014-4020 (daily ed., March 4, 1911). There is discussion to the effect that the Secretary should enact regulations to protect the public lands from interference or abuse, <em>Id. </em>at 4020. But, we agree with appellant this does not support the Secretary\u2019s authority to promulgate a wheeling requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">However, we agree with the statement by the Department of the Interior made in an administrative decision involving the same issue as that which confronts us here, <em>i. e., </em>whether the act of 1911 supports the Secretary\u2019s promulgation of a wheeling regulation. This was in Southern California Edison Company, 71 I.D. 405, 409-411 (1964) which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-6\">\u201cIts [The Act of 1911] intent is that such lines not be placed thereon by right and at random. Its intent on its face is that transmission lines be placed on Government lands under the terms and conditions the Government department responsible for the overall welfare of those lands believes transmission lines should be placed thereon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-9\">Where the permit is to endure for fifty years and is not to be revocable at the will of the Government, the act requires such regulations as will protect Government interests associated with Government lands for the next 50 years. Had the Sixty-first Congress intended permits to be issued summarily \u2014 had it intended them to be issued if the applicants met the one, two, or three standards, the Sixty-first Congress in March 1911 thought should govern the placement of transmission lines on Government lands \u2014 the Sixty-first Congress would have said so. It legislated differently. Having stated its specific purpose and intent, Congress directed the departments responsible for Government lands to treat by such regulations as they in their expertise deemed appropriate, such developments and exigencies that should materialize during the life of the law that affected the placement of transmission lines on Government lands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-10\">We think a regulation requiring a permittee to let the Government use surplus capacity in a transmission line permittee would build on Government\u2019s lands, is uniquely within the purview and intent of the 1911 transmission line act. The use of the transmission lines of one electric system to wheel, convey, or market the power and energy of and for another system is a widespread, long-established operating practice in the power industry. So is the interconnection and the joint use of transmission facilities by two or more different systems; and so is the purposeful overbuilding of transmission line capacity in anticipation of future load growth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>The Federal Government is the largest wholesale producer of electric power and energy in the Nation. Its installed generating capacity of about 26 million kilovolts comprises 17 percent of all electric utility generating capacity in the country. Its installed hydroelectric capacity accounts for about 45 percent of the Nation\u2019s developed hydroelectric capacity. We are advised by the Assistant Secretary, Water and Power Development, that another 8.8 million kilovolts of Federal generating capacity is under construction; and still another 10.2 million kilovolts has been approved or authorized for future construction. The statutes under which this Federal power and energy is produced require that preference in the sale thereof be given to governmental agencies and to nonprofit organizations. This requirement originated contemporaneously with the transmission line right-of-way laws in question. It began with section 5 of the act of April 16, 1906 (34 Stat. 116, 117), requiring the Secretary of the Interior to give preference to municipal purposes when disposing of power produced at Federal reclamation projects in the western United States under the act of June 17, 1902 (32 Stat. 388). It was restated by the act of February 24, 1911 (36 Stat. 930) ; and it has been affirmed by a long series of statutes enacted and re-enacted down to the present. To avoid constructing the transmission lines needed to market this power and energy, the Government utilizes the transmission facilities of other systems to the maximum extent practicable. This wheeling service that utility systems perform for the Federal Government is based on \u2018the principle of coordination and cooperation * * * the very purpose of which is to make use of company transmission line facilities to avoid duplication and waste of Government funds\u2019 for transmission lines.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">As appellee contends and the above quotation supports, the Secretary of the Interior had already initiated federal hydroelectric projects before the 1911 statute was enacted. The Federal Power Marketing Policy, which substantially began with the Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 1057, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 617-617u; and includes the Bonneville Project Act of 1937, 50 Stat. 731, 16 U. S.C. \u00a7 832 et seq.; The Flood Control Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1570, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 701b et seq.; the Fort Peek Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 403, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 833 et seq.; the Reclamation Project Act of 1939, 53 Stat. 1187, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 375, 387-389, 485-485k and the Flood Control Act of 1944, 58 Stat. 890, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 825s although admittedly not directly related to the 1911 statute, does indicate a Congressional policy of giving the Secretary a broad scope of responsibility in implementing Federal Power Projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">Similarly, the express language in the 1911 act had authorized the Secretary, by means of general regulations, to condition grants of rights-of-way in a manner best serving the public interest. Since the permit to use the public land may be for 50 years, when we consider the fact that there was no specific Congressional intent expressed as to the manner in which the public interest shall be protected for those 50 years, the wheeling requirement represents a logical and presumably effective means of protecting the public interest in the public lands over which rights-of-way are granted. Unless we find such a regulation unreasonable in its content, we see no reason from the legislative background to hold that the wheeling requirement is beyond the scope of the Secretary\u2019s authority under 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 961.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We do not find that the appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>has met his burden of proof to show the challenged regulation is an unreasonable exercise of a delegated power, \u201ci. e., inconsistent with the statute.\u201d United States v. Boyd, 491 F.2d 1163 (9th Cir. 1973); Boske v. Comingore, 177 U.S. 459, 470, 20 S.Ct. 701, 44 L.Ed. 846 (1899).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">II. <em>The Idaho Power Cases and The Chapman Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Since we find no case which directly concerns the Secretary\u2019s authority challenged here, we turn to an analysis of eases argued by both sides as being analogous and relevant to our decision on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Appellee asserts that the Secretary\u2019s wheeling requirement has been judicially sustained in a similar context by the Supreme Court in <em>Idaho Power </em>(1952) and by this Court in Idaho Power Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 346 F.2d 956 (9th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 957, 86 S.Ct. 435, 15 L.Ed.2d 361 (1965); and that these decisions are dispositive of the present controversy. (Appellee\u2019s Brief p. 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Appelllant, on the other hand, argues that the District of Columbia Circuit case of Chapman v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 92 U.S.App.D.C. 154, 204 F.2d 46 (1953) requires us to find that the \u201cright of way statute did not confer upon the Secretary so vast and detailed a power as the promulgation of specific regulations and conditions governing the \u2018operations\u2019 of an applicant.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief p. 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-14\">In the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Idaho Power </em>case, discussed above, the Court was concerned with the authority of the F.P.C. to impose a wheeling requirement. In presenting the facts the Court took particular note of the Federal Power Marketing Policy and the responsibility of the Secretary thereunder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-15\">\u201cThe United States has power projects in this area; and the Bureau of Reclamation and the Bonneville Power Administration were contemplating the construction of a transmission line which would connect the same areas as respondent\u2019s proposed lines. Therefore the Federal Power Commission, on the suggestion of the Secretary of the Interior authorized the project on conditions specified in paragraph (F) of the order. These conditions, in summary, were that the licensee permit the interconnection of transmission facilities of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>States with the two transmission lines, and the transfer over those lines of energy generated in power plants owned by the United States \u2018in such amounts as will not unreasonably interfere\u2019 with the licensee\u2019s use of the lines, the United States to pay the licensee for government power so transmitted.\u201d 344 U.S. at 19, 73 S.Ct. at 86.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">In discussing the authority of the Commission, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-7\">\u201cUnder these sections the Commission is plainly made the guardian of the public domain. The requirement that existing lines be fully utilized before additional lines are authorized would seem to be relevant to a decision under \u00a7 10(a) that the project submitted was consonant with the \u2018comprehensive plan\u2019 for the waterway. And the Commission might well determine under \u00a7 4(g) that if public lands are to be used for the transmission of power, conservation of the \u2018water-power resources of the region\u2019 require that public power as well as private power be transmitted over them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-8\">Sections 4 and 10 speak specifically of the public domain \u2014 waterways and public lands. Section 6 makes each license subject to all the terms and conditions of the Act and to \u2018such further conditions, if any, as the Commission shall prescribe in conformity with this Act. . . .\u2019 Section 6, read in the context of \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 10, would seem to give ample authority to the Commission to attach the conditions imposed here. Protection of the public domain, conservation of water-power resources, development of comprehensive plans for the waterways\u2014 each of these might on the facts of a case be sufficient to authorize the grant of permission to a public utility company to use the public domain provided it agreed to use its excess capacity to transmit government power.\u201d 344 U.S. at 23, 73 S.Ct. at 88. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-15\">Appellee contends that in analogous fashion, the Secretary has similar authority under the right-of-way statute. In this Court\u2019s <em>Idaho Power Co., supra </em>(1965), a similar issue was addressed. There the power company sought authority to. construct two additional transmission lines in connection with its already licensed hydroelectric project on the Snake River, Idaho. Authority was granted to amend the license provided the petitioner make surplus capacity of the project\u2019s transmission facilities available to the Government for the wheeling of Government power at Government expense. Idaho Power Company challenged the authority of the Commission to impose such a condition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-16\">We affirmed the condition suggested by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture, relying on the reasoning by the Supreme Court in the earlier <em>Idaho Power </em>case. 346 F.2d at 959-960.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-17\">Appellant relies on the <em>Chapman </em>case. In <em>Chapman, </em>El Paso Natural Gas Company had entered into negotiations with the Secretary of Interior concerning grants of rights-of-way for a proposed gas pipeline. Under section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 449 (1920) as amended 49 Stat. 678 (1938), 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 185 (1953) (amended 1973), such rights-of-way \u201cmay be granted by the Secretary of Interior &gt; . . under such regulations and conditions ... as may be prescribed by the Secretary . . . \u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>Secretary originally acted to require El Paso to sign a stipulation that it would operate . . as a common carrier in accordance with the provisions of the Mineral Leasing Act . . 204 F. 2d at 48, n. 1. But as the construction progressed additional rights-of-way were granted. Then the Secretary took the position that the remaining rights-of-way would not be granted unless El Paso signed a detailed stipulation concerning common carrier obligations and including a provision for increased capacity of the pipeline. El Paso took the position that the stipulation was beyond the Secretary\u2019s authority under the statute. The court held that the Secretary\u2019s authority under the statute, which expressly provided authority for regulations and conditions as to survey, location, application and use, was limited to physical aspects of the rights-of-way and did not extend to the actual operations of the pipeline. 204 F.2d at 51. Thus, appellant asserts that here the Secretary is regulating the operations of a power company by conditioning the grant of a right-of-way for purposes unrelated to the right-of-way statute and <em>Chapman </em>is authority preventing the Secretary from acting in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">However, as we stated previously, we do not find that the Secretary is regulating the operations of Utah Power by means of the wheeling requirement, but is acting within the authority provided by the right-of-way statute to protect the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">The Mineral Leasing Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, prior to its amendment in 1973, and at issue in <em>Chapman, </em>expressly provided a built-in protection of the public interest. The court there stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-8\">\u201cAmple protection of the public interest exists, and adequate enforcement of the condition is possible, under the provision for forfeiture of the grant by the United States District Court, in an appropriate proceeding, for failure to comply with the provisions of the section or with appropriate regulations and conditions established by the Secretary.\u201d 204 F.2d at 51.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">The right-of-way statute at issue here, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 961, does not expressly provide any such protection. The only forfeiture provision is for \u201cnonuse for a period of two years or for abandonment.\u201d Instead the Congress directed the Secretary to use his expertise to determine what might be deemed appropriate to protect the public interest under the right-of-way statute. Although we acknowledge certain problems may well be caused by the wheeling requirements on appellant\u2019s ability to transmit power (Appellant\u2019s Brief pp. 28-33), on balance we find that protection of the public interest in public lands in this situation must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">A final distinction between the <em>Idaho Power </em>cases and <em>Chapman </em>exists. In <em>Chapman </em>the court recognized a distinction between the facts there and those in the Supreme Court <em>Idaho Power </em>case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-12\">\u201cSimilarly, F.P.C. v. Idaho Power Co., 1952, 344 U.S. 17, 73 S.Ct. 85, 97 L.Ed. 15, decided by the Supreme Court since we heard the present case, is not in point, in spite of some apparent similarities. There, the Court held that the Judiciary was without power to modify conditions attached to a license, the function of a reviewing court being at an end when it laid bare an error of law. <em>But we are not dealing here with an order which seeks to compel the granting of a license in futuro or the modification and alteration of conditions embodied in the license prior to its issuance, but with an order which would simply require the Secretary to execute the purely ministerial act of issuing rights-of-way pursuant to what we regard as a license granted previously without condition.\u201d </em>204 F.2d at 53 (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-13\">Thus, <em>Chapman </em>was concerned with a license previously issued without condition, the expenditure of millions of dol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>lars by the licensee in reliance thereon, and a later attempt to alter the license. The earlier <em>Idaho Power </em>case involved a license not yet granted and modification and alteration of conditions prior to issuance, which is what <em>Utah Power </em>is attempting to do here.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Our later opinion in <em>Idaho Power </em>(1965) concerned a proposed amendment of the original license which had originally left some of the final terms open pending later agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">The distinction between attaching a condition to a license prior to issuance, and that of altering a license already existing by attaching a new condition is readily .explained by reference to contract law. The distinction is between negotiating the terms of a contract <em>prior </em>to entering into a contract (which Utah Power was attempting to do by having the Secretary waive the wheeling requirement), and altering a contract previously entered into. The latter requires agreement by both parties (which explains the <em>Chapman </em>holding). <em>See </em>4 Williston, Contracts \u00a7 591 (3d ed. 1961). Thus, we agree with appellee that the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Idaho Power </em>(1952) and our decision in <em>Idaho Power </em>(1965) support the Secretary\u2019s authority to promulgate the wheeling requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">Furthermore, our attention was drawn to the unpublished Memorandum Opinion in Idaho Power Company v. Chapman, No. 4540-50 (D.D.C.1952) and supplemental memorandum of October 31, 1952 (Appellee\u2019s Brief pp. 62-72) in which the issue of the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s wheeling regulation was fully explored and upheld.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">III. <em>Reasonableness of the Wheeling Provision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">We repeat, the substance of the contested regulation (43 C.F.R. 2851.1-1(a)(5)) provides that the Department of Interior have the use of any surplus capacity in the holder\u2019s transmission line crossing public lands (in excess of the capacity needed by the holder) and that the Department may increase the capacity. The expense of interconnection to use surplus capacity or to increase capacity is borne by the Department in a manner insuring the normal and efficient operation of the holder\u2019s transmission facilities (subpara, (c) and (d)). Any disagreement in surplus capacity is to be adjudicated by a three-man board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>(subpara. (j)). When for his own-operations the owner needs to recover his surplus capacity he must give the Department 36 months notice (subpara, (i)). In transmitting electric power and energy over the holder\u2019s transmission facilities, the Department shall not unreasonably interfere with the owner\u2019s operation (subpara, (f)); it may not, without the owner\u2019s consent use his surplus capacity to supply customers the owner was serving when he applied for the permit unless they are preference customers (subpara. (g)). The Department must pay an equitable share of the total cost of that part of the holder\u2019s transmission facilities utilized by the Department (subpara. (h)).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">On its face, we believe that such a wheeling regulation is reasonable. It does not in substance differ greatly from that wheeling provision approved by this Court in the <em>Idaho Power </em>case, <em>supra, </em>346 F.2d at 958.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s complaint in the district court only stated that the wheeling provision was itself unreasonable. (R. 13), but made no factual allegations to support its conclusory statement. The 36 months notice requirement to recover surplus capacity is reasonable in that construction activities are planned at least that far in advance in the electrical industry. For example, <em>see </em>Idaho Power Co. v. Chapman, <em>supra </em>at 7. Thus, a judgment on the pleadings was appropriate and an evi-dentiary hearing was not required.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">IV. <em>Fifth Amendment Deprivation of Property Without Due Process of Law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">The appellant next argues that the wheeling provision constitutes a taking of its property without due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment. We cannot agree with appellant on this point. Utah Power fails to consider the fact that the right-of-way statute allows the holder of the grant to place transmission lines on public lands. The right to grant such rights-of-way is within the discretion of the Secretary under 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 961, and allowing a private utility to use the public lands balances against allowing the Government to use the holder\u2019s surplus capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">The regulation would not operate co take property of appellant without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment, because 43 C.F.R. 2851.1-1(a)(5)(h) requires the Department to pay the owner \u201can equitable share\u201d of the cost of transmission facilities used by the Department. As far as provision for a hearing, the regulations provide under subparagraph (j) for a board of three persons to determine the existence or amount of surplus capacity if the Department and the holder are unable to agree. (This would seem to satisfy due process requirements given the special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>relationship between the Department and the private utility in the grant of the right-of-way to public lands. A full evidentiary hearing is not required in every instance.)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">V. <em>Vagueness and Ambiguity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Finally, in response to appellant\u2019s various contentions that the wheeling regulation is vague and ambiguous and should be declared unreasonable, we are in agreement with the statement of the Department in Southern California Edison Company, <em>supra, </em>in responding to the same claim of unreasonableness :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-6\">\u201c. . . we find appellant\u2019s arguments on this ground premature. The regulations serve to articulate certain fundamental legal relations subsisting between the Government and the per-mittees who place transmission lines on Government lands. The regulations do not purport to be a substitute for the complex, contractual relations that must exist before Government attempts to make use of a permittee\u2019s transmission facilities. This is made expressly clear by the reference to \u2018supplemental agreements\u2019 at subpara-graph (xii) [(1)] of the stipulation. The permittees may assume that if or when Government contracts to use any surplus capacity of a permittee\u2019s transmission lines, the Government will not interfere with and will respect all legal rights and interests of the permittees.\u201d 711.D. at 414.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Because of what has been said herein, we affirm the order of the district court holding that the wheeling requirement and attendant provisions contained in 43 C.F.R. 2851.1-l(a) (5) constitute a reasonable and lawful exercise of the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s administrative discretion and that said regulations are within the scope of authority delegated to the Secretary under Title 43, United States Code, Section 961.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b793-12\">. \u201cWheeling\u201d is the transmission of one company\u2019s power over another company\u2019s systern.

At the time of issuing the regulation the Secretary states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-9\">\u201cThe regulations are first a matter of conservation. We felt that it was important to set forth now the basic principle that where one transmission line crossing Government lands can do the job all reasonable efforts should be made to avoid additional lines. This principle is important when one considers the rapidly growing needs of the future for more and more transmission line facilities. The regulations were also issued so that the Department could carry out better its responsibilities for the marketing of power.\u201d Public Land Law Review Commission, Use and Occupancy, Yol. I Report, Chapters 1-9, p. VII-41.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b794-10\">. In 1948 the Secretary of the Interior promulgated a wheeling regulation similar to the one here, but it was rescinded in 1954.

The Committee\u2019s conclusions indicated affirmative support for the wheeling regulation.

Another source of rejection for appellant\u2019s argument is that Part II does not regulate public lands. <em>Idem. </em>344 U.S. at 22, 73 S.Ct. 85. That function is covered by Part I. Here, the application is for a right-of-way over public land and although the issue concerns the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s authority to condition such a grant by means of a wheeling requirement, the ultimate grant concerns a regulation o\u00ed public lands; and thus the 1911 statute prevails here over either Part I (because of non-primary transmission lines) or Part II of the Federal Power Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b799-10\">.
