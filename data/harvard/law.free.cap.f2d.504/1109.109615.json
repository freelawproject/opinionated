Defendant also advances contentions that the prosecutor\u2019s summation infringed defendant\u2019s fifth amendment right not to testify and that the sentence imposed on him was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-19\">During argument counsel for the government was interrogated about a possible variance between the indictment and the government\u2019s proof, an issue not briefed, and leave was granted the government to supplement its views on this aspect of the case. In exercise of this permission, the government has advised us that it has reconsidered its entire position in the case, that it confesses error in the exclusion of all of the grand jury testimony sought to be presented by defendant as urged by the government at trial, that such error is reversible error, and that defendant should be granted a new trial at which the government expects to make a more persuasive demonstration of the materiality of the alleged untruths.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-20\">We accept the government\u2019s concession; and it obviates the necessity of further discussion of the issues. Accordingly the judgment entered on the conviction is reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial. We intimate no views as to the admissibility of the entire grand jury transcript. Rather the district court shall rule on the admissibility of the portions offered in light of the government\u2019s changed position, the rules of evidence and its sound discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-21\">Reversed with new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
