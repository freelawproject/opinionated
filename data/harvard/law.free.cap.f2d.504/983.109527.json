F. Goodrich Company began to manufacture a plastic reinforcement film for commercial sale to garment manufacturers. Hortex, Inc., a Texas garment producer, purchased the Goodrich product, called Fabrilock,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and used it to reinforce the knee areas of boys\u2019 trousers. Williamson-Dickie Mfg.' Co. is the owner of the Mizell patent<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>that related to a method of reinforcing garments by applying heat and pressure to a film of thermoplastic material. They sued Goodrich and Hortex for patent law violations. Williamson-Dickie claimed that Hortex\u2019s use of Fabrilock film infringed upon the Mizell patent,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that Goodrich\u2019s actions in marketing Fabrilock constituted contributory infringement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">Goodrich and Hortex denied infringement of the Mizell patent, and counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment of invalidity and an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. Adopting almost all of the defendants\u2019 proposed findings of facts and conclusion of law, the district court ruled that Hortex and Goodrich had not infringed upon the patent, and that the patent itself was invalid.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Williamson-Dickie appeals the trial court\u2019s decision on those issues, while Goodrich and Hortex cross appeal the denial of attorneys\u2019 fees. We affirm the district court\u2019s ruling on the validity issue; accordingly we do not reach the infringement claim. We also affirm the district court\u2019s refusal to award attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">The Mizell Patent</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">On May 13, 1959, Louis R. Mizell applied to the Patent Office for a patent on an invention relating to producing garments with increased resistance to abrasive wear<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> His original application made sixteen claims relative to both the process and the end product. Protracted negotiations between Mizell\u2019s attorneys and the Patent Examiner followed. The Examiner rejected all the original claims and seven subsequent claims. On May 14, 1963, he finally allowed the following claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-15\">A method of making a garment comprising, cutting pieces of fabric of about 10 ounce weight to peripheral dimensions and shapes for fabrication into a garment, overlaying said pieces in areas of potential wear with a film of thermoplastic material having a thickness of approximately 2 mils, and simultaneously applying heat from about 345\u00b0 F. to 440\u00b0 F. and pressure from about 14 p. s. i. to 145 p. s. i. for periods of about 3-10 seconds to cause the film to flow around the fibers of the fabric in said area on one side only and separate at the interstices between the fibers to render said area permeable to air and water and prevent mechanical separation of the thermoplastic material from the fabric.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1050-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>Thus the end product under the Mizell process has the following characteristics: (1) flow of the film on only one side of the fabric; (2) separation of the l'lm at the interstices rendering the area permeable to air and water; (3) a permanent bond between film and fabric. Mizell\u2019s process achieves these results through application of heat and pressure to the film and fabric for a certain time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">The striking characteristic of the Miz-ell patent is the breadth of the claim. When Mizell\u2019s deposition testimony is considered in conjunction with the language of the claim, its scope becomes clearer. The patent is not limited to certain types of fabrics. Nor does it embrace a limited class of thermoplastic materials.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Instead the claim refers to any fabric \u201cof about 10 ounce weight,\u201d and to any thermoplastic film \u201chaving a thickness of approximately 2 mils.\u201d Yet Mizell\u2019s deposition testimony makes clear that the 10 ounce weight is not crucial. He testified that Williamson-Dickie manufactured work clothes with fabrics ranging from 5 to 12 ounces in weight, and that wear problems were similar for all of them.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He later referred to the problem of strikethrough \u2014having the film penetrate through both sides of the fabric:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-5\">Q Did you ever observe a problem of strikethrough in connection with the film patches which you subsequently developed for Williamson-Dickie ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-6\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-7\">Q And in what connection did you observe the problem in that case ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-8\">A When we got the pressure or thickness too great we could get strike-through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-9\">Q Did it depend also on the weight of the fabric?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-10\">A We could get strikethrough with twelve-ounce denim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-13\">Q Would it stike through twelve-ounce denim just as readily as through a five-ounce fabric?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-14\">A Under different pressure and temperature conditions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1050-15\">The proper temperature factor depended in large part on the heat softening temperature of the particular thermoplastic film employed. Mizell testified that he used a temperature of about 440\u00b0 to cause eaplene (a Nylon film) to fuse and imbed into the fabric, while 325-350\u00b0 was sufficient to achieve that result with polypropylene.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Mizell stated the basic requirement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-16\">Q Continuing at the bottom of page 10, the entry says that the propylene film was placed on the fabric and pressed in the Carver press at 345 degrees, the conditions otherwise apparently being the same as for the Mylar film and the eaplene film.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-17\">How was the temperature of 345 degrees Fahrenheit selected for this first experiment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-18\">A Well, if you look on page 9 you will see that the polypropylene, it says the heat sealing range is 325 to 350 so we are close to the 350.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-19\">\u2022 Q It was considered important then to have the temperature within the heat softening range of the material in question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-20\">A Well, it was important to have to get the temperature of the film in the heat softening range, .... <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"abp-dedup-0\">Mizell\u2019s testimony shows that the patent claim does not contain precise specifications for a particular film and fabric. He stated that \u201c. . . these factors are interrelated ... by applying more pressure for a longer time we could have been a little lower in the temperature . . . . \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The figures in the claim represent the range of temperatures, pressures and times that Miz-ell used in his experiments. Given the interrelationship between the five varia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>bles \u2014 time, temperature, pressure, fabric thickness, and film thickness-the particular specifications in his process are achieved through trial and error. We find that the district court properly concluded Mizell\u2019s process was obvious in light of the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">Validity of the Mizell Patent</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">The three basic tests for patent validity are utility, novelty, and non-obviousness. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101, 102, 103. When a patent application survives the scrutiny of the Patent Office, it presumptively passes all three tests, and the burden of establishing invalidity rests with the party challenging the patent. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284. But the presumption of validity weakens when the challenger presents evidence of prior art not considered by the Patent Office. Beckman Instruments, Inc. v. Chemtronics, Inc., 5th Cir. 1970, 439 F.2d 1369, 1374-1375. Here Goodrich and Hortex contend that the Mizell patent was obvious in light of' certain prior art not disclosed to or considered by the Patent Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">The Supreme Court has set out the applicable boundaries of the obviousness inquiry in Graham v. John Deere Co., 1966, 383 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545. Mr. Justice Clark stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGh\">While the ultimate question of patent validity is one of law, Great A. &amp; P. Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., <em>supra, </em>340 U.S. 147 at 155, 71 S.Ct. 127 at 131 [95 L.Ed. 162 (1950)], the \u00a7 103 condition, which is but one of three conditions, each of which must be satisfied, lends itself to several basic factual inquiries. Under \u00a7 103, the scope and content of the prior art are to be determined; differences between the prior art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained; and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved. Against this background, the obviousness or nonob-viousness of the subject matter is determined. Such secondary considerations as commercial success, long felt but unsolved needs, failure of others, etc., might be utilized to give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin of the subject matter sought to be patented. As indicia of obviousness or nonobviousness, these inquiries may have relevancy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 17-18, 86 S.Ct. at 694, 15 L.Ed.2d at 556. The standard of invention under the patent laws is a demanding one. Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 1969, 395 U.S. 653, 676, 89 S.Ct. 1902, 1914, 23 L.Ed.2d 610, 626. The Supreme Court has counselled that strict observance of the <em>Graham </em>three-pronged test for obviousness is required since the patent standard is bottomed on the Constitution. Anderson\u2019s-Black Rock, Inc. v. Pavement Salvage Co., 1969, 396 U.S. 57, 61-62, 90 S.Ct. 305, 308, 24 L.Ed.2d 258, 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-13\">A. Scope and Content of the Prior Art</p>\n<p id=\"Ah4n\">In Finding of Fact No. 42, the district court defined the scope of the prior art. \u201cA man of ordinary skill in the art would have been familiar with the properties and characteristics of thermoplastic materials and of fabrics at the time the alleged invention of the patent was made.\u201d We agree. Mizell\u2019s claim is not limited to a particular type of fabric or thermoplastic film.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-14\">The district court also found that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been familiar with all the patents cited by Goodrich and Hortex as more relevant to the Mizell claim than the references the Examiner relied upon.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Wil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>liamson-Dickie does not contest the finding that these patents were within the scope and content of the prior art. Rather they argue that these patents are no more relevant to the Mizell patent than the references cited and ultimately rejected by the Examiner. In fact they imply that the Patent Examiner may have considered these patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">B. Relationship Between the Mizell Patent and the Prior Art</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">We find no significant differences between the results achieved through the Mizell process and those achieved by the prior art references cited by Goodrich and Hortex. The Anderson, Redman, Kline, and Gillespie patents all teach application of heat and pressure to cause thermoplastic material to flow around the fibers of the fabric, effecting a substantially permanent bond.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Both Kline and Gillespie explicitly teach flow of the film on one side of the fabric only.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Redman and Gillespie claim that permeability results from their processes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">None of the references cited by Goodrich and Hortex give the same ranges of temperature, pressure, and time as appear in the Mizell claim. However, given the interrelationship between those factors, we find that the lack of precise specifications is immaterial. The general principle, as stated in Mizell\u2019s deposition testimony, is that the temperature, pressure, and time must be sufficient to cause the thermoplastic material to soften and imbed itself into the fabric. Yet the temperature cannot be so high as to scorch the fabric.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Both Redman and Kline explicitly refer to this principle.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-12\">Robert F. Johnson, the expert witness for the defendants below, testified that the Mizell process would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art prior to the filing date of the Mizell patent. The district court accepted that statement in Conclusion of Law Number 9. We believe the record amply supports the district judge\u2019s conclusion. Mizell\u2019s original application sought to patent the resulting article of manufacture as well as the process itself. The Patent Examiner consistently rejected the product claims, and eventually allowed the process claim. But the actual method for achieving Mizell\u2019s results would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-13\">Attorneys\u2019 Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-14\">Under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285, the court has discretion to award attorneys\u2019 fees to the prevailing party in exceptional cases. In this case, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>refused to hold that this was an exceptional ease within \u00a7 285, and did not award attorneys\u2019 fees. We, as an appellate court, cannot lightly overturn that decision. \u201cThe law placing, as it does, the discretion in the trial court to determine . . . whether the case is an exceptional one so that attorneys\u2019 fees should be allowed, appellate courts ought not to and will not interfere with the exercise of such discretion. Indeed, they may not do so unless there is such a clear abuse as to show that discretion was not exercised, or unless it is plain that the trial court\u2019s decision is based on an erroneous concept of law.\u201d Graham v. Jeoffroy Mfg., 5th Cir. 1958, 253 F.2d 72, 78 (Tuttle J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">It is our conclusion that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to award attorneys\u2019 fees. Our review of the record provides no indication that Williamson-Diekie has not proceeded in good faith in this litigation, or in its dealings with the Patent Office. Under these circumstances, the trial court properly refused to award attorneys\u2019 fees. Garrett Corp. v. American Flight Systems, Inc., 5th Cir. 1974, 502 F.2d 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1048-18\">. Goodrich has actually produced three types of Fabrilock film. They originally manufactured Fabrilock Red, a plastic film with a backing of release paper to keep the film from sticking to itself. Fabrilock Red was never distributed on a large scale basis as Fabrilock Blue quickly replaced it. Fabrilock Blue added a water soluble release coating between the film and the paper. Then in 1971 Goodrich marketed Fuzzy Fabrilock, which used a permanent backing of noil-woven fabric to avoid the excessive reduction in tear strength experienced with Fabrilock Red and Fabrilock Blue. Hortex never used Fabrilock Red, but did use the other two products. Williamson-Dickie claims that all three infringe upon the Mizell patent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1048-33\">. United States Patent No. 3,089,806, issued May 14, 1963.
