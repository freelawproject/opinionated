Plunkett initially filed charges of employment discrimination against Roadway with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1972. At Plunkett\u2019s request and in accordance with Commission regulations, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.25, the Commission on July 31, 1973, mailed him notice of his right to sue Roadway in federal district court. Plunkett received the notice by certified mail on August 3, 1973. He instituted this action on October 31, 1973, 92 days after the Commission sent notice and 89 days after he received it. The district court dismissed on the ground that the 90-day period in which a party must file suit under section 706(f) of Title VII, 42 U. S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f) (1), runs from the date on which the Commission mails notice of the right to sue and that Plunkett\u2019s action was not therefore timely filed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Section 706(f)(1), as amended in 1972, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">If the Commission has not entered into a conciliation agreement to which the person aggrieved is a party, the Commission shall so notify the person aggrieved and <em>within ninety days after the giving of such notice a civil action may be brought </em>against the respondent named in the charge .... (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Prior to the 1972 amendments of Title VII, section 706 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">If the Commission has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance with this title, <em>the Commission shall so notify the person aggrieved and a civil action may, within thirty days thereafter, be brought </em>against the respondent named in the charge .... 78 Stat. 259 (1964) (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">The Supreme Court twice construed the unamended statute to require the thirty-day period to begin to run from the date on which the Commission\u2019s notice is received. Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 47, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 39 L.Ed.2d 147; McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 798, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668. <em>See also </em>Archuleta v. Duffy\u2019s Inc., 10 Cir., 471 F.2d 33. The court below held that the 1972 amendment, besides lengthening to 90 days the period within which aggrieved persons may sue, also changed the date on which the period begins to the date of the Commission\u2019s mailing of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">The language of the 1972 amendment, however, in no way suggests or compels the conclusion that Congress intended to alter the time of commencement of the complaint-filing period as the Court construed it in <em>Alexander </em>and <em>McDonnell Douglas. </em>The language of the present statute to the effect that the period begins \u201cafter the giving of . notice\u201d does not clearly evidence Congress\u2019 intent to alter the effect of the superseded language of section 706; in this respect, notification and the giving of notice appear to be synonymous terms. The sole pertinent reference in the legislative history of the 1972 amendments confirms our conclusion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, we believe that measurement of the period from the date of the aggrieved person\u2019s receipt of notice serves the policy underlying the notice requirement better than measurement of the period from the Commission\u2019s mailing of notice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-16\">[T]he purpose of statutory notification, which is \u201cto provide a formal notification to the claimant that his administrative remedies with the Commission have been exhausted\u201d . and to inform him that the . period has begun to run, has not been accomplished unless the claimant is actually aware of the suit letter. Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 5 Cir., 495 F.2d 398, 404, quoting Beverly v. Loan Star Lead Construction Corp., 5 Cir., 437 F.2d 1136.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-17\">Plunkett was unaware of the Commission\u2019s suit letter until he received it; he cannot be said to have impermissibly slept on his rights so long as he filed, as he did, within 90 days of his receipt of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>the letter. <em>See </em>Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., <em>supra, </em>495 F.2d at 404. A contrary result would unnecessarily penalize private litigants for mistakes in delivery and other delays in the mail. We therefore hold that the period for filing private suits under'section 706 of Title VII runs from the aggrieved person\u2019s receipt of the Commission\u2019s letter of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-15\">. The district court dismissed on the additional ground that Plunkett\u2019s action was barred by the Commission\u2019s failure to find reasonable cause to believe that a violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>of Title VII occurred. In this appeal Roadway concedes that the Commission\u2019s finding of reasonable cause is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit brought under Title VII. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 798, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b482-13\">. The only \u25a0 reference to the date of commencement of the period for filing complaints appears in the section-by-section analysis accompanying the conference report on II.R. 1746: \u201c[T]he person aggrieved may bring an action in an appropriate district court <em>within 90 days after receiving notification.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Senate Committee on Labor &amp; Public Welfare, Legislative History of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 (II.R. 1746, P.L. 92-261), 92d Cong., 2d Sess., at 1847 (1972). The same analysis noted: \u201cIn any area where the new law does not address itself, or in any area where a specific contrary intention is not indicated, it was assumed that the present case law as developed by the courts would continue to govern the applicability and construction of Title VII.\u201d Id. at 1844.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
