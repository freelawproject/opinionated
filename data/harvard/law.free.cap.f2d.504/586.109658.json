Speth to recover' an alleged overpayment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>of estate tax and interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a bench trial, the district court entered judgment in favor of the taxpayer from which the Government has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">The decedent Josephine Speth died on March 28, 1966, at the age of 75. Her sister, Margaret Speth, had died one month earlier on February 21, 1966. By her will, Margaret bequeathed to the decedent a life estate in certain property. At the time of Margaret\u2019s death, Josephine was suffering from cancer of the colon with metastasis to the liver.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The taxpayer, in computing the federal estate tax on Josephine\u2019s estate, claimed a credit under \u00a7 2013 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for the amount of federal estate tax paid by the estate of Margaret on the life estate transferred to Josephine. In calculating the amount of this credit, the taxpayer used the actuarial tables set forth in \u00a7 20.2031-7(f) of the Treasury Regulations to value Josephine\u2019s life estate at the time of Margaret\u2019s death. The indicated table expectancy was approximately six years. The Commissioner disallowed the taxpayer\u2019s computation of the credit on the ground that, under Revenue Ruling 66-307, Josephine\u2019s actual life expectancy had to be utilized in determining the value of her life estate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The district court held, alternatively, that (1) the Revenue Ruling did not control this case, and (2) the Revenue Ruling was invalid. The Government contests both holdings on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b652-13\">Section 2013 of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted \u201cto prevent the diminution of an estate by the imposition of successive taxes on the same property within a brief period.\u201d Sen.Rep.No. 1622, 83rd Cong., 2dSess. 121 (1954), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, 1954, pp. 4629, 4755. The section provides for a credit against estate tax where the decedent has received property in a transfer during the previous ten years which transfer was itself subject to estate tax.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> With certain adjustments and limitations not relevant here, the tax credit is the amount which bears the same ratio to the total estate tax paid by the trans-feror as the value of the property transferred bears to the total value of the transferor\u2019s taxable estate. If the transferred property has no value, the credit will, therefore, be zero. The percentage of credit allowed to the transferee\u2019s estate decreases ratably over the ten-year period.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-14\">The credit applies to any beneficial interest in property received by the transferee. \u00a7 2013(e). Thus, the credit is available for a life estate held by the decedent-transferee, even though the life estate will not be included in his estate and, therefore, cannot itself be the subject of double taxation. See Treas.Reg. \u00a7\u00a7 20.2013-1(a) and 20.2013-5(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-17\">Section 2013(d) provides, in general, that \u201cthe value of property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>transferred to the decedent shall be the value used for the purpose of determining the Federal estate tax liability of the estate of the transferor\u201d subject to .certain adjustments not relevant here. The Code itself does not, however, set forth the manner for computing the value of a life estate in property transferred to the decedent when the property was taxed in the estate of the trans-feror. The Treasury Regulations state, <em>inter alia, </em>at \u00a7 20.2013-4(a), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">\u201cIf the decedent received a life estate or remainder or other limited interest in property included in the transfer- or\u2019s gross estate, the value of the interest is determined as of the date of the transferor\u2019s death on the basis of recognized valuation principles (see especially \u00a7\u00a7 20.2031-7 and 20.2031-10).\u201d \u00ab</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Section 20.2031-7 of the Regulations contains the mortality tables for valuing life estates.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">The Government admits that, as a general rule, the \u00a7 2013 credit on a life estate is to be calculated by finding the actuarial life expectancy, as determined by the tables in Treasury Regulation \u00a7 20.-2031-7, of the life tenant as of the transferor\u2019s death. The Government contends, however, that there is an exception to this general rule and this exception is embodied in Revenue Ruling 66-307.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">Revenue Ruling 66-307 <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is predicated upon a factual situation \u201cwhere it was <em>known </em>at the death of the transferor that the life tenant, afflicted with a ravaging and incurable disease of advanced state, <em>could not survive for more than a year.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In this situation, the Revenue Ruling directs that, for the purpose of calculating a \u00a7 2013 credit, the life tenant\u2019s actual life expectancy, rather than his actuarial life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>expectancy, as of the transferor\u2019s death, be used in valuing the life estate. The Revenue Ruling goes on to state that, as a general rule, such a departure from the mortality tables is proper, for the purpose of \u00a7 2013, \u201cif it is <em>known </em>on the valuation date that a life tenant is afflicted with a fatal and incurable disease in its advanced stages, <em>and </em>that he <em>cannot survive for more than a brief period of time.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The Government contends that this Revenue Ruling covers the present case and that, therefore, Josephine\u2019s actual life expectancy as of her sister\u2019s death should be used in valuing her life estate. The taxpayer, on the other hand, argues that Revenue Ruling 66-307 is invalid and, even if it is valid, it does not cover the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Forceful arguments have been made by both of the litigants with respect to the issue of the validity of the Revenue Ruling. We need not, however, resolve this matter in order to decide this case since, in our opinion, even assuming <em>ar-guendo </em>that the Revenue Ruling is valid, the present case falls outside the ruling.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">In reaching this conclusion, we are assuming that words used in the Revenue Ruling were employed precisely. Such an assumption is particularly warranted in the field of tax law where the decision is ordinarily determined by the&lt; language utilized and not necessarily by application of logical principles. We first note that the statement of the rule is in two-pronged form joined by the conjunctive \u201cand.\u201d Thus, we conclude that it is essential not only that it be known that the disease is fatal and incurable in an advanced stage but also that the life tenant cannot survive for more than a brief time. It is at this point that we find ourselves deserted insofar as further guidance is concerned. Outside of the particular fact situation the Ruling presents, we are not advised as to the meaning of \u201cbrief,\u201d or whether it is an absolute or relative term.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">The Government, in its brief, states that departure from the tables is proper if the actual life expectancy is \u201cconsiderably shorter\u201d or \u201cfar less\u201d than that predicted in the mortality tables. Under the Government\u2019s interpretation of \u201cbrief\u201d as a relative term, a person with a fatal, incurable disease in its advanced stages who had an actuarial life expectancy of 25 years but an actual life expectancy of 5 years would apparently have only a \u201cbrief\u201d life span and, therefore, departure from the tables would be proper. As an absolute, as opposed to a relative matter, two years might be deemed by some to be a \u201cbrief\u201d life span. Thus, some might consider that a failing nonagenarian whose life expectancy, according to the mortality tables, was approximately two years and who had an actual life expectancy of only slightly less than this actuarial expect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>ancy, had only a \u201cbrief\u201d life expectancy. Nevertheless, we doubt that the Government would contend, in this situation, that the \u201cbrief\u201d life expectancy (in absolute terms) should require departure from the actuarial tables.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Turning to source books such as Words and Phrases and Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, we find no definitions of \u201cbrief\u201d in the time sense.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Webster tells us that \u201cbrief\u201d in its duration meaning is synonymous with \u201cshort.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accepting that definition we construe the Revenue Ruling ' to be applicable only to a situation in which it is known that death will follow closely after a crucial date. Moreover, although a court might well wish to consider the actuarial life expectancy in determining whether the life tenant\u2019s actual life expectancy is \u201cbrief,\u201d we construe \u201cbrief,\u201d as used in the Revenue Ruling, to be essentially an absolute, not a relative, term. We are fortified in this interpretation by the prefatory synopsis of the Revenue Ruling which speaks in terms of \u201cwhere the death of a life tenant from known causes is predictable and imminent on the valuation date.\u201d \u201cImminent,\u201d in the time sense, appears unlike \u201cbrief\u201d to have been the subject of considerable judicial attention. 20 Words and Phrases 215 (1959). Without citing individual cases, it is clear that \u201cimminent\u201d refers to something which is threatening to happen at once, something close at hand, something to happen upon the instant, close although not yet touching, and on the point of happening. With this construction of the Revenue Ruling in mind, we turn to the evidence adduced in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">. According to the actuarial tables, Josephine\u2019s life expectancy, at the time of her sister\u2019s death, was six years. The medical evidence indicated, however, that, at that time, it was known that Josephine was suffering from cancer of the colon which had metastasized to the liver. There was no dispute over the fact that this was a fatal and incurable disease.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">The question of the decedent\u2019s actual life expectancy, due to this disease, however, was disputed at the trial. Dr. Myles Cunningham, a cancer expert presented by the taxpayer, testified that, at the time of Margaret\u2019s death,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Josephine did not have any of the clinical signs associated with liver metastasis which would indicate an imminent death. Absent such clinical signs of imminent death, a physician could not predict with reasonable certainty, according to Dr. Cunningham, how long a patient with liver metastasis would live. In particular, Dr. Cunningham noted, \u201cfor one pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>tient in the condition that Josephine Speth was in in January of 1966, I don\u2019t believe you can place a time span on her expected length of life.\u201d Dr. Cunningham further stated that there was a reasonable chance that Josephine could have lived a year or more after Margaret\u2019s death, that it was possible that she could have lived 18 months, and that, although it was unlikely, it was not impossible for her to live two years.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The doctor noted that he himself had \u201chad at least one case who has lived six years now with liver metastasis.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Dr. Samuel Taylor, a cancer expert presented by the Government, testified that he would have expected Josephine to live four to six months after February 21, 1966. Dr. Taylor admitted, however, that she possibly could have lived for a year. He further noted that \u201cin medicine you can\u2019t be too didactic, because someone always surprises you.\u201d Finally, Dr. Taylor agreed with Dr. Cunningham that spontaneous remission was a medical fact and could occur in any cancer patient prior to the emergence of clinical signs of imminent death.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The third doctor to testify, Dr. Kenneth Kettleson, was the decedent\u2019s physician. Dr. Kettleson was an internist but not a cancer expert. He stated that, in his opinion, Josephine\u2019s life expectancy at the time in question was between one and six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">All three physicians agreed that, on the basis of the autopsy report, cancer may not have been the actual cause of Josephine\u2019s death but rather that her death could have been caused by a heart attack or a blood clot in her lung.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\"> The district court found that the present case was distinguishable from the fact situation presented in the Revenue Ruling in that it was possible that, on February 21, 1966, Josephine could have lived for another year. Based on the testimony of Dr. Cunningham, we cannot say that this finding was clearly erroneous. Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P.; Commissioner v. Duberstein, 363 U.S. 278, 291, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218 (1960). To the extent that the doctors disagreed about Josephine\u2019s actual life expectancy on February 21, 1966, this was a question of credibility to be determined by the trial judge. Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 123, 89 S.Ct. 1562, 23 L.Ed.2d 129 (1969); Aunt Mid, Inc. v. Fjell-Oranje Lines, 458 F.2d 712, 716 (7th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 877, 93 S.Ct. 130, 34 L.Ed.2d 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">Moreover, we agree with the district court that the general rule which the Revenue Ruling purports to establish (i. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>e., that the taxpayer should use the actual life expectancy of the decedent where it is \u201cknown\u201d on the valuation date that the life tenant is afflicted with a fatal and incurable disease in its advanced stages, and that he cannot survive for more than a \u201cbrief\u201d period of time) does not cover this case. The testimony of the experts indicated that there was a range of longevity among patients with liver metastasis. According to Dr. Cunningham, this range could, for some patients, extend at least as far as six years. Where a particular patient fell within this range of longevity could not, according to Dr. Cunningham, be predicted, absent clinical signs of imminent death. In view of this testimony and the fact that the life expectancy predicted by the mortality tables for the decedent was itself six years, we cannot say that it was \u201cknown\u201d that Josephine\u2019s actual life expectancy was so \u201cbrief\u201d as to require a departure from the tables.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">In addition to the Revenue Ruling, the Government relies on a number of eases (most of which concern Code sections other than \u00a7 2013), in which departures from the actuarial tables have been permitted for the purpose of valuing life estates. The case before us is, however, readily distinguishable from these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">In the majority of these cases permitting departures from the tables, the life tenant\u2019s maximum actual life expectancy was one year or less. In Estate of Nellie H. Jennings, 10 T.C. 323 (1948), for instance, the Tax Court held that the life tenant\u2019s actual life expectancy should be used in valuing a charitable remainder where, at the time of the decedent-trans-feror\u2019s death, the life tenant was almost totally paralyzed, had a complete loss of memory and was described by his physician as \u201cjust an individual protoplasm.\u201d 10 T.C. at 327. The life tenant in <em>Jennings </em>had an actual life expectancy, according to the medical experts, of \u201cnot more than one year\u201d from the date of the transferor\u2019s death. 10 T.C. at 327. Similarly, in Estate of Nicholas M. Butler, 18 T.C. 914 (1952), also a charitable remainder case, a departure from the mortality tables was permitted to value a life estate where the life tenant had cancer and \u201c[t]he facts in existence at the time of [the transferor\u2019s] death were such as to render it <em>certain </em>that [the life tenant] would not live more than one year after [the transferor\u2019s] death.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 18 T.C. at 919-920.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">In Estate of Lion v. Commissioner, 438 F.2d 56 (4th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 870, 92 S.Ct. 52, 30 L.Ed.2d 114, the Fourth Circuit applied the actual life expectancy, rather than the actuarial life expectancy, of a life tenant in determining a \u00a7 2013 credit. <em>Lion, </em>however, involved a situation in which the transferor and the life tenant died simultaneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">The cases permitting the substitution of actual life expectancy for actuarial life expectancy are typically characterized as \u201cexceptional\u201d cases. Miami Beach First Nat\u2019l Bank v. United States, 443 F.2d 116, 120 (5th Cir. 1971); Estate of Lion v. United States, <em>supra </em>at 62; Estate of Carl E. Weller, 38 T.C. 790, 803 (1962). Absent \u201cexceptional\u201d circumstances, the actuarial tables should be used since these tables \u201cafford a reasonable norm and some degree of certainty in ascertaining the value of property and the consequent tax liabilities of the beneficiaries thereof.\u201d Miami Beach First Nat\u2019l Bank v. United States, <em>supra </em>at 119. See Simpson v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>United States, 252 U.S. 547, 550, 40 S.Ct. 367, 64 L.Ed. 709 (1920). Although the tables prove to be accurate when used in large numbers of cases, discrepancies are bound to occur in individual cases.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> But, as the First Circuit has noted, \u201cthe discrepancies may have to be suffered in the interest of a simplified overall administration of the tax laws.\u201d McMurtry v. Commissioner, 203 F.2d 659, 667 (1st Cir. 1953). Departures from the tables are permitted, if at all, only where the result of using the tables is \u201cunrealistic and unreasonable,\u201d Estate of Carl E. Weller, <em>supra </em>at 803; Estate of Chauncey Stillman, 24 T.C.M. 478, 497 (1965), or \u201cignore [s] common sense.\u201d Hall v. United States, 353 F.2d 500, 505 (7th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Moreover, although the taxpayer has the burden of showing the error in the Commissioner\u2019s determination, where the taxpayer proves that normally the actuarial tables provided in the Regulations would be applicable to his case, the burden is on the Government to show that the case is \u201cexceptional,\u201d justifying a modification of or departure from the prescribed method. Estate of Carl E. Weller, <em>supra </em>at 803; Estate of Chauncey Stillman, <em>supra </em>at 497; Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v. United States, 368 F.Supp. 743, 746 (D.Md.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The mere fact that the life tenant is suffering from an incurable and fatal disease is not necessarily sufficient to justify a departure from the actuarial tables. In <em>Estate of Chauncey Stillman, supra, </em>the taxpayer transferred a contingent remainder interest to a trust for the benefit of his daughters. In valuing the gift for gift tax purposes, the taxpayer determined the life expectancy of the life tenant by means of the actuarial tables provided in the Regulations. The Government contended, however, that the actual life expectancy of the life tenant should be used since the life tenant was afflicted, at the time of the gift, with multiple myeloma, a fatal and incurable type of cancer. The tax court noted the expert testimony that the disease, although fatal, was variable among patients and predictions as to individual longevity were therefore impossible. The court held in <em>Stillman </em>that departure from the tables would be improper in this situation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-10\">\u201c[The Commissioner] relies on the <em>Jennings </em>rule. Since the ultimate finding is that on the gift date, the life expectancy of the life tenant was indeterminate and could not be foretold, [the Commissioner\u2019s] method of valuation falls. On the evidence, this case is distinguishable from <em>Jennings </em>and the other cases in the <em>Jennings </em>group and the <em>Jennings </em>rule does not apply. ... In this instance, departure from the method of valuation prescribed in section 25.2512-5(e) is neither justified nor required. . [The Commissioner\u2019s] determination was little better than a guess which cannot be approved.\u201d 24 T.C.M. at 502-503. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">See also, Miami Beach First Nat\u2019l Bank v. United States, supra; Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">In the present case, the Government has failed to show that, assuming <em>ar-guendo </em>a departure from the prescribed actuarial tables may be proper in certain \u00a7 2013 cases, the circumstances here justify such a departure, from the prescribed method. Rather, as in Estate of Chauncey Stillman, <em>supra, </em>any determination of Josephine\u2019s actual life expectancy as of her sister\u2019s death would be \u201clittle better than a guess.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The phy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>sicians who. testified were candid in admitting their Sybyllic efforts of necessity lacked exactitude.

The taxpayer paid estate tax in the amount of $256,819.51. The District Director of the Internal Revenue Service assessed an estate tax deficiency in the amount of $33,950.52 plus interest.

Without examining all the estate tax sections, we are inclined to agree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b652-20\">. The Congressional rationale for permitting a credit for terminable interests was apparently that \u201cthe terminable interest may have produced income [presumably during the life tenant\u2019s life time] that might be taxable in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>the decedent\u2019s estate. Sen.Rep.No.1622, <em>supra </em>at 122. A second possible rationale, suggested by one commentator, is that possession of the life estate may enable the' life tenant to conserve other assets which otherwise lie would have expended, and which subsequently are included in his gross estate. Kirby, Proposed Estate Tax Regulations, 96 Trusts &amp; Estates 12 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b653-8\">. In determining a \u00a7 2013 credit, it is necessary to look at the dollar value of the property as it was taxed in the prior estate since the credit in the second estate is founded on the fact that the property was taxed \u25a0 at a specified dollar amount in the prior estate. However, unlike a fee simple interest in property, the value of a life estate is based not only on the value of the property on which the life estate is imposed but of necessity is also dependent upon the extent of the period of enjoyment. Some conceptual difficulties might arise as to the rationale for utilization, in \u00a7 2013, of the predictive process as to the number of years the life tenant will live since in the case of the life estate, \u00a7 2013 comes into play only after the \u2022transferee-life tenant has died, when the extent of enjoyment is a known fact. This is not a situation in which the life expectancy of a transferee-life tenant must be predicted in order to calculate the estate taxes of the <em>transferor (e. g., </em>the charitable remainder cases). Nor is it a case in which the \u201ctaxable event\u201d clearly occurred at a particular date prior to the transferee\u2019s death and the transaction, for valuation purposes, \u201cclosed\u201d as of that earlier date (e. <em>g., </em>a transfer for full and adequate consideration : see United States v. Righter, 400 F.2d 344 (8th Cir. 1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-15\">According to the Senate Report, \u201c[t]o eliminate the tracing [of the transferred property] the credit is based upon the value of the property at the time of the death of the prior decedent.\u201d Sen.Rep.No.1622, <em>supra </em>at 121, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1954, p. 4755. Under \u00a7 812 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, the transferee was permitted a deduction from the gross estate for taxes paid by the transferor and the amount of the deduction was computed by tracing the transferred property in the hands of the transferee.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-16\">Regardless of the rationale, it is clear that in valuing a \u00a7 2013 credit on a life estate, the value is to be determined as of the date of the transferor\u2019s death and that the valuation process is not aided by the hindsight provided by the actuality of duration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"adp-dedup-1\">.

Tlie decision of this court in Hall v. United States, 353 F.2d 500 (7th Cir. 1965), is not controlling with respect to the issue of the validity of the Revenue Ruling. In <em>Sail, </em>this court held that for the purpose of \u00a7 2037(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (pertaining to reversionary interests), taxpayers are not required to use the actuarial tables in all cases. Section 2037(b) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">\u2018\u2018The value of the reversionary interest . . . shall be determined ... by usual methods of valuation, <em>including </em>the use of tables of mortality and actuarial principles, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aqx-dedup-0\">The wording of \u00a7 2037 was construed in <em>Sail </em>to mean that the use of the actuarial tables was not mandatory. In the present case, however, neither the Code section nor the Regulation involved contains language similar to that involved in <em>Sail.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-14\">Ignoring any dilemmatic impaling aspects arguably present, the Government in its brief, while citing <em>Sail </em>to support its position, states that the Commissioner does not agree with the result reached by this court in <em>Sail, </em>as \u201cCongress obviously contemplated the use of mortality tables to determine life expectancy under Section 2037.\u201d The Government does not deem this obviousness to be present in Section 2013. In <em>Sail, </em>the use of the mortality tables would have been to the detriment of the taxpayer; in the present case, the converse is, of course, true.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b655-6\">.

Although it apparently played no part in the district court\u2019s decision, and we have given it no weight in our decision, a fact, of which the reading public cannot be unmindful, is that a lively discussion and considerable controversy has developed from the ability of modern medical science, by various sophisticated devices, to keep life in existence or \u201cvital functions [continuing! long after a patient\u2019s awareness has departed.\u201d William 1).

The Government contends that the district court\u2019s decision suggests that to be able to depart from the actuarial tables, it is necessary to be able to predict the exact day upon which the decedent would die.

The point is that in this ease, as in <em>Stillman, </em>there was a range of longevity and there was no certainty where a particular patient would fall within this range, thereby rendering any determination of actual life expectancy uncertain.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
