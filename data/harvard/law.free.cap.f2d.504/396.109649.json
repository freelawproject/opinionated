Since the actions originated as prisoners\u2019 <em>pro se </em>claims for relief, counsel was appointed and directed to focus primarily on the common issue presented, namely, a parole applicant\u2019s right to learn the reasons for the denial of his parole. Each of the petitioners before us, at the time of filing his asserted cause of action in the District Court for the District of Kansas, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>confined in the United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Kansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Although in view of our resolution of this matter we deem it unnecessary to recite in detail the various <em>pro se </em>claims and charges made, bases of jurisdiction asserted, and forms of relief demanded, \u201cthe thrust of each petition,\u201d as agreed by the government, \u201cwas that the petitioner was eligible for parole, yet had been denied parole\u201d without having been given a statement of reasons therefor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In each case, the District Court declined all types of relief sought, including a statement of reasons for denial of parole, and dismissed the actions on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The appellants rely on a duality of arguments. It is first contended, citing United States ex rel. Johnson v. Chairman, Board of Parole, 500 F.2d 925 (2nd Cir. 1974), that the failure to give reasons constitutes a constitutional offense, a denial of due process. With respect to the process that is due in this situation, we agree with the opinion of the court in King v. United States, 492 F.2d 1337, 1343 (7th Cir. 1974) that \u201ca substantial argument can be made that some modicum of due process should attend the denial of the expectation of conditional freedom on parole inasmuch as its termination after having been granted inflicts a \u2018grievous loss\u2019 of a \u2018valuable liberty,\u2019 \u201d Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 482, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). But the appellants present, as well, a statutory argument, that the refusal to give reasons constitutes a violation of the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551-559 (hereinafter the \u201cAct\u201d). In accordance with well established principles we will proceed first to a resolution of the statutory issue, construing the prisoners\u2019 <em>pro se </em>petitions with respect thereto as actions in the nature of mandamus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">We note at the outset of our statutory exploration that we are not plowing new ground, prior exhaustive examination having been had by the Seventh Circuit in King v. United States, <em>supra,. </em>It was there held that the Parole Board <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was an \u201cagency\u201d within the meaning of the Act, since it is an \u201cauthority of the Government of the United States\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and is not otherwise excepted from the operation of the Act. It was further held that the action of the Parole Board came within the requirements of \u00a7 6(d) of the Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 555(e), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">Prompt notice shall be given of the denial in whole or in part of a <em>written application, </em>petition, or other request of an interested person made in connection with any agency proceeding. Except in affirming a prior denial or when the denial is self-explanatory, the notice shall be accompanied by <em>a brief statement of the grounds for denial. </em>[emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">We agree with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s reading of the act. The term \u201cagency proceeding,\u201d above employed, is defined as an agency process comprehending rule making, licensing and adjudica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>tions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the latter being an \u201cagency process for the formulation of an order.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In view of the fact that an order \u201cmeans the whole or a part of a final disposition * * * in a matter other than rule making * * <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it seems clear, that the decision whether to grant a prisoner parole is an adjudication\u201d within the meaning of the Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">We reject the Board\u2019s argument, based on Hyser v. Reed, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 254, 318 F.2d 225, 236-237 (en banc), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 957, 84 S.Ct. 446, 11 L.Ed.2d 315 (1963), that the parole decision is not an \u201cadjudication.\u201d There the court was confronted with convicts whose parole had been revoked and who claimed \u201c[i]n essence . . . they [were] entitled to a revocation hearing before the Board\u201d at which certain procedural rights should be granted. <em>Id. </em>at 233. The court held that no hearing was required under the Act since the procedures in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 554, 556-557 apply in terms only \u201cto agencies which are required by their own statute of creation to adjudicate, after hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237 (emphasis omitted). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 6(d), on the contrary, applies to \u201cany agency proceeding, whether or not formal or upon hearing.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is to be noted that \u00a7 6(d) requires only a \u201cbrief statement of the grounds of denial\u201d \u201cas contrasted with the more elaborate findings which are customarily issued to support an order,\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>e. g. </em>the requirements of 5 U. S.C. \u00a7 557(c) relating to decisions after a full hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-16\">This \u201cseldom heeded\u201d section,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we hold, is applicable to the situation presented and governs the action of the Parole Board. Not only is such the plain import of the text, as discussed above,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but the result, also, is clearly consonant with the purposes of the Act and the purposes of the parole system. The framers of the Act were determined to bring the \u201cfourth branch\u201d of government \u2014 the administrative agencies\u2014 within the rule of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-18\">[The Act] is a bill of rights for the thousands of Americans whose affairs are controlled or regulated in one way or another by agencies of the Federal Government. It is designed to provide guaranties of due process in administrative procedure.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-19\">Whether or not the parole decision is subject to external review, the requirement that the Board give a brief statement of reasons for the denial of parole is certain to improve the quality and fairness of the decision. To require the decision-maker to articulate his reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>focuses in him an awareness that his discretion must be exercised in a principled and consistent way. A statement of reasons may promote, as well, the rehabilitative goals of the parole system, since informing the prisoner of the reasons for denying his parole is an obvious first step toward enabling him to conform his institutional conduct to proper standards, should such issue be before the Board. Finally, we note, paraphrasing the Court in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 484, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972), that society has a further interest in treating the potential parolee with basic fairness: fair treatment in parole denials will enhance the chance of rehabilitation by avoiding reactions to arbitrariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Such seem to be among the considerations which lie behind the Board\u2019s newly promulgated regulations.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Under this comprehensive revision of the Board\u2019s procedures, \u201c[e]ach inmate is permitted to have a representative to assist him at his parole hearing, parole decisions are accompanied by written reasons, and a two level administrative appeal process is provided.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> These new procedures, now in effect in the Northeast Region,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> are, we are told, to be applied in other regions as personnel and staff become available, estimated to be in the fall of 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">We do not, we point out, purport to control discretion. What is required is the \u201cbrief statement\u201d prescribed by the Act. Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s orders of dismissal are reversed and the cases remanded for a determination of the threshold requirement for the application of \u00a7 6(d) of the Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 555(e), whether or not a written application was made and, if so, for further proceedings consistent herewith.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">With respect to Mr. Sigler\u2019s representations as to the deleterious impact a decision requiring a statement of reasons would have on the imminent implementation of the Board\u2019s new rules, we are satisfied that the District Court will provide in whatever Order it deems appropriate that no undue burden is placed upon the Board, consistent herewith. In view of the large number of parole applications made annually to a Board of limited staff and the lack of any indication in the record of bad faith in the interpretation and administration of the applicable law and regulations, however, our decision will not be applied retroactively; see Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 573, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 490, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-11\">.
