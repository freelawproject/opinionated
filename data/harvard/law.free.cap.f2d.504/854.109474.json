The dicta from United States v. Jorn, which is the foundation of the dissent,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> does not encompass the extraordinary circumstances of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>present case, in which judicial error alone, rather than defendant\u2019s exercise of any option to stop or go forward, took away his \u201cvalued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b918-17\">. 492 F.2d 53 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b918-18\">. \u201cIf that right to go to a particular tribunal is valued, it is because, independent of the threat of bad-faith conduct by judge or prosecutor, the defendant has a significant interest in the decision whether or not to take the case from the jury when circumstances occur which might be thought to warrant a declaration of mistrial. Thus, where circumstances develop not attributable to prosecutorial or judicial overreaching, a motion by the defendant for mistrial is ordinarily assumed to remove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>any barrier to reprosecution, even if the defendant\u2019s motion is necessitated by pros-ecutorial or judicial error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AY2\">400 U.S. 470, 485, 91 S.Ct. 547, 557, 27 L.Ed.2d 543, 556 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b919-4\">GEWIN, BELL, THORNBERRY, COLEMAN, AINSWORTH, RONEY and GEE, Circuit Judges</author>\n<p id=\"alf-dedup-0\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">We respectfully dissent for the reasons stated in the dissent filed to the panel opinion. United States v. Dinitz, 5 Cir. 1974, 492 F.2d 53, 61 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">We also note that the panel opinion in United States v. Walden, 4 Cir. 1971, 448 F.2d 925, relied upon in the original majority opinion in this case, was superseded on rehearing en banc. United States v. Walden, 4 Cir. 1972, 458 F.2d 36 (affirming district court on double jeopardy question by an equally divided court).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
