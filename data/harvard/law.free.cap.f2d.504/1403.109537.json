The microphones and receivers were classified by Customs under item 684.70, TSUS, as \u201cmicrophones\u201d; the coils were classified under item 682.60, TSUS, as \u201cinductors.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1468-10\">The relevant statutory provisions are:</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-11\"><em>Schedule 6. </em>\u2014 Metals <em>and Metal Products</em></p>\n<p id=\"awt-dedup-0\">Part 5.

So shall we.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-15\">\n<em>The Microphones</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-16\">The Customs Court held that appellants failed to show that the imports invoiced as microphones were not \u201cmicrophones\u201d within the ambit of item 684.70. Appellants concede that the imported goods are commonly known in the trade as \u201cmicrophones\u201d and that item 684.70 is an <em>eo nomine </em>provision for microphones. The Customs Court found that the primary function of the goods at bar is conversion of acoustical energy into electrical energy, fitting the technical definition of \u201cmicrophones.\u201d These findings clearly conform to the weight of the evidence and we accept them. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. United States, 61 CCPA \u2014, C.A.D. 1131, 499 F.2d 1283 (1974). Appellants contend, however, that item 684.70 is not a specific provision for the microphones at bar and thus General Interpretative Rule 10(ij) does not require classification of these microphones under the <em>eo nomine </em>provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-19\"> In the absence of contrary legislative intent, an <em>eo nomine </em>provision for an article includes all forms of the article. Nootka Packing Co. v. United States, 22 CCPA 464, T.D. 47464 (1935). Appellants have not demonstrated that the term \u201cmicrophones\u201d in item 684.70 was not intended by Congress to include the merchandise at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-20\">Appellants agree with the Customs Court that there is minimal direct legislative history to indicate what Congress intended the breadth of item 684.-70 to be and suggest that heading 85.14 to the <em>Brussels Nomenclature </em><footnotemark>3</footnotemark> fills the gap, alleging that the scheme adopted by Congress is similar thereto. Even were there some basis to conclude that Congress enacted the <em>substance </em>of the Tariff Schedules with this heading to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1406\">*1406</page-number>Brussels Nomenclature in mind,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we do not consider heading 85.14 to be evidence of intent clear enough to require classification of these microphones outside the <em>eo nomine </em>provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-4\">Appellants argue in the alternative that \u201cparts of hearing aids\u201d is a designation more specific to the merchandise at bar than \u201cmicrophones\u201d and that accordingly the rule of relative specificity<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> requires classification as parts of hearing aids. We disagree, Item 709.50 includes parts of electrical hearing aids unnamed in item 684.70, such as the case and the power supply; the legislative history of the item shows it is also intended to cover ear trumpets and .other won-electrical hearing aids.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The term \u201cmicrophone\u201d on the other hand pertains only to electrical devices which convert acoustical energy into electrical energy. This is not a case like C. J. Tower &amp; Sons v. United States, 44 CCPA 41, C.A.D. 634 (1957), where the tariff term was shown not to include everything falling within its literal scope. We there rejected the argument that all corn is \u201ccorn,\u201d in light, inter alia, of prior administrative construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-5\">We conclude that the Customs Court properly read the term \u201cmicrophones\u201d in accordance with its meaning in the trade, see Brown Boveri Corp. v. United States, 53 CCPA 19, C.A.D. 870 (1966), and agree that appellants did not overcome the presumption of correctness attaching to the Government\u2019s <em>classification.\u2019</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1470-12\">\n<em>The Coils</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-13\">The Customs Court opinion observes :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1470-14\">In short, the evidence does preponderantly establish that the imported coils are manufactured to exacting design specifications; that the imported coils are not made to any specific level of inductance; that the inductance of the coil is secondary to the design considerations, and that the imported coils are dealt with in the trade as \u201ccoils\u201d rather than as \u201cinductors\u201d. The sum of that evidence, however, is not sufficiently relevant to overcome the presumption that the coils, in the manner of their use and application in miniature magnetic transducers, are inductors within the common meaning of the term. To the contrary, as I suggested earlier, the evidence of how the coils function in transducers tends to support the classification of these imported coils as inductors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1470-15\">Plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses testified to the use and function of the imported coils in miniature magnetic transducers and flatly opined that the imported coils were not inductors. But their opinions, as mentioned earlier, were preponderantly based on facts too inconclusive to establish that the coils were not inductors in the common meaning of the tariff term. The lack of concern for the property of inductance in the coils, constantly adverted to in the testimony, in my opinion, is quite immaterial since the inductance native in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1407\">*1407</page-number>the coils is not established to be insufficient for application in miniature magnetic transducers. Plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses also testified that the function of the coils involved a process of induction which they said was not inductance. Such testimony, in my opinion, does no more than suggest a possible distinction which, for all that is said, may be a distinction without a difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1471-5\">One of plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses testified that the induction process he described was different from inductance as defined by McGraw-Hill, for the reason there was no current creating the magnetic field. (R.90.) Weighing the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses on cross-examination, however, it is apparent that while they were inclined to equivocate, they were unable to deny that the imported coils have the property of inductance and that the manner in which the imported coils function in miniature magnetic transducers is a process of induction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1471-6\">\u2022X- # -X- * *x- \u25a0\u00bb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1471-7\">Thus, notwithstanding plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses were of the opinion that the coils were not inductors, their explanation of the function of the coils in miniature magnetic transducers strongly supports that the coils do function to assist in the conversion of energy by inductance. The classification of the coils as inductors is presumed to include each and every fact necessary to support the classification, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. United States, 27 CCPA 146, 149, C.A.D. 75 (1939), and the explanation of the function of the coils appears to involve electromagnetic induction which, as discussed in the McGrawHill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, Vol. 7, at 69, is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1471-8\">The production of an electromotive force either by motion of a conductor through a magnetic field in such a manner as to cut across the magnetic flux or by a change in the magnetic flux that threads a conductor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1471-9\">The customs classification is further supported by the opinion of defendant\u2019s witness, who testified that the coils are inductors and explained in fuller detail than did plaintffs\u2019 witnesses the manner in which the coils function as inductors in miniature magnetic transducers to produce an electromotive force. [Footnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1471-10\">We find appellants\u2019 explanation of the difference between \u201cinduction\u201d and \u201cinductance\u201d in the context of the function of the coils in transducers no more convincing than did the the Customs Court, which had the parties\u2019 witnesses before it and was in a better position than we are, on the appellate level, to assess their credibility. Based on our consideration of the conflicting testimony and exhibits, the oral arguments, and the briefs, we conclude that the findings of the Customs Court reproduced supra are amply supported by the evidence. We agree that evidence the coils were not <em>designed </em>with inductance in mind, when rebutted by evidence the coils actually <em>function </em>by the process of induction when used in transducers, does not prove that the coils are not \u201cinductors\u201d for tariff purposes. It was also well within the province of the Customs Court as the trier of fact to accept the testimony of the Government\u2019s witness, an employee of a large manufacturer of these coils, that the coils function as inductors in transducers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-11\">The judgment of the Customs Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1468-27\">.

Appellants consider the Government\u2019s admission that the receivers (output transducers) are classifiable under item 709.50 strong evidence that the microphones, which are similar in structure to the receivers, should be classified likewise. There is argument, but no evidence of record, concerning the Government\u2019s motives in conceding the protest as to the receivers. In the absence of explanatory evidence, the Customs Court saw no reason to give the Government\u2019s admission any weight with respect to the classification of the microphones, nor do we.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
