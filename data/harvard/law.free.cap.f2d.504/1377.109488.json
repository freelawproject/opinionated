The accident occurred on a siding of the railroad owned by the ASARC. With the reasonableness of the amount paid agreed upon, the only issue was the question of the defendant\u2019s joint or concurrent negligence. The District Court, trying the action on a jury-waiver, found the defendant guilty thereof and assessed it with one-half of the damages. This apportionment derived from the railroad\u2019s and ASARC\u2019s outstanding contract to bear equally any liability resulting from \u201cthe joint or concurring negligence of both parties hereto\u201d while on or about the sidetracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-12\">Perceiving that the findings of the District Court are not clearly erroneous and observing no errors of law at trial, we affirm on the District Judge\u2019s opinion. Canton Railroad Company v. American Smelting and Refining Company, Inc., 384 F.Supp. 1181 (D.Md.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
