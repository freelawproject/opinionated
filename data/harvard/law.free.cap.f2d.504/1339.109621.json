Since the facts are set forth in the district court opinion, 369 F.Supp. 232, 233-234 (E.D.Pa.1973), only the facts most pertinent to the issues now before the court are recited here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-22\">Movant, Jose Juan Soto, was indicted for aiding and abetting a sale of heroin in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4704, 4705 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When his case was called for trial at 2:30 P.M. on June 1, 1972, Soto\u2019s appointed attorneys <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> asked leave to withdraw as counsel on grounds that movant had \u201cbecome displeased with [their] representation.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (N.T. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>2). In presenting their motion to the court, counsel identified two bases for Soto\u2019s dissatisfaction. First, he had \u201cexpressed . . . the feeling that they were not raising every constitutional claim which [they] might perhaps raise on his behalf.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (N.T. 2-3). Second, Soto had expressed resentment of, and resistance to, counsel\u2019s requirement that movant telephone them once a day to determine whether his case had been called for trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After counsel had argued their motion, the court engaged in a colloquy with Soto which revealed that he had made no arrangements to retain another attorney. 369 F.Supp. at 234, N.T. 3-9. The court thereupon denied counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, stating that a substitution of attorneys would be allowed in the event that Soto did obtain other counsel. Soto participated freely in the colloquy, volunteering that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for him to leave his truck and be in court on a moment\u2019s notice. 369 F.Supp. at 239 n. 13. He offered no grounds for dissatisfaction other than those already advanced by counsel, though the court appeared willing to hear any and all reasons for such dissatisfaction. Having ruled on the motion to withdraw, the court immediately proceeded to allow Soto\u2019s waiver of jury trial, \u201cpartly . . . because [Soto] indicated that [he] want[ed] to get this over with\u201d and was inconvenienced by having the matter continued longer. Upon Soto\u2019s affirmative response to the court\u2019s inquiry whether \u201cyou want me to start right now; is that correct,\u201d the case proceeded to trial. (N.T. 12). Testimony was heard until 7:30 P.M. on June 1, 1972, and resumed at 9:30 A.M. on June 2, 1972, to accommodate the trial court\u2019s calendar.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A verdict of guilty was announced by the court on June 2, 1972, and movant\u2019s sentence was affirmed on appeal, sub nom. United States v. Santiago, 474 F.2d 1337 (3d Cir. 1972), cert. denied, Soto v. United States, 411 U.S. 907, 93 S.Ct. 1535, 36 L.Ed.2d 197 (1973). Soto then filed this motion under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-15\">The crux of the \u00a7 2255 motion is that the trial court, by failing to advise appellant of his right to proceed pro se, deprived him of that right, thereby committing a <em>\u201cper se </em>reversible error.\u201d Ancillary to this claim is appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court abused its discretion in denying appointed counsel leave to withdraw without either ascertaining from appellant the reasons for his dissatisfaction with counsel or granting, <em>sua sponte, </em>a continuance so that appellant could obtain substitute counsel or prepare his own defense. We reject all these contentions and affirm the district court order of November 15, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-17\">At the outset, we must determine whether jurisdiction lies under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to adjudicate appellant\u2019s claim that he was denied the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>proceed pro se. In the recent case of Davis v. United States, 417 U.S. 333, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (U.S., 1974), the Supreme Court held that a \u00a7 2255 proceeding was not limited to the resolution of constitutional claims, but was the proper vehicle for a prisoner to assert that his confinement was invalid due to a change in the law of the circuit. The Court noted that \u201cthe grounds for relief under \u00a7 2255 are equivalent to those encompassed by 2254, the general federal habeas corpus statute, under which relief is available on the ground that \u2018a person is in custody ... in violation of the Constitution <em>or laws </em>or treaties of the United States.\u2019 (Emphasis added).\u201d 417 U.S. at 344, 94 S.Ct. at 2304, citing United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. [205] at 219, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1952). In sum, the remedy of \u00a7 2255 \u201cis intended to be as broad as habeas corpus.\u201d 417 U.S. at 344, 94 S.Ct. at 2304. The Government\u2019s position, that \u201cthe petitioner\u2019s claim [was] not \u2018of constitutional dimension\u2019 and thus [was] not cognizable in a \u00a7 2255 collateral proceeding,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 342, 94 S.Ct. at 2303,</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-7\">was emphatically rejected as inconsistent with the clear words of the statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 343-345, 94 S.Ct. 2298.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-8\">Although the courts of appeals disagree over whether the right to represent oneself is constitutionally guaranteed, \u201cthere is no dispute that it is a fundamental right.\u201d 369 F.Supp. at 235. The right, embodied in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was set forth in the Judiciary Act of 1789 and has been consistently honored by the federal courts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, even though we decide that there is no constitutional requirement that an accused be permitted to proceed pro se, see Part II, <em>infra, </em>the statutory right is sufficient to afford jurisdiction under the holding of <em>Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1406-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-10\">After careful consideration, we reject movant\u2019s contention that the Constitution guarantees a defendant the right to proceed pro se. <em>See </em>United States v. Dougherty, 154 U.S.App.D.C. 76, 473 F.2d 1113, 1121 (1972); Brown v. United States, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 77, 264 F.2d 363, 365 n. 2 (1959) <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>The Sixth Amendment provides that the accused in all criminal prosecutions \u201cshall enjoy the right ... to have the assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d In interpreting this language, the Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed that it is \u201can obvious truth\u201d that a fair trial cannot be assured unless a defendant has counsel. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 344, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963). <em>See </em>Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25, 36-37, 92 S.Ct. 2006, 32 L.Ed.2d 530 (1972); In Re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 462-463, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938); Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 68-69, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932). The central importance of competent legal counsel to the conduct of a fair trial has led the Court to require assistance of counsel at all \u201ccritical stages\u201d in the trial process. <em>See, e. g., </em>Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 26 L.Ed.2d 387 (1970); Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U.S. 128, 88 S.Ct. 254, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967); Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.S. 736, 68 S.Ct. 1252, 92 L.Ed. 1690 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-5\">By contrast, the right to pro se representation is only tangentially related to procuring a fair trial. The primary basis of the right \u201cderives from the belief that respect for human dignity is best served by respect for individual freedom of choice.\u201d 369 F.Supp. at 235-236. <em>See also </em>United States v. Dougherty, 154 U.S.App.D.C. 76, 473 F.2d 1113, 1128 (1972).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Pro se representation may. at times serve the ideal of a fair trial better than representation by an attorney. Also, the individual\u2019s freedom of choice and stake in the conduct of his own trial should, on occasion, prevail over society\u2019s generalized interest in the trial process. <em>See </em>Comment, <em>supra </em>note 11, at 1479, 1481. Nevertheless, the right is one that is typically not essential to a fair trial, and, indeed, is generally an obstacle thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-10\">The deficiencies of pro se representation as a means of protecting \u201cthe integrity of the process,\u201d Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, 400 U.S. 455, 468, 91 S.Ct. 499, 27 L.Ed.2d 532 (1971), Burger, C. J\u201e concurring, prompted the American Bar Association to recommend that the trial judge \u201cconsider the appointment of standby counsel to assist the defendant when called upon and to call the court\u2019s attention to matters favorable to the accused upon which the court should rule on its own motion.\u201d A.B.A. Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to the Judge\u2019s Role in Dealing with Trial Disruptions, 11-12 (1971).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Such appointment of standby counsel was also recommended by Chief Justice Burger as a means of accommodating both the accused\u2019s desire to rep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>resent himself and the public interest in the fairness of criminal trials. <em>Mayberry, supra </em>at 468, 91 S.Ct. 499. The vital role of counsel in protecting the rights of the accused, which is \u201ca matter of public interest even if the accused has rejected professional assistance,\u201d A.B.A. Project, <em>supra </em>at 12, leads us to reject Soto\u2019s contention that the Sixth Amendment guarantees pro se representation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1408-4\">Since the right, though important, is only statutory, we conclude that it is waived if not asserted.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Dougherty, supra, </em>Adams, J., concurring, 473 F.2d at 1145; cases cited <em>supra </em>note 15; Williams v. United States, 389 F.2d 34 (2d Cir. 1967); 59 Calif.L.Rev. 1479, 1483 (1971). The trial judge is under no duty to advise any defendant that he may represent himself. Brown v. United States, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 77, 264 F.2d 363, 365-366 (1959). This conclusion obviates any need to reach the question of prejudice. We therefore hold that the trial court committed no error in failing to suggest pro se representation as an alternative to the appointed counsel with whom Soto expressed displeasure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-9\">Movant also contends that it was error for the trial court to deny appointed counsel leave to withdraw without first asking Soto the reasons for his dissatisfaction with their representation. As the district court noted, Soto did not raise the issue of his dissatisfaction with counsel. Although he engaged in a colloquy with the court in which he amplified counsel\u2019s statement that he resented checking with them daily to determine the time for trial, Soto never offered any reasons for dissatisfaction in addition to those expressed by counsel. The record clearly indicates both that Soto could have raised such additional objections and that he was not reluctant to express his views to the trial court. <em>See </em>N.T. 3-9. On this record, we affirm the district court\u2019s holding that the obligation of the trial judge \u201cto explore the sources of a defendant\u2019s dissatisfaction with counsel\u201d was dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>charged. 369 F.Supp. at 239. <em>See also </em>United States v. Young, 482 F.2d 993 (5th Cir. 1973); United States v. Morrissey, 461 F.2d 666 (2d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-5\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-6\">Finally, we consider Soto\u2019s claim that his expression of dissatisfaction with appointed counsel obligated the trial court to declare, <em>sua sponte, </em>a continuance to enable Soto to obtain other counsel or to prepare his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-7\">Counsel described a slow deterioration in their relation with Soto that culminated in their motion for leave to withdraw. A week before the case was called for trial, Soto had complained about their conduct of his case to Puerto Rican fraternal and social agencies. <em>See </em>note 7, <em>supra. </em>Yet, by the day of trial, Soto had made \u201cno arrangements\u201d to procure other counsel, though he had ample time to do so. McGill v. United States, 121 U.S.App.D.C. 179, 348 F.2d 791 (1965); <em>cf. </em>United States v. McMann, 386 F.2d 611 (2d Cir. 1967). Moreover, there are strong indications in the record that Soto would have opposed a continuance. He had, for example, expressed great resentment over the inconvenience caused by holding himself available to go to trial on short notice. N.T. 5. He waived a jury and requested that his trial proceed immediately after the court\u2019s ruling on counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, apparently because he was eager to conclude the matter. N.T. 12. Thus, Soto not only failed to request a continuance, he also encouraged expediting the trial. These facts do not suggest that the trial court abused its considerable discretion in refusing to discharge counsel and proceeding directly to trial. United States v. Price, 474 F.2d 1223, 1226 (9th Cir. 1973); United States ex rel. Maldonado v. Denno, 348 F.2d 12, 16 (2d Cir. 1965); Juelich v. United States, 342 F.2d 29, 32, and cases cited n. 5 (5th Cir. 1965). Soto suggests that the district court improperly required that \u201cgood cause\u201d be shown before a defendant is entitled to substitution of counsel. Although such a requirement might not be necessary in all circumstances, it certainly appears proper where, as here, no request for either substitute counsel or a continuance was made and no objection to counsel was expressed to the court prior to the day the trial started.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1409-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court, denying Soto\u2019s motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1404-8\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1404-9\">\u201cA prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States . . . may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside, or correct the sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1404-11\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1404-12\">\u201c(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to purchase, sell, dispense, or distribute narcotic drugs except in the original stamped package or from the original stamped package . . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1404-13\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4705 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1404-14\">\u201c(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to sell ... or give away narcotic drugs except in pursuance of a written order of the person to whom such article is sold . . . or given, on a form to be issued . by the Secretary . . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1404-23\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1404-24\">\u201c(a) Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as principal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1404-25\">\u201c(b) Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the United States, is punishable as a principal.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1404-26\">.

But see </em>Comment, <em>id. </em>at 1488-89.

A second basis is the need for confidence in the attorney-client relation. United States v. Dougherty, 154 U.S.App.D.C. 76, 473 F.2d 1113, 1128 (1972) ; United States ex rel. Maldonado v.

The Commentary to Standard C.3 (\u201cStandby counsel for defendant representing himself\u201d) includes this language (p. 12) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqs-dedup-0\">\u201cEven if the defendant is permitted to represent himself at the trial, in all but the simj)lest trials \u2014 and perhaps even in those if resources permit \u2014 it will be prudent for the trial judge to arrange for standby counsel to be present at all times. . . . [T]he presence of such counsel . . . may also serve to protect the rights of the accused, a matter of public interest even if the accused has rejected professional assistance. The experience of those judges who have appointed standby counsel is that the <em>pro se </em>defendant often discovers, early in the trial, the value of counsel and will consent to being represented by the standby.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1408-5\">. We are not alone in finding that a constitutional right to proceed pro se and a constitutional right to counsel are incompatible. The Ninth Circuit, which recognizes both rights, recently acknowledged that \u201cit is manifest that any such two constitutional rights cannot actively co-exist.\u201d United States v. Dujanovich, 486 F.2d 182, 185 (1973). Because of the basic conflict between the two rights, especially given the standard for waiver of counsel, VonMoltke v. Gillies, 332 U.S. 708, 723-724, 68 S.Ct. 316, 92 L.Ed. 309 (1948), both the Second and Ninth Circuits have devised guidelines for trial judges who would otherwise be put in the position of laying \u201can appeal or a collateral attack by either a denial or a granting of the request\u201d to proceed pro se. <em>Id. </em>486 F.2d at 184. <em>See also </em>Meeks v. Craven, 482 F.2d 465, 467 (9th Cir. 1973) ; United States ex rel. Maldonado v. Denno, 348 F.2d 12, 15-16 (2d Cir. 1965). For a graphic illustration of the difficulties posed by positing both rights as constitutional, see United States v. Rosenthal, 470 F.2d 837, 844-845 (2d Cir. 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1408-6\">. Even had we found the right to be constitutional, it would not follow that a defendant must be advised of it. See 369 F.Supp. at 236-238. <em>Cf. </em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973), holding that the police need not advise that consent to a search may be withheld. The Court pointed out that \u201c[ajlmost without exception, the requirement of a knowing and intelligent waiver has been applied only to those rights which the Constitution guarantees to a criminal defendant in order to preserve a fair trial.\u201d 412 U.S. at 237, 93 S.Ct. at 2053. Since the value promoted by pro se representation is primarily one of free choice, rather than the conduct of a trial fair to the defendant, see <em>Dougherty, supra, </em>473 F.2d at 1128, the knowing waiver standard would not apply under <em>Sohneekloth. </em>It is true that <em>Plattner, supra, </em>recognized a subsidiary, trial-related function of the pro se right in recognizing that defense by counsel in whom defendant has no confidence may be less effective than lay defense, but in light of the reasoning of the right to counsel cases (see page 1343 above), this function may be of doubtful importance. <em>See also </em>369 F.Supp. at 235 n. 7. <em>But see </em>Comment, note 11, <em>supra </em>at 1481, 1489.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1409-8\">. Soto does not contend that his reluctance to cooperate with appointed counsel, motion for leave to withdraw, par. 8, constituted t\u2019..e \u201cgood cause\u201d sufficient to require a substitution of counsel. We note that both United States v. Pomeroy, 485 F.2d 272 (9th Cir. 1973), and United States v. Young, 482 F.2d 993 (5th Cir. 1973), suggest that'such \u201cgood cause\u201d requires the existence of an \u201cirreconcilable conflict.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
