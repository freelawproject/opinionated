Richardson carried two old acquaintances as passengers: Clarence Louis Fritz, riding in the back seat, and Ralph Joseph Anderson in the front passenger seat. After the police officers turned on their flashing light and honked at Richardson\u2019s car, but before Richardson brought it to a halt, the back seat passenger turned around and looked at the patrol car, then turned back to the front and leaned forward as if handing something to the driver. Suspicious of this movement, when Richardson\u2019s car stopped, the arresting officers asked all three occupants to get out of the car and identify themselves. While one of the officers examined the identifications produced, the other noticed a bag beneath the front seat on the floor of Richardson\u2019s car, with a pipe or gun barrel protruding about two inches through a hole and in plain view. The officer seized the bag, detecting immediately that it contained a weapon; opening the bag, he discovered a sawed-off shotgun. The weapon was found to be loaded, and upon frisking Anderson, Fritz and Richardson, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>officers located another live cartridge in Fritz\u2019 jacket pocket. All three were arrested for possession of the sawed-off shotgun, placed in the back seat of the police patrol car, and advised of their rights under <em>Miranda. </em>Nevertheless, after a brief colloquy with his two associates, Richardson inquired of his captors : \u201cWhat would happen if any one of us claimed it [the gun], takes the rap?\u201d This appeal arises out of a jury\u2019s response to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Anderson, Fritz and Richardson were charged in a two-count indictment with knowingly and unlawfully possessing an unregistered shotgun in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5845(a), 5861(b) (Count I), and with knowingly and unlawfully possessing a firearm which was unidentified by a serial number in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5842, 5861(i) (Count II). Anderson pleaded guilty to both counts, and drew concurrent three-year sentences. After a joint jury trial at which Anderson, Fritz and Richardson all testified, Fritz and Richardson were convicted on Count I and acquitted on Count II. Fritz was sentenced to three years\u2019 confinement; Richardson to five. Richardson brings this appeal, contesting the sufficiency of the evidence of his possession of the illegal weapon; contending that the trial court committed reversible error in not properly instructing the jury regarding evidence of Anderson\u2019s guilty plea; and challenging the trial court\u2019s jury instruction on reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b423-15\"> The Government attempted to prove \u2014 and the jury evidently concluded \u2014that Richardson was in constructive, though not actual, possession of the sawed-off shotgun.

Such possession need not be exclusive, but may be shared with others, and is susceptible of proof by circumstantial as well as direct evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-17\">Garza v.

Transcript at 88, 103. Moreover, although the bag containing the weapon was evidently brought into the car by Anderson, back seat passenger Fritz\u2014 who had appeared to hand something to Richardson after the police presence had been detected \u2014 was found to be carrying a shotgun cartridge. <em>Glasser </em>does not,' of course, require or permit us to rubber-stamp every jury conviction, and does not permit the synthesis of facts from mere hypothesis. But the evidence here fully justified the jury in concluding that the gun was not foisted upon Richardson by his old acquaintances, or that he was unaware of its presence. We cannot conclude that \u201ca reasonably minded jury\u201d aware of these facts and apprised of Richardson\u2019s inquiry about the effect of any one of the defendants\u2019 admitting sole possession <em>\u201cmust </em>have a reasonable doubt\u201d of Richardson\u2019s shared dominion and control over the illegal weapon. United States v. Stephenson, 5 Cir. 1973, 474 F.2d 1353.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In identifying Anderson as a witness at Fritz\u2019 and Richardson\u2019s trial, the trial court made Anderson\u2019s guilty plea known to the jury. Richardson argues here that, having so informed the jury, the trial court committed reversible error by failing to charge the jury that Anderson\u2019s guilty plea could not be considered as evidence of Richardson\u2019s guilt. Since Richardson failed to request such a cautionary instruction at trial, however, we review the lower court\u2019s action only for evidence of plain error. F.R.Crim.P. 30, 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">Our cases reflect a deep sensitivity to the possibilities of prejudice caused by allowing a jury in a criminal case to consider evidence of a co-defendant\u2019s guilty plea.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, we observed in United States v. Baete, 5 Cir. 1969, 414 F.2d 782, 783-784,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-11\">that there may be aggravated circumstances in which [even] the strongest corrective instruction would be insufficient, as, for example, where the guilty plea of one codefendant necessarily implicates another or others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ahe-dedup-0\">In United States v. Harrell, 5 Cir. 1970, 436 F.2d 606, 613-617, we found plain error, and reversed a jury conviction despite the absence of objection at trial, when the jury was needlessly exposed to evidence of a coeonspirator\u2019s guilty plea, \u201cbecause there [were] present the \u2018aggravated circumstances\u2019 alluded to in <em>Baete, </em>[arid] because of the failure of the trial judge to give any sort of cautionary instruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">In the ease at bar, however, we are not faced with such \u201caggravated circumstances.\u201d Richardson did not deny the unlawful presence of the weapon in his car. Rather, he admitted the weapon\u2019s introduction into the car by Anderson \u2014 that is, Anderson\u2019s guilt \u2014 but sought to disconnect Anderson\u2019s actions and responsibility for the weapon from himself.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, the very able trial court adequately instructed the jury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>it could not base a guilty verdict as to Richardson solely on Anderson\u2019s possession, but that it had to determine beyond a reasonable doubt the fact of Richardson\u2019s own intentional and knowing possession. If there was error at all in failing to caution the jury precisely as Richardson now suggests, it was not plain error. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Davis, 5 Cir. 1973, 487 F.2d 112, cert. denied, 415 U.S. 981, 94 S.Ct. 1573, 39 L.Ed.2d 878; United States v. Franicevich, 5 Cir. 1972, 465 F.2d 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Richardson\u2019s third specification of error relates to the trial court\u2019s jury instruction on reasonable doubt, which provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-6\">Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is established if the evidence is such that you would be willing to rely and act upon it in the most important of your own personal affairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Richardson contends that this portion of the charge should have been in terms of \u201cyou would not hestitate\u201d instead of \u201cyou would be willing.\u201d Since there was no objection to the charge at trial, Richardson must demonstrate plain error to succeed on this appeal. F.R.Crim.P. 30, 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"A2C\">The Supreme Court has clearly stated its judgment,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the Courts of Appeals which have found themselves directly confronted with these alternative phrasings of the reasonable doubt instruction have generally been consistent in emphasizing,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that the form of instruction contended for by Richardson here is the fairer and better of the two. Those courts have nevertheless been equally unanimous in holding that use of the \u201cwould be willing\u201d form objected to here does not constitute plain error, a result with which we find ourselves obliged to conform at this time in light of the correctness of the remainder of the trial court\u2019s charge on reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That conclusion should not be taken as any encouragement to the district courts to employ the \u201cwould be willing\u201d form however. We join the plea echoed by our sister circuits that the district courts henceforth employ the \u201cwould not hesitate\u201d language in their reasonable doubt instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">The judgment appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b425-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-6\">.
