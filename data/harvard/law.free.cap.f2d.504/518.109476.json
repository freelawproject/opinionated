FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b590-20\">This case involves three separate claims for damages arising out of a complicated series of transactions between four corporations and a number of their executive officers. The trial lasted three weeks and the record is correspondingly lengthy and complex. We begin by briefly summarizing the critical facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-21\">A. <em>Joint Venture Agreement Between UCC and LYC.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-22\">University Computing Company (UCC), a Texas corporation, and Lykes-Youngstown Corp. (LYC), a Delaware corporation, entered into a written agreement on July 1, 1969 to create jointly a new corporation, to be called Lykes-University Computing Company (Lykes/UCC), which was to offer com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>puter services<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the southeastern United States. This enterprise was a new venture for LYC, which is a large diversified holding company active in insurance, shipping and other manufacturing enterprises. UCC was active in other parts of the country, particularly in the southwest, offering essentially the same services as Lykes/UCC was to offer. The joint venture was designed to open new markets for the sale of UCC\u2019s computer systems.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">As part of their agreement and pursuant to it, UCC funded early operations of the new corporation, including payrolls, equipment purchases and other expenses. These expenditures totalled $66,647.45.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Several UCC employees were hired by the new corporation, including defendant Oliver Shinn who became President of Lykes/UCC.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The joint venture agreement provided UCC was to sell computer \u201chardware\u201d (i. e., computer equipment) and \u201csoftware\u201d to the new corporation. UCC was further to receive 10% of the gross disbursements of the new corporation for the first year for \u201cmanagement services.\u201d LYC agreed to have its various controlled subsidiaries (with the exception of Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co.) purchase computer services from the new corporation. The agreement did not set forth in any greater detail the manner in which the corporation was to be managed, or by whom.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The new corporation, Lykes/UCC, was chartered in Delaware, and its articles of incorporation provided for a Board of Directors to be composed of four individuals, who then had the option of electing a fifth. This was pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreement which provided that UCC and LYC would each select two members of the Board of Directors of Lykes/UCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">By October, 1969, before either party had contributed capital and before stock had been issued, the two original members of the joint venture came to disagree over the day-to-day management of Lykes/UCC. The original intent of the parties is now in dispute, with UCC pointing to the fee for \u201cmanagement services\u201d and other terms of the contract as evidence that it was intended to make operational management decisions, while LYC points to the terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>the contract, provisions of the Delaware Corporation Act and other extrinsic evidence to support its claim that the new corporation was to be wholly independent.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The parties aired their disagreements at a meeting held on September 30, 1969. The outcome of this meeting is now also in dispute. LYC claims UCC agreed to make a final decision, prior to October 7, about remaining in the joint venture and that in a telephone conversation on October 6 both sides agreed to terminate the joint venture. UCC claims the matter was left open at the meeting and thereafter, and that while both sides understood UCC would likely wish to withdraw, the terms of that withdrawal and the amount of compensation for initial expenditures and loss of prospective profits were left unsettled.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">On October 7, 1969, a fourth corporation, Lykes-Youngstown Computer Services Corp. (LYCSC) was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of LYC. Oliver Shinn became President of this corporation; all property formerly owned by Lykes/UCC was taken over by LYCSC, and the new subsidiary of LYC proceeded to enter into the business planned for Lykes/UCC. UCC' had no part in the decision to create this fourth corporation, and UCC now claims it wasn\u2019.t aware of the existence of LYCSC until a story on it appeared in the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>on October 14, 1969. It is undisputed that UCC did not authorize the creation of the new corporation, nor did UCC authorize the seizure of all Lykes/UCC\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">While a draft of a rescission and termination agreement was prepared by UCC following the October 6 telephone conversation, and a copy was sent to LYC for its consideration, it is undisputed that the terms of UCC\u2019s withdrawal were unsettled and the parties remained in substantial disagreement over the amount of compensation UCC was to receive. The draft agreement was not signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">During the period between July 1 and September 30, while the disagreement over the management of Lykes/UCC was developing, Oliver Shinn met twice with executive officers of LYC. UCC claims to have been unaware that these meetings were taking place. In any event, it is undisputed that UCC certainly was unaware of the matters discussed at these meetings. Among these topics discussed were the desirability of Lykes/UCC being independent of UCC and LYC, the burden of paying the 10% management fee owed UCC under the joint venture agreement, and the fact that Shinn was confident the UCC name was unlikely to further sales efforts in the southeast where UCC was virtually unknown. Although one of the meetings Shinn had with LYC executives took place when he was still a Vice President of UCC, Shinn made it clear at the beginning of the meeting that he was there solely on. his own behalf, and he felt no loyalty to his employer, UCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">In preparation for the September 30 meeting between UCC and LYC, Shinn prepared a report which he made available only to LYC on a confidential basis. In that report Shinn demonstrated that for $688,000 LYC could fund, a wholly owned subsidiary which would have substantially the same chances for success as the joint venture corporation, to which LYC had committed $500,000 for only half ownership. These secret meetings and the confidential Shinn memo were the primary evidence of LYC bad faith in terminating the joint venture agreement introduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">B. <em>Misappropriation of - AIMES III By LYCSC.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">Among the computer systems Lykes/UCC was to market was a retail inventory control system owned by UCC called \u201cAIMES III.\u201d (Automated Inventory Management Evaluation System). This system was designed to maintain information on inventory in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>retail department stores.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> UCC had previously sold the system to Leonard\u2019s Department Store in Fort Worth, Texas, subject to a restrictive use agreement which limited Leonard\u2019s to private and confidential use of the system. Leonard\u2019s paid $41,700 for the rights to restricted use of AIMES III. Lykes/UCC was to offer this system, as well as several others designed and owned by UCC, to customers in the southeast. The joint venture agreement provided for discount sales of these systems to Lykes/UCC at no more than 20% of UCC\u2019s development costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Following the incorporation of LYCSC (the newly created subsidiary of LYC), the new corporation proceeded to offer AIMES III to customers. Rather than purchase unrestricted rights to the system from UCC, LYCSC elected to steal the system from Leonard\u2019s. In December, 1969, LYCSC bribed an employee of Leonard\u2019s for $2500 to deliver a suitcase filled with computer tapes and other materials to an employee of LYCSC. In February, 1970, this same Leonard\u2019s employee was paid to fly to Atlanta from Dallas with additional tapes and documents once the materials originally obtained were found to be insufficient to run the system. With the new materials and the help of the Leonard\u2019s employee in installing the system in the LYCSC' in-house computer, LYCSC was able to run the system in its entirety.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">After receiving these materials in December, LYCSC attempted to market the AIMES III system. This marketing effort continued until April of the following year. Salesmen for LYCSC made offers to department stores in Atlanta, New Orleans and Tampa, Florida. In addition the system was offered to another computer services firm in Atlanta. While none of these offers was accepted, in several cases detailed sales presentations were made by sales representatives of LYCSC. A brochure was printed by LYCSC to assist the sales effort.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">C. <em>Judgment in District Court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">UCC brought this suit against LYC, LYCSC and Oliver Shinn claiming damages under seven Counts. Counts 1 and 2 were combined at trial into a single count against LYC for breach of the joint venture agreement. Count 3 charged a conspiracy among the three defendants to misappropriate UCC\u2019s trade secret, AIMES III; Count 4 charged a conspiracy among the three defendants to convert unlawfully AIMES III; Count 5 charged a conspiracy among the three defendants to infringe UCC\u2019s common law copyright in AIMES III; Count 6 charged a conspiracy among the three defendants to vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>late Oliver Shinn\u2019s non-competition agreement with UCC; and finally Count 7 charged a conspiracy among the three defendants to induce a breach of the restrictive use agreement between Leonard\u2019s and UCC. Plaintiff conceded at trial Counts 3, 4, 5 and 7 all involved essentially the same damages for the misappropriation of the AIMES III system.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The district court granted a directed verdict for defendants on Counts 5 and 7. The remaining counts went to the jury, which returned verdicts against the plaintiff on Counts 4 and 6, against defendant LYC on Count 1 and against all three defendants on Count 3. The jury awarded $172,000 against LYC for its breach of the joint venture agreement (Counts 1 and 2); $220,000 against all three defendants for misappropriation of UCC\u2019s trade secret, AIMES III (Count 3); and finally the jury awarded $100,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees against LYC on Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Defendants bring this appeal attacking these verdicts on a number of different grounds. Plaintiff cross-appeals the directed verdict on Count 7, and the verdicts on Counts 4 and 6. We affirm the judgment of the court below on the jury verdict on Count 1 against defendant LYC, and on Count 3 against defendants LYC, LYCSC and Oliver Shinn. We affirm judgment on the jury verdict on Counts 4 and 6 against plaintiff UCC and affirm the directed verdict against plaintiff UCC on Count 7. We reverse and remand for a new trial on the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">II. BREACH OF THE JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT BY LYC.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">A. <em>Enforceability of the Joint Venture Agreement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">The jury found that LYC breached its July 1 joint venture agreement with UCC by unilaterally terminating the joint venture corporation and appropriating the property and assets of the joint venture corporation for its own use. The defendant first challenges the validity of the July 1 agreement which it was found to have breached. LYC and UCC subsequent to July 1 were unable to agree as to how the agreement allocated management control. UCC claimed the right to make day-to-day operational decisions about such matters as employment, equipment acquisitions, and the like, while LYC claimed Lykes/UCC was intended to be independent of both the members of the joint venture and its President, Oliver Shinn, was to have a free hand in managing the new corporation. LYC\u2019s argument is that to the extent the joint venture agreement failed to settle this important question it was deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-15\">Under Georgia law <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> when the parties fail to agree on some element of a contract which affects the operation of the agreement in some extensive and important way, such a defect cannot subsequently be cured, and the contract is void for indefiniteness. We believe the testimony presented a jury question as to whether the parties agreed over operational control, and whether their July agreement can be so construed. The question whether there was a meeting of the minds of the two parties is essentially a factual one, and this would determine whether the agreement was enforceable. The problem here really is not that the parties had failed to consider and agree on some vital element of the contract, rather it is the parties\u2019 dispute as to what their original agreement was.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-16\">The record amply supports the jury finding that the contract was enforceable. The written agreement\u2019s references to accounting and management services might on its face be ambiguous,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but there was sufficient pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>rol evidence for the terms to be understood by the jury as indicating the parties\u2019 intent that UCC exercise day-to-day operational supervision over the affairs of the new corporation. Further, the conduct of Oliver Shinn subsequent to his taking the position of President of Lykes/UCC supports this jury finding. Shinn used normal UCC procedures and accounting forms in requesting authorization for purchases, and sought UCC approval of his hiring guidelines. These actions are inconsistent with LYC's claim that he had always been meant to function independently of UCC. Until shortly before the ultimate rift between the parties, when he did in fact begin to act independently \u2014 thereby necessitating the September 30 meeting \u2014 Shinn performed essentially as a subordinate of UCC\u2019s President of the Data Link Division, Karl Young. Young was asked to approve all expenditures, down to so trivial an expenditure as moving expenses for a particular employee of Lykes/UCC. There was sufficient evidence that this pattern of conduct was what the parties intended that the jury could conclude the contract was complete and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">While LYC executives vigorously denied that they had ever agreed to this at trial, UCC executives just as vigor-</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">ously testified that they had. On this type of factual dispute, concerning primarily the credibility of the witnesses, we are bound by the jury\u2019s findings. Boeing Co. v. Shipman, 411 F.2d 365 (5th Cir. 1969) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">The defendant next argues that if the UCC view of its asserted authority under the joint venture agreement to make operational decisions is accepted as being what the parties intended, the contract is nonetheless void under Delaware law as an illegal delegation of managerial authority.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We believe Delaware law is inapplicable to the type of delegation of authority involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">Title 8 of the Delaware Corporation Law, \u00a7 141(a) provides that the \u201cbusiness and affairs of every corporation organized under this chapter shall be managed by a board of directors ..\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There is substantial case law limiting the power of a board of directors to delegate this ultimate authority<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and in any case where a lawful delegation of managerial authority is made, such a delegation must be made through the Certificate of Incorporation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> No such express provision was made in the Certificate of Incorporation of Lykes/UCC, nor was Lykes/UCC incorporated as a closely held corporation which under Delaware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>law<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> is permitted greater flexibility in delegating the authority of the board of directors than are all other corporations. We recognize that under Delaware law a board of directors cannot be ousted from ultimate managerial responsibility, but we do not believe that was what was agreed to here.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Rather, in our view, the joint venture agreement was intended to permit the board of directors of Lykes/UCC the type of ultimate decision-making responsibility called for by the Delaware Corporation Law, but intended day-to-day decisions normally left to the executive officers of a corporation to be left to UCC. Karl Young, at the time of the joint venture President of UCC\u2019s Data Link Division, testified at trial that the relationship of the President of Lykes/UCC to UCC was to be that of a Vice President of a data link region\u2014 with line responsibility for some decisions, but ultimately under the authority of the President of the Data Link Division. Young testified that \u201cthere was two levels of management involved here\u201d distinguishing the type of authority the board of directors was to have from the type of authority UCC was to have:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">\u201c . . . one level of management which I refer to as the day-to-day management, would be directed to data-link and to me. . . . Obviously there is another level of management. . . . And this is the Board level which is a far-reaching and investors\u2019 type of participation and concern. The Board would meet occasionally or rarely, maybe two, three times a year. And they would be concerned with whether or not we acquired another company or whether or not we made some great investment or far-reaching type of thing. <em>if</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">It seems clear to us that UCC was demanding something less than complete managerial control.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">Surely no one disputes the fact that executive officers who manage a corporation possess managerial authority which in one sense is delegated by the board of directors, but which no one would claim was affected by the rule against complete abrogation of board of directors\u2019 responsibility. Similarly here, while in one sense UCC\u2019s responsibility for making operational decisions is a delegation of authority by the board of directors, we do not believe that Delaware restrictions on delegation of ultimate managerial responsibility are applicable to the authority UCC claimed under the joint venture agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-14\">B. <em>Challenges to Jury\u2019s Finding LYC Breached the Joint Venture Agreement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-15\">We conclude that there was more than adequate evidence for the jury to find that LYC breached the joint venture agreement with UCC. LYC could be found to have done this by unilaterally terminating Lykes/UCC, the joint venture corporation, and substituting in its place LYCSC, a wholly owned subsidiary which thereupon seized all the assets of Lykes/UCC and entered into the business planned for the joint venture. LYC\u2019s defense came down to its claim that UCC unilaterally withdrew from the venture after orally rescinding the agreement over the telephone. The pivotal conversation in LYC\u2019s account of events leading up to the dissolution of Lykes/UCC was one between Frank Nemec, then President of LYC, and Karl Young, then President of the Data Link Division of UCC, on October 6. Both men testified at trial, and both recounted substantially different accounts of the conversation \u2014 Nemec testifying that Young unconditionally withdraw on behalf of UCC, and Young denying any statement indicating UCC\u2019s intention to withdraw until the terms of withdrawal could be negotiated. This factual contro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>versy clearly comes down to the credibility of the two witnesses. We find no reason to upset the jury\u2019s finding that Young did not withdraw from the venture and that UCC\u2019s intention to withdraw was conditioned upon the two sides coming to terms over the amount of compensation UCC was to receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The evidence the jury received was conflicting, In addition to the direct conflict between Nemec\u2019s and Young\u2019s versions of the October 6 telephone conversation, there were a number of documents which each side used to support its claim. The documentary evidence was ambiguous, and thus while we don\u2019t find any of the evidence offered conclusive on this question, we are satisfied that the jury\u2019s decision that UCC did not unilaterally withdraw is permissible in light of all the evidence, and that in unilaterally terminating the joint venture on October 7 LYC breached its agreement with UCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">C. <em>Damages for Breach of the Joint Venture Agreement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">We finally come to the question of damages. In attacking the verdict of $172,000, LYC claims that there was no substantial evidence to support UCC\u2019s claim that in breaching the joint venture agreement LYC appropriated assets and business opportunities belonging to the joint venture without UCC\u2019s knowledge or consent. In part this raises again the question of mutual termination of the agreement which we have previously discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">We note there can be no doubt that LYCSC, LYC\u2019s subsidiary, appropriated the joint venture\u2019s property and business. In our view, once the jury found LYC breached the agreement with UCC, it was wholly justified in assessing damages in addition to the $66,647.45 which UCC had expended on behalf of LYKES/UCC before LYC\u2019s breach.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> At trial UCC proved a variety of damages, including loss of the 10% management fee to October 1, 1970; loss of the 5% management fee for the period thereafter; loss of profits on sales and leases of hardware to Lykes/UCC as provided in the agreement; and finally loss of the opportunity to begin operations in the southeast with the guaranteed flow of revenues from the Lykes subsidiaries obliged to purchase computer services from the new corporation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Together, the amount of damages subject to proof at trial on Count 1 totalled well in excess of two million dollars. We find the jury verdict of $172,000 was supported by the record.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-13\">III. MISAPPROPRIATION OF UCC\u2019S TRADE SECRET, AIMES III, BY LYC, LYCSC, AND OLIVER SHINN.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-14\">The defendants admit that LYCSC paid one Ron Clinton, an employee of Leonard\u2019s Department Store in Fort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Worth, Texas, $2500 to induce him to steal Leonard\u2019s copy of the AIMES III system and deliver the tapes and documents comprising that system to an LYCSC employee. The defendants do not now claim that this conduct was lawful or even defensible.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The defendants do not challenge the finding of the jury that they acted in concert. If the jury finding of misappropriation of AIMES III is thus upheld, all three defendants properly share liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">A. <em>Legal Standards on Protection of Trade Secrets</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">A trade secret is protected against illegal appropriation and commercial use by a competitor. The development of this area of the law has been progressive, and most jurisdictions have developed similar standards.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> What Georgia law exists in this area seems to follow the Restatement, Torts \u00a7 757.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We so held in Water Services, Inc. v. Tesco Chemicals, Inc., 410 F.2d 163 (5th Cir. 1969).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Under the Restatement \u00a7 757 formulation, a trade secret is defined as:<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">\u201cAny formula, pattern, device or compilation of information which is used on one\u2019s business and which gives him an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-15\">In large measure the requirements simply are that \u201cthe parties view the process or device as a secret and that the secret be revealed in confidence . . . \u201d <em>Water Services, supra, </em>410 F.2d at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-17\">Liability attaches under the Restatement if one \u201cwho discloses or uses another\u2019s trade secrets without a privilege to do so .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-18\">(a) . . . discovered the secret by improper means</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-20\">or (b) his disclosure or use constitutes a breach of confidence reposed in him by the (owner of the secret) in disclosing the secret to him,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"arj-dedup-0\">or (c) he learned from a third person with notice of the. facts that it was a secret and that the third person\u2019s disclosure of it was otherwise a breach of his- duty to the (owner of the secret) . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-21\">Unlike a patent which is totally protected for the period of time for which it is granted, the protection afforded a trade secret is limited \u2014 for it is protected only so long as competitors fail to duplicate it by legitimate, independent research. <em>Water Services, supra</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-22\">While the defendants in this action have deprecated the value of AIMES III<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and made an effort at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>trial to challenge its uniqueness, they do not appeal the finding of the jury that AIMES III was a trade secret within the meaning of the \u00a7 757. Certainly it was undisputed that UCC viewed the system as a valuable and unique property, and used great caution in attempting to preserve its confidentiality. LYCSC itself described the system to one potential customer as \u201c. . . the finest automated merchandising system available today,\u201d and proceeded to offer it to that customer for $45,000. Evidence was adduced at trial that AIMES III had unique capabilities and features which make it a valuable competitive product.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The jury could properly find that the AIMES III computer system owned by UCC was a trade secret. The jury further could find that LYCSC\u2019s appropriation of the system was unlawful and a knowing violation of Leonard\u2019s restrictive use agreement with UCC. The requirements for liability under \u00a7 757 were satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Once having determined that the jury finding that AIMES III was a trade secret wrongfully appropriated by the defendants was proper, the problem remains as to what is the appropriate measure of damages. It seems generally accepted that \u201cthe proper measure of damages in the case of a trade secret appropriation is to be determined by refer-</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">ence to the analogous line of cases involving patent infringement, just as patent infringement cases are used by analogy to determine the damages for copyright infringement.\u201d International Industries, Inc. v. Warren Petroleum Corp., 248 F.2d 696, 699 (3d Cir. 1957). The case law is thus plentiful, but the standard for measuring damages which emerges is very flexible.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">In some instances courts have attempted to measure the loss suffered by the plaintiff. While as a conceptual matter this seems to be a proper approach, in most cases the defendant has utilized the secret to his advantage with no obvious effect on the plaintiff save for the relative differences in their subsequent competitive positions. Largely as a result of this practical dilemma, normally the value of the secret to the plaintiff is an appropriate measure of damages only when the defendant has in some way destroyed the value of the secret. The most obvious way this is done is through publication, so that no secret remains.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Where the plaintiff retains the use of the secret, as here, and where there has been no effective disclosure of the secret through publication<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the total value of the secret to the plaintiff is an inappropriate measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Further, unless some specific injury to the plaintiff can be established \u2014such as lost sales \u2014 the loss to the plaintiff is not a particularly helpful approach in assessing damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">' [23] The second approach is to measure the value of the secret to the defendant. This is usually the accepted approach where the secret has not been destroyed and where the plaintiff is unable to prove specific injury. In the case before us, then, the \u201cappropriate measure of damages, by analogy to patent infringement, is not what plaintiff lost, but rather the benefits, profits, or advantages gained by the defendant in the use of the trade secret.\u201d International Industries, Inc. v. Warren Petroleum, <em>supra, </em>248 F.2d at 699. The cases reveal, however, many variations in the way this benefit to the defendant can be measured.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Normally only the defendant\u2019s actual profits can be used as a measure of damages in cases where profits can be proved, and the defendant is normally not assessed damages on wholly speculative expectations of profits. Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp., 309 U.S. 390, 60 S.Ct. 681, 84 L.Ed. 825 (1939). Had the defendants here been able to sell the AIMES III system at a profit, our task would be simplified.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Because the defendants failed in their marketing efforts, no actual profits exist by which to value the worth to the defendants of what they misappropriated. However, the Supreme Court has held in a patent case that the lack of actual profits does not insulate the defendants from being obliged to pay for what they have wrongfully obtained in the mistaken belief their theft would benefit them. In re Cawood Patent, 94 U.S. 695, 24 L.Ed. 238 (1877).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">The rationale for this seems clearly to be that the risk of defendants\u2019 venture; using the misappropriated secret, should not be placed on the injured plaintiff, but rather the defendants must bear the risk of failure themselves. Accordingly the law looks to the time at which the misappropriation occurred to determine what the value of the misappropriated secret would be to a defendant who believes he can utilize it to his advantage, provided he does in fact put the idea to a commercial use.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">This second technique frequently entails using what is called the \u201creasonable royalty\u201d standard: while the parties to this action agree this is the appropriate standard, they are unable to agree on what the measure entails. Originally this measure was intended to deal with the situation where the misappropriated idea is used either to improve the defendant\u2019s manufacturing process, or is used as part of a larger manufactured product. In the early case of Egry Register Co. v. Standard Register Co., 23 F.2d 438 (6th Cir. 1928), a patent in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>fringement case, the defendant manufactured and sold cash registers which in part used a device developed by the plaintiff to roll paper through the machine. The trial court had awarded the plaintiff the total profits the defendant had made on all sales of the machines using this device. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held this measure of damages was inequitable, because the device was only a part of the larger product sold by the defendant. Because no actual apportionment of profits based on what percentage of the success of the marketing of the machines was due to the plaintiff\u2019s device could be shown, the court held the proper measure of damages would be a reasonable royalty on defendant\u2019s sales, thereby creating an apportionment of profits based on an approximation of the actual value of the infringed device to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">The Court explained its new measure in this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">\u201cTo adopt a reasonable royalty as the measure of damages is to adopt and interpret, as well as may be, the fiction that a license was to be granted at the time of beginning the infringement, and then to determine what the license price should have been. In effect, the court assumes the existence <em>ab initio </em>of, and declares the equitable terms of, a supposititious license, and does this <em>nunc pro tunc; </em>it creates and applies retrospectively a compulsory license. . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">The Court further held the proper standard would be a willing buyer-willing seller test: \u201c . . . the primary inquiry ... is what the parties would have agreed upon, if both were reasonably trying to reach agreement.\u201d <em>Egry Register, supra, </em>at 443.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-8\"> The language of the <em>Egry </em>decision has been often quoted, but the type of measure used by the Court, based on actual sales, has taken many different forms.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> As the term is presently understood, the \u201creasonable royalty\u201d measure of damages is taken to mean more than simply a percentage of actual profits. The measure now, very simply, means \u201c[t]he actual value of what has been appropriated.\u201d Vitro Corporation of America v. Hall Chemical Co., 292 F.2d 678, 683 (6th Cir. 1961). When this is not subject to exact measurement, a reasonable estimate of value is used. Many different factors are now considered in arriving at the \u201creasonable royalty\u201d in any given case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\">\u201cAs pointed out in many cases in a case where no established royalty is shown it is for the Court to determine a reasonable royalty which represents the value of that which has been wrongfully taken by the infringer . . . it is sufficient to point out that in making such determination many factors were taken into consideration . . .. In fact, the reasonable royalty was based upon the advantages which would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>accrued to (the infringer) had it negotiated a license . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Union Carbide Corp. v. Graver Tank and Manufacturing Co., 282 F.2d 653, 674-675 (7th Cir. 1960), cert. denied, 365 U. S. 812, 81 S.Ct. 692, 5 L.Ed.2d 691 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">One other important variation on this \u201creasonable royalty\u201d standard is the standard of comparison method, which also attempts to measure the value to the defendant of what he appropriated. As the Court in International Industries, Inc. v. Warren Petroleum Corp., 248 F.2d 696, 699 (3d Cir. 1957) explained this method, relating it to the facts of the case in which the defendant had misappropriated a method of converting dry cargo \u2022 vessels into ones equipped to transport liquefied petroleum gas, and had actually used the technique to convert one vessel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">\u201cThis method contemplates the comparison of the cost of transportation by means of the use of the trade secret with a method of accomplishing the same result which would have been open to defendant had he not appropriated the trade secret.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Occasionally this has been taken to mean the difference in costs to the defendant of developing the trade secret on his own, using the actual development costs of the plaintiff as the complete measure of damages. Servo Corp. v. General Electric Co., 342 F.2d 993 (4th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 934, 86 S.Ct. 1061, 15 L.Ed.2d 851 (1936). This measure of damages simply uses the plaintiff\u2019s actual costs, and in our view is frequently inadequate in that it fails to take into account the commercial context in which the misappropriation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">In certain cases, where the trade secret was used by the defendant in a limited number of situations, where the plaintiff was not in direct competition with the defendant, where the development of the secret did not require substantial improvements in existing trade practices but rather merely refined the existing practices, and where the defendant\u2019s use of the plaintiff\u2019s trade secret has ceased, such a limited measure might be appropriate. In the type of ease which we now consider, when the parties were potentially in direct competition and the course of conduct of the defendant extended over a period of time and included a number of different uses of the plaintiff\u2019s trade secret, and where the process of developing a computer system was very difficult and required substantial technical and theoretical advances, we believe a broader measure of damages is needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">This broader measure should take into consideration development costs, but as only one of a number of different factors. We believe this type of measure is appropriate despite the fact that the inclusion of other factors means the final damage figure \u201cneed not be as precise as if the actual development costs for the trade secret were itself the measure of damages.\u201d Forest Laboratories, Inc. v. Pillsbury Co., 452 F.2d 621, 628 (7th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">Our review of the caselaw leads us to the conclusion that every case requires a flexible and imaginative approach to the problem of damages. We agree with the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit that \u201ceach ease is controlled by its own peculiar facts and circumstances,\u201d Enterprise Manufacturing Co. v. Shakespeare Co., 141 F.2d 916, 920 (6th Cir. 1944), and accordingly we believe that the cases reveal that most courts adjust the measure of damages to accord with the commercial setting of the injury, the likely future consequences of the misappropriation, and the nature and extent of the use the defendant put the trade secret to after misappropriation. Naturally in some cases the damages will be subject to exact measurement, either because the parties had previously agreed on a licensing price as in Vitro Corp. v. Hall Chemical Co., <em>supra, </em>or because some industry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>standard provides a clear measure.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Where the damages are uncertain, however, we do not feel that that uncertainty should preclude recovery; the plaintiff should be afforded every opportunity to prove damages once the misappropriation is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Certain standards do emerge from the cases. The defendant must have actually put the trade secret to some commercial use. The law governing protection of trade secrets essentially is designed to regulate unfair business competition, and is not a substitute for criminal laws against theft or other civil remedies for conversion.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> If the defendant enjoyed actual profits, a type of restitutionary remedy can be afforded the plaintiff \u2014 either recovering the full total of defendant\u2019s profits or some apportioned amount designed to correspond to the actual contribution the plaintiff\u2019s trade secret made to the defendant\u2019s commercial success. Because the primary concern in most cases is to measure the value to the defendant of what he actually obtained from the plaintiff, the proper measure is to calculate what the parties would have agreed to as a fair price for licensing the defendant to put the trade secret to the use the defendant intended at the time the misappropriation took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">In calculating what a fair licensing price would have been had the parties agreed, the trier of fact should consider such factors as the resulting and foreseeable changes in the parties\u2019 competitive posture; the prices past purchasers or licensees may have paid; the total value of the secret to the plaintiff, including the plaintiff\u2019s development costs and the importance of the secret to the plaintiff\u2019s business; the nature and extent of the use the defendant intended for the secret; and finally whatever other unique factors in the particular case which might have affected the parties\u2019 agreement, such as the ready availability of alternative processes. Hughes Tool Co. v. G. W. Murphy Industries, Inc., 491 F.2d 923, 931 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">B. <em>Challenges to Jury Instructions on Measuring Damages.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">The district court charged the jury that the following factors should be considered by them in arriving at the proper damages for the defendants\u2019 misappropriation of AIMES III: (1) the development costs incurred by the plaintiff; (2) the fees paid by customers of the plaintiff who utilized the system on a service bureau basis; (3) the prices at which the system was leased or sold by the plaintiff for restrictive use; (4) the sale price placed on the system by the defendants; and (5) expert testimony as to what would constitute a reasonable royalty for the rights to unrestricted use of the system. We believe that these factors were proper to be considered by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">The defendants challenge the trial court\u2019s charging the jury that they were to find the \u201creasonable value\u201d of the computer system, arguing that the phrase \u201creasonable value\u201d is an improper measure of damages, and that the proper measure can only be \u201creasonable royalty.\u201d In our view, the trial court\u2019s charge was proper. Naturally we read the charge in its entirety, and we do not believe that the trial court\u2019s charge in any way confused the jury as to what damages they were entitled to find. Defendants argue that the word \u201cvalue\u201d necessarily means the <em>entire </em>value of the system, or, in other words, the value of the system <em>to the plaintiff, </em>a measure they argue is appropriate only in cases where the secret has been totally destroyed. We believe the meaningful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>question is not whether the word \u201cvalue\u201d was used, but whether the jury was properly charged, as they were here, that they could assess damages only for the actual use of the AIMES III system in an amount which would fairly approximate the price the parties would have come to, had the defendant been licensed to use the system as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The court properly concluded its instructions on Count 3 by charging the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">\u201c[i]f you should further determine that (the plaintiff, UCC) has sustained any damages, it will be your responsibility to determine from all the evidence in the case what amount would be paid as a reasonable royalty for the unrestricted use of said computer program by a buyer willing, but not compelled to buy, to a seller willing, but not compelled, to sell.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">This was an accurate statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">C. <em>Challenges to Jury\u2019s Finding Defendants Put AIMES III to a Commercial Use.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">The defendants\u2019 position is quite simply that there was no evidence they ever \u201cused\u201d the system, as required by the law on misappropriation of trade secrets, and that accordingly the trial court erred in denying their motion for a directed verdict on Count 3. The defendants place considerable emphasis on the fact that, in their view, the plaintiff lost nothing. They point to the plaintiff\u2019s failure to prove lost profits as grounds for dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages. In our view the established rule is that the plaintiff is not required to prove lost profits; rather it need only prove misappropriation of its valuable trade secret and prove that it was put to some commercial use.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">The defendants claim that their inability to market the AIMES III system should insulate them from liability. While the defendants may be technically liable to the plaintiff under the formulation of \u00a7 757 of the Restatement of Torts due to the way they obtained the AIMES III system, they argue damages can be assessed against them only for a limited percentage of actual profits. We reject this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">While the cases use the term \u201creasonable royalty\u201d to describe the method of calculating damages, we do not believe the word \u201croyalty\u201d has the talismanic quality the defendants ascribe to it. While in certain cases the reasonable royalty would be a percentage of profits on actual sales, we do not accept the view that this need be the measure in all cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">Rather the measure should correspond to the nature of the use. In cases where the trade secret was used to improve manufacturing, and subsequently manufactured items were sold at a profit,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> it would seem natural and equitable to measure damages based on those sales. But when, as here, the trade secret itself was what was to be sold \u2014 unlike any of the other cases we have discussed \u2014 we do not believe the same measure should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">Superficially the defendants' argument that they did not \u201cuse\u201d the AIMES III system seems supported by the cases. Almost without exception prior trade secret eases involved a device or process which was used by the defendant to improve his manufacturing process. Either the idea was some new way to improve manufacturing, or some new device which improved a larger manufactured product. Obviously when a trade secret is \u201cused\u201d in such cases, the use is manifest and extensive. Here the use by the very nature of the misappropriated secret is more subtle. The computer system had value in that it could be sold to customers for their internal use, or it could be used by its owner on a service bureau basis if the owner chose to lease time on its computer to outside clients, and permitted the clients to use the programs. Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>ther, the system had a value in that it represented a technical achievement, some new method of accomplishing the ordering of data to produce useful business reports. Testimony at trial indicated experts in the field of computer technology could be assisted in their experimental work by viewing the systems of others. Given these facts concerning the utility of the AIMES III system, in our view three separate sets of facts established a pattern of use of the system by the defendants which warrants damages for use of the system as if the defendants had been licensed to use it without restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Because of the earnestness with which this issue is argued by the parties, we feel it is necessary to discuss it in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">First, it is clear that the defendants offered the system to potential buyers. They represented they held rights to the system which entitled them to sell the system to others. In some cases the defendants represented the system to be of their own design, designating the system under the initials MIMIC. In other cases the defendants acknowledged the UCC role in developing the system, but asserted rights to it. We believe this was a \u201cuse\u201d which satisfied the requirements of the law on misappropriation of trade secrets.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Defendants claimed that computer service organizations frequently offered systems they did not own. Plaintiff\u2019s witnesses who had expertise in the field denied that this was true; defendants produced no examples of marketing campaigns of the type they conducted for systems the seller did not own. While it was shown that occasionally firms would sell systems they were in the process of developing (as indeed UCC had sold the AIMES III system to Leonard\u2019s before the research had been completed) clearly this is not the same thing as selling the system another owned. The only other instance of the marketing campaign preceding the seller\u2019s obtaining rights to the system was when the owner of the system had explicitly solicited such a campaign. We further believe the jury could find that LYCSC was attempting to sell a system it believed it had in its possession (i. e., the system it had misappropriated) rather than a system it believed it could purchase from UCC. The relations between UCC and the LYC subsidiary grew progressively more strained following what the jury found to have been LYC's breach of the joint venture agreement in October, 1969. The jury could reasonably infer that UCC was unwilling to deal with LYCSC and that LYCSC had no reason to believe that it would be able to purchase a copy of the AIMES III system from UCC after December, 1969; the defendants offered no evidence that they attempted to revive negotiations for purchases of software from UCC during 1970, despite the fact their marketing efforts continued unabated.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Finally, we find it difficult to ignore the fact that in February, months after all negotiations for the purchase of AIMES III ceased, LYCSC was still anxious to obtain the entire system and used Ron Clinton to obtain additional tapes and materials. We accept the jury\u2019s finding that LYCSC intended to sell the system it had misappropriated.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">While defendants presented testimony at trial attempting to show that LYCSC arranged to steal the system only to guarantee that upon later purchasing the system from UCC they could be assured they received a current copy of the system, this testimony was thoroughly discredited by the fact that undisputed evidence at trial proved that the negotiations with UCC over the purchase of AIMES III ended prior to January, 1970, and that despite this fact LYCSC obtained additional AIMES III materials from Clinton in February, subsequently ran the system in their computer in February, compiled a complete Cobol listing for the system, and continued to offer the system to poten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>tial customers until April, 1970. The jury could reasonably reject this defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Once having determined this, it seems clear that any misappropriation, followed by an exercise of control and dominion such as an attempted sale (in which lay the principal value the system held for LYCSC), must constitute a commercial use for which damages can be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Second, LYCSC displayed the component programs and listings of AIMES III to Hugh Cort of Technical Resources, Inc. Once again such conduct indicates a continuing use in that the defendants viewed the system as something they could handle as they wished, without regard to the interest they knew UCC had in maintaining its confidentiality. The admitted secrets of AIMES III lie in its ability to generate specific reports and in its novel use of certain types of numbers placed on the inventory items (the so-called AIMES numbers) which are used to accomplish the compilation of inventory data. There is evidence in the record which indicates that any expert in computer software who observes the Cobol listings, the reports generated, and the details of the programs of a system of a competitor will gain a commercial advantage from that information. LYCSC thus took upon itself the authority to display all this information to such an expert, knowing that he could potentially use that information to the competitive disadvantage of UCC. We view this as a clear commercial use of the system \u2014 but one which has a second facet as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">LYCSC displayed the various reports, listings and programs described above in the hopes of interesting Technical Resources in jointly developing a type of control system called RANFILE which they believed Technical Resources to be developing. AIMES III thus served the commercial interests of LYCSC and the other defendants in that it was used to prove LYCSC\u2019s technical expertise inasmuch as the AIMES III system was represented as being of LYCSC's design and invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Finally, there is some evidence that LYCSC had installed the AIMES III system on a service bureau basis. What this would mean is that LYCSC would be equipped to lease time on its in-house equipment and its clients could use the AIMES III system. The evidence of this is indirect, the unobjected to hearsay account of one Herbert Martenson who told of a LYCSC\u2019s salesman\u2019s claim that this was true. There was, further, clear and undisputed testimony that LYCSC had run the entire system to generate a complete set of Cobol listings after Clinton had delivered the additional tapes to LYCSC in February, 1970. We believe there is evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that LYCSC had used the system on its computer, and that this constituted a commercial use.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Taken together, these three patterns of usage lead us to the conclusion that the jury could, indeed, find that LYCSC and, through it, the other two defendants, used the AIMES III system as if it had been theirs to do with as they pleased. They ran the tapes, they compiled the listings, they generated several reports, they exposed the secrets of the system to a competitor. In short, they acted as if they owned unrestricted rights to the system. No other pattern of licensing was shown by the defendants which would permit them the complete freedom they had in using the system as they chose. The defendants offered no evidence that under past industry practice the type of agreement the parties would most likely have reached would be some form of royalty on sales, thereby sanctioning this type of unrestricted use by the fictional licensee. We are unprepared to hold that because UCC had in the past refused to sell its rights to the AIMES III system to a competitor, and thus was unable to show past transactions to show how an agreement of this sort would have been reached, it should accordingly be denied damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>In our view it is precisely in cases where the plaintiff had previously attempted to maintain the complete confidentiality of its trade secret that the lack of evidence of prior industry practice should not unreasonably limit the plaintiff\u2019s ability to prove its damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">D. <em>Challenges to Admission of Evidence on Value of AIMES III</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The defendants challenge the method by which UCC proved damages at trial. The only evidence introduced by either side on the question of damages for the AIMES III misappropriation was the expert testimony of one Stan Josephson, who estimated the value of a sale of unrestricted rights to AIMES III at $220,000. Defendants challenge both the expert qualifications of this witness and the legal sufficiency of his testimony. We deal with the first of these issues quickly.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\"> The trial court has substantial discretion over the admission of evidence, Reuter v. Eastern Air Lines, 226 F.2d 443 (5th Cir. 1955) and this includes the admission of expert testimony. Salem v. U. S. Lines Co., 370 U.S. 31, 82 S.Ct. 1119, 8 L.Ed.2d 313 (1962). In the absence of obvious error we will not disturb the ruling of the trial court. We find no error in permitting Josephson to testify as an expert. He was UCC Vice President of Technical Services. He testified he was responsible for developing software systems, pricing them for marketing, and then assisting as technical expert at sales presentations. He testified in pricing a software system he took into account such factors as development costs, the long-term potential for the system and UCC\u2019s sales objectives, as well as such extrinsic factors as the current market for such systems. We find Josephson was properly permitted to testify as to the value placed on the sale of unrestricted rights to the AIMES III system by UCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The second challenge to Josephson\u2019s testimony involves this colloquy from the record during Josephson\u2019s cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">Q: Now, of course, you understand Mr. Josephson, I take it, that value \u2014 when you give an opinion on value, you are talking about what someone is willing to pay. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-11\">A: Oh, I wouldn\u2019t categorize it as that narrow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-13\">Q: You wouldn\u2019t?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-14\">A: No. Value I don\u2019t think is what someone else will pay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-16\">Q: What\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-17\">A: As you stated, I don\u2019t believe that value is strictly what someone else is willing to pay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-19\">Q: Well, when you are talking about value here what were you talking about ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-21\">A: I\u2019m talking about many things, the value of that particular product, the use that a retail company or data processing firm can maKe of that product. Many things besides \u2014 inherent in value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-23\">Q: Then you were not telling us, arriving at a price at which the willing buyer would buy from a willing seller, that price they would arrive at?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-25\">A: What I was telling you, as I testified, was the generally accepted practice within the computer industry for unrestricted use of a valuable computer program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-27\">Q: And that\u2019s not what a willing seller and a willing buyer would arrive at as a consequence of a negotiated transaction ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-29\">A: No. They\u2019re two separate things.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-31\">Defendants rightly point to the ambiguity created by Josephson\u2019s concession that what he was calculating was something other than what a willing buyer would agree to, which is the proper measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-32\">In part our decision to sustain the jury verdict, which was heavily depend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>ent on the Josephs'on testimony in view of the fact they assessed damages of $220,000, the precise estimate he had testified to, is based on our view that the jury was properly instructed in the law governing damages. The verdict of a jury properly instructed in the law clearly resolves ambiguities of this sort in testimony, and the jury had been fully instructed in the willing buyer-willing seller test.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">But secondly we believe the ambiguity created by cross-examination was more apparent than real. Naturally, we read Mr. Josephson\u2019s testimony in its entirety and we do not find the above-quoted passage so inconsistent with his otherwise legally accurate description of how to calculate the value of unrestricted rights to AIMES III as to justify the jury verdict based on that testimony. Certainly estimating sales price as a function of costs is unexceptionable, and Josephson in our view had the expertise to opine that the proper way to calculate value is to multiply costs by a multiple of 2i/2.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">What the disputed passage amounts to is Josephson\u2019s reluctance to claim that the figure he set as the proper sale price was necessarily that which a buyer would agree to. We can understand why he would demur from confidently asserting this is what the parties would agree to, for he had no prior transaction upon which to base his opinion. We believe it wasn\u2019t improper for UCC to prove its best estimate of the proper sales price, in part taking into consideration its policy of normally not offering its systems to potential competitors. While a certain amount of speculation is involved in this highly theoretical reconstruction of a sale which never took place, the aggrieved plaintiff must be permitted to present its best evidence on damages and not be foreclosed from seeking damages it deserves due to difficulty in measurement.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\"> While we do not dispute the proper standard to be the \u201cwilling buyer-willing seller\u201d test, we do not think a reconstruction of the agreement these two reasonable parties would arrive at can be taken too far. Nor do we feel that a witness as to value must cast his answers in the precise language that the Court uses in charging the jury. Both sides in such a hypothetical transaction have interests they wish to protect; such interests affect the price at which they are prepared to buy or sell \u2014 and in cases such as this one, the law is far more concerned with the rights and interests of the aggrieved plaintiff than in the interests of the defendants which they would have tried to protect had they dealt openly with the plaintiff from the beginning. As the Court in the <em>Egry Register </em>case acknowledged, the hypothetical agreement \u201cmust be modified by the commercial situation\u201d <em>supra, </em>23 F.2d at 443, and where the \u201cwilling seller\u201d would have been unwilling to sell but for the theft of his secret, the Court reconstructing the agreement should consider the reasons the seller is unprepared to sell, and take into account such factors as the possible decline in the seller\u2019s future competitive posture.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\"> This interest the holder of a trade secret has in retaining his rights to his secret is not a trivial one, and one which we do not intend to minimize. Courts should be reluctant to penalize an aggrieved plaintiff by too unrealistic and sterile a requirement of proving that the defendant <em>would </em>have agreed to the price the plaintiff thinks is fair. As in Forest Laboratories, Inc. v. Formulations, Inc., 320 F.Supp. 211, 213 (E.D.Wis.1970), affirmed in part, reversed in part on other grounds, 452 F.2d 621 (7th Cir. 1971) where the president of the plaintiff company was permitted to testify as to what price would have been required for the plaintiff to willingly agree to sell its patented secret, we believe a consideration of plaintiff\u2019s interest in protecting its future competitive position is proper, and some consideration must be given to the price at which the seller would be \u201cwilling\u201d to deal. In affirming the trial court\u2019s assessment of damages in the <em>Forest Laboratories </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>case, the Seventh Circuit expressly acknowledged that consideration of such factors as plaintiff\u2019s future ability to stay in business is proper. 452 F.2d at 627-628. We fully agree with this approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">The proper method of fleshing out the dimensions of this hypothetical sale is by cross-examination and rebuttal testimony. The plaintiff fulfills its burden of proving damages by showing the misappropriation, the subsequent commercial use, and introduces evidence by which the jury can value the rights the defendant has obtained. This UCC did; the defendants introduced no evidence on the question of the value of unrestricted rights to AIMES III. The defendants chose to leave Josephson\u2019s testimony unchallenged as to how his estimate of value was arrived at, save for their belief his admission he couldn\u2019t guarantee a willing buyer would accept the $220,000 figure necessarily destroyed the value of all his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Because we read the record as presenting a valid issue of damages to the jury, with sufficient evidence by the plaintiff to permit the jury to value the system at $220,000, we cannot now decide that the $220,000 verdict was clearly excessive as defendants argue.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The defendants also attack the basis for Josephson\u2019s calculation of total development cost \u2014 claiming such factors as marketing expenses and the plaintiff's royalty agreement with the original developer of the system should not have been included as development costs. We believe these were questions for the jury; the defendants did not choose to cross-examine Josephson extensively on this point, nor did they present rebuttal evidence to dispute his inclusion of these amounts. The jury was not obliged to accept Josephson\u2019s figures, but we hold they could reasonably do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">The defendants next argue that permitting Josephson to testify as to the unaccepted offer UCC made to Honeywell for the sale of rights to unrestricted use of the AIMES \u25a0 III system was manifest error requiring reversal. It is clear that as a general rule, unaccepted offers are improper evidence by which to estimate value.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Typically this problem will arise in condemnation proceedings where an expert witness estimates value by using sales of adjoining property, and occasionally uses unexercised options to purchase adjoining property.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> A second frequent problem occurs when the owner of the condemned property attempts to use past offers he has received to prove the value of the property.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">The clearest statement of the rationale for excluding this evidence appears in Sharp v. United States, 191 U.S. 341, 348-349, 24 S.Ct. 114, 115, 48 L.Ed. 211 (1903):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-11\">\u201cIt is, at most, a species of indirect evidence of the opinion of the person making such offer as to the value of the land. He may have so slight a knowledge on the subject as to render his opinion of no value, and inadmissible for that reason. He may have wanted the land for some particular purpose disconnected from its value. Pure speculation may have induced it, a willingness to take chances that some new use of the land might, in the end, prove profitable. There is no opportunity to cross-examine the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>son making the offer, to show these various facts. Again, it is of a nature entirely too uncertain, shadowy, and speculative to form any solid foundation for determining the value of the land . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">In virtually \u2018 every case which has utilized this general rule, the offers came from third parties, frequently unidentified, and were mere hearsay. Further, in most of these cases there was no evidence that the offeror had the type of expert qualifications which would have entitled him to testify as to his opinion on value had he been called at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Thus, while the rule is well entrenched in the caselaw, it is designed to serve specific purposes and we do not believe is meant to be enforced mechanically or without regard to the reasons for its existence. In the past where the offer was part of a continuing series of negotiations leading to ultimate agreement, it was held to be admissible.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Where the offer was introduced for a purpose other than to prove value, it was held to be admissible.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Where the \u00bb offer was such a trivial part of the evidence offered as to be harmless, this Court has recognized the rule of Sharp v. United States is not to be automatically applied.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\"> In sum, we find the admission of testimony concerning UCC\u2019s past offer to Honeywell of unrestricted rights to the AIMES III system of $220,000 to have been properly admitted. The past offer wasn\u2019t hearsay, for Josephson had personally been involved in the Honeywell transaction. Josephson was an expert and the rule against admitting proof of anonymous offers from unqualified third parties is clearly inapplicable to the facts of this ease. Finally the figure of $220,000 was subject to full cross-examination. The defendants could explore with Josephson what factors he considered, what factors he ignored, how development costs were calculated, and finally how he arrived at the multiple of 2% times development costs. We conclude they suffered no prejudice from the admission of evidence on the Honeywell offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">There is a second, equally compelling, reason to uphold the admission of the evidence. The issue of the Honeywell offer was first raised on cross-examination of Josephson by the defendants. Josephson was asked whether UCC had ever offered unrestricted rights to anyone in the past, but was not asked what the offer actually was. We believe in the interests of elementary fairness the plaintiff had the right to then complete the account of the transaction which the defendants began. Had the jury only heard that an offer had been made to Honeywell, but did not learn of the amount, their likely reaction would be that UCC was concealing the facts of the Honeywell transaction because they had offered the AIMES III system for substantially less than $220,000. This untrue inference was properly rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-14\">E. <em>Challenge to Trial Court\u2019s Resubmission of the Case to the Jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-15\">Finally the defendants challenge the verdict of $172,000 as not being the jury\u2019s true verdict. Originally the jury returned verdicts of punitive damages alone on Counts 3 and 4, the misappropriation and conversion counts relating to the theft of the AIMES III system. This ignored the trial court\u2019s explicit instruction that punitive damages could only be awarded if actual damages were also assessed. The defendants argue that this initial verdict amounted to a finding that plaintiff suffered no actual injury and judgment should accordingly have been entered for defendants on Counts 3 and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>The trial court, upon receiving this first verdict, informed the jury its verdict was not in proper form and that they should retire to correct it.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">The court next informed counsel what had occurred, and discussed with them how to handle the situation. The court correctly observed the verdicts for punitive damages either meant the - jury' found no actual damages, or they were\u2019 confused on his initial instructions as to how to assess damages. Naturally defendants immediately moved for entry of judgment, but their motion was denied. The court decided to bring the jury back and charge them again on damages. He told them again what factors were to be considered in measuring actual damages; he told them punitive damages could only be awarded in conjunction with actual damages. Finally he charged the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">\u201cNow, I want to make it abundantly clear to you that if it was your intention, ladies and gentlemen, if you determined \u2014 if you have already determined that the plaintiff is not actually damaged with respect to Counts three and four, that will end your deliberations, and all you have to do in' that event is return a verdict for the defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">We believe the trial court had the authority to request the jury to correct its verdict. While the problem has arisen infrequently, several courts have held a trial court may order a jury to continue its deliberation if the verdict is contrary to the court\u2019s instructions. Alston v. West, 340 F.2d 856 (7th Cir. 1965); Grober v. Capital Transit Co., 119 F.Supp. 100 (D.D.C.1954).<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Similarly if the jury returns two inconsistent verdicts, the trial court may resubmit the issue to them for clarification. Wells Truckways, Ltd. v. Burch, 247 F.2d 194 (10th Cir. 1957) <footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">Naturally the court may not coerce the jury, nor should it attempt to change the jury\u2019s findings \u2014 but that was not done in this case. That portion of the trial court\u2019s new instructions to the jury which we quoted earlier seems to clearly and properly notify the jury of its options without making any attempt to sway the jury in its deliberations. We find the trial court properly recharged the jury, and properly resubmitted their verdict to them to clarify their decision. We approve the clear instructions to the jury that if they had decided the plaintiff suffered no actual injury they were to find for the defendants as a valid effort to guarantee the jury understood they were to reconsider their verdict only in the event they had misunderstood the court\u2019s instructions originally.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>IV.

This Court does not weigh the sufficiency of the evidence as if on a motion for a new trial \u2014for this function is within the discretion of the trial court. Rather, our function normally would be to evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Under Cone v. West Virginia Pulp and Paper Co., 330 U.S. 212, 67 S. Ct. 752, 91 L.Ed. 849 (1947), a Court of Appeals cannot order entry of judgment for a party whose motion for a directed verdict was erroneously denied unless the sufficiency of evidence is first tested by a motion for judgment n. o. v., which motion is proper only if the moving party had previously moved for a directed verdict at the close of evidence pursuant to F.R.Civ.P. 50(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Porter v. Eckert, 465 F.2d 1307 (5th Cir. 1972); Stockton v. Altman, 432 F.2d 946 (5th Cir. 1970) and Delchamps, Inc. v2. Borkin, 49 F.2d 417 (5th Cir. 1970) are examples of recent applications of this rule by this Court. <em>See generally, </em>5A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 50.12 (2d Ed.'1966). Here, no such motion was made, and following these clear authorities, we are unable to review the sufficiency of the evidence on which the jury found against UCC on Count 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">V. ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-12\">Under Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 20-1404, attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded \u201cif the defendant has acted in bad faith, or has been stubbornly litigious, or has caused the plaintiff unnecessary trouble and expense . . . .\u201d The bad faith referred to has been consistently held by Georgia courts to refer to the conduct of the defendant in his dealings with the plaintiff out of which the suit arose, rather than the defendant\u2019s conduct in defending the suit.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"azl-dedup-0\">The defendant LYC challenges the jury finding of bad faith in connection with Count 1. We find this to be without merit. There was sufficient evidence of secret meetings, confidential cost studies and the like, to permit the jury to find bad faith in LYC\u2019s dealings with UCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-15\">However, the Georgia courts have placed a gloss on the requirements of \u00a7 20-1404 \u2014 adding to them the further requirement that in order for a plaintiff to be entitled to attorney\u2019s fees the jury must award the plaintiff substantially what he has requested in damages.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>The plaintiff argues G. E. C. Corp. v. Levy, 126 Ga.App. 604, 191 S.E.2d 461 (1972) reverses this rule. We cannot agree .with this reading of the case. In <em>Levy </em>the Georgia Court of Appeals specifically noted that \u201calthough the plaintiff did not recover all that he sought he did recover a substantial amount . . . .\u201d 126 Ga.App. at 608, 191-S. E.2d at 465. We believe this was in keeping with the rule announced in the cases cited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The plaintiff UCC did not recover substantially all that it sought- in damages in Count 1. The amended complaint requested damages of three million dollars; the plaintiff put on proof of damages in excess of two million dollars at trial \u2014 yet recovered only $172,-000. In our view this amount is so substantially less than the amount requested that the verdict for attorney\u2019s fees cannot stand, as it clearly amounts to, a punitive measure which the Georgia cases expressly state \u00a7 20-1404 will not permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">We cannot stop here, however, for we further find that the trial court erroneously charged the jury on assessing attorney\u2019s fees, and accordingly that, issue must be retried.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">The district court charged the jury: If you should render a verdict for the plaintiff on any of the four counts or more than one of the four counts, and if you should further determine \u2014and this, again, is a matter entirely for you \u2014 that the plaintiff is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees on any of those counts, then you should go ahead and make a finding as to attorney\u2019s Tees on each of those counts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">In other words, don\u2019t split anything up; just go ahead and make a determination as to attorney\u2019s fees on'each' of these counts, and if you should return a verdict for the plaintiff on more than one count, I instruct you that the plaintiff would not be entitled to more than one award of attorney\u2019s fees, so that if you should return more than one award of attorney\u2019s fees, I will frame an appropriate judgment and will award to the plaintiff by said judgment only one of the awards indicated in your verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-11\"> We believe this instruction was erroneous. The jury was improperly denied the opportunity to apportion attorney\u2019s, fees among the different counts and different defendants according to the proportion of total counsel time and effort which was devoted to each of the three substantive areas of the law suit, the joint venture breach, the AIMES III misappropriation and the violation of Shinn\u2019s non-competition agreement. The fact that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel refused to attempt to apportion his time in, this manner, claiming the three were entwined, in no way concludes the matter. The jury heard the full case presented, and the jury would have known what percentage of the case was devoted to which substantive cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">The jury should have been instructed to assess each count separately \u2014evaluating each under the standards set out in \u00a7 20-1404 to determine whether attorney\u2019s fees should be awarded, and then determining whether to award fees for each area. While the trial court properly was concerned lest the plaintiff receive three times the fees it had proven, we do not believe the proper method of handling this potential problem is to take the matter from the jury entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-13\">It is to be particularly noted that not all defendants were joined in all the counts. By charging the jury as the trial court did, the court may well have induced the jury to deliver one verdict of attorney\u2019s fees, against only one defendant, for possibly the entire amount which the jury felt the plaintiff\u2019s counsel should receive for the case \u2014 despite the fact that the jury found against the plaintiff on the non-competition agreement count, and we now hold found damages in an inadequate amount under the joint venture agreement count to support an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">We believe there was sufficient evidence in the record to sustain a jury finding of bad faith in the defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>misappropriation of AIMES III, and thus we believe the issue of attorney\u2019s fees must be remanded for a new trial. Naturally because we do not disturb the original jury\u2019s findings as to liability and damages, only the AIMES III count can be the basis for attorney\u2019s fees, and the jury should be so instructed. The damages the jury assessed on the AIMES III count are, we believe, sufficient to support an award of attorney\u2019s fees. In evaluating what proportion of counsel\u2019s services related to the AIMES III count, we believe it is proper to apportion counsel\u2019s efforts into the three substantive areas of the lawsuit, rather than by count. Thus the jury, if it wishes to award attorney\u2019s fees, should consider what proportion of counsel\u2019s time was devoted to the preparation of Counts 3, 4, 5 and 7, all of which relate to AIMES III, and it may properly award attorney\u2019s fees on Count 3 for the total time involved in preparing and trying the AIMES III claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The case is affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\">.

The court polled the jury after they returned their second verdict as to whether they intended by their first verdict to find no actual injury had been suffered by plaintiff. Each juror responded in the negative. The defendants subsequently have obtained affidavits of two jurors which contradict their statements in open court and claim the first verdict did express the jury\u2019s finding of no actual injury. We believe such affidavits are an improper effort to impeach a jury verdict after it has been delivered. It is improper to interrogate a juror concerning what he meant by his verdict. Bruce v. Chestnut Farms-Chevy Chase Dairy, 75 U.S.App.D.C. 192, 126 F.2d 224 (1942).
