Following a practice known as \u201cwithdrawal\u201d which had gained some standing in the Patent Examiner\u2019s office, the Examiner rejected claims 12 to 17 of plaintiff-appellant\u2019s patent application and then \u201cwithdrew\u201d claims 23 and 24 from consideration. The effect of this was to leave plaintiff free to refile these claims separately. As of the time of the Examiner\u2019s action, however, the \u201cwithdrawal\u201d was conceived in the Patent Office not to represent a rejection. Hence no appeal could be taken from the Examiner\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-21\">Plaintiff-appellant did, however, unsuccessfully petition the defendant Commissioner to review the Examiner\u2019s decision. It then sought to appeal to the District Court under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 (1970), and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (1970). The District Judge relying on the lack of finality of the \u201cwithdrawal\u201d proee-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>dure denied appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Some time thereafter, on November 1, 1973, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals decided a case called In re Haas, 486 F.2d 1053 (1973). The court held that when an Examiner designated an adverse decision as a \u201cwithdrawal\u201d of a claim from further consideration it was \u201cin fact a rejection of that claim on the ground that it encompasses independent and distinct inventions.\u201d ' <em>Id. </em>at 1056. The court thereupon held that appeals could be taken from such a rejection.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">\u201cWe find that the action taken by the examiner did in fact amount to a .rejection of claims 1 and 2. Those claims were withdrawn from consideration not only in this application but prospectively in any subsequent application because of their content. In effect there had been a denial of pat-entability of the claims. Presumably only by dividing the subject matter into separate, and thus different, claims in plural applications could an examination of the patentability of their subject matter be obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">Conclusion</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">\u201cWe are thus led inevitably to the conclusion that the examiner\u2019s action here meets the standard established in Hengehold for adverse decisions reviewable by the board. The absolute \u2018withdrawal\u2019 herein cannot properly be categorized as merely a \u2018requirement\u2019 or \u2018objection\u2019 and the avenue of review thereby be restricted to petition and judicial examination under 5 U.S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706. An examiner\u2019s adverse action of this nature <em>is </em>a rejection, a denial of substantive rights. Review thereof must fall within the jurisdiction of the board.\u201d In re Haas, 486 F.2d 1053, 1056 (1973). (Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">In re Haas is directly in point with our instant appeal as appellee conceded at oral argument. Since we agree with the reasoning of In re Haas, <em>supra, </em>we vacate the District Court judgment in this case and direct the District Court to remand this appeal to the Patent Office for further proceedings in the light of In re Haas. Appellant under our order or remand retains the right to full administrative review of his pending petition under the principles of In re Haas.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
