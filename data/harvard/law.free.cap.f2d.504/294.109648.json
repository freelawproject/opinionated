I. M. E. \u2014 DC, Inc. (the Company), was scheduled to report for work at the Company\u2019s Albany, New York, terminal on January 17, 1972. For reasons which will appear below, Smith did not present himself in Albany until February 24, 1972. In the interim, and for several months thereafter, the Company and the Albany Local 294 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Local 294) treated Smith in a manner that caused an administrative law judge to conclude on the basis of a hearing that the Company had discriminated against Smith in violation of sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act (the Act) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that Local 294 had prompted that discrimination in violation of sections 8(b)(1)(A) and 8(b)(2) of the Act. The National Labor Relations Board (the NLRB or the Board) adopted the decision of the administrative law judge and ordered the Company and Local 294 to atone for their discriminatory treatment of Smith. 1973, 203 NLRB No. 174. The Company has petitioned this Court for a review of the Board\u2019s order, and the Board has submitted an application to enforce its order against the Company and Local 294. An examination of the record convinces us that the NLRB\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. The Board\u2019s order will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-18\">The Company, a common carrier of freight, conducts trucking operations from terminals throughout the nation. In the summer of 1971, the Company initiated a change of operations whereby certain of its drivers were to be transferred from one terminal to another. Smith, who had worked for the Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>since 1969, chose to transfer from Chicago, where he was a member of Local 710, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, to Albany. Three other Chicago drivers were to make the same move, which was to become effective on January 17, 1972. The four Chicago drivers were to have their seniority dovetailed at the Albany terminal on the basis of their full unbroken road seniority dates, as provided in the Teamsters\u2019 National Master Freight Agreement. In Smith\u2019s case, this meant that he would be fifth on the seniority list in Albany, after the three other Chicago drivers and one Albany driver but before any new Albany drivers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">On December 17, 1971, while on a run back to Chicago, the door of Smith\u2019s truck suddenly closed on his hand. Smith signed off sick after returning to Chicago, and although he reported himself available for work on December 20, his hand became numb, so that Smith again signed off sick on December 22 and went home to Kirksville, Missouri, where he remained until February 23, 1972.2 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Smith made no attempt to see the Company\u2019s doctor in Chicago, as Company regulations required, but preferred to rely on the good offices of his family doctor, a chiropractor, who treated Smith and eventually released him for work. What is more important, Smith did not notify the Company that he would be unable to report to Albany as scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Two of the transferred Chicago drivers began work in Albany on January 17 and a third arrived the next day. When Smith did not appear, the Company\u2019s Albany Terminal Manager, Anthony Pape, called the Company\u2019s driver-supervisor in Chicago, Wayne Hanna, and Hanna, after consulting with another Company official, sent Smith a telegram on January 24 asking him to inform the Company of his intentions within 72 hours after receiving the telegram; Hanna warned Smith that if he did not reply, he would be dropped from the seniority list. The telegram was sent to the residence of Smith\u2019s parents in LaGrange, Illinois, an address where Smith had frequently and recently received Company correspondence. Unfortunately, Smith\u2019s father had died in December, 1971, and his mother had moved away, so that Western Union returned the telegram to the Company with the information that Smith was deceased. For some reason, this startling news did not seem to stir the Company, which took no immediate action of any sort with regard to Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">On January 31, the business agent of Smith\u2019s Chicago local (which had received a copy of the telegram) contacted Smith in Missouri and advised him of the Company\u2019s inquiry about his intentions. Smith immediately telephoned Hanna in Chicago and said that he had not received the telegram and that the report of his death was somewhat exaggerated. Although Smith mentioned his injury, he did not say when he planned to arrive in Albany.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">By this time, the Company had hired a number of new drivers for its Albany operations, all of whom were members of Local 294 in Albany. It is at this point that the record becomes filled with conflicting testimony, for Smith\u2019s delayed arrival (and somewhat unusual behavior) created a question in the minds of the new drivers \u2014 and in the mind of Local 294\u2019s President, Nick Robilotto\u2014 as to Smith\u2019s seniority relative to the seniority of the new drivers. Local 294 resolved this question in favor of its own people and attempted to persuade the Company to reach a similar conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>On February 17, Smith sent a telegram to Pape, the Company\u2019s man in Albany, stating that he would soon be released by his doctor and would report to Albany on February 24. After receiving this telegram, Pape told Chicago transferee Hugh Latty that Smith had a good safety record and still had a job. Smith telephoned Pape on February 22 to confirm his arrival and contends that Pape told him: \u201cFine, come on up.\u201d Pape denies this and testified that he (Pape) told Smith that there was no work for him in Albany.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">At some time after February 17 and before February 24, Pape discussed Smith\u2019s pending arrival with Local 294 President Robilotto, who told Pape that since Smith had not appeared \u201cwithin the allotted time,\u201d other (Local 294) men had taken Smith\u2019s position, so that there was nothing for Smith in Albany. Pape also talked to Richard Pastors, a Company official in Chicago, who told Pape that Smith had been discharged because he had failed to respond to the Company\u2019s telegram of January 17. Pastors sent Smith a telegram to this effect on February 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Nothing daunted, Smith reported for work in Albany on February 24. Pape told him (in the presence of Hugh Latty) that he had no job and \u201cwould have to go to Local 294 to get things straightened out,\u201d that Robilotto \u201cwould not accept [Smith\u2019s] seniority on the Albany board\u201d because Smith had not arrived \u201cin 30 days.\u201d The next day, Smith and Latty went to the Local 294 hall, where they spoke with the Local\u2019s business agent, Bentley, as Robilotto was out. Smith told Bentley that he had been absent because of an injury incurred on the job and showed the agent his doctor\u2019s release. Bentley stated that he saw no reason why Smith could not be placed on the seniority list. When Bentley called Pape about the matter, however, Pape restated the Company\u2019s position that Smith had no job because he had not reported on January 17. Bentley then asked Pape whether he could represent Smith in a grievance concerning the purported discharge, but Pape replied that because Smith was not a member of Local 294, the grievance would have to be filed with Smith\u2019s local in Chicago. Smith and Latty then marched over to Pape\u2019s office, where they called a Company official in Chicago who reaffirmed the Company\u2019s position with respect to Smith\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">On February 28, Smith submitted his grievance concerning the discharge to a joint employer-union tribunal in Chicago. Robilotto sent a telegram to the Company on the same day advising the Company that Local 294 \u201ccould not accept [Smith] for transfer and seniority\u201d at Albany \u201cdue to the fact that he was to report for work at [Albany] on January 17, and he failed to do so\u201d and had submitted no explanation for his behavior. The Joint State Committee considered this and other evidence and resolved to reinstate Smith as follows: \u201cReinstate \u2014 no compensation. Company to effect continuous coverage health, welfare, and pension by making all contributions to the funds not made because of this dispute.\u201d Immediately thereafter, the business agent of the Chicago local advised Smith that the decision of the Committee awarded him the Albany job with full seniority.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Upon receiving the decision of the Chicago tribunal, Pape called Robilotto and told him that Smith would have to be reinstated \u201cpursuant to the decision.\u201d Robilotto\u2019s first reaction was that Smith should not be reinstated; he then agreed to the reinstatement on the condition that Smith would go to the bottom of the seniority list, as the tenth man. The Company adopted this plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">On March 3, Smith made his first trip from Albany and, upon his return, noticed that a seniority list had been posted. The first three positions on the list were held by Chicago transferees, who had been credited with their full Company seniority. Next on the list was the senior Albany driver, followed by five new men from Local 294. Smith, whose Company seniority dated to 1969, was last on the list with an Albany terminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>senioi\u2019ity date of March 2, 1972. After reading the list, Smith attempted to contact Robilotto or Bentley at Local 294 but was unable to reach them or to have his calls returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">On March 5, after a regular Local 294 meeting, the Company\u2019s drivers met to elect a road steward and were introduced to Robilotto, who informed them, according to Smith and another Chicago driver, that the Local 294 men came ahead of the Chicago men. After a somewhat confused election, the senior Albany man was elected steward. Smith then discussed his seniority with Robi-lotto, who said that he could do nothing unless Smith could establish that he had drawn workmen\u2019s compensation for the injury to his hand. Smith\u2019s Chicago lawyer sent a letter to Bentley on March 6 stating that an application for workmen\u2019s compensation had been filed, but Local 294 took no action on the matter. Smith continued to protest his seniority status, to no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">On March 30, during a run to Carter-et, New Jersey, Smith\u2019s tractor-trailer allegedly developed transmission trouble on the New York Thruway and Smith stopped at a service area to report the trouble. A mechanic was sent from a local garage with another tractor and Smith completed his trip with the replacement tractor. When the suspect tractor was examined at the garage, however, nothing appeared to be wrong with it, and this conclusion was reported to Pape at Albany. On April 3, when Smith called the Albany dispatcher, Pape took the phone and told Smith that he had been discharged because of the events of March 30. That same day, Pape sent Smith a registered letter stating that he had been discharged for \u201cdishonesty,\u201d for \u201cfaking a breakdown\u201d in order to collect wages for the two hours of delay. At no time was Smith asked to explain his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Smith called on the Local 294 road steward on April 5 to commence a grievance procedure with respect to his discharge, but the steward declined to process the grievance, allegedly saying that the matter was \u201ctoo hot to handle\u201d and suggesting that Smith file the grievance in Chicago. Smith was then told by the Chicago local that he could not file his grievance there, since he had been in Albany for over 30 days, but Local 294 continued to refuse to process the grievance. At this point, Smith betook himself to the local office of the NLRB, where he filed unfair labor practice charges against the Company and Local 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">On May 6, Smith was notified that a grievance had been filed on his behalf, and at a meeting of the Albany Joint Local Grievance Committee on May 9, Smith was reinstated with back pay \u201cfor all trips made by the next junior man to him from April 16, 1972, to May 9, 1972.\u201d Since Smith, in the opinion of the Company and Local 294, was the most junior man at the Albany terminal, the soothing balm of vindication did not result in financial remuneration for the time he had been out of work. Shortly after returning to work on May 10, Smith once again sought an affirmation of his correct seniority status from Pape, who told him that he was still considered the most junior man because \u201cthat was a decision from Nick Robilot-to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">After the General Counsel of the NLRB had issued a consolidated complaint against the Company and Local 294, the Company and Local 294, on their own motion, granted Smith a grievance hearing regarding his seniority status. On June 20, a Joint Local Committee, consisting of three employer representatives and three representatives of Local 294, held a hearing and decided that Smith had \u201cnot acted responsibly\u201d in the matter of his injury and denied his grievance. The Committee determined that Smith\u2019s \u201cterminal seniority\u201d \u2014 his seniority for purposes of determining trip seniority and layoffs \u2014would be established as of March 2, 1972, but that his \u201cCompany seniority\u201d \u2014his seniority for purposes of vacations, holidays, health and welfare and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>pensions \u2014 would be established as of September 5, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The administrative law judge considered the events and testimony outlined above and determined that the Company had violated .sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the Act3 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by denying Smith his rightful seniority on the Albany list and by discharging him on April 3, 1972. The administrative law judge also concluded that Local 294 had violated section 8(b)(1)(A) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Act when it refused to process Smith\u2019s grievance in April, 1972 and had violated sections 8(b)(1)(A) and 8(b)(2) of the Act<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> when it \u201cattempted to cause and did cause\u201d the Company to deny Smith his rightful seniority because Smith was not a member of Local 294. Finally, the administrative law judge ruled that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that Local 294 had instigated the Company\u2019s wrongful discharge of Smith in April, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The Board affirmed the findings and the decision of the administrative law judge in all particulars and ordered the Company to restore Smith to his proper seniority status and to make Smith whole for any loss of wages accruing from the April 3 discharge. The Company and Local 294 were made jointly and severally liable to Smith for wages lost as a result of their denial of his seniority rights. The Company and Local 294 were also ordered to cease and desist from discriminating against Smith or any of the Company\u2019s employees at Albany because of their non-membership in Local 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b363-15\">We have recited the facts of this case at great length because the administrative law judge and the Board have relied heavily upon the sum of the circumstances of this ease to show that the Company\u2019s treatment of Smith was instigated by Local 294 and that Local 294, in turn, was motivated by a bald, chauvinistic localism of a sort prohibited by the Act. Of course, it is not enough for the Board to demonstrate that Smith was treated incorrectly; the NLRB must prove that he was treated unfairly, that Smith was the victim of discrimination based upon his nonmembership in Local 294. It is well established in NLRB proceedings, however, that \u201cdirect evidence of discriminatory motivation is not necessary to support a finding of discrimination,\u201d and that \u201csuch intent may be inferred from the record as a whole,\u201d Health International, Inc., 1972, 196 NLRB 318, 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-16\">Our task in the review of an NLRB order is to determine whether there is \u201csubstantial evidence on the record as a whole\u201d to support the Board\u2019s decision. Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 1951, 340 U.S. 474, 491, 71 S.Ct. 456, 466, 95 L.Ed. 456, 469; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(f). This standard requires us to review all of the evidence, and not just that which supports the Board\u2019s decision. M. R. &amp; R. Trucking Co. v. N. L. R. B., 5 Cir. 1970, 434 F.2d 689. This Court has always been mindful of its statutory duty carefully to police Board actions and we are not infrequently forced to conclude that particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>lar NLRB findings are fatally devoid of evidentiary support. <em>See, e. g., </em>Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America v. N. L. R. B., 5 Cir. 1974, 491 F.2d 595; N. L. R. B. v. Carlton McLendon Furniture Co., Inc., 5 Cir. 1974, 488 F.2d 58; N. L. R. B. v. White Knight Mfg. Co., 5 Cir. 1973, 474 F.2d 1064.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Once that is said, it is usually the case that careful and critical exegesis of Board orders results in the enforcement of those orders. This situation is not completely attributable to any innate sense of justice which the Board may possess, nor is it totally the product of the NLRB\u2019s long experience and expertise in labor relations disputes, although the Board, a daily observer of union vendettas and employer alliances, is certainly better equipped to evaluate such struggles than is a Court with a sometime familiarity with those practices. The fact of the matter is that, although we may question the Board\u2019s disposition of a particular controversy, the substantial evidence standard, predicated as it is upon the Board\u2019s experience and expertise, forbids us to displace the choice of the NLRB between two fairly conflicting views even though we might justifiably have made a different choice had the case been before us as an original matter. N.L.R.B. v. United Insurance Co., 1968, 390 U.S. 254, 88 S.Ct. 988, 19 L.Ed.2d 1083; N.L.R.B. v. W. R. Bean &amp; Son, Inc., 5 Cir. 1971, 450 F.2d 93, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 849, 92 S.Ct. 57, 34 L.Ed.2d 91. Moreover, we are neither empowered nor equipped to make <em>de novo </em>determinations of witness credibility based upon any impressions we might glean from the printed record. N.L.R.B. v. Groendyke Transport, Inc., 5 Cir. 1974, 493 F.2d 17; N.L.R.B. v. B. F. Diamond Constr. Co., 5 Cir. 1969, 410 F.2d 462, cert. denied, 396 U.S. 835, 90 S.Ct. 94, 24 L.Ed.2d 86. Where the record contains conflicting testimony, the responsibility for the resolution of such conflicts reposes exclusively in the administrative trier of fact and in the Board. N.L.R.B. v. Rex Disposables, Div. of DHJ, Inc., 5 Cir. 1974, 494 F.2d 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">This is not an easy case, in spite of the Board\u2019s assertion that the evidence here is that of a garden variety instance of union-instigated employer discrimination against a non-union employee. The parties do not agree on what was said by whom to whom; even if that problem is resolved for the sake of argument, the parties place very different interpretations upon the meaning and effect of what may have been said and done. We will examine each of the Board\u2019s conclusions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The Board determined that the Company wrongfully denied Smith his proper seniority and that this discrimination was the product of Local 294\u2019s bias against Smith because he was not a member of that union. Section 8(b)(2) of the Act makes it an unfair labor practice \u201cto cause or attempt to cause an employer to discriminate against an employee in violation of subsection (a)(3) of this section.\u201d Subsection (a)(3) makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer \u201cby discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.\u201d A violation of section 8(b)(2) may be found only if two elements are present: (1) an impermissible discrimination by the Union, which (2) causes or tends to result in the encouragement or discouragement of union membership. Radio Officers\u2019 Union v. N.L.R.B., 1954, 347 U.S. 17, 74 S.Ct. 323, 98 L.Ed. 455; N.L.R.B. v. International Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, Local 1581, 5 Cir. 1974, 489 F.2d 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">The NLRB\u2019s disposition of this case is necessarily predicated upon the finding that Local 294, and particularly its president, Nick Robilotto, desired to deny Smith his rightful seniority in order to further the interests of the newly-hired Local 294 drivers, and that Robilotto caused the Company to effectuate this unlawful design. The evidence to support such a finding is partially circumstantial and partially based upon more direct testimony given by Smith and other Chicago transferees, testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>that was frequently contradicted by various Company and Local 294 officials. We believe that the administrative law judge\u2019s decision to credit Smith\u2019s rendition of the disputed events was not unreasonable. We find that Smith\u2019s testimony, in the context of all the surrounding circumstances, adequately supports the NLRB\u2019s inference that the Company and Local 294 unlawfully discriminated against Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The Company and Local 294 argue that even if the Company\u2019s actions were the product of union pressure, their respective actions with respect to Smith were not based upon any discriminatory motive but were instead the natural results of a reasonable (and at worst an incorrect) interpretation of the Company-Local 294 agreements regarding seniority. The Board considered this interpretation of the facts and found it unpersuasive, and we have already shown that we may not reject the Board\u2019s view of the matter if it is grounded upon substantial evidence, no matter what other gloss might be put upon the same statements and events.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\"> The Company and Local 294 contend that it was reasonable for them to believe that Smith\u2019s failure to report to Albany on January 17, 1972, rendered him liable to discharge and that he was in fact discharged, so that his seniority could date only from the day on which he was \u201crehired\u201d and returned to work \u2014March 3, 1972. They rely on the language of article 5, section 1 of the Teamsters\u2019 National Master Freight Agreement, a part of the collective bargaining agreement between the Company and Local 294, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">Seniority rights for employees shall prevail under this agreement and all agreements supplemental thereto. Seniority shall only be broken by discharge, voluntary quit, more than a three (3) year layoff . . . or as provided in any applicable provisions of the supplemental agreements. The extent to which seniority shall be applied as well as the method and procedures of such application shall be clearly set forth in each of the supplemental agreements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">This language must be read in conjunction with the Change of Operations Agreement which governed the transfer of drivers from Chicago to Albany. This Agreement directed that \u201cdrivers who relocate shall have their seniority dovetailed at their new terminals on the basis of their respective full unbroken road seniority dates.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Finally, article 43, section 5 of the supplemental agreement between the Company and Local 294 provides that \u201cterminal seniority as measured by length of service at such terminal shall prevail excepting in those instances where the employer, the unions involved and the New York State Teamsters Joint Freight Division agree to the contrary.\u201d The Company and Local 294 argue that since article 43 is a part of the supplemental agreement to the Master Freight Agreement, and since Smith failed to conform to the provisions of the Change of Operations Agreement by failing to report as scheduled, article 43 formed a sound basis for a reasonable belief that Smith\u2019s terminal seniority should date from March 3, 1972. They argue further that this interpretation was so reasonable that the Albany Joint Grievance Committee adopted the very same conclusion in its decision of June 20, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">Even assuming that we should take any cognizance of the Albany Committee\u2019s decision, the persuasiveness of this argument lasts only as long as one neglects to read the rest of the Master Freight Agreement. Article 46, section 1(c) provides that \u201cwhere a Joint State Committee by a majority vote settles a dispute, no appeal may be taken. Such a decision will be final and binding on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>both parties.\u201d If the Company and Local 294 could have entertained a good faith misapprehension of Smith\u2019s seniority prior to the Illinois Joint State Committee\u2019s decision of February 28, 1972, wherein that Committee reinstated Smith, any legitimate confusion must have been banished upon receipt of that decision. Although the order of reinstatement : \u201cReinstate \u2014 no compensation. Company to effect continuous coverage health, welfare, and pension by making all contributions to the funds not made because of this dispute\u201d \u2014 is not a model of pellucidity with respect to seniority, the order clearly reinstated Smith, so that any possible discharge was thereby rendered void, and with it any possible loss of seniority rights was obviated. This is not a subtle point of contractual interpretation, the knowledge of which could not be fairly charged to Company terminal managers and union leaders; by reinstating Smith, the February 28 decision necessarily indicated that there was no possible reason for which his accrued seniority i\u2019ights could be nullified pux\u2019suant to article 5, section 1 of the Master Fx\u2019eight Agreement. The administrative law judge found, furthermore, and the Board agreed, that \u201cthe reasonable import of [the language of the February 28 order] not only restored Smith to his job but also reestablished all rights appurtenant to that job, including seniority. Indeed [Smith\u2019s Chicago local] intex-preted that decision to mean that it reinstated Smith with full seniority.\u201d Although it would not be corx\u2019ect to say that the Company and Local 294 are chargeable with the acquired expertise of an administrative law judge or with the particular knowledge and experience of another local, such interpretations do tend to indicate the unreasonableness of a belief that the Illinois Joint State Grievance Committee would deny by silence those precious seniox\u00faty x\u00fcghts which article 5, section 1 of the Master Freight Agreement tells us may be fox-feited only in specified circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\"> The Company and Local 294 also urge that the NLRB erred in failing to defer to the decision of the Albany Joint State Committee, dated June 20, 1972, regarding Smith\u2019s seniority rights. In Spielberg Mfg. Co., 1955, 112 NLRB No. 139, the Board established a policy that where certain minimum standards are met \u2014 where \u201cthe proceedings appear to have been fair and regular, all parties had agreed to be bound, and the decision of the ax\u2019bitration panel is not cleaxdy repugnant to the purposes and policies of the Act,\u201d 112 NLRB at 1082 \u2014 the Board will defer to the decisions of an ax-bitrator or a bipartisan committee with respect to the same subject matter as the ai'bitrated grievance. <em>See </em>Carey v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 1964, 375 U.S. 261, 84 S.Ct. 401, 11 L.Ed.2d 320. In Collyer Insulated Wire, 1971, 192 NLRB No. 150, the Boax'd extended its <em>Spielberg </em>policy to cases where there is reasonable cause to believe that the use of the arbitral or grievance machinery by the parties will resolve the issue in a manner compatible with the Act. <em>See </em>National Radio Co., Inc., 1972, 198 NLRB No. 1. <em>Spielberg </em>and <em>Collyer </em>represent a part of the NLRB\u2019s continuing effort to facilitate the prompt and expert settlement of labor disputes in a peaceful manner by the parties involved, without resort to the sometimes ponderous apparatus of federal intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\"><em>Spielberg </em>and <em>Collyer </em>can have no application, however, to a situation where the ax\u2019bitration or grievance proceedings are not even-handed, for in such a case there can be no expectation of fairness and substantial justice such as to be minimally satisfactox'y to all pax'ties. Where both the employer and the union are hostile to an employee\u2019s interests, the Boai\u2019d has propei\u2019ly x\u2019efused to defer to an arbitral or grievance procedure invoked and administered by the employer and the union. Anaconda Wire &amp; Cable Co., 1973, 201 NLRB No. 125; Kansas Meat Packers, 1972, 198 NLRB No. 2. In this case, where the Boax'd has found that the Company and Local 294 have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>committed unfair labor practices against Smith over a period of several months, any deference to the decision of a tribunal composed, as the Albany Committee was, of representatives of the Company and Local 294 would surely be misplaced. Even assuming that the decision of the Albany Committee was not a nullity, in light of the previous decision of the Illinois Committee and the directive of section 46 of the Master Freight Agreement that the previous award would be final and binding on all parties, the Board did not err in refusing to accord any weight to the decision of the Albany Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The administrative law judge found, and the Board agreed, that the Company violated sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the Act by discharging Smith on April 3, 1972, but that there was insufficient evidence to implicate Local 294 in the matter. This conclusion is certainly supported by substantial evidence. The abruptness of the discharge, coupled with the total failure of the Company to conduct a fair and impartial investigation and the previous history of the Company\u2019s treatment of Smith, indicate that the discharge was pretextual in nature and that the charge of \u201cdishonesty\u201d was only a mask for a discriminatory motive. <em>See </em>N.L.R.B. v. Ship Shape Maintenance Co., Inc., 1972, 154 U.S.App.D.C. 186, 474 F.2d 434; N.L.R.B. v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc., 2 Cir. 1957, 242 F.2d 497, cert. denied, 355 U. S. 829, 78 S.Ct. 40, 2 L.Ed.2d 41. After a consideration of all the surrounding circumstances described above, we also hold that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Local 294 violated section 8(b)(1)(A) of the Act when it refused to process Smith\u2019s grievance regarding his April 3 discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">In summary, the record as a whole is the sum of its parts and while parts of the Board\u2019s case against the Company and Local 294 evidence some stress, the entire record demonstrates such tensility as to convince us of the structural soundness of the Board\u2019s decision that Smith was the victim of a primitive sort of union localism, a local-ism which the Company helped to effectuate.
