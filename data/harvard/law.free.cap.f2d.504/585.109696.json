We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-24\">The conviction of appellant was affirmed by this court. 475 F.2d 1022 (9th Cir.), cert, denied, 412 U.S. 929, 93 S.Ct. 2757, 37 L.Ed.2d 157 (1973). A new trial is sought because of the presence of \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence. A full hearing was held by the trial court on appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-25\">It is well settled that the scope of review of a denial of a motion for a new trial is narrow and reversal will be ordered only when it is clear that the District Court abused its discretion. United States v. Craft, 421 F.2d 693, 695 (9th Cir. 1970); Pitts v. United States, 263 F.2d 808, 810-811 (9th Cir.), cert, denied, 360 U.S. 919, 79 S.Ct. 1438, 3 L.Ed.2d 1535 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-26\">A review of the record clearly discloses that the evidence relied upon by the appellant was not newly discovered and unknown to the defendant at the time of trial. Nor would the evidence probably have produced an acquittal. United States v. Cativiela, 460 F.2d 192 (9th Cir. 1972) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-27\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
