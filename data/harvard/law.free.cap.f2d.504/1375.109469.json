This appeal raises two issues which we discuss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-4\">Hessbrook represented himself to Gregorio Quintana Barron and Ruben Moreno Ledesma, two poorly educated Mexican aliens who had entered this country illegally, as an F.B.I. agent looking for the Mexican murderer of an Anglo male. Hessbrook \u201carrested\u201d Barron and Ledesma, drove them down to a deserted area along the Medina River near Macdona, Texas, threatened to kill them, then took most of their money and let them go. The general outline and implementation of Hessbrook\u2019s gambit, his self-identification as a government agent, and his intent to defraud<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were incontrovertibly established by the testimony of Barron, Ledesma, and one Brown, Hessbrook\u2019s aceomplice-turnedGovernment-witness. Hessbrook argues, however, that the evidence did not sufficiently identify him as a federal agent. We disagree. Barron and Ledesma speak only Spanish: their testimony was given through an interpreter, and Hessbrook had addressed them in Spanish while arresting and robbing them. Because of the language problem, and Ledesma\u2019s difficulty in reproducing the sounds F-B-I, there was some confusion at trial as to whether the victims recalled Hessbrook as having identified himself as an agent of the \u201cF.B.I.\u201d or the \u201cS.B.I.\u201d or the \u201cS.P.I.\u201d After a thorough review of the testimony, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we cannot conclude that a reasonably-minded jury must have doubted that Hessbrook falsely represented himself as an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. <em>See </em>Glasser v. United States, 1942, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680, 704; United States v. Warner, 5 Cir. 1971, 441 F.2d 821, 825, cert. denied, 404 U.S. 829, 92 S.Ct. 2040, 30 L.Ed.2d 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-10\">Hessbrook argues additionally that the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury, in accordance with his proposed instructions, that the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the victims Barron and Ledesma believed that Hessbrook was \u201can officer or employee of the United States, as opposed to an officer or an employee of some other level of government.\u201d The able trial court charged the jury that in order to convict it must find beyond a reasonable doubt that Hessbrook falsely pretended to be an officer and employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but the trial court did not accept the proposition that the victims\u2019 belief or understanding regarding the statutory roots of the F.B.I.\u2019s authority constituted an element of the offenses charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-11\">It may be true that if a victim is aware that a pretended federal official <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>is actually a state, and not a federal, employee, then there could be no violation of \u00a7\u00a7 912 or 913, since there would be no arrest or taking of property under the assumed character of a federal agent. <em>See </em>Ferguson v. United States, 8 Cir. 1923, 293 F. 361, 363. <em>Cf. </em>Massengale v. United States, 6 Cir. 1957, 240 F.2d 781. In the matter at bar, however, the appellant has never suggested that the victims believed that he was a state or city official: Hessbrook seeks to rely simply on the possible and untested inability of his victims to be sure that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was an exclusively federal operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-4\">We hold that the district court\u2019s instructions were ample. We think such a result is required by the omission in the statute of any language supporting the appellant\u2019s interpretation, and by the construction placed on the predecessor legislation by the Supreme Court in United States v. Barnow, 1915, 239 U.S. 74, 80, 36 S.Ct. 19, 22, 60 L.Ed. 155, 158, in upholding a conviction for obtaining money through false representation of a nonexistent federal office: \u201cit is the aim of the [legislation] not merely to protect innocent persons from actual loss through reliance upon false assumptions of Federal authority, but to maintain the good general repute and dignity of the service itself.\u201d We refuse to sacrifice these aims by precluding application of these statutes to those who, while expressly identifying themselves as agents of a federal agency, may prey on victims insufficiently sophisticated to assure themselves of the distinctly federal character of that institution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1441-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1439-27\">. Section 913 provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1439-28\">Whoever falsely represents himself to be an officer, agent, or employee of the Unit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>ed States, and in such assumed character arrests or detains any person or in any manner searches the person, buildings, or other property of any person, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1440-6\">. Section 912 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1440-7\">Whoever falsely assumes or pretends to be an officer or employee acting under the authority of the United States of any department, agency or officer thereof, and acts as such, or in such pretended character demands or obtains any money, paper, document, or thing of value, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1440-12\">. Appellant raises ten additional issues on this appeal: admissibility of certain testimony of witness Ledesma; characterization of a government witness as an agent of the \u201cFederal Bureau of Investigation,\u201d not \u201cF.B.I.\u201d; appellant\u2019s timing of his self-identification to his victims; introduction of a map into evidence ; photographic identification; non-severance of the two counts on which appellant was acquitted; denial of appellant\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars; jury voir dire; bail pending appeal; admissibility of one government witness\u2019 self-characterization as a felon. After careful consideration, we find no merit in appellant\u2019s arguments on these points.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1440-13\">. <em>See </em>United States v. Randolph, 5 Cir. 1972, 460 F.2d 367.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1441-6\">. This conclusion is fully consistent with the holding in Heskett v. United States, 9 Cir. 1932, 58 F.2d 897, 902. In that case, the pretended immigration officials had not identified themselves as representing the federal government. Nevertheless, where there was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AENM\">ample testimony to show that [the defendants] represented themselves as immigration officers, with authority to inquire as to whether their intended victim was in possession of a passport, [the court concluded that] they held themselves out as acting under the authority of the United States .... Inasmuch as the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over the question of passports, it was not necessary that they expressly represent themselves as \u201cUnited States\u201d immigration officers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1441-17\">Hessbrook relies here on a jury instruction recited in <em>Heslcett </em>to establish a requirement that the victim believe the pretended official to have acted under distinctly federal authority. This reliance is misplaced. First, as we read it, so much of that instruction as goes to the victim\u2019s belief regarding the pretender\u2019s authority is relevant only to making out an implied showing of impersonation in the absence of an express claim by the pretender to his federal office. Second, a review of the full discussion in <em>Heslcett </em>reveals that the appellate court merely concluded that a jury finding in accordance with the trial court\u2019s instruction was <em>ample </em>to establish that the defendants \u201crepresented themselves as immigration officers with authority to inquire as to whether their intended victim was in possession of a passport.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
