Petitioners include natural gas distributors purchasing gas that flows through Texas Eastern\u2019s system, some directly from Texas Eastern and others from Algonquin Gas Transmission Company, a New England pipeline which currently obtains its entire supply from Texas Eastern. Other petitioners are Rhode Island Consumers\u2019 Council, the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities, and the Connecticut Public Utilities Commission. Intervening in support of the Commission\u2019s order are Algonquin, Texas Eastern and several large customers of the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-19\">Petitioners challenge both the allocation and the rate structure changes ordered by the Commission. We decline to pass upon certain objections to the allocation provisions, in view of events that have occurred subsequent to the Commission\u2019s order. We do consider the merits of the objections leveled by petitioners against the rate tariff order, particularly the Commission\u2019s approval of retention of \u201cdemand charge\u201d provisions notwithstanding termination of entitlement to contract \u201cdemand\u201d quantities. We reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>I. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Taking note of the nation\u2019s gas shortage, the Commission on April 15, 1971, issued Order No. 431<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> directing all jurisdictional pipelines to submit reports to implement the FPC\u2019s policy that pipelines take all steps necessary to insure an adequate and reliable gas supply for the 1971-72 winter and thereafter. The FPC directed pipelines anticipating curtailment of deliveries to file a tariff sheet, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act, setting forth a curtailment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Texas Eastern initially responded to Order 431 with a statement that any curtailment necessary would be carried out in accordance with the existing tariff, which called for pro-rata reductions of customers\u2019 entitlements under their contracts. Subsequently, on October 19, 1971, Texas Eastern advised the Commission that it would be necessary to curtail deliveries by approximately 15 billion cubic feet during the winter of 1971-72. At the same time, Texas Eastern filed a tariff change eliminating an obligation to refund certain charges when it curtailed deliveries as a result of a supply shortage. The Commission docketed Texas Eastern\u2019s tariff <em>change</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and consolidated further proceedings with those to be held on the delivery curtailment plan. Also joined with the foregoing were proceedings on the curtailment plan and a similar tariff change filed by Algonquin.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Following a November 19, 1971, order by the Commission that Texas Eastern should distribute \u201cevidence in support of the curtailment programs to be pursued\u201d and that the possibility of a settlement should then be explored, the parties commenced negotiations that stretched into the spring of 1972. These culminated in a proposal for an interim curtailment of Texas Eastern deliveries through September 1, 1973; the curtailment plan incorporated the tariff change Texas Eastern had sought by its prior filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">On August 28, 1972, the proposal, which had been drafted by representatives of Texas Eastern and certain Texas Eastern customers, was presented as a nonunanimous settlement proposal to an administrative law judge (ALJ). The proposal was opposed by several parties, including petitioners here. The ALJ rejected requests for an evidentiary hearing concerning the terms of the proposed plan, but did allow Municipal Defense Group (MDG), a petitioner here, to serve Texas Eastern with interrogatories. Following the filing of interrogatories and answers and other documentary materials in support of and opposition to the proposed plan, the ALJ certified the record to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">On December 1, 1972, the Commission approved the proposal as an interim plan for curtailment through September 1, 1973. It turned aside objections by petitioners to the basis for allocation of gas to customers, to the allocated amounts themselves, to the rate structure changes, and to the procedures followed by the ALJ in receiving evidence bearing on the proposal. Petitioners\u2019 application for rehearing was denied on January 26, 1973, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">II. THE ALLOCATION PROVISIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b269-14\">\n<em>Nature of the Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Atd\">The plan approved by the Commission provided that each Texas Eastern customer was to receive an annual \u201centitlement\u201d (hereinafter \u201callocated entitlement\u201d) to supersede Texas Eastern\u2019s contract commitment to deliver a specified volume of gas. Each customer\u2019s al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>located entitlement was based initially upon its historical annual purchases of gas from Texas Eastern; upward adjustments from the historical purchase \u201cbaseline\u201d were then made to reflect additional needs of some customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">In the event Texas Eastern\u2019s gas supply did not allow it to fill each customer\u2019s allocated entitlement, the plan provided that further curtailment of deliveries would be accomplished by ratable reductions in allocated entitlements. Small-volume customers, defined as those with contractual entitlements of 10,000 Mcf per day or less, were exempt from daily curtailment below allocated entitlements (Article III). Under Article IV, other customers were eligible to seek an emergency exemption from daily curtailment to avoid jeopardy to residential and commercial loads.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\n<em>Challenges to the Allocation Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Petitioners\u2019 principal challenges to the allocation provisions may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">1. The Commission\u2019s use of historical purchases as the baseline for allocated entitlements was unreasonable in that there was no differentiation among consumptive uses of gas, to the detriment of small-volume customers serving high-priority uses of gas;</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">2. The Commission unreasonably refused to guarantee that the exemption from curtailment below allocated entitlements available to small-volume Texas Eastern customers would be extended to Algonquin customers meeting the qualifying criteria; and</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">3. The Commission erred in refusing to require presentation of the settlement proposal by a sponsoring witness, available for cross-examination as to the methods used to calculate individual adjustments to the historical baseline in determining allocated entitlements, an error which led the Commission to approve the proposal on an inadequate record.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">\n<em>Decision to Disclaim Resolution of Challenges to Allocation Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\"> While some of the petitioners\u2019 objections are not without force, the court concludes that, in light of events occurring since the Commission\u2019s order, including the expiration of the allocation plan in September, 1973, judicial resolution of challenges to the allocation provisions is now inappropriate. The expiration of the plan, and the accompanying inability to change the allocation of gas to customers, does not alone deprive the court of a \u201ccase or controversy\u201d to adjudicate, for the court is empowered to decide the questions presented if they are likely to recur, and their immediate resolution will serve important public interests.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such a course might be appropriate if petitioners challenged the Commission\u2019s power to act, or a basic approach it is likely to follow in future allocation proceedings. But petitioners\u2019 objections cannot be so characterized. The Commission\u2019s power to mandate allocations, upheld by the Supreme Court in FPC v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co., 406 U.S. 621, 92 S.Ct. 1827, 32 L.Ed.2d 369 (1972), is beyond challenge. And subsequent to the approval in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>of what it stressed was an \u201cinterim curtailment settlement,\u201d the Commission has announced a new approach to permanent curtailment plans. For the reasons stated below, we conclude that this later permanent approach makes it unlikely that resolution of petitioners\u2019.particular objections to Texas Eastern\u2019s interim plan would have any significant impact on future allocation proceedings. Accordingly, and in view of our inability to give petitioners meaningful relief even if they should prevail,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we decline to resolve petitioners\u2019 challenges to the allocation provisions. Such a disposition is analogous to a decision to withhold declaratory relief without reaching the merits, as in A. L. Mechling Barge Lines, Inc. v. United States, 368 U.S. 324, 331, 82 S.Ct. 337, 342, 7 L.Ed.2d 317 (1961), where the Supreme Court stated: \u201csound discretion withholds the remedy where it appears that a challenged \u2018continuing practice\u2019 is, at the moment adjudication is sought, undergoing significant modification so that its ultimate form cannot be confidently predicted.\u201d We now set forth in some detail the considerations underlying our decision to disclaim determination of petitioners\u2019 challenges to the allocation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\n<em>Commission Statement of Policy of January 8, 1973</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Subsequent to its order of December 1, 1972, approving Texas Eastern\u2019s interim allocation plan, the Commission issued Order No. 467,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> dated January 8, 1973, a Statement of Policy, which advised pipelines that the Commission would in the future favor allocation plans that discriminate among end-uses of natural gas with \u201chigh-priority\u201d users protected from curtailment until lower-priority users were without gas entirely. Order 467 contains eight categories of consumptive uses, ranked in the order in which they will be protected from disruption due to shortage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In its order of January 24, 1973, denying petitioners\u2019 application for rehearing, the Commission provided that Texas Eastern\u2019s filing for a curtailment plan to become effective September 1, 1973, should take into account the policies set forth in Order No. 467, and include detailed submissions so that end-use determinations can be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">While providing that \u201cin specific cases, opportunity will be afforded interested parties to challenge or support this policy,\u201d Order 467 plainly- evinces the Commission\u2019s intention to adopt, at least as a point of departure, the approach based upon end-use priorities when reviewing future allocation plans submitted for approval. In its January 24, 1973, order denying rehearing on Texas Eastern\u2019s interim curtailment plan, the Commission (at p. 9) drew attention to the newly-promulgated Order 467 and directed Texas Eastern to consider end-use priorities in the preparation of a permanent curtailment plan. More recently, the principle of designating end-use priorities has been reflected in permanent plans approved since promulgation of Order 467. <em>See </em>United Gas Pipe Line Co., 49 FPC 179 (1973), modified, 49 FPC 1211 (1973); El Paso Natural Gas Co., Opinion No. 697, June 14, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>\n<em>Use of Historical Purchases As Baseline for All Customers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Petitioners contend that the Commission\u2019s use of historical purchases as the baseline for allocated entitlements to all customers constitutes an unreasonable discrimination against small-volume Texas Eastern customers, having a low ratio of historical purchases to contract entitlements but serving end-uses deserving the highest degree of protection from curtailment. The outcome is most egregious, petitioner MDG contends, because the allocated entitlements of industrial customers are boosted by past purchases of gas made on an interrupti-ble basis \u2014 deliveries ordinarily made by a pipeline only when the needs of higher-priority customers have been fully met.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">We perceive some merit in the contention that an approach that is blind to the differing degrees of hardship disruption of service may impose on different customers may constitute an unreasonable abandonment of reasoned inquiry merely for the sake of a convenient \u201crule of thumb.\u201d At the same time, we discern in the provisions for exemption of small-volume customers from daily curtailment below allocated entitlements, and the emergency exemption for others,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a sensitivity to special hardships worked by curtailment. In addition, in its order denying rehearing, the Commission addressed MDG\u2019s contention that high-priority uses had been given short shrift, stating: \u201cWhile it may be true, as MDG contends, that Texas Eastern\u2019s larger customers will use part of their allotments for industrial purposes, the record indicates that this is the intent of the smaller customers also.\u201d Finally, the Commission noted that extraordinary relief under \u00a7 1.-7(b) of its rules was available to customers having special hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">A more currently relevant consideration, however, is that the policy outlined in Order 467 meets the concern which petitioners raise. So long as the Commission continues to focus attention on establishing end-use priorities, there is little prospect of a recurring claim that it has been blinded by historical usage alone.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, we see no warrant for a declaration as to the validity of the technique employed in Texas Eastern\u2019s interim, and now expired, curtailment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">\n<em>Refusal to Mandate Exemption for Algonquin Customers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">Similar considerations govern our treatment of the objection raised by small-volume Algonquin customers to the Commission\u2019s refusal to guarantee them the same exemption from curtailment below allocated entitlements that was granted their counterparts purchasing directly from Texas Eastern. The Commission\u2019s response to the small-volume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Algonquin customers\u2019 demands for a guarantee of equal treatment was a statement that Algonquin\u2019s allocation should be examined separately, notwithstanding the fact that Algonquin obtains its entire supply from Texas Eastern, in view of the Commission\u2019s policy that each pipeline must be \u201cresponsible for its own curtailment plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">We are concerned about the possibility that a rigid procedure of \u201cone pipeline at a time\u201d may, as a practical matter, foreclose equal treatment of substantially equal customers, identical except for the fact that some customers purchase directly and others through a major \u201ccustomer\u201d pipeline. Refusal to provide for the interests of the indirect purchasers in the initial proceeding raises serious problems, unless justified by overriding considerations of administrative necessity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In Order 467, however, the Commission has acknowledged that discrimination among end-uses requires equal treatment of direct and indirect purchasers having consumptive uses of the same priority, and we read its provisions as eschewing an inflexible rule that truncates the inquiry regardless of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\n<em>Hearing Procedures and Record</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A6f\"><em>At </em>this juncture we think it appropriate to say that the record in this case is not free from difficulty. The allocated entitlements arrived at in the course of settlement negotiations consisted of historical purchase baselines and individual adjustments to take care of special needs. Municipal Defense Group asserted a need to cross-examine a sponsoring witness to determine the extent of individual adjustments to the baselines and the reasons for making them; the Administrative Law Judge ruled that submission of interrogatories were adequate. We have some doubt that the interrogatory responses filed by Texas Eastern and affidavits in the record sufficiently disclose the basis for individual adjustments to permit a conclusion that the Commission, by its adoption of the settlement proposal, has \u201cgenuinely engaged in reasoned decision-making.\u201d Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, 143 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 393, 444 F.2d 841, 851 (1970), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2229, 2233, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">It appears, at least upon an initial examination of the record, that the reasons for some adjustments are rather vaguely described as \u201cto reflect historical purchase patterns,\u201d that there is frequently no identification of controlling factors \u2014 such as nature of end use, the importance of end use to ultimate consumers or to the community at large, or the date of a commitment \u2014 that impelled adjustment, and that adjustments were in some instances made upon data submitted to Texas Eastern and not contained in the record.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">The difficulties for the reviewing court presented when the record fails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>disclose with unmistakable clarity the reasons for the governing provisions of the agency\u2019s action are exacerbated where, as here, the terms of its order have originated in proceedings from which some affected parties have been excluded. <em>Compare </em>Mobil Oil Corp. v. FPC, 157 U.S.App.D.C. 235, 483 F.2d 1238 (1973). The Commission\u2019s desire for the expedition afforded by settlement proposals, even non-unanimous ones, is understandable, particularly where it is concerned with provisions having a quite temporary life. Nevertheless, the encouragement of settlement agreements gives rise to a complementary obligation to avoid the appearance as well as the reality of special favoritism, by insuring that the basis for action taken is placed on the record for all parties to see.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The need for an adequate record is not rigidly tied to particular procedures. Our cases have consistently held that the procedures required are those appropriate to the issues raised. <em>See e. g., </em>American Airlines, Inc. v. CAB, 123 U.S.App.D.C. 310, 359 F.2d 624, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 843, 87 S.Ct. 73, 17 L.Ed. 2d 75 (1966); International Harvester Co. v. Ruckelshaus, 155 U.S.App.D.C. 411, 478 F.2d 615 (1973). <em>Sua sponte </em>inquiry by the agency may, under certain circumstances, provide the requisite clarity quite as well as the full-dress evidentiary hearing demanded by Municipal Distributors Group here. We do caution, however, that the decision in Pennsylvania Gas &amp; Water Co. v. FPC, 150 U.S.App.D.C. 151, 463 F.2d 1242 (1972), which upheld the Commission\u2019s approval of a non-unanimous settlement proposal on a record consisting only of written submissions, is not to be taken as an invitation to dispense with further inquiry whenever the Commission can find some level of descriptive fact at which all parties agree.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> When important decisions turn on the particular weight to be attributed to certain facts, the Commission may have a duty to probe beyond \u201ccanned\u201d writings or to allow the parties to illuminate the issues through exposure to questioning designed to separate inferences from hard data and ventilate interpretative assumptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Having identified some difficulties, we decline to determine whether, as petitioners argue, the record and the procedures used to compile it are fatally deficient. Claims such as these will undoubtedly arise again as the Commission approves permanent allocation plans, but they are invariably tied closely to the record and circumstances of the particular case in which they arise. Even if petitioners should prevail, our decision would contribute little in the way of general guidance relevant to future proceedings. Accordingly, it would not be a productive judicial exercise to unravel the record in order to reach the merits.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">III. CHANGES IN TEXAS EASTERN\u2019S RATE TARIFFS</p>\n<p id=\"Axi\">The rate change to which petitioners object relieves Texas Eastern of the obligation to refund demand charges when it is unable to meet contractual commitments because of a shortage of its supply. Many, although not all, Texas Eastern customers pay a two-part rate, consisting of a \u201cdemand charge\u201d and a \u201ccommodity charge.\u201d The customer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>pays a demand charge for the right to demand a specified volume of gas daily; once fixed by the customer\u2019s maximum daily entitlement, the charge does not vary with the amount of gas consumed. The separate commodity charge is assessed for each unit of gas delivered to the customer. Prior to the modification here at issue, Texas Eastern\u2019s tariff provided for refunding at least a portion of the demand charge when a customer\u2019s demand for his entire daily entitlement could not be met.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The tariff change approved by the Commission relieves Texas Eastern of this obligation if its failure to deliver is attributable to a supply shortage.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Petitioners contend that relieving Texas Eastern of the refund obligation while at the same time permitting it to make deliveries below contractual entitlements is patently unreasonable and contrary to the Natural Gas Act. The reasonableness of the Commission\u2019s action must be assessed in light of its economic effects. <em>See </em>Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U.S. 747, 790-792, 88 S. Ct. 1344, 20 L.Ed.2d 312 (1968). We turn to an assessment of these.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The tariff change permits a <em>de facto </em>increase in the average price of gas to any customer paying a demand charge, the amount of the increase dependent upon the amount of gas received and the amount by which gas delivered falls short of a quantity demanded pursuant to the contract. The Commission found that Texas Eastern would not recover its fixed costs at the rates then prevailing so long as a shortage reduced the amount of gas available for sale, and accordingly concluded that the price increase effected by the tariff change was justified in order to mitigate the pipeline\u2019s revenue loss. Petitioners do not dispute that the price increase is cost-based,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> but contend that loss of revenue resulting from supply shortage should be borne by pipeline investors. Petitioners support this contention by referring to decisions of the Commission in past years which identified the risk of a shortfall in supply of gas as a factor justifying increments to the rate of return.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">Whether a price adjustment ought to be allowed to protect investors involves a \u201cbalancing of the investor and the consumer interests\u201d that is entrusted to the Commission. FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U.S. 591, 603, 64 S.Ct. 281, 288, 88 L.Ed. 333 (1944). Here the Commission was engaged in an exercise of discretion when it held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the emergency and severity of the shortfall warranted a price increase, a position it maintained with the comment that investors still bore losses of fixed costs ordinarily recovered through a component of the commodity charge, which it was leaving undisturbed. Considerations like these are peculiarly a matter for appraisal by the administrative agency and we do not discern the kind of unreasonableness that would warrant judicial intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Petitioners object in broad terms to a \u201cbreach of contract,\u201d but there has been here no unilateral attempt by the pipeline to modify a fixed-price contract with a customer, as was the case in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U.S. 332, 76 S.Ct. 373, 100 L.Ed. 373 (1956). In its order denying rehearing the Commission characterized the arrangements between Texas Eastern and its customers as contracts like those considered in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div., 358 U.S. 103, 79 S.Ct. 194, 3 L.Ed.2d 153 (1958), agreements to provide service at whatever rates are lawfully in effect under the Natural Gas Act. This characterization has not been contested.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The conclusion that the price increase is cost-based does not necessarily dispose of all questions of validity of rates under the Act. To avoid any inference that the court is approving all aspects of the rate schedule, we identify a problem raised by the court at oral argument, whether the Commission\u2019s order is not subject to challenge because it distributes the burden of the increase unevenly among Texas Eastern's customers: There is relative advantage (a) for those customers which pay no demand charge, and (b) among the purchasers paying the demand charge, for those who receive substantially their entire contract demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">To determine whether such discriminatory effects of a broadside cancellation of a demand charge refund obligation would be justified is a question we do not reach, because of the petitioners\u2019 failure to present it in their objections to the Commission. Section 19(b) of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(b), provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">[n]o objection to the order of the Commission shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the Commission in the application for rehearing unless there is reasonable ground for failure so to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">The purpose of this provision is to insure that the Commission has an opportunity to deal with any difficulties presented by its action before the reviewing court intervenes. FPC v. Colorado Interstate Gas Co., 348 U.S. 492, 75 S.Ct. 467, 99 L.Ed. 583 (1955). This exhaustion requirement comports with the general function of judicial review to insure that an agency has \u201ctaken a \u2018hard look\u2019 at the salient problems.\u201d Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, 143 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 393, 444 F.2d 841, 851 (1970), cert, denied, 403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2229, 2233, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971). The agency cannot reasonably be expected to take a hard look unless the parties participate in the task of identifying the hard problems, and of bringing to light pertinent information and analysis bearing on their resolution. The agency\u2019s obligation presupposes a burden on the part of interested parties to draw attention to the consequences of proposed action that adversely affects their interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">The objections to the demand charge that were submitted to the Commission, which parallel those presented to this court on appeal, failed to meet this burden. On appeal, MDG\u2019s objections appear in its Brief (p. 48 ff) under the caption: \u201cIt is unlawful to permit Texas Eastern to collect a demand charge for gas it is not delivering.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> MDG <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>asserts that the FPC has unlawfully ignored the interests of consumers, an argument highlighted by reference to the circumstance that purchasers must not only bear the higher price of gas to Texas Eastern, but also expend substantial sums for substitute fuel when deliveries are curtailed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Objections like these have a ring of eloquence, but they are, in effect, a contention that the monetary consequences of a shortfall of gas must be borne by the investors. These objections simply do not focus on discriminatory impact of the Commission\u2019s action as between different purchasers.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It would be contrary to the purpose of \u00a7 19(b), and the concept of exhaustion of administrative remedies, to accept such a broadside objection as sufficient to alert the Commission to particular and possibly remediable problems. We are precluded by \u00a7 19(b) from pursuing the discriminatory problem we have identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">-\u00bb * \u2022&gt;:\u2022 * * -\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">For the reasons stated in Part II, <em>supra, </em>we decline to reach the merits as to the allocation provisions of the Commission\u2019s order.

While courts have treated these matters under the single rubric of mootness, <em>e. g., </em>United States v. W. T.

There appear to be no related issues on which the validity of the allocation provisions might bear. Petitioners do not allege the existence of any contract remedies, as in Monsanto Co. v.

Once a purchaser's end-uses have been identified and classified, a question may still arise as to whether its gas \u201cneeds\u201d are more appropriately measured by its contract entitlement or the volume of gas it has historically purchased. The Commission has not used a rigid rule; in some cases it has found contract entitlement appropriate, while in others it has found historical purchase a better indicator of uses which can least withstand disruption. Although the petitioners here have contract entitlements exceeding their historical purchases, this is not always the case; the Commission has on occasion found that customers consistently buying gas in excess of the contractual amount had expectations of continued service warranting protection from the effect of shortage. <em>Compare </em>El Paso Natural Gas, <em>supra, </em>Order 697 at 20-21 &amp; 29 <em>with </em>United Gas Pipe Line Co., <em>supra, </em>49 FPC at 1219. We advert to these findings as illustrative of the point that the reasonableness of a choice between contract entitlement and historical purchases may depend upon the particular circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">Insofar as petitioners object to the use ot historical purchases in arriving at. their allocated entitlements, an assessment of that claim would require a detailed review of the record, which we decline to undertake for the reasons stated in the last paragraph of Part II of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b273-6\">. The Commission may have had in mind such considerations, although their force in this case is diluted by the consolidation of proceedings on curtailment plans for Texas Eastern and Algonquin. The Commission denied a motion by Algonquin to sever proceedings, reasoning that since \u201cAlgonquin\u2019s supply will be directly affected by the decision rendered in the Texas Eastern Proceeding. ... a decision in the Algonquin proceeding could be rendered simultaneously with a decision in the Texas Eastern case.\u201d Order of December 23, 1971, at 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b273-7\">. These difficulties cannot simply be waived away by the observation that disappointed customers can apply for extraordinary relief if their allocated entitlements are insufficient to cover gas \u201cneeds.\u201d A firm\u2019s gas \u201cneeds\u201d are determined, in the final analysis, by application of standards set by the Commission. A gas distributor, and the ultimate consumers he serves, have <em>demands </em>for gas. Failure to meet demands may mean a small annoyance for some users, considerable inconvenience for others, and hardship bordering on catastrophe for still others. It is for the Commission to say what demands are so inflexible that they are treated as \u201cneeds,\u201d and the place where the Commission draws the line can be gleaned only from observations about how it treats firms and consumers. Realistically, a firm or consumer cannot assert its \u201cneeds\u201d without some reference to how the Commission has dealt with other claimants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b274-5\">. More recently in Mobil Oil Corp. v. FPC, <em>supra, </em>the court cautioned that \u201cthe Commission would not be free to adopt factual assertions <em>{such as settlement offers) </em>which had not been subject to examination and testing by opposing parties.\u201d [Emphasis added], 157 U.S.App.D.C. at 260 n. 93, 483 F.2d at 1263 n. 93.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b274-6\">. Petitioners also object to the allocation provisions on the ground that small volume customers should be allowed to qualify for the emergency exemption contained in Arti-ele IV as well as the small customer exemption of Article II. Insofar as petitioners assert that they are entitled to the benefit of two provisions designed as alternatives, it appears that they have failed to perceive that the exemptions give relief only from curtailment below allocated entitlements; the entitlements iiroscribed in Article I are not in any event to be exceeded. Since petitioners\u2019 contention turns largely on an interpretation of the plan itself, we decline to pass upon it for the reasons stated above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b275-6\">. The refund was calculated at a rate of 2.7 cents per mef of the deficiency. Municipal Defense Group brief, p. 49.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\">. Texas Eastern\u2019s tariff revision to effect the change, first suspended by the Commission pursuant to \u00a7 4 of the Act, had taken effect in the course of the consolidated proceedings. The settlement proposal presented to the Commission provided that the refund obligation was to be restored and an adjustment of commodity rates made to allow the inpeline to recoup revenue lost by making refunds. Since Texas Eastern had never made the commodity adjustment proposal in a tariff revision filed under \u00a7 4, the Commission saw a statutory bar to making commodity rate changes in its December 1, 1972, order in the provision of \u00a7 5 that the Commission lacks \u201cpower to order any increase in any rate contained in the currently effective schedule ... on file with the Commission, unless such increase is in accordance with a new schedule filed by [a] natural gas company.\u201d Accordingly, the Commission ordered that Texas Eastern would continue to be relieved of its refund obligation until approval of a commodity rate change proposed by the pipeline.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b275-12\">. Although Rhode Island Consumers\u2019 Council quarrels with the evidence in support of the Commission\u2019s action, its contention is that in view of \u201cthe numerous serious questions raised by sister federal agencies of the bona fides of the gas shortage\u201d the Commission erred in relying upon data submitted by Texas Eastern to establish a shortage of its supply. (R.I. Brief at 15). Evidence in the record showed a consistent gap between acquisitions and contract demands during the period 1969-1970, and more recent deficiencies in Texas Eastern\u2019s total supply. (J.A. 1, 235). The Council does not suggest an alternative source of data of greater reliability. IVe do not disturb the Commission\u2019s finding of shortage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\">.

Memorandum of Intervenor on New Issues Raised During Oral Argument at 2 n. 2. This assertion has not been challenged by any petitioner. The application for rehearing submitted by MDG, the only such application in the Joint Appendix filed with the court, parallels the argument made in its brief on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b277-25\">. Petitioners\u2019 final contention is that the Commission\u2019s order is contrary to the Act for its failure to find that Texas Eastern\u2019s existing tariff was \u201cunjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717d. A finding that tracks the statutory language is not accepted without scrutiny beyond the words. Similarly, an order is not invalidated by mere failure to use the magic words. A court may reverse for failure to make a statutory finding <em>in haee verba, </em>when it is doubtful whether the agency took into account the pertinent standard. We have no doubt here that the FPC was aware that the issue was whether Texas Eastern had shown that the existing tariff was unjust or unreasonable. The FPC should have said so expressly, but in this case we think there was \u201charmless error,\u201d not warranting reversal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
