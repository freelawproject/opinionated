Early in that year NASA decided to expand its footage in the structure, and at the same time Keydata was seeking to move to larger quarters in another location. After negotiations in which NASA was represented by the General Services Administration (GSA), an agreement was reached as to NASA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>rental of Keydata\u2019s 2,093 square foot computer room on the first floor (and also other rental space, not now involved). The agreement was embodied in two lease amendments, one between Keydata and Wyman, the other between the Government and Wyman.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These modifications provided that Keydata would surrender possession of the computer room, and the Government would lease it (from Wyman), either on October 1, 1968 or on a date mutually agreeable to Keydata and the Government (with advance notice to Wyman) between August 1, 1968 and January 1, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">The amendments also provided separately for the sale of certain fixtures. The Government promised to pay Wy-man $39,000 for air conditioning equipment which Keydata had installed in the computer room, and Wyman obliged itself in the same amount in payment to Keydata.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These improvements had been installed by Keydata with Wyman\u2019s consent, and the tenant retained the right to remove the equipment so long as the premises were returned to their original condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">The two lease amendments summarized above were executed on March 11, 1968. Keydata and the Government later selected the January 1, 1969 move-in date, by using the mechanism set up in the lease-cum-amendments. There were subsequent exchanges between the parties concerning the move-in date; what was said is a matter of dispute, but it is not now necessary to examine that history.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In any event, both parties agree that Keydata had not vacated by January 1, 1969, and that on the next day GSA sent Keydata a letter informing it \u201cthat the Government hereby cancels the proposed acquisition of 2093 square feet on the first floor at 575 Technology Square, as hitherto provided for under Amendment No. 7 to the above referred to lease. This action is necessary because of the fact that the space above referred to was not available for Government occupancy on January 1, 1969 * * *.\u201d The Government did not pay the $39,000 due under the agreements for the computer room improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-16\">When the Wyman Street Trust refused to take action to collect this sum from the Government, Keydata brought suit against the Trust and its trustees in the Superior Court of the County of Suffolk, Massachusetts. Tried on the pleadings and a stipulation of facts, that action resulted in an order requiring the Wyman Street Trust t\u00f3 assign its rights to the $39,000 under the lease amendment to Keydata, and such an assignment was executed on April 21, 1971. Keydata sues here in place of Wyman and as its assignee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-17\">This suit involves two causes of action. The theory of the first is that Wyman fully performed its obligations as landlord under Massachusetts and federal law, therefore the Government\u2019s recission was illegal, and the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>States now owes the $39,000. The second cause of action claims that in any case the conduct of the Government\u2019s agents constituted a waiver of any obligation on the part of Keydata to vacate by January 1, and that the defendant is estopped from so contending. Both parties have moved for summary judgment, the plaintiff as to its first claim only.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">Defendant asks for summary judgment on both claims, urging as one ground that Wyman\u2019s assignment of its rights to Keydata violated the Assignment of Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 203 (1970), and is therefore void.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">Despite the broad language of the Act, and the courts\u2019 tendency at an earlier time to read it as an all-inclusive prohibition, numerous classes of assignments, although literally within the statutory ambit, have been judicially exempted from its operation. The largest category of excised assignments are those which, in one form or another, occur by operation of law. Various such assignments which are regularly held to be unaffected by the Act include the passage of claims to heirs and devisees (Erwin v. United States, 97 U.S. 392, 397, 24 L.Ed. 1065 (1878)), transfers made incident to proceedings in bankruptcy or receivership (Segal v. Rochelle, 336 F.2d 298, 302 (C.A.5, 1964), aff\u2019d 382 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 511, 15 L.Ed.2d 428 (1966); Danielson v. United States, 416 F.2d 408, 410 (C.A.9, 1969); New Rawson Corp. v. United States, 55 F.Supp. 291, 293 (D.Mass.1943)), transfers by the succession of one business entity for another (Consumers Ice Co. v. United States, 475 F.2d 1161, 1163, 201 Ct.Cl. 116, 119 (1973)), assignments made by judicial sale or order (Price v. Forrest, 173 U.S. 410, 419-425, 19 S.Ct. 434, 43 L.Ed. 749 (1899); 36 Comp.Gen. 157, 158 (1956)), and assignments produced by operation of the law of subro-gation (United States v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., 338 U.S. 366, 376, 70 S.Ct. 207, 94 L.Ed. 171 (1949)). These classes of assignments are all thought to be outside the statute\u2019s scope because none of them threatens the dangers Congress sought to avoid by enacting the prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-10\">Within the past decade this court has once again explained the objectives of the Assignment of Claims Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-11\">The prohibitory language contained in the first paragraph of the statute above dates back in essentially its present form to 1853 (10 Stat. 170, Rev.Stat. \u00a7 3477 (1875)), and originally to an 1846 statute (9 Stat. 41). Over the years it has consistently been recognized by the courts to have two purposes \u2014 primarily, to prevent fraud; and secondarily, to avoid multiple litigation. More specifically, Congress is said to have had- as its major objective the prohibiting of trafficking in claims against the Government such as by persons who would be in a' position to exert political pressure or improper influence in prosecuting claims before the departments, the courts, or the legislature, [citations omitted] Secondarily, the courts have ascribed to Congress the motive of enabling the United States to deal exclusively with the original claimant instead of with several parties, thus obviating the necessity of having to inquire into the validity of specific transfers or assignments of the claim, minimizing subjection to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>successive litigation upon the same claim, and eliminating the risk of double payment or multiple liability, [citations omitted] Patterson v. United States, 354 F.2d 327, 329, 173 Ct.Cl. 819, 822-823 (1965) (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">When an assignment, or class of assignments, has been found not to pose those risks, the Act has ordinarily been held inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-6\">The first significant fact about the assignment of Wyman\u2019s claim against the Government to Keydata is, of course, that it was done under order of the Superior Court of Massachusetts, as a result of an adversary proceeding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In that respect it is very close to the other classes set out above, which have been held not to transgress the Assignment of Claims Act. Like those exempted classes, recognition of the Wyman-Keydata assignment will not frustrate the Congressional objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-7\">For one thing, the court-ordered assignment will not increase the number of parties with whom the Government must deal; as discussed more fully <em>infra, </em>Keydata, not Wyman, is basically, if not technically, the real party in interest; Wyman is involved as a conduit more than anything else. Also, the case presents no real risk of double liability because the court-ordered assignment fully empowers Keydata to \u201cgive releases or discharges\u201d on behalf of Wyman for all or any part of the $39,000 claim. If Keydata should recover on its claim here, it would be a small matter to condition payment of the judgment on the execution of a release binding against Wyman; we have imposed this condition to prevent double recovery. <em>Cf. </em>Carchia v. United States, 485 F.2d 622, 637, 202 Ct.Cl. 723, 740 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-8\">The Government urges that, since the assignment was ordered as part of a suit instigated by Keydata \u201cfor the sole purpose of attempting to circumvent the provisions of the Assignment of Claims Act,\u201d the normal exemption granted to judicially-compelled transfers should not be extended. It is said that the exception should be applied only where the assignment is involuntary, and that the Keydata-Wyman litigation was not defended with sufficient vigor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-9\">The case law does not bear out the first distinction. Among the transfers found not to invoke the Act are those by devise or inheritance, and assignments from a defunct business organization to its substantially identical successor (see <em>supra). </em>These categories have a considerable element of volition, perhaps even more than in the situation before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-10\">As for the second point, we might be persuaded to regard with suspicion some assignments ordered as the product of collusive or sham litigation, but this is not such a case. The Government gives us no good reason to suspect the Keyda-ta-Wyman suit. The mere fact that both parties joined in a stipulation of facts is not enough, especially where the dispute centers on the legal rights arising from essentially uncontested events. The answer filed by Wyman to Keyda-ta\u2019s complaint seems a <em>bona fide </em>adversary response in the context of Wyman\u2019s interest in the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-11\">In any event even if the state action were somehow vulnerable, its only effect was to transfer the right to bring the claim to the basic party in interest. It is clear from the wording of the lease amendments, and the fact of their contemporaneous execution, that Wyman was merely a conduit through which GSA paid Keydata for the leasehold improvements. The tenant asked Wyman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>consent (as required by its lease) before adding the air conditioning equipment, and such consent was apparently given. A letter from Wyman to Keydata at the time it was vacating the computer room stated: \u201cIf you choose to remove [the air conditioning equipment with associated duct work, piping and electrical work] you are, of course, required to restore the premises to their original condition,\u201d thus implying that the tenant had a right to carry away this equipment. The improvements clearly belonged to Keydata, and it was natural that Keydata would be the one to be compensated if the Government, as successor tenant, were to enjoy their use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">As we have said, such a court-ordered assignment, transferring the cause of action from the nominal owner to the beneficial owner, does not go counter to the legislative objectives of the Assignment of Claims Act. A transfer of that kind to the most intimately concerned claimant is unlikely to pose an added danger (and here does not) of fraud in prosecution of the claim,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or of expanding the number of parties with whom the Government must deal, to its prejudice or consternation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">The Government raises another, related objection to the competency of Key-data to bring this suit. It is argued that Wyman was not liable to Keydata for the $39,000 if the Government did not in fact pay it that sum, and that therefore Wyman (in whose shoes Key-data now stands) was not injured by the refusal to pay the money. The contention springs from the wording of this part of the Keydata-Wyman lease amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1184-7\">LESSOR shall not be obligated to make * * * [payment of $39,000] unless and until LESSOR receives such sums from the Government, nor shall LESSOR be liable to LESSEE in any event whatsoever should the Government fail to deliver such sums to LESSOR.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1184-10\">Defendant analogizes the legal situation created by this provision to that in Severin v. United States, 99 Ct.Cl. 435 (1943) cert. denied, 322 U.S. 733, 64 S.Ct. 1045, 88 L.Ed. 1567 (1944), holding that a prime contractor cannot sue for damage suffered by its subcontractor, if the prime contractor is in no way liable or responsible to the subcontractor for its loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-11\">This court has already dealt specifically, in considering the <em>Severin </em>doctrine, with limiting provisions comparable to that in the Wyman-Keydata arrangement. In Donovan Construction Co. v. United States, 149 F.Supp. 898, 900, 138 Ct.Cl. 97, 99, cert. denied, 355 U.S. 826, 78 S.Ct. 34, 2 L.Ed.2d 39 (1957), the prime was liable to the sub for extra work caused by the Government \u201cas and when it is paid therefor by the Principal [Government].\u201d It was held that this did not remove the prime\u2019s obligation to proceed against the Government, administratively and by recourse to the courts, and <em>Severin </em>did not control (149 F.Supp. at 900, 138 Ct.Cl. at 100). The same ruling was made in Barnard-Curtiss Co. v. United States, 301 F.2d 909, 913, 157 Ct.Cl. 103, 111-112 (1962), where the subcontractor released the prime from all liability except as to a claim the latter was pursuing against the United States on behalf of the former; \u201c[a]ny amount which [the prime] receives from the government with respect to [the sub\u2019s] claim is excepted from this release, and [the prime] agrees to forward such sums it may collect when received.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-12\">The holding was reconfirmed in J. L. Simmons Co. v. United States, 304 F.2d 886, 158 Ct.Cl. 393 (1962); there, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>release given by the subcontractor provided that the prime would pursue the sub\u2019s claim but that \u201c[e]ither the disal-lowance of the [sub\u2019s] claim by the court or the payment of the [sub] by [the prime] of the amount, if any, that may be recovered on said claim * * * shall completely extinguish all further obligation of [the prime] to [the sub] under the subcontract * * and shall operate as a full and complete release of any and all liability of [the prime] to the [sub] arising out of the performance by the [sub] of its work under said subcontract\u201d (304 F.2d at 888, 158 Ct.Cl. at 396).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">The court stressed that (a) there was no express negation of the prime\u2019s liability or responsibility on the claim in question, (b) the clauses simply set forth the manner in which the prime\u2019s liability was to be extinguished, (c) the prime assumed the obligation of prosecuting the claim, and that duty would have to be fulfilled before the duty to reimburse the subcontractor for the damages allegedly caused by the Government could be extinguished, and (d) \u201c[i]t is apparent, then, that plaintiff is presently subject to liability on these claims and will continue to be so until liability is extinguished in accord with the method agreed to by the parties\u201d (304 F.2d at 890, 158 Ct.Cl. at 400). <em>See also, </em>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. United States, 419 F.2d 439, 457, 190 Ct.Cl. 211, 241-242 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-8\">The arrangement in the present case falls into this same category. Wyman was not absolved of all responsibility or liability by its agreement with Keydata. As the <em>Donovan </em>opinion put it, there was an implied undertaking \u201cto proceed against the Government\u201d in administrative and judicial proceedings should defendant fail to pay without good cause.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 149 F.Supp. at 900, 138 Ct.Cl. at 99-100. Wyman would not be responsible if the defendant was absolved, or if collection could not be enforced,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but the <em>Donovan </em>opinion recognized that such conditional liability \u201cas a practical matter is perhaps the best that a subcontractor could hope to obtain from the prime contractor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>149 F.Supp. at 900, 138 Ct.Cl. at 99. It does not seem realistic to expect the prime contractor (or here, Wyman) to become an insurer of the defendant\u2019s performance for its subcontractor (here, lessee).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-12\">We conclude therefore that, taking plaintiff\u2019s pleadings and supporting documents at face value, our prior decisions show that Wyman has suffered enough of a legal injury to bring suit, and Key-data, its assignee, may do so in its stead.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-14\">On the merits, there is one important legal issue which can now be resolved. Keydata\u2019s motion for summary judgment asserts that the Government had no legal right to rescind its lease agreement with Wyman, despite plaintiff\u2019s holding-over. The argument is that the lease amendment obligated Wyman to do no more than convey to the Government the right to take possession of the computer room, that Wyman did not explicitly promise to deliver actual possession, and that no such promise can be implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>Keydata\u2019s description of the lack of obligation of a landlord to secure his tenant in possession (in the absence of an express undertaking) is an accurate reflection of the present Massachusetts law. But there is a clear split among the states between the \u201cAmerican\u201d and \u201cEnglish\u201d rules on the liability of a landlord when the demised premises are occupied by a third party at the commencement of the lease term. <em>See </em>49 Am.Jur.2d, Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 217 (1970). Under the so-called \u201cAmerican\u201d rule, the landlord merely covenants that possession will not be withheld by himself or by one having paramount title. <em>Ibid. </em>This is the current rule in Massachusetts. Snider v. Deban, 249 Mass. 59, 144 N.E. 69 (1924). It is sometimes justified on the ground that, since the lessor has conveyed the sole and exclusive right of possession to the new lessee, he cannot maintain an action for possession in his own name. Snider v. Deban, <em>supra, </em>249 Mass, at 66, 144 N.E. at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">The other doctrine, called the \u201cEnglish\u201d rule, requires that, when the lease is silent on the point, the landlord deliver actual possession of the premises at the beginning of the term. 49 Am.Jur. 2d, Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 217, at 235 (1970). The lessee\u2019s rights are based on breach of the lessor's implied covenant that he has a right to lease the premises, or of the implied undertaking that the lessor will deliver possession to the lessee. 2 R. Powell, Real Property (Ro-han ed. 1966) \u00a7 225 [1]. If the lessee cannot take possession because of a holdover tenant, or some other obstructing third person, the landlord is in breach of his obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">This division in view compels us to face the problems of whether we are bound to follow the Massachusetts rule because the real property is located there \u2014 and, if not, what standard to apply. It will prove simpler to reverse these questions and first take up the issue of what rule to adopt if we are free to choose on the merits of the competing principles. In such an area of free choice, we \u201cshould take account of the best in modern decision and discussion\u201d Padbloc Co. v. United States, 161 Ct.Cl. 369, 377 (1963); Groves v. United States, 202 Ct.Cl. 660, 674 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">The American Law Institute\u2019s <em>most </em>recent formulation, accepting the \u201cEnglish\u201d rule, seems to us to represent \u201cthe best in modern decision and discussion.\u201d The Institute\u2019s phrasing (Restatement of the Law, Second, Property, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 6.2, p. 137 (Tent.Draft No. 2, 1974) is this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1186-8\">Except to the extent the parties to the lease validly agree otherwise, there is a breach of the landlord\u2019s obligations if a third person is improperly in possession of the leased property on the date the tenant is entitled to possession and the landlord does not act promptly to remove such person and does not in fact remove him within a reasonable period of time. For such breach, the tenant may</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1186-9\">(1) terminate the lease * * *</p>\n<p id=\"aro-dedup-0\">The Restatement gives persuasive reasons in support of this choice (Restatement of the Law, Second, Property, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 6.2, Comment a, p. 139 (Tent.Draft No. 2,1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1186-11\">(1) The landlord knows, or should know, the status of the possession of the leased property better than the tenant in the period prior to the date the tenant is entitled to possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1186-12\">(2) The landlord knows, or should know, better than the tenant whether a person in possession of the leased property prior to the date the tenant is entitled to possession is properly or improperly on the leased property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1186-13\">(3) Prior to the date the tenant is entitled to possession of the leased property, the landlord is the only one of the two who can evict a person improperly in possession of the leased property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1186-14\">(4) In the situation where the person in possession of the leased property is entitled to be there until the date the tenant is entitled to possession, the case of the possible holdover prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>tenant, the landlord is the only one of the two who had an opportunity to get some assurance that the prior tenant would not hold over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1187-5\">(5) The tenant will have received less than he bargained for if he must go forward with the lease and bear the cost of legal proceedings to clear the way for his entry on the leased property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">This \u201cEnglish\u201d rule conforms to the commonsense notion of what a lease is. The tenant is buying space \u2014 in a building or in the open \u2014 and not merely the right to bring a lawsuit to try to get the space. The \u201cAmerican\u201d (or Massachusetts) rule, on the other hand, rests on an abstruse technicality \u2014 the separation of legal title (which remains in the landlord) from the right to possession (which is conveyed to the new tenant)\u2014 and represents an unfortunate example of mechanical jurisprudence, grinding out a result without any regard for the true interests or policies involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-7\">Plaintiff objects that adoption for federal leases of the rule requiring the landlord to deliver actual possession places a Massachusetts lessor in a dilemma \u2014 he must deliver possession but cannot evict a third party or holdover tenant after the lease term has begun. <em>See </em>Snider v. Deban, <em>supra, </em>249 Mass, at 66, 144 N.E. at 72. As the ALI comment suggests this difficulty is not insuperable. First, a landlord is able to protect himself in the lease document by expressly limiting or disclaiming his obligation to deliver possession, or else by requiring security of a prior tenant in possession that he will not hold over. Second, the landlord may have a remedy in damages against a holdover tenant; such at least is the majority American rule. 49 Am.Jur.2d, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 1123, at 1074 (1970). Third, the landlord is still in a better position to appraise, anticipate and bear the risk of this loss than a prospective tenant not yet in possession. The risk ought to be upon the owner, unless the prospective tenant expressly agrees to shoulder it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-9\">Are we, however, free to elect the \u201cEnglish\u201d rule as a uniform federal standard applicable to government leases in all domestic jurisdictions, including Massachusetts? The states have a considerable interest in the definition of the property interests within their borders, and some aspects of federal law do defer to that concern. <em>See, e. g. </em>Comm\u2019r v. Stern, 357 U.S. 39, 44-45, 78 S.Ct. 1047, 2 L.Ed.2d 1126 (1958); United States v. Bess, 357 U.S. 51, 78 S.Ct. 1054, 2 L.Ed.2d 1135 (1958); United States v. Certain Property, 344 F.2d 142 (C.A.2, 1965). But though a lease may concern and convey a property interest, it is also very much a contract \u2014 and it is settled that the contracts of the Federal Government are normally governed, not by the particular law of the states where they are made or performed, but by a uniform federal law. Padbloc Co. v. United States, 161 Ct.Cl. 369, 377 (1963); United States v. Wegematic Corp., 360 F.2d 674, 676 (C.A.2, 1966); Groves v. United States, 202 Ct.Cl. 660, 674 (1973). Leases are not sufficiently different from other federal procurement contracts to call for a different policy across-the-board in the construction of their terms. At least in this case in which there is no question as to the content of the property interest transferred, but merely a delineation of one of the landlord\u2019s collateral obligations, there is no adequate reason to subordinate federal to state law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is true that in Security Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. United States, 357 F.2d 145, 148-149 (C.A.5, 1966), the court applied Alabama law to a federal lease, but it did so only after finding that, in that particular, Alabama law fully conformed to the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d and \u201cgeneral contract law\u201d which would normally apply against private citizens in the same cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>cumstances; in effect the court applied the accepted, general rule, not a special or unusual state doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-4\">The Federal Government\u2019s need for a uniform rule is strong. It ought to know in advance what its rights are if the premises are not available on the due date. But there are many jurisdictions in which it is not yet firmly established whether the \u201cAmerican\u201d or the \u201cEnglish\u201d rule controls, and the Government would either have to litigate or take a substantial chance on its position. On the other hand, as we have already indicated, the interest of the state in the landlord\u2019s obligation if the premises are unavailable seems to us minor, and relatively unconnected with its concern with the definition of property interests within its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">We hold, therefore, that we are free to disregard the Massachusetts rule, and we do so \u2014 for the reasons we have given \u2014in favor of the \u201cEnglish\u201d rule as set forth in the Restatement, as the appropriate standard for government leases. Accordingly, we deny the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment, grant on this ground the defendant\u2019s motion as to the first cause of action, and dismiss that portion of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-7\">This does not mean that the case can be disposed of now. There is a clear dispute, requiring resolution at the level of the trial division, as to whether the Government acquiesced in plaintiff\u2019s delay in making the computer room available, or extended its time for moving out, so that the defendant is now es-topped from saying that January 1st was the crucial date (this is plaintiff\u2019s second cause of action). The Government seeks summary judgment on this point also, but is obviously not entitled to it in view of the clear factual conflict. With respect to this claim, the defendant\u2019s motion is denied without prejudice and the case is remanded to the trial division to determine the facts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1188-9\">The result on the whole case is that the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted as to the first claim but only on the ground that under the controlling rule the landlord was normally required to make the premises available to the Government on January 1st, and is otherwise denied as to both claims. The plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the first claim of the petition is denied and that claim is dismissed. The second claim is remanded to the trial division for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1180-13\">. Formerly known as Charles W.

There is, of course, no suggestion that Key-data has sought or is likely to exert improper influence on the handling of the claim, or that it could do so. The state court supervision of the assignment is warrant against that likelihood, as is Keydata\u2019s pre-existing substantial interest in the claim.
