Trial was had before the Vigo County Superior Court which ordered that appellant be delivered up to Sheriff Bilyeu, the agent of Tennessee, to be transported to that state.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj6\">Appellant sets out various assignments of error in his motion for new trial some of which he fails to argue on this appeal. The law is clear that grounds urged in a motion for new trial, not discussed in the argument section of the brief, are deemed waived. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State </em>(1969), 252 Ind. 161, 247 N. E. 2d 76; <em>Short </em>v. <em>State </em>(1968), 250 Ind. 459, 237 N. E. 2d 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">The two principal contentions advanced by argument in appellant\u2019s brief relate to errors occurring at trial. It is further argued that the decision of the trial court is contrary to law in that the extradition papers were allegedly deficient under the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act (Ind. Ann. Stat. \u00a7\u00a79-419-448 [1956 Repl.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">Looking first to the errors alleged to have occurred at trial, appellant argues that highly prejudicial hearsay evidence was allowed to be entered over his objection. More specifically it is contended that appellant was denied the right to confront and cross-examine an identifying witness whose affidavit was admitted in the record. The affidavit complained of was that of one Jewell Allison who swore that appellant was in Tennessee and had defrauded her of $6,000. Additionally she swore that she had identified a picture of defendant as being the same man who defrauded her and that such picture was attached to her statement.</p>\n<p id=\"Atae\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Appellant cites as authority for the exclusion of the affidavit cases and other reference works which merely reaffirm the general rule that an accused has the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses against him. This rule is so well established and basic to this country\u2019s concepts of ordered liberty and due process that we need not be reminded of its significance to an accused. Inquiry in a habeas corpus proceeding pursuant to extradition is limited, however, to identifying the alleged fugitive as being one and the same individual as charged in the indictment or affidavit accompanying the requisition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-7\">\u201cThe guilt or innocence of the accused as to the crime of which he is charged may not be inquired into by the governor or in any proceeding after the demand for extradition accompanied by a charge of crime in legal form as above provided shall have been presented to the governor, <em>except </em>that as it may be involved in identifying the <em>person held </em>as the <em>person charged with the crime.\u201d </em>(emphasis added) Ind. Ann. Stat. \u00a79-438 (1956 Repl.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"As\">See also, <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Burke, Deputy Sheriff, etc. </em>(1958), 238 Ind. 1, 148 N. E. 2d 413; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1938), 213 Ind.. 640, 13 N. E. 2d 954. Thus, evidence relating to the various aspects of petitioner\u2019s probable guilt or innocence has been properly excluded by this .court on previous occasions. <em>Gluff </em>v. <em>Rouls, Superintendent, Indianapolis Police Dept. </em>(1950), 228 Ind. 186, 91 N. E. 2d 176; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Rodger, Sheriff </em>(1939), 215 Ind. 500, 20 N. E. 2d 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">In the instant case therefore, the issue is not whether petitioner could have been in the state so as to commit the crime, but rather is whether the man sought to be extradited is indeed the same man arrested under the warrant. To consider if petitioner could have been in the state or otherwise available to commit the alleged crime goes to the merits of the case on the issue of alibi. Consequently, to entertain evidence at a habeas corpus proceeding which tends to establish petitioner\u2019s presence elsewhere at the time of the offense is to give him a de facto trial on the merits prior to extradition.</p>\n<p id=\"AP9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Keeping in mind the nature and scope of a habeas corpus proceeding relative to an arrest pursuant to extradition, it must also be noted that the usual rules of evidence are not applicable. <em>Notter </em>v. <em>Beasley, Sheriff of Vigo County </em>(1960), 240 Ind. 631, 166 N. E. 2d 643, and numerous cases there cited. See also 93 A. L. R. 2d 912. This being the law, the affidavit of Jewell Allison with the accompanying photograph identified to be that of appellant was competent evidence to establish appellant\u2019s identity. <em>Notter </em>v. <em>Beasley, supra. </em>In fact it appears that appellant admitted at the hearing that the photograph was in fact one of him.</p>\n<p id=\"AD6\">Appellant next contends that the trial court erred in overruling his objections to the purported telephone conversation had between Raymond Tryon, witness for appellee and a person presumed to have been Sheriff Bilyeu of Putnam County, Cookeville, Tennessee. It is argued that such evidence is inadmissible unless a foundation first be laid as to the identity of the person with whom the witness was speaking. However, we need not determine whether such evidence was improperly admitted. Appellant fails to show in what manner such evidence prejudiced his case. Further, his identity had already been established by his own admission that it was indeed his picture that the affiant, Jewell Allison, had identified. Consequently, the admission of the testimony relating to the telephone conversation, <em>if improper </em>would be harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">Appellant\u2019s final argument is that the trial court\u2019s decision is contrary to law in that the extradition papers were deficient. The Uniform Criminal Extradition Act provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMd\">\u201cNo demand for the extradition of a person charged with crime in another state shall be recognized by the governor unless in writing and accompanied by a copy of an indictment found or by an information supported by affidavit in the state having jurisdiction of the crime, or by a copy of an affidavit made before a magistrate there, together with a .copy of any warrant which was issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>thereon. The indictment, information, or affidavit made before the magistrate must substantially charge the person demanded with having .committed a crime under the law of that state; and the copy must be authenticated by the executive authority making the demand, which shall be prima facie evidence of its truth.\u201d Ind. Ann. Stat. \u00a7 9-421 (1956 Repl.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Also:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-6\">\u201cA warrant of extradition shall not be issued unless the documents presented by the executive authority making the demand show that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">1. Except in cases arising under section six [\u00a7 9-424], the accused was present in the demanding state at the time of the .commission of the alleged crime, and thereafter fled from the state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-8\">2. The accused is now in this state, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANm\">3. He is lawfully charged by indictment found or by information filed by a prosecuting officer and supported by affidavit to the facts, or by affidavit made before a magistrate in that state, with having committed a crime under the laws of that state, or that he has been convicted of a crime in that state and has escaped from confinement or broken his parole.\u201d Ind. Ann. Stat. \u00a7 9-423 (1956 Repl.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">The warrant of extradition is alleged, by appellant, to be insufficient in the present case since: (1) there is nothing contained therein stating or showing that the accused was in the demanding state of Tennessee at the time of the alleged offense by way of sworn document; (2) that the document entitled \u201cState Warrant\u201d fails to allege that the acts complained of constitute an unlawful act; (3) the person signing the \u201cState Warrant\u201d is in no manner identified as being a prosecuting officer; (4) that the requisition documents do not contain any affidavit, information or indictment on which to base a warrant of extradition; (5) that nowhere in the documents contained in the Governor\u2019s Warrant of Extradition is there any allegation that a felony, or even a misdemeanor had been committed in Tennessee; and (6) that the \u201cState Warrant\u201d is so vague that it does not properly allege a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"ABPA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Upon a careful examination of the extradition papers properly made a part of the record in this case, it is our conclusion that appellant\u2019s contentions as to their sufficiency are completely without merit. All of appellant\u2019s points relating to the deficiency of the extradition papers will be dealt with in the order presented above:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-4\">(1) the statute [\u00a79-423] requires that the documents presented by the executive authority of the demanding state show that the accused was present in that state at the time the alleged offense was committed and thereafter fled. It is clear from the affidavit of the prosecuting attorney, sworn to before a notary public and attached to the governor\u2019s demand that appellant was present at the time the offense was committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">(2) it is not a statutory requirement that the \u201cState Warrant\u201d allege that the act complained of constitute an unlawful act. Section 4-923(3) requires only that the documents filed show that the person sought has been lawfully charged with having committed a crime under the laws of that state. The \u201cState Warrant\u201d in addition to all supporting documents clearly satisfies this requirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\">(3) the statute does not require that the prosecuting attorney sign the \u201cState Warrant.\u201d The supporting papers accompanying the governor\u2019s demand include an affidavit by Jewell Allison <em>made before the Judge of Putnam </em>County, <em>Tennessee. </em>Clearly this satisfies \u00a7 9-423(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">(4) the statutory requirement that the demand be accompanied by a copy of an indictment found <em>or </em>by an information supported by affidavit in the state having jurisdiction <em>or </em>by a copy of an affidavit made before a magistrate [\u00a7 9-421] is satisfied by the affidavit of Jewell Allison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">(5) the contention that nowhere in the documents contained in the Governor\u2019s Warrant of Extradition is there an allegation that a felony, or even a misdemeanor has been committed in Tennessee is wholly frivolous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-9\">(6) appellant fails to show in what manner the \u201cState Warrant\u201d is vague. It is manifestly evident to this court that the offense and its nature have been properly alleged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">There being no merit to those errors assigned and argued by appellant, the decision of the trial court is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj39\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Arterburn, Givan, DeBruler, JJ., concur; Jackson, J., dissents with opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Dissenting</p>\n<author id=\"b762-5\">Jackson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVo\">I am unable to concur in the majority opinion herein and dissent thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The State of Tennessee attempted to extradite the appellant on an alleged .criminal charge and appellant brought a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Vigo Superior Court.

The Court erred in allowing the contents of a telephone conversation of witness, Raymond Tryon, detective for the City of Terre Haute, Indiana, to an alleged person in the State of Tennessee, identified by witness Tryon as a law officer from said State, over plaintiff\u2019s objection that the conversation of the alleged person from Tennessee as related by detective Tryon was hearsay. A Motion To Strike in this regard was overruled by the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-8\">C. That the Court erred in admitting into evidence the testimony of witness Raymond Tryon, over objection of plaintiff that this testimony was hearsay evidence; such testimony being that a photograph of the plaintiff herein, taken by the Terre Haute police department, was sent by witness Raymond Tryon, to the Sheriff of Putnam County, Tennessee, for identification, and that the picture was identified as being the plaintiff herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-9\">D. The Court erred in admitting into evidence defendant\u2019s Exhibit, over plaintiff\u2019s objections thereto, for the reason that the photograph and attached papers to said Exhibit were in no manner authenticated nor was there a proper foundation laid for each or any of said documents and photographs admitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-10\">E.

The Court erred in overruling plaintiff\u2019s Motion to Stay Order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>5. The Court erred in overruling plaintiff\u2019s Petition for Reconsideration of trial Judge\u2019s order in denying petitioner\u2019s Motion to Stay order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">WHEREFORE, the plaintiff prays the Court for a new trial of this cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\"><em>Woodrow S.

Defendant failed to sustain its burden to prove by preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff is the same person sought by the State of Tennessee by its requisition and demand, and by the warrant upon requisition by the Governor of the State of Indiana; by reason that the prima facie case established as a matter of law wherein the name on the Governor\u2019s warrant and the name of plaintiff herein are the same, was overcome by plaintiff testifying that he was not one and the same person requisitioned nor was he in the demanding State at the time of alleged offense, and that the burden of identification shifted back to defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-16\">5.

The indictment, information, or affidavit made before the magistrate must substantially charge the person demanded with having committed a crime under the law of that state; and the copy must be authenticated by the executive authority making the demand, which shall be prima facie evidence of its truth.

He is lawfully charged by indictment found or by information filed by a prosecuting officer and supported by affidavit to the facts, or by affidavit made before a magistrate in that state, with having committed a crime under the laws of that state, or that he has been convicted of a crime in that state and has escaped from confinement or broken his parole. (Acts 1935, ch. 49, \u00a7 5, p. 134)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-14\">The warrant of extradition herein issued by the Governor of the State of Indiana was issued on insufficient documents contained in the requisition papers, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-15\">(1) There is nothing contained therein (Tr. p. 58 to Tr. p. 64) stating that the accused was in the demanding State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>of Tennessee at the time of the alleged offense by way of any sworn document. Burns\u2019 9-423 (1) states that such documents must \u2018show\u2019 the accused was in the demanding State at the time of the commission of the alleged crime. There is no paper within said documents from the State of Tennessee, which has been sworn to by a Prosecuting Officer that the accused herein was in the demanding State at the time of the alleged crime of Larceny By Trick on or about the 18th day of October, 1967. The only reference made of the accused being allegedly within the State of Tennessee at the time of the alleged crime is in the page containing the Request of the Governor of Tennessee to the Governor of Indiana which is no more than an unverified allegation of such (Tr. p. 59).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-4\">(2) That the document self-identified as a \u2018State Warrant\u2019 in no manner alleges or states that the alleged facts therein constitute an unlawful act, or that such was a violation of the laws of the State of Tennessee, as required by Uniform Extradition Act as adopted by the State of Indiana.

He is lawfully charged by indictment found or by information filed by a <em>prosecuting officer </em>and supported by affidavit to the facts. . . . (Acts 1935, ch. 49, \u00a7 5, p. 134) (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-10\">(4) That the requisition documents do not contain any affidavit, information or indictment on which to base a warrant of extradition as is necessary under the Uniform Extradition Act as adopted by the State of Indiana. (Tr. pp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Burns\u2019 Indiana Statutes, Anno. 9-421. Acts 1985, ch. 49, \u00a7 3, p. 134.) The application for a requisition (Tr. p. 61) states that there is a certified copy of an indictment attached thereto, on which said requisition is being made, but an examination of the documents contained in the Governor\u2019s Warrant (Tr. pp. 58-64) results in one being unable to find such. Appellant contends that this is a fatal omission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-4\">The ruling of <em>Dawson </em>v. <em>Beasley, </em>242 Ind. 536, 180 N. E. 2d 367, that the lack of an indictment in the requisition papers, to wit, a complaint, has no application herein, by reason that there are no such supporting documents in the case herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-5\">(5) That nowhere in the documents contained in the Governor\u2019s Warrant of Extradition is there any allegation that a felony, or even a misdemeanor, had been committed within and against the State of Tennessee. (Tr. pp. 58-64). The Uniform Extradition Act, as adopted in the State of Indiana, was adopted to expedite the extradition of persons sought to the demanding state wherein they have been charged with a crime. In this case, there is no crime charged against the State of Tennessee; hence, no basis for use of the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-6\">(6) That the \u2018State Warrant\u2019 is so vague that it does not properly allege a crime. (Tr. p. 62).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-7\">The Uniform Extradition Act was not adopted to be haphazardly followed, but serves as a legal guideline for the courts to follow in extraditing fugitives from justice. The courts are bound to demand some positive identification of the person before it being the one sought, if the petitioner overcomes the prima facie aspects of the Warrant of Extradition. In the instant case, Appellant overcame such prima facie identification, by testifying that he was not the \u2018James Russell Sumner\u2019 sought by said Warrant, nor was he ever in the State of Tennessee. (Tr. p. 51, 11. 19-23. Tr. p. 52, 1.1) Hence the burden shifted to the Appellee to properly identify Appellant as the one sought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-8\">The Uniform Extraditoin Act, as adopted by the State of Indiana, liberalizes certain procedural features, <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>215 Ind. 500, 20 N. E. 2d 933, but the documents received by the Governor of Indiana from the Demanding State must contain certain basic elements before a prima facie case can be made against the alleged person sought. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Rodgers, Supra., </em>U. S. Const. Art. 4, \u00a7 2, 7 FCA, til. 18, \u00a7 662.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Even the liberal interpretation made in <em>Notter </em>v. <em>Beasley, </em>240 Ind. 631, 166 N. E. 2d 643, wherein it was held that if the person being sought has the same name as petitioner, then a prima facie case of identity was established, does not apply herein. When appellant overcame the rebuttable presumption by his testimony as above stated, (Tr. p. 51, 11, 12-27. Tr. p. 52, 11, 1-2) then the entire Governor\u2019s Warrant was otherwise insufficient to establish identity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-4\">It is submitted that for the Court to have allowed the Governor\u2019s Warrant into evidence in the first instance, over appellant\u2019s objections, that he was denied Due Process of Law, and secondly, for the Court to make the judgment which it did, based upon an incomplete and inadequate Warrant of Extradition, that such was contrary to law in Indiana.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">I am of the opinion the court committed error in denying the application for a writ of habeas corpus and that the judgment of the Vigo Superior Court should be reversed and cause remanded with instructions to grant the writ to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Note. \u2014 Eeported in 256 N.
