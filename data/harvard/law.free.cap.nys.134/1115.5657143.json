The signs were made under a contract which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-18\">\u201c150 signs to be delivered <em>at once </em>and balance in three months from date of order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1139-19\">The contract was dated March 3, 1911. The plaintiff offered to deliver the goods bn April 6, 1911. The defendants refused to accept them, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-20\">\u201cIt\u2019s too late now, as my man is out on the road.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1139-21\">The evidence showed that these signs were to be used by the defendants\u2019 salesman for distribution among the Eastern trade. The contract specified that the delivery should be made \u201cat once.\u201d The plaintiff did not establish his right to recover by showing that he offered to deliver six weeks after the contract was made. The contract, by using the words \u201cat once,\u201d contemplated that delivery should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>be promptly made, or that it should be made with greater celerity than is ordinarily comprehended by a reasonable time.
