If the breakage of these two barrels occurred in transit, their condition was sufficient evidence of negligent rough handling to call upon the defendant to show that the damage was occasioned in a manner or at a time or place to relieve the defendant from liability under the shipping contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> We think the evidence presented a question of fact for the jury as to whether these two barrels were broken and damaged in transit, \u25a0or before their delivery to the drayman who took them from the station to the custom house in Buffalo. If so broken, the jury could have found that it caused or contributed to the damaged condition of the contents. For this reason, we. think the learned trial judge was in \u2022error in directing a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-15\">The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All \u25a0concur, except KRUSE, J., who dissents, upon the ground that it does not appear that the bad condition of the contents of the barrels was through any fault of the defendant, or from any cause for which it is liable.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
