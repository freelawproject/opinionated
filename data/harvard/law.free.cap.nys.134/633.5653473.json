At the trial the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint upon the grounds that the complaint alleged no demand, that it contained no allegation that the note was made for value, and contained no allegation that the note was indorsed before maturity. The trial justice granted this motion, and dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-20\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> There is, of course, no doubt but that a negotiable instrument is a chose in action, and, like other choses in action, may be assigned, either before or after maturity, with or without indorsement. The defendant, however, claims that an assignment made by indorsement after maturity is merely an assignment of a chose in action, and not of a negotiable instrument, and that therefore the plaintiff, having failed to allege indorsement and delivery before maturity, must allege both demand and consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-21\"><bracketnum>[2,3]</bracketnum> \u201cIt is true that after maturity a holder of a negotiable instrument can transfer only his own title to the instrument, and that the transferee is not a holder for value in due course; but a promissory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>note, negotiable when made, undoubtedly continues to be negotiable after it becomes due and has been dishonored, in respect of all parties to the note who were liable upon it at its maturity and whose liability has not been discharged.\u201d Leavitt v. Putnam, 1 Sandf. 199. See, also, opinion of Court of Appeals in same case, 3 N. Y. 494, 53 Am. Dec. 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><bracketnum>[4,5]</bracketnum> The instrument is still a negotiable instrument as between the original parties, and is deemed prima facie to have been issued for a valuable consideration, though the absence of consideration is a matter of defense against the transferee. It follows, therefore, that consideration need not be alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> It has never been held that demand is necessary to hold-the maker of a promissory note payable at a definite time. If the instrument was indorsed after maturity, his obligation to pay was then complete, and an assignment of the cause of action against him neither increases nor diminishes his liability. The cases which hold that demand must be promptly made where an instrument is indorsed after maturity are cases where the holder attempted to hold his own indorser liable upon the indorsement. Leavitt v. Putnam, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
