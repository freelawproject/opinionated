This stipulation was not filed with the clerk, and the case, being regularly on the calendar, was submitted and heard at the November term upon the appellant\u2019s brief alone, and the judgment reversed. Upon a re-examination of the record!, and due consideration of the respondent\u2019s brief, we have reached the same conclusion as on the former hearing, and the determination must therefore be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
