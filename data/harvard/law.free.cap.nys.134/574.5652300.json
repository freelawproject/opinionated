The plaintiff, an infant, who, at the time of the accident, was lawfully upon the sidewalk of one of our public thoroughfares, was injured through a collision which occurred between a street car in operation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>on said thoroughfare and an auto truck which was being operated thereon by an employ\u00e9 of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The appellants\u2019 first point is that the court erred in allowing a juror to be asked the question whether he was \u201cinterested in the-Pacific Coast Casualty Company.\u201d Section 1180 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended by Laws 1911, c. 206, provides that any juror may be asked whether \u201che is a shareholder, stockholder, director, officer or employ\u00e9, or in any manner interested, in any insurance company issuing policies for protection against liability for damages for injury to person or property.\u201d The appellants contend that this, being a statutory right, must be strictly construed as permitting simply a general question, and not a particular inquiry as to-any specific casualty company. This seems to be a very strained construction of the statute. The general provisions as to challenges of jurors are intended to safeguard the litigant from any possible interest or bias on the part of a juror, and the recent amendment to section 1180 of the Code must be deemed to have been enacted with this; same purpose. General inquiry as to the juror\u2019s interest in any casualty company having already been properly made in this case, it is difficult to see how the defendant could have been prejudiced by further inquiry as to a particular company. It would seem that the shield which has been thrown around casualty companies is already ample, and that there is no cause for extending the rule in that regard. I do not think, therefore, that this exception is of any value.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The defendants appellants also contend that the court erred in excluding evidence as to the character of construction of the defendants\u2019 auto truck, and of the fact that it had recently been purchased as a new machine. In my opinion, this contention of the appellants is sound. Evidence was given as to the very eccentric and unusual manner in which the defendants\u2019 auto was driven in a zigzag manner across the street and back again, in spite of the efforts of the defendants\u2019 chauffeur to control it; and evidence tending to show that the defendants exercised the utmost care in the selection of the machine, and that, notwithstanding the efforts of a competent chauffeur to control it, the machine got beyond his control, was relevant and material evidence on the part of defendants in disproving the plaintiff\u2019s allegation of negligence; and it was not such new matter as required that it should be set up as a separate defense. The erroneous exclusion of this evidence was, in my judgment, prejudicial to the defendants, and the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
