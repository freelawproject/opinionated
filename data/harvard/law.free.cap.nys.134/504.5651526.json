When the Appellate Term affirmed that judgment, the costs of that appeal were also not within the discretion of the court, but were taxable by the respondent as a matter of right. When, however, the Appellate Division reversed the determination of the Appellate Term and granted a new trial, it had the right to grant or withhold costs, and it granted these costs only to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-21\">The order of the court below is based upon the authority of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>case of Belt v. American Central Insurance Co., 33 App. Div. 239, 53 N. Y. Supp. 363, in which the Appellate Division held that where the court of Appeals reversed a judgment of the Supreme Court and of the General Term, and granted a new trial \u201cwith costs to plaintiff to abide the event,\u201d the defendant, if again successful, could tax the costs of the first trial and of the appeal to the General Term, on the ground that the word \u201ccosts,\u201d as used in the order of the Court of Appeals, referred only to costs in that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">The appellant urges that this case may be distinguished from the case under consideration, on the ground that both cases merely call for the construction of the order of the Appellate Court, and that these orders differ in the significant feature that the one referred only to \u201ccosts\u201d and the other to \u201ccosts in all courts.\u201d Undoubtedly these latter words show an intent by the Appellate Division to grant to the appellant such costs as were within its discretion to grant, and the respondent cannot claim any costs which the Appellate Division had the right to grant or withhold.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The costs of the trial are given to the successful party by statute, and neither the trial nor the appellate court can deprive him of these costs. Berrent v. Simpson, 61 Misc. Rep. 611, 113 N. Y. Supp. 1065. Included in those costs are all items incurred through the previous abortive trial. Hudson v. Erie R. R. Co., 57 App. Div. 98, 68 N. Y. Supp. 28. The order of the Appellate Division should, therefore, not be so construed as to include these costs. The Appellate Division has, however, reversed the determination of the Appellate Term absolutely, and the plaintiff is not entitled under the order of reversal to any costs in that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">It is unnecessary to consider whether or not the decision of Belt v. American Central Insurance Company, supra,\" would apply in the case of an appeal from the determination of the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, if the order were in the same form. There is, however, no doubt that upon such reversal the Appellate Division could itself determine to whom and in what event the costs should be awarded, and it has done this unequivocally in the order before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The order should therefore be modified, by striking out all costs and disbursements of the former appeal, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs to. either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
