The agreement was in the form of a letter (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 1), which reads in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-18\">\u201cWe accept your verbal proposition to build two scows. * * * Our understanding is that the price of these scows delivered will be $3,700, and that you will make us an allowance thereon of $2,700 for the secondhand piles and timber which we are removing from the St. George Terminal, S. I., <em>above to include the five long platforms between the trades, </em>and all other material below the top level of deck. * * * It is also our understanding that <em>we are to raft this secondhand timber and piles, </em>and that you will tow <em>it </em>from the work at your own expense, as we get it ready.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-19\">The answer denied that the defendant agreed to raft the five long platforms, and it appearing on the trial that he failed to dio so, the principal question on the trial was as to the proper interpretation of the' agreement. That the learned trial justice considered the agreement ambiguous is evidenced from a portion of his charge, as follows (folio 168): 1</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-20\">\u201cI am going to leave it to you to decide how far there rested upon the defendant in this case the obligation to raft material which was covered by this contract. If the defendant failed to raft\u2014that is, put in the water and place in rafting condition, material that had to be rafted\u2014then in that respect the defendant failed to perform his contract. If he did raft all that it was required to raft, then there is no cause of action here on the part of the plaintiff against the defendant, because the only thing mentioned here is rafting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>The jury found for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,514.50 and interest, and in setting aside the verdict the court handed down the following opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">\u201cThe defendant was under obligation to raft secondhand piles and timbers \u2014long stuff only. This conclusion follows the construction by the court of the written agreement. To submit the questions to the jury was error. Verdict set aside, and new trial granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">While it is quite clear that the defendant\u2019s agreement was to raft \u201clong stuff only,\u201d the qualifying or explanatory phrase \u201cabove to include the five long platforms between the tracks\u201d must not be overlooked. \u201cLong platforms,\u201d undisputedly of wood, surely may be included in the description \u201clong stuff only,\u201d and there was no evidence that the long platforms could not be rafted. If, as it appears, the contract is ambiguous, the a*mbiguity should not be construed in favor of the defendant, who wrote it. As was said by the court in Gillet v. Bank of America, 160 N. Y. 549, 555, 55 N. E. 292, 294:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">\u201cThe reason of the rule that the language of an instrument is to be construed against the person who proposes it, rather than against the person who is invited to accept it, is that men are supposed to take care of themselves, and that he who chooses the words by which a right is given ought to be held to the strict interpretation of them, rather than he who only -accepts them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">In order to determine the only question at issue, whether the parties intended that the five long platforms should be rafted, it was. necessary to examine facts aliunde in connection with the written language. This the court apparently did when it decided that the long platforms were not \u201clong stuff\u201d; but the question was a mixed question of law and fact, and in submitting it to the jury the court committed no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">In Trustees of East Hampton v. Vail, 151 N. Y. 463, 470, 45 N. E. 1030, 1032, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-10\">\u201cWhile it is a general rule that the construction of a written instrument is a question of law for the court, yet, where its interpretation depends upon the sense in which the words were used, or depends upon facts aliunde in connection with the written language to ascertain the intent of the parties, the question becomes a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">If it was not error to submit the question to the jury, the court erred in setting aside the verdict on account of that supposed error.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">The order should therefore be reversed, and the verdict reinstated-All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
