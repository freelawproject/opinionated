The second partial defense consists-of the allegation that, notwithstanding chapter 569, Laws 1911, extending the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of the City Court to actions to recover money only up to the sum of $5,000, exclusive of interest and costs,, said City Court has jurisdiction only up to the amount of $2,000, because the act as amended is unconstitutional. This claim is based upon the provisions of article 6, \u00a7 18, of the Constitution, forbidding, the Legislature to confer upon any inferior or local court of its creation any greater jurisdiction than is conferred upon County Courts, and section 14 of the same article, which limits jurisdiction of the County Courts, in actions for the recovery of money only, to those in which the complaint demands judgment for a sum not exceeding. $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Plaintiff, however, makes the point, which I find well taken, that defendant\u2019s so-called partial defense is premature. In Ralli v. Pearsall, 69 App. Div. 254, 257, 74 N. Y. Supp. 620 (1902), the Appellate Division held that the jurisdiction of the City Court was unlimited in actions brought to recover a money judgment in any amount, and that the limitation was only to the amount of the judgment that could be entered thereon. As, of course, it cannot, at the present stage of this litigation, appear that plaintiff will enter judgment for more than the statutory amount, defendant\u2019s so-called partial defense is without basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It may also well be doubted whether an objection of this peculiar kind may be regarded technically as a \u201cdefense,\u201d either complete or partial;1 and, in any event, it is apparent that, if the objection be one going to the jurisdiction of the City Court (whether to entertain the action or enter the judgment), it is one that cannot be waived, and defendant cannot be substantially injured by delaying its interposition until what I regard as the proper time.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
