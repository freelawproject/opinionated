Under the leave thus reserved, the defendant renewed his motion, which was on the 29th of February again denied, and an order entered. In pursuance of that order, the defendant, on March 6th, served his case on appeal, to which, on March 11th, the plaintiff served amendments, with notice of settlement for March 25th. On March 14-th the defendant served a notice of appeal from the order of February 5th, denying his motion; and the plaintiff now moves to dismiss that appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The defendant claims that his second motion, denied on February 29th, was a reargument of the first motion, and not a renewal of the motion under the leave contained in the order of February 5th. But it is clear from the record that it was a renewal of the motion, and that he, having acted upon the favor granted by the first order, and renewed his motion, which was again heard and determined against him, prevented an appeal from- the first order.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The motion to dismiss the appeal from the order of February 5th must therefore be granted, with $10 cost$.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
