Defendant gave three notes in part payment for a millinery business sold to defendant by plaintiff, and in this action defendant set up a counterclaim, charging that plaintiff had falsely represented the gross income of said business to be not less that $7,000 per year. It was not denied that this representation had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">The husband of defendant testified that he had examined the books of the business kept by plaintiff prior to the sale to defendant, which had been turned over to defendant; but he was not allowed, after objection by plaintiff, to tell the amount he found to be the gross income derived from the business for the three years prior to the sale to defendant. This is claimed to be error, by defendant. The books themselves were not offered in evidence. The husband claimed to be an expert bookkeeper. I do not think this ruling was error. The correct rule is stated in Van Sachs v. Kretz, 72 N. Y. 552, where it is stated that it was not error for the referee to reject an offer to show by a bookkeeper the results derived from his examination of the books, on the ground that the books were in evidence and \u201cspoke for themselves.\u201d \u201cIt would not have been error for the referee to have allowed a witness with the books before him to give a summary of their contents; but this was a question of convenience simply, and a matter within his discretion.\u201d .In Van Name v. Van Name, 38 App. Div. 451, 56 N. Y. Supp. 659, it is said that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-6\">\u201cIt is perfectly well settled at this late day that resort may be had to schedules containing abstracts of voluminous books or documents, which have been put in evidence, when those schedules are verified by the witness who made them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">In that case the court referring to a schedule made up from checkbook stubs, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-8\">\u201cThese check book stubs were not admitted in evidence, and so far as the statement is based on these stubs it is not admissible.\u201d . National Bank of Republic v. Nassau Phosphate Co., 56 Hun, 136, 8 N. Y. Supp. 929.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-9\">No error was committed by the trial judge in rejecting the testimony of this witness as to a computation made by him from books not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-10\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
