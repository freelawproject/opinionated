Y. Supp. 433) and upon the further ground that under the amended pleadings in this action defendant claimed that it had given notice to make the repairs in question to the Barber Asphalt Company as assignee of the Warren-Scharf Asphalt Paving Company. It was the defendant\u2019s contention that the Barber Company was acting as such assignee, but it utterly failed to sustain its contention by proof, and the verdict was therefore properly directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-16\">The judgment and order appealed from are therefore affirmed, with costs to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-17\">INGRAHAM, P.

Y. Supp. 433), known as No. 2, in which a verdict was rendered for the city; but counsel for the city upon the trial applied for and obtained leave to amend the answer by omitting the allegation that the contractor was duly notified, and substituting, in place thereof, an allegation that its assignee was duly notified to make fepairs. Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>der the answer as thus amended, it was incumbent on the defendant to show that the Barber Asphalt Paving Company was the assignee of the contractor, and in this it failed. The court therefore properly directed a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for the amount owing to the contractor.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
