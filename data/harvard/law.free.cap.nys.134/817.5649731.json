The action is brought to recover the sum of $1,000 upon a policy of burglary insurance. The answer denies the material allegations of the complaint, and sets up two separate defenses : First, that the plaintiff\u2019s assignor failed to keep books of account, according to the terms and conditions of the policy; and, second, that plaintiff\u2019s assignor avoided the policy by attempting to cheat and defraud the company in exaggerating his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The trial justice held that these defenses were insufficient, for want of specific denials in\u2019 the answer of the allegation of due performance of the conditions of the policy pleaded in the complaint. In so ruling, the learned judge erred. The allegation of fraud was new matter, which, if established by competent proof, would constitute a defense to the action. Eagle Waist Co. v. Ocean Accident &amp; Guarantee Corporation, 133 N. Y. Supp. 1031; Shaff v. United Surety Co., 142 App. Div. 465, 127 N. Y. Supp. 8; Anibal v. Ins. Co., 84 App. Div. 634, 82 N. Y.
