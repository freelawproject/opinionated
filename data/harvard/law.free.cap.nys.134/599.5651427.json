The action-is brought to recover for goods sold and delivered, consisting of certain new parts for defendant\u2019s automobile, under the following circumstances:</p>\n<p id=\"b623-21\">Defendant\u2019s chauffeur brought defendant\u2019s automobile to the repair shop of the plaintiff and asked that certain repairs be made thereto. Plaintiff\u2019s mana get called up defendant\u2019s office on the telephone, and had a conversation with some one over the telephone, whom he supposed to be defendant\u2019s manager. In the colloquy over the telephone, the person at defendant\u2019s office asked that the repairs' be made without charge, to which plaintiff\u2019s manager, replied that that could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>done, as plaintiff had not sold the machine and had not participated in any way in the purchase or sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\">- <bracketnum>[1]'</bracketnum> It is contended by the defendant respondent that, there being no proof - as to the authority of the chauffeur, or as to the authority of the person who, at defendant\u2019s office, talked over the telephone, no agreement has-been established on the part of the defendant. This would undoubtedly be the correct view, but for the admissions contained in the pleadings. By his failure to deny the allegations in the second and fourth paragraphs of the complaint, the defendant has admitted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\">\u201cThe plaintiff delivered to the defendant certain goods, wares, and merchandise, and that said goods, wares, and merchandise were so delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant at the special instance and request of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">.Qn the trial the defendant admitted the allegations of the third paragraph as to the reasonable value of said goods, wares, and merchandise. These admissions, in the light of the evidence as to the circumstances under which the goods, wares, and merchandise were delivered to defendant\u2014i. e., that they were put into his machine by way of permanent repairs\u2014make.out in my judgment an implied promise to pay the value thereof, in the absence of any evidence as to any definite agreement to the contrary. Defendant is not in a position to contend that the repairs were made and the goods delivered under any different agreement. If the person who talked with plaintiff\u2019s manager over the telephone did not represent the defendant, then there was no notification to the plaintiff that defendant expected the repairs to be made without charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> If the person talking over the telephone did represent the defendant, then the suggestion that the repairs should be made without charge was immediately repudiated by plaintiff\u2019s manager; and the fact that defendant left his machine in plaintiff\u2019s repair shop thereafter, and permitted the repairs to be made, coupled with the admission that the goods were delivered at defendant\u2019s special instance and request, renders the defendant liable therefor on an implied promise to pay the value of such repairs. The pleadings should properly have been amended to conform to the proof in that regard, so as to eliminate all question of sufficiency. But, even without such amendment, it was error to direct a judgment in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs-to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
