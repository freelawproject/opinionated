Defendant was excavating the extensive tract west of Sixth avenue, between Thirty-Second and Thirty-Third streets, in this city. Plaintiff had been in defendant\u2019s employ for a considerable time as helper to \u201ctimber men,\u201d placing braces to hold back exposed walls of earth. He was directed by a foreman on October 12, 1909, the day of the accident, to assist a gang of men who were removing rocks. While employed in fastening a chain around a large rock near a steeply sloping bank in a part of the excavation, a rock higher up tumbled down and. injured the plaintiff\u2019s hand. Plaintiff has, on this appeal, disclaimed any desire to charge the mas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>ter with negligence based on the theory of failure to provide a \u201csafe place\u201d to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The first question, then, to be determined is: Did the plaintiff make out a prima facie case of negligence on the part of the foreman? To this I think that, after giving plaintiff the benefit of every intendment and inference to which he is entitled on a motion to dismiss, we must return an affirmative answer. Moreover, evidence that defendant\u2019s foreman had been warned by several of the workmen, that very morning, that this bank was in a dangerous condition, and that stones were falling from it, was erroneously excluded by the learned trial judge. This knowledge, on the part of the foreman, of facts which rendered dangerous the manner in which he directed the work to be done, was material on the issue of the foreman\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The next inquiry is whether the negligence of the foreman is chargeable to the defendant, bearing in mind that this action was brought under the Employer\u2019s Liability Act. That again depends, in the first place, on whether the foreman at the time was, as provided in the act, exercising superintendence and whether his alleged negligence occurred in respect of an act of superintendence. See Guilmartin v. Solvay Process Co., 189 N. Y. 490, 82 N. E. 725 (1907). This presented an issue upon which there was at least sufficient evidence to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> There remains, then, the question: Assuming that the jury-might have found the foreman negligent while exercising superintendence, and in respect of an act of superintendence, would the master have been liable for the foreman\u2019s act? The defendant apparently claims that the master is not liable because the act of alleged negligence occurred in the course of the performance of \u201cdetails of the work.\u201d Before the statute, the master was not liable for the negligence of a fellow servant in the detailed prosecution of the work, and \u201cthe foreman and workmen are fellow servants.\u201d Vogel v. American Bridge Co., 180 N. Y. 373, 380, 73 N. E. 1, 3, 70 L. R. A. 725 (1905). The employer was \u201cresponsible only for his own negligence or that of his alter ego\u2014not for the negligence of a coservant.\u201d Neagle v. Syracuse, etc., Railroad Co., 185 N. Y. 270, 274, 77 N. E. 1064, 1065, 25 L. R. A. (N. S.) 321 (1906).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> What change has the Employer\u2019s Liability Act wrought in these relations? We may omit consideration of the more liberal rule as to assumption of risk laid down in section 3 of the act (Laws 1902, c. 600 [Labor Law] \u00a7 202) as that either has no application to the case at bar, or would, if the facts in any aspect might be held to render the question pertinent, require by the very terms of the act, submission of that question to the jury. This inquiry addresses itself primarily to section 1 of the act, being section 200 of the Labor Law as it existed at the time of this accident in 1909, prior to the amendment by Laws 1910, c. 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">The first subdivision of this section relates to an injury caused by an employ\u00e9 \u201cby reason of a defect in the condition of the ways, works, or machinery connected with, or used in, the business of the employer. * * * \u201d As to this section, the Court of Appeals, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>a case decided shortly after the passage of the original act, namely, Gmaehle v. Rosenberg, 178 N. Y. 147, 151, 70 N. E. 411, 412 (1904), remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-5\">\u201cWe are not prepared to say whether the statute had In any respect increased the liability o\u00ed the master for defective ways, works, or machinery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">See, also, Nappa v. Erie R. Co., 195 N. Y. 176, 181, 88 N. E. 30, 21 L. R. A. (N. S.) 96 (1909).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">We may therefore disregard subdivision 1 of section 200 as having no bearing on \"the case at bar. On the other hand, when we come to subdivision 2 of section 200, we observe that it makes the employer liable \u201cby reason of the negligence of any person in the service of the employer intrusted with and exercising superintendence, whose sole or principal duty is that of superintendence. \u2022 * * * \u201d As was said by the Court of Appeals in the Gmaehle Case, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-8\">\u201cIt is clear that'it has given an additional cause of action, where it prescribes that the master shall be liable for the negligence of the superintendent or any person acting as such.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">See, also, McHugh v. Manhattan Ry. Co., 179 N. Y. 378, 383, 72 N. E. 312 (1904).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">It is true that in the subsequent case of Payne v. N. Y., etc., R. Co., 201 N. Y. 436, 443, 95 N. E. 19, the court says that this expression as to an additional cause of action \u201chas been too broadly construed\u201d; but that warning applies only to the interpretation of the Gmaehle Case as holding that the statute gives a new cause of action, technically speaking. It remains, however, established with perfect clearness that the effect of the act was to add to the master\u2019s responsibility to his servant by making him liable for the negligence of another servant\u2014a foreman, for example\u2014actually engaged in superintendence; whereas, previous to the act, a servant so situated would have been regarded as matter of law as a fellow servant, and the master thus exempted from responsibility for his negligence. It is to be noted that the master\u2019s exemption from liability for the negligence of such a \u201cfellow servant\u201d in carrying out. the \u201cdetails of the work,\u201d as held in the Vogel Case, supra, and Perry v. Rogers, 157 N. Y. 251, 51 N. E. 1021 (1898), almost, on all fours with the case at. bar, was determined apart from the Employer\u2019s Liability Act. The Vogel Case was not brought under the act, and the Perry Case was decided in 1898, four years before the act was passed. In the Neagle Case, supra, the court says expressly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-11\">\u201cThis rule has been somewhat modified by the Employer\u2019s Liability Act, but that statute was enacted subsequent to the accident before us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-12\">The present state of the law is clearly expressed in the Guilmartin Case, supra, 189 N. Y. 494, 82 N. E. 726, approving the language of Judge Gray in Harris v. Baltimore, etc., Works, 188 N. Y. 141, 80 N. E. 1028:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-14\">\u201cThat statute gave an additional cause of action, because it prescribed chat the master. shall be liable for the negligence of the superintendent or the person acting as such. At common law such a liability was not recognized, unless the superintending servant was the alter ego of the master with r.espeet to the work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>It is apparent therefore, that the act has so changed the common law that, instead of the master\u2019s exemption from liability for the negligence of a foreman engaged in the details of the prosecution of the work, he has been made liable for the negligence of such a servant exercising superintendence and in respect of an act of superintendence.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">For the reasons above stated, I think that the case at bar presented issues, as herein above set forth, which should have been submitted to the determination of the jury on the evidence adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
