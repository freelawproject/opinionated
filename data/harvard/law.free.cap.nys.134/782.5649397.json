This machine contained knives projecting an eighth of an inch above the level of the table, and revolving, when in operation, towards the workman. There was an iron guage, 6 inches high, against which was pressed the wood sought to be cut, which usually comes in pieces 2 feet long and 2 inches wide. While the knives were revolving, the workman used his right hand to press the wood towards them, and with his left thumb pressed down upon the wood to keep it steady. While so engaged, the wood suddenly \u201cjumped back\u201d as plaintiff describes it for some reason which no one undertakes to explain, and his left hand fell in front of the knives, which cut off the thumb and a portion of the hand. The action is brought under the Employer\u2019s Liability Law, and negligence is predicated upon the defendant\u2019s failure to guard the machine as required by section 81 of the Labor Law, which, so far as it is applicable, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-5\">\u201cAll vats, pans, saws, planers, cogs, gearing, belting, shafting, set screws and machinery, of every description shall be properly guarded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Evidence was introduced tending to show that similar machines used by other employers were provided with a guard, which was set over the knives in such a way that the hand of a workman could not possibly come into contact with them, and that such guard came as part of the original equipment of the machine. There was also proof that plaintiff had called the attention of .the defendant\u2019s general manager to the absence of a guard when the machine in question was put up some eight months before, and the manager said he would make one for use thereon. Plaintiff some weeks later again called attention to the absence of the guard, and said he was afraid to work \u00f3n it, but the general manager said he would make one when he had time and not to mind it but go ahead,</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Objection was made to the receipt in evidence of the notice given under the Employer\u2019s Liability Act, but the defendant was clearly advised thereby that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was based upon a defect in the condition of the jointer by reason of its not being provided with a guard, and a machine not guarded as required by the Labor Law is a defective machine.

Supp. 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> Exception was taken to the charge of the learned trial judge that \u201cif you find that it was practical for a guard to be placed upon the machine, and (if the master omitted to place a guard there that would be negligence,\u201d as well as to the refusal to charge, at defendant\u2019s request, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae5W\">\u201cIf the master, in the exercise of reasonable care, could not have foreseen the accident would have occurred in the manner described by the plaintiff, then there was no duty on his part to guard the machine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>To this the court replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8T\">\u201cNo, gentlemen, I refuse to charge that. The statute casts a duty upon him. It is not for him to decide.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-4\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> So far as the question of the assumption of risk by plaintiff -was concerned, that was a question of fact for the jury, and it was properly submitted to them. Klein v. Garvey, 94 App. Div. 183, 87 N. Y. Supp. 998; Neuweiler v. Central Brewing Co., 119 App. Div. 101, 103 N. Y. Supp. 1136; Graves v. Stickley Company, 125 App. Div. 132, 109 N. Y. Supp. 256, affirmed 195 N. Y. 584, 89 N. E. 1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The sole question here presented is, Do the two exceptions just \u2022quoted present reversible errors for our consideration? In Marino v. Lehmaier, 173 N. Y. 530, 66 N. E. 572, 61 L. R. A. 811, which, was a case where a boy 13 years and 3 months old had been employed in a factory in direct contravention of the provisions of section 70 of the Labor Law (Consol. Laws, c. 31), prohibiting the employment in .any factory of a child under the age of 14 years, four judges agreed that a question of fact was presented for the determination of the jury, and that in case it should be found that the defendant was negligent and the plaintiff, under the circumstances, was not chargeable with contributory negligence, the defendant was civilly liable. The Chief Judge concurred in an opinion wherein he held that the violation of the section, although punishable as a misdemeanor, also, in the case of injuries which could not have happened but for its violation, constituted evidence of negligence to be considered by the jury. The two dissenting judges held that the section created no cause of action whatever. In that case the prior decisions were reviewed to demonstrate that a statute prohibiting the doing of an act which is \u25a0dangerous to the life or health of others might also f\u00fcrnish a jury with the basis of a finding of negligence and a liability for damages resulting from the doing of the prohibited act. But we are referred to no case holding that the failure to perform an act required by the Labor Law constitutes negligence per se, so as to leave no question on that phase of the case for the jury. All the cases hold, by .analogy xyith those where a violation of a municipal ordinance was -involved, that the violation of a duty imposed by statute or ordinance, where no right of action is in terms created, is some evidence of \u2022negligence, and raises at most a question of fact for the jury, but is not necessarily .negligent. Knupfle v. Knickerbocker Ice Co., 84 N. Y. 488; McGrath v. R. R. Co., 63 N. Y. 522; McRickard v. Flint, 114 N. Y. 222, 21 N. E. 153; Marino v. Lehmaier, 173 N. Y. 530, 66 N. E. 572, 61 L. R. A. 811; Kiernan v. Eidlitz, 109 App. Div. 726, 96 N. Y. Supp. 387. In the case at bar the machinery was not entirely unguarded; only an eighth of an inch of the knives projected above the table, the rest being guarded by the table itself. The duty to guard imposed by the statute depended upon two considerations: First. Was it practicable to guard? Second. Could danger reasonably have been anticipated to the workman? As the rule is laid down in Scott v. International Paper Co., 204 N. Y. 49, 97 N. E. 413:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-6\">\u201cWhere it is practicable to guard a machine, and danger from its remaining unguarded should be reasonably anticipated, the provisions of the statute quoted (section 81 Labor Law) are mandatory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>In the case at bar as to the first essential element to make the statute applicable there was evidence of the practicability of placing a guard on this machine. This evidence was not controverted. When the court charged the jury, therefore, that if \u201cit was practical for a guard to be placed on a machine, and the master omitted to place a guard there, that would be negligence,\u201d that was practically a direction of a verdict against plaintiff, and nothing remained save to assess the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">The learned court failed to charge the necessity for the existence of the second element, viz., a reasonable anticipation of danger. As was said in Valentino v. Garvin Machine Co., 139 App. Div. 139, 123 N. Y. Supp. 959:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-5\">\u201cA master is not bound under all circumstances to guard all of the machines in his factory. Some force must be given to the word \u2018properly,\u2019 and the necessity of guarding must to some extent be determined by the probable dangers from exposure (Glens Falls P. C. Co. v. Travelers\u2019 Insurance Co., 162 N. Y. 399, 56 N. E. 897; Dillon v. National Coal Tar Co., 181 N. Y. 215, 73 N. E. 978.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Applying the rule uniformly laid down in all these cases, it follows that the employer is bound to guard machinery under 'the requirements of section 81 of the Labor Law if it is practicable so to do, and if danger can reasonably be anticipated from its remaining unguarded. When the duty to guard exists, the failure to guard furnishes evidence of negligence which must be submitted to the jury with the other evidence in the case, but does not as a matter of law constitute negligence per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The judgment and order appealed from must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">INGRAHAM, P. J., and McLAUGHLIN, J., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b809-9\">MILLER, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"Ags\">The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-10\">\u201cAll vats, pans, saws, planers, cogs, gearing, belting, shafting, set-screws and machinery of every description, shall be properly guarded.\u201d Labor Law, \u00a7 81 (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 31).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">The machinery upon which the plaintiff was injured was called a \u201cjointer.\u201d It consisted of a steel table with an opening in the center through which revolving knives projected. The risk in running it was precisely like that involved in running a circular saw, one of the machines specifically enumerated in the statute. The danger was so obvious that but for the statute (Employer\u2019s Liability Law, .\u00a7 3; Labor Law, \u00a7 202; Consol. Laws 1909, c. 31) the servant would be held as matter of law to have assumed the risk. See Proctor v. Rockville Centre Milling &amp; Construction Company, 141 App. Div. 900, 126 N. Y. Supp. 743. I am unable to perceive, therefore, how there was any question of fact as to whether the master should have anticipated the danger. The case is not like those in which the piece of machinery is so located as to be removed from danger to employes; e. g., a set screw from 15 to 18 feet above the floor (Glens Falls P. C. Company v. Travelers\u2019 Insurance Company, 162 N. Y. 399, 56 N. E. 897), or a printing press protected by a heavy iron frame (Kimmerle v. Carey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>Printing Company, 144 App. Div. 714, 129 N. Y. Supp. 572). The danger was obvious as a matter of law. The plaintiff\u2019s assumption of it is another matter which is now governed by the statute. \u2022 The only question, therefore, on that branch of the case was whether it was practicable to guard the projecting knives, and that was submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Moreover, the burden was on the defendant to show that it was impracticable to guard the machine or that its location removed it from danger (Scott v. International Paper Company, 204 N. Y. 49, 97 N. E. 413), and it offered no evidence on the subject. . Of course, the steel table guarded the part of the knives below it, hut the projecting part was the thing to be guarded, and there was no attempt to guard that. Within the Scott Case, therefore, the machine was presumptively maintained contrary to the statute, and I am utiable to discover any evidence in the record to rebut that presumption. There was evidence that it was practicable to guard the projecting part of the knives, which I think any one who had ever seen such a machine couldi determine from a mere description of it. We have .then the case of a mandatory duty imposed for the benefit of plaintiff, which the defendant violated to the plaintiff\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">I am aware that it has been said in many cases that the violation of a municipal ordinance or a statute is evidence of negligence. But in all of those cases other elements were involved) in the determination of the question of the defendant\u2019s negligence. Either the duty violated was not mandatory as to the plaintiff or its violation was not the immediate cause of the injury. In this case the plaintiff was injured by the violation of a mandatory duty imposed! for his benefit, and without the intervention of any other cause. Negligence is the violation of duty. Surely it would not have been error for the court to charge that it was the mandatory duty of the defendant to guard this machine, if it was practicable to do so; the danger being obvious. How. then, can it be said that it was error to charge that the defendant was negligent if it violated that diuty?</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">LAUGHEIN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
