The evidence, viewed in its most favorable light to the plaintiff, tends to show that there was rough or uneven frozen snow or ice of the depth of about 1% to <em>2y2 </em>inches on the walk at the point where the plaintiff slipped; that the walk in front of the premises known as 346-348 East Sixty-Seventh street was covered with ice or snow, and showed footprints thereon; that other parts of the walk were free from ice or snow; that on the 13th and 14th of the month 3 inches of snow fell, and that there had been no storm prior to that time since the 6th of the month; that there was no storm on the 15th, but that on the 16th 2% inches of snow fell, and on the 17th 1 inch of very wet snow fell, for, melted, it made .62 of an inch of water, and the storm lasted 15 hours and was the last storm before the accident; that on the 16th the mean temperature was 21.01 degrees above zero, and on the 17th 30.07 degrees, and on the 18th from 23 degrees to 32 degrees, and on the 19th from 5 degrees to 32 degrees, and on the day of the accident from 25 degrees at 7 a. m. to 36 degrees at noon; that the snow which fell on the 16th and 17th of the month probably had not been removed, and that the condition of the walk from that time until the time of the accident underwent a change to some extent, owing to the changes in temperature and to use of the walk by pedestrians, and its condition was described by one witness as \u201cpretty good\u201d the day before the accident, but the witness said that the more people passed over it the rougher it became. The city proved the ordinance by which it enjoined upon owners and occupants of premises the duty of removing snow and ice from the walk. There was no evidence of actual notice to the city of the condition of the walk, or that its condition was such that any one else had fallen upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">We are of opinion that the plaintiff failed to show that the walk Lad been in an unsafe and dangerous condition for such a length of time as to charge the city with constructive notice thereof, and to render it liable for failing to remove the obstruction formed by the snow and ice.

Supp. 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">It follows, therefore, that the judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
