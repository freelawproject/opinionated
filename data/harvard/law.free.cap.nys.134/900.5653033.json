The complaint further alleges that subsequently the aforesaid property was sold to one Marie Peter for $7,375, which moneys were received by the defendant for the plaintiff\u2019s account, and that after the payment of the amount of the first and second mortgages, interest, charges, assessments, taxes, etc., together with such sums as were due defendant from plaintiff, there remained in the defendant\u2019s possession and control the sum of $717.28, which the plaintiff had duly demanded, and which the defendant refused to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> In the agreement annexed to the complaint, the defendant agrees to convey back to the plaintiff the premises in question within six months from date, upon payment to him of the sum due, with interest thereon. .We are of the opinion that the complaint stated a cause of action in equity. Mooney v. Byrne, 163 N. Y. 86, 57 N. E. 163; Doty v. Norton, 133 App. Div. 106, 117 N. Y. Supp. 793. As was said by Mr.. Justice Scott in the similar case of Doty v. Norton, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-9\">\u201cIt is true that plaintiff does not call his action one to redeem, and asks for a money judgment; but the action is in legal effect one for redemption, although, under the circumstances set forth in the complaint, only a money judgment can he obtained, and therefore only such a judgment need be demanded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-10\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> In legal effect, the action was one for redemption, calling for the exercise by the court of equitable powers, and as such was not within the jurisdiction of the City Court of the City of New York. The defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
