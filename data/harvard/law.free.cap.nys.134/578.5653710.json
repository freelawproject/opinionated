Both orders contained the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-20\">These dummies are to be held by you and paid for by us as taken, we agreeing to take complete delivery within one year; we paying charges for packing. Price $68.50 (and $27.50, respectively) per thousand f. o. b. New York.\u201d'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-21\">Defendant ordered these dummies to be, shipped to various parts of the United States in packages containing from 25 to 1,000 each. Plaintiff sues for the value of the special packing and incidental ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>penses involved in making up these comparatively small packages. Plaintiff respondent\u2019s manager testifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">\u201cInstead of packing these goods in the most convenient packages in large cases, we had to pack them in eases containing from 25 to 500.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">And again he testifies that plaintiff\u2019s claim is for\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">\u201cthe costs of the individual small packages, less the costs of putting those goods or shipping those goods in large quantities, such as we ordinarily would do, * * * and extra labor that we put on those goods, making the numerous shipments, instead of a usual shipment that would be made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-8\"><bracketnum>[ 1 ]</bracketnum> In substance, this amounts to a claim for greater compensation, based on a bargain which plaintiff would have preferred to make after it found that it had made a different bargain. The contract provides that the goods were to be delivered and paid for \u201cas taken,\u201d and that defendant was to pay no charges for packing.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Respondent makes some claim, apparently based on the phrase \u201cf. o. b. New York,\u201d which it claims should be interpreted as meaning \u201cf. o. b. respondent\u2019s plant in New York,\u201d as stated in the prior request for quotations coming from appellant. I can see neither the force nor the relevancy of the point. The controversy centers, not about the place of delivery, but about the question whether appellant was bound to order the goods packed in large quantities in the manner in which plaintiff\u2019s manager expected they would be ordered, or in such quantities as appellant chose and as provided in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Some evidence is offered by plaintiff to the effect that one of defendant\u2019s agents had promised to adjust plaintiff\u2019s extra charge for packing; but a promise to adjust is not a promise to pay, and, if it were, it would have been without consideration, because plaintiff was already under obligation to furnish the services, payment for which was claimed to have been promised.

E. 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to.appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
