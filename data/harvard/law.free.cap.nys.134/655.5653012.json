Plaintiff claims that he had made use of but 898 inches of the total amount reserved to him, when he tendered to defendant, between the 23d and 25th days of October, 1909, certain political advertisements, aggregating 1,098 inches, for which plaintiff was to receive the sum of $7,135, but which defendant refused to publish, to plaintiff\u2019s damage in the sum of $6,-696.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The original order was incorrect in form, for it directed the examination of John Vicario, president of defendant, and not the examination of the party defendant, by its president, which was the proper procedure. Jacobs v. Mexican Sugar Refining Company, 112 App. Div. 658, 98 N. Y. Supp. 542. But this was an irregularity which was properly cured by the court at Special Term by an amendment of the original order. Meade v. Southern Tier Masonic Relief Association, 119 App. Div. 764, 104 N. Y. Supp. 523. The particulars as to which the defendant\u2019s examination is sought are, however, too broad, and have no application to the issues as presented by the pleadings. Thereunder the plaintiff is bound to establish the making of the contract, its breach by defendant by its refusal to accept the political advertising on the dates mentioned in the complaint (October 23 to 25, 1909), that plaintiff then had under his option a sufficient amount of unused space in defendant\u2019s newspapers to cover the advertising. tendered, and the damage he sustained by reason of the breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The order appealed from must therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the application to modify the original order of examination granted, without costs, to the extent of directing the examination of the defendant by John Vicario, its president, upon the following matters only: (a) The amount of total space claimed to have been used by'plaintiff, or the advertisers procured by him, or charged by defendant against him or them, under the alleged contract'for 3,000 inches of space, up to and including October 25, 1909. (b) The name of each advertiser claimed to have been charged by defendant against plaintiff\u2019s said option down to the date last mentioned, with the amount of space allotted to him, or to plaintiff, the date of each advertisement, and the amount of space it occupied, and the rate charged by defendant therefor. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
