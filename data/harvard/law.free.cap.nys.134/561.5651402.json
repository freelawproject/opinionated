That covenant, however, would be to supply only such hot water as would reasonably be expected under the circumstances, viz., such supply as would be furnished ordinarily in a small private house. It would certainly be unreasonable to expect the landlord of a single leased apartment situated in his private house to keep a supply of hot water at all hours, day and night, for the convenience of his single tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-20\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The defendant leased the apartment for one year from the 1st day of October, and vacated the apartment on the 27th day of May, claiming a constructive eviction because not sufficient hot water was furnished. It appears that at various times after October there was a lack of hot water, but there is no evidence at all as to the supply during the time shortly prior to the defendant\u2019s abandonment of the premises. Moreover, there is no sufficient explanation of the reason why defendant continued to put up with his alleged discomfort during the whole winter, and found the conditions unbearable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>eight months thereafter. He claims that he remained there in reliance on plaintiff\u2019s promise to remedy conditions by installing a new range, which afterwards turned out to be unsatisfactory; but there is no evidence as to the time when the range was installed or the promises made upon which defendant relied. The record discloses nothing but the vaguest testimony to establish defendant\u2019s defense, and the judgment in his favor should be reversed, and a new trial granted,, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with .costs to appellant, to abide the event.
