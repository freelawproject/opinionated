The landlords agreed to return the sum so deposited at the expiration of the lease, provided all the covenants on the part of the tenants have been performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-17\">In July, 1909, Penny &amp; Anderson assigned their lease to one Weiss, who assigned it to the Lincoln Square Restaurant Company, which assigned it to one Jensen. In August, 1911, Penny &amp; Anderson, individually and as copartners, were duly adjudged bankrupts, and the plaintiff was duly appointed trustee of their estate. It is conceded that the lease has expired, and that its terms and conditions were fully complied with on the part of the tenants. The covenant under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>which the money was deposited was for the benefit of the lessor. It was collateral and personal, and did not run with the land. Under these circumstances the assignee of the tenants cannot sue upon it. Fallert Brewing Co., Limited, v. Blass, 119 App. Div. 53, 103 N. Y. Supp. 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">We are of the opinion that the learned court below erred in dismissing the complaint, and that the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
