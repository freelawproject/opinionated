De Severinus v. Press Publishing Co., 147 App. Div. 161, 132 N. Y. Supp. 80. It was admitted in that action, as in the action at bar, that the circulation of the newspaper was very large. As there are no circumstances of material difference which relate b&gt; the damages, we should not hold this verdict of $3,000 excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The fact that the article was published first by the defendant in the case cited supra is not admissible in mitigation. There is an exception to this rule, which, however, is not presented in the case at bar. In a case of libel, if the defendant published the article as hearsay, with a statement of the source of its information, proof thereof, and that the publisher at the time of publication believed the article' to be true, is admissible in mitigation, to show freedom from malice. See Newell on Slander and Libel (2d Ed.) 893, 894; Odgers on Libel, and Slander, p. 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The judgment and order must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
