W. Carlin Construction Company against the New York &amp; Brooklyn Brewing Company. From an interlocutory judgment sustaining a demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s second cause of action, plaintiff appeals. Affirmed, with leave to plead over.</summary>\n<seealso data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"seealso\" id=\"b518-11\">See, also, 139 App. Div. 935, 124 N. Y. Supp. 1115.</seealso>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-12\">The opinion of Putnam, J., at Special Term, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-13\">Plaintiff\u2019s second cause of action is for alleged charges and extra and additional work under a contract which the complaint states \u201cshould be done under the direction of the architect and that the decision of the architect as to the construction and meaning of the drawings and specifications should be final; that no allowance would he made for alterations causing extra work and material unless by written order.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-14\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It is settled that a provision for a written order as a condition to liability for extra work is valid, and will be enforced. Langley v. Rouss, 185 N. Y. 203, 77 N. E. 1168, 7 Ann. Gas. 210; Sutherland v. Walsh, 45 1-Iun, 259. But this provision may be waived by the subsequent conduct of the parties. Solomon v. Vallette, 152 N. Y. 147, 46 N. E. 324; Stout v. Jones, 120 N. Y. 638, 24 N. E. 1096; Bartlett v. Stanehfield, 148 Mass. 394, 19 N. E. 549, 2 L. R. A. 625. Therefore the real question raised by the demurrer is whether the complaint shows the elements of such a waiver by the conduct of the parties. The allegations of the complaint, instead of charging a new agreement, set forth wrongful conduct on the part of defendant and his architect, in that they gave to the contract, drawings, and specifications unreasonable and arbitrary meanings, contrary to the terms thereof, and sought to require plaintiff to do things not required by the contract, and in an unwarranted and unreasonable manner, and in bad faith, ordered work and materials that were in addition to the contract, and changed and modified the drawings and specifications, thereby increasing the amount and character of labor and materials over and above the amount provided by the contract, and arbitrarily and in bad faith refused to give written orders for such changes and additional work, and, although insisting upon the performance of such extra work, refused to give to plaintiff written orders for such work or material upon demand, \u201cand further, by its said acts and the acts of its said architect in connection with said work, waived, ignored, and abandoned the provisions of said contract with reference to such extra work.\u201d The complaint further charges that the architect collusively, in bad faith, unreasonably, and in fraud, refused to certify che performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>and furnishing of such extra work and materials, although requested by plaintiff to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-3\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> The demurrer admits such inference as may be reasonably drawn from material facts properly pleaded (Avon Springs v. Weed, 119 App. Div. 560, 104 N. Y. Supp. 58), but does not admit conclusions of law (Blum v. Whitney, 185 N. Y. 232, 77 N. E. 1159; Burdick v. Chesebrough,. 94 App. Div. 532, 88 3ST. Y. Supp. 13). While the allegation that the defendant waived and abandoned the provisions of the contract is a conclusion of law (Potts v. Lambie, 138 App. 'Div. 144, 122 N. Y. Supp. 935), the present averment is that such abandonment was by its said acts, referring to the previous charges of bad faith, collusion, and improper interpretation of the requirements of the drawings and specifications. Where a contract contains such an absolute provision amounting to a condition precedent against liability, the elements of waiver must be distinctly pleaded because on them the right to recover wholly depends (Ryer v. Prudential Ins. Co., 85 App. Div. 7, 82 N. Y. Supp. 971).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-4\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> The present averments do not show that the defendant in any way renounced its previous contract, or by conduct substituted a new contract, or dispensed with the performance of something which it had a right to exact. On the contrary, the complaint implies that, instead of renouncing any rights, the defendant and its architect insisted on all their original rights, even to the point of unreasonable and excessive claim under the contract. These facts do not indicate any waiver, but, on the contrary, an attitude the opposite of giving up rights to which it was entitled. The charge of refusing to give the order in writing in collusion and bad faith, as alleged, clearly negatives a waiver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-5\">The demurrer to the second cause of action is therefore sustained, with costs.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b519-6\">Argued before JENKS, P.

'The essential features of that pleading are stated in the opinion of Putnam, J. The matter pleaded is so far without the limits of the contract that there cannot be question for fair debate and doubt upon that subject, and hence the theory of breach of contract cannot be sustained1. See Borough Const. Co. v. City of New York, 200 N. Y. 157, 93 N. E. 480, 140 Am. St. Rep. 633; Molloy v. Village of Briar-cliff Manor, 145 App. Div. 491, 129 N. Y.
