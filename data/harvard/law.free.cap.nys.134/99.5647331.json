Tuohy, No. 28 Jackson avenue, in Long Island City, Queens county, New .York, and it is understood that the stipulations aforesaid are to apply to and bind the heirs, executors, administrators and assigns of the respective, parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-15\">No one claimed at the trial that on the 28th day of January, 1907, the vendor was in a position to give the title which she had contracted to give; that is, free from incumbrances. There was -no requirement in the contract that the vendee should give any notice to the vendor as to the mortgages, etc., prior to the day on which the title was to close. Therefore neither of the parties to the contract was in default on that day, because the courts would read into the contract a provision that the vendor was entitled to wait until the closing day to learn from the vendee whether he would assume the incumbrances, and was likewise entitled to a reasonable time thereafter to remove the incumbrances, if the vendee failed to disclose his intentions on that point until the closihg day. Neither party claimed as against the other \u00e1 default on that day. It was error, therefore, for the trial court to submit to the jury as a question of fact to determine whether the plaintiff was in default on January 28, 1907.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>The judgment and order should be reversed and' a new trial granted, costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">JENKS, P.
