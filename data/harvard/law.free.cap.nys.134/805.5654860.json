This action is brought to reform said deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">The complaint alleges that it was the intent of the parties, the one to sell and the other to purchase, a lot of ground, with the house thereon, known as and by the street number 296 Prospect avenue; that said lot was only 18 feet wide, instead of 20 feet wide, and that the \u2022easterly boundary line thereof began at a point 82 feet distant from Sixth avenue, instead of 80 feet, and' that by mutual mistake the deed was executed in form \"as above described.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-14\">Defendant answered, pleading various defenses and denials, and setting up by way of counterclaim that, at the time that the agreement for the purchase and sale of the property was entered into, plaintiff stated and represented to him that the lot was 20 feet wide and that the house upon the same was of the full width of the lot; that in ignorance of the real fact, and relying upon the statements and representations of the plaintiff, he agreed to purchase said property and .to pay for the same the sum of $1,850, subject to an outstanding mortgage thereon for th\u00e9 sum of $3,850; that in fact the house upon the said lot of land did not exceed in width 18 feet, and that by reason thereof the property was not worth the sum which he agreed to pay and did pay, and that by reason thereof he had been damaged in the sum of $1,000, for which sum he demanded recovery of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>To this counterclaim plaintiff demurred, upon the ground that it did not tend to diminish or defeat his recovery, and did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. From an interlocutory judgment, overruling the demurrer, plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> That the counterclaim tends to defeat or diminish plaintiff\u2019s recovery seems clear. In order to justify a judgment reforming an instrument on the ground of mistake, the mistake must be mutual, and the paper as finally executed and delivered must fail to represent the actual intention of each of the parties thereto. 34 Cyc. 915; Avery v. Equitable Life Assurance Society, 117 N. Y. 451, 23 N. E. 3. In his counterclaim, defendant alleges that he intended to purchase a lot 20 feet wide, and supposed that he was purchasing a lot of such dimensions, and that the deed as executed expresses his intention. Whatever plaintiff\u2019s intention or understanding may have been, it is clear that there was no mutual mistake, and, unless that is established, plaintiff\u2019s recovery will be wholly defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> But we are of the opinion that the facts stated in the counterclaim are insufficient to sustain an action for damages for deceit, because there is no allegation that plaintiff, when he made the statement as to the size of the lot and of the house thereon, knew that such statements were false, or, in ignorance of the truth or falsity thereof and indifferent as to the fact, made such statement recklessly, paying no heed to the injury which might ensue. Such an allegation, or an allegation that the statement was fraudulently made, is absolutely essential. Bradbury on Rules of Pleading, 329; Kountze v. Kennedy, 147 N. Y. 124, 41 N. E. 414, 29 L. R. A. 360, 49 Am. St. Rep. 651; McIntyre v. Buell, 132 N. Y. 192, 30 N. E. 396; Inderlied v. Honeywell, 88 App. Div. 144, 84 N. Y. Supp. 333; Carr v. Sanger, 138 App. Div. 32, 122 N. Y. Supp. 593. For anything that appears in the statement of facts constituting the counterclaim, plaintiff, in good faith, and in an honest, although mistaken, belief as to its true dimensions, represented to defendant that the house was 20 feet in width, instead of 18 feet. It may be urged that this is improbable, in view of the fact that plaintiff now claims that he never intended to convey a lot more than 18 feet wide; but the sufficiency of the counterclaim must be determined by the allegations contained therein, and, so tested, within the rule above stated, these are insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">The interlocutory judgment should be reversed, with costs, and plaintiff\u2019s demurrer to defendant\u2019s counterclaim sustained, with costs, with leave to defendant to amend his answer within 20 days after service of a copy of the order to be entered herein, upon payment of the costs of said demurrer and of this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
