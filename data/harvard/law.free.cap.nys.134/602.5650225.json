The absence of a recital to this effect is fatal to the \u2022order. Obermeyer v. Adisky, 123 App. Div. 272, 274, 107 N. Y. Supp. 949; Guerrier v. Merrill, 135 App. Div. 46, 119 N. Y. Supp. 895. I find nothing in the amendment of section 767 of the Code (Laws 1911, c. 366), \u201cDefinition and form of an order,\u201d to affect this determination. The mere authorization of what has come to be known as a \u201cshort form order\u201d does not excuse the omission of the recital of a determination of a substantive factor of the issues involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It may be remarked, also, that the amount of the fine appears excessive. The judgment debtor, in her affidavit in opposition, explains her absence, and offers to appear any time for examination. There is no intimation that she has endeavored to evade service or conceal herself in.any way. On the contrary, it appears that her residence is well known, and that it was and is easy to find and serve her. Under the circumstances, a fine of $50, plus the costs and ascertained expenses of the motion, would have been sufficient. Matter of Husted, 37 Misc. Rep. 237, 75 N. Y. Supp. 252; Reynolds v. Gilchrest, 9 Hun, 203; Kreiser v. Kitaoka, 36 Misc. Rep. 174, 73 N. Y. Supp. 164; Leonard v. Jacobson, 27 Misc. Rep. 325, 57 N. Y. Supp. 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The fact that no actual loss to the creditor was shown to have been incurred does not prevent the imposition of the fine, under section 773 of the Judiciary Law (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 30; formerly Code, \u00a7 2284), provided it appear and be adjudicated under section 770 (formerly section 2281 of the Code) that the offense was \u201ccalculated to, or actually did, defeat, impair, impede or prejudice the rights or remedies\u201d of the judgment creditor.
