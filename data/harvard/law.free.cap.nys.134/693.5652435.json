The act under which the claim is made is known as chapter 460, Laws 1904, the first section of which reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b717-14\">\u201cSection 1. In any case where the grade of any street or avenue in the city of New York has been changed to conform to the location and construction of the new East River bridge authorized by chapter seven hundred and eighty-nine of the Laws of eighteen hundred and ninety-five, the board of assessors of the city of New York is hereby <em>authorized and empowered </em>to estimate and allow the damage which each owner of \u00a1and fronting on such streets or avenues has sustained or will sustain by reason of said change of grade, <em>and to make a just and equitable award of the amount of such damo.ge to the owner or owners </em>of said lands fronting on said street or avenue and opposite' thereto and affected by said change of grade. Provided, however, that no award shall be made unless buildings or improvements have been erected on such land or lands prior to such change of grade, <em>and the damages allowed, if any, shall be limited to such buildings or improvements.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b717-15\"><em>\u25a0 </em>A substantial award has been made to relators, who, however, feel aggrieved thereby because it is, as they consider, insufficient.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b717-16\">Argued before INGRAHAM, P.

We are therefore of the opinion, for the reasons stated in People ex rel. Olin et al. v. Hennessy et al., 134 N. Y. Supp. 691, decided herewith, that we are without power to review the determination. We have, however, looked into the record, with the result that we are satisfied that, if we had the power, we should not interfere with the determination sought to be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The writ1 must therefore be dismissed, with $50 costs and disbursements to the respondents.
