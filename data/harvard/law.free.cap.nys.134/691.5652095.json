People ex rel. Stephens v. Phillips, 88 App. Div. 560, 85 N. Y. Supp. 200; People ex rel. Hallock v. Hennessy, 146 App. Div. 440, 131 N. Y. Supp. 327; Johnson v. Pettit, 120 App. Div. 778, 105 N. Y. Supp. 730. As pointed out in the cases cited, the persuasive reasonings of which need not be reiterated, the relators\u2019 only claim to receive damages for a change of grade is that which the statute gives it and it was competent for the Legislature by the same statute to designate the board or body which was to determine the amount of damages, if any. In the present case it has devolved that duty upon a board of city officers known as the \u201cBoard of Assessors,\u201d just as it might have devolved the duty upon any other officer or board. It has not clothed the board with any of the attributes of a body acting judicially, as it has clothed the permanent board, known as the \u201cChange of Grade Damage Commission,\u201d organized under chapter 567, Laws of 1894. The determinations of the latter board have been held to be reviewable by certiorari, because \u201cthe act expressly provided rules for the guidance and control of the commissioners\u201d; such rules,including an obligation to hear evidence in support of claims or in opposition thereto, and to administer oaths and affirmations to. all persons testifying, and after considering the evidence to award such damages as shall be on the evidence presented just and equitable. Matter of Fitch, 147 N. Y. 334, 41 N. E. 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">It was manifest that these provisions called upon the change of grade damage commission to' act judicially, but nothing of the sort is made applicable to the board of assessors in this proceeding. They are not required to take evidence, although they may do so if they see fit, and they are not confined to a consideration of the evidence in ascertaining if any damage has been suffered, or as to its amount. The act is entirely silent as to how the assessors shall \u201cascertain and award\u201d the damages, and the matter is therefore confided to their discretion. It is true that this court has, in some cases, entertained a 'certiorari to review-the action of the board of assessors under similar statutes; but in those cases we have contented ourselves with passing upon the jurisdiction of the board to act upon certain claims, and have not undertaken to review their determination where jurisdiction was found to have been vested in them: People ex rel. City of New York v. Lyon, 114 App. Div. 583, 100 N. Y. Supp. 62, affirmed 186 N. Y. 545, 80 N. E. 1136. In Heiser v. Gilon, 121 N. Y. 551, 24 N. E. 944, which arose under a statute radically different from that now under consideration, the determination of the board of assessors was set aside, because, as the court thought, they had failed to give adequate notice of hearing to the property owners affected, whence, as it was considered, they had never actually acquired jurisdiction to proceed; but in that case the Court of Appeals was careful to remark:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">\u201cThe only question that we can consider is the regularity of the proceed' ings of the board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">In the present case no such question arises. We are therefore of the opinion, and place our decision squarely upon the ground, that since the record presents no question of jurisdiction, or of the reg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>fdarity of the proceedings, we are without power to review the determination of the board of assessors.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The writ must therefore be dismissed, with $50 costs and disbursements to the respondents. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
