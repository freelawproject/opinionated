The said defendant is now bankrupt, and the respondent Edward Gribbon &amp; Sons, Limited, a creditor of said bankrupt and not a party to the action, obtained from the Special Term.in Kings county an ex parte order in said action, restraining, and staying all proceedings in the action \u201cdirected toward obtaining a personal judgment against Abraham Epstein.\u201d The plaintiff moved at Special Term for an order vacating and setting aside such ex parte order, which motion was made on notice to the creditor, Edward Gribbon &amp; Sons, Limited, and after a hearing the motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-14\">As no grounds are disclosed in the papers on appeal for the granting of the ex parte order, or for the refusal to vacate ait, and as the sole respondent, the creditor at whose instance the stay was granted, has not appeared on the hearing of the appeal or presented a brief, it would seem proper that the order be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate the ex parte order granting the stay be granted, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
