Horton, deceased, has been awarded substantial damages as for a change of grade of Franklin avenue in the city of New York. That avenue was originally laid out as a 50-foot street, and by\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>a map filed in 1894 it was made a .60-foot street, being widened 10 feet on the side upon which claimant\u2019s property abutted. This 10-foot strip was acquired by the city of New York, and an award therefor made to the then owner of the property, and in 1897 the street was physically regulated and graded as a 60-foot street upon the grade established by the act of 1894.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Claimant\u2019s property extends from Franklin avenue to Third avenue, sloping downward very decidedly toward the latter avenue; the difference between the grades of these avenues being from 17 to 22 feet. In consequence of this natural contour of the land, the extension of Franklin avenue 10 feet towards Third avenue left that portion of claimant\u2019s land which abutted upon the widened street some 7 feet below the grade of the street, which grade, however, remained substantially as it had been; the grade established by the map of 1894 differing from the physical surface as it had existed since 1871 by less than one-half a foot. The commissioners have awarded damages upon the theory that there has been a 7-foot change of grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The act from which the commissioners derive authority to proceed (section 1, c. 567, Laws 1894) gives them power to award damages only which have been sustained by reason of a change of grade of a street or avenue. It is manifest that in the present case the grade of Franklin avenue has not been changed, except to an insignificant extent. It is true that there has been a change in the relative grades of the street and of the land abutting upon it; but this is due to the widening of the-street, and not to any change in its grade, and if the claimant has suffered damage it is a result of the widening of the street, not of any change in its grade, for that remains substantially as it has always been..</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">It follows that the writ must be sustained, and the determination of the commissioners annulled, with $50 costs and disbursements. Alt concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
