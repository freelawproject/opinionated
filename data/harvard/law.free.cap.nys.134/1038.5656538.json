The plaintiff and his companion picked.up the piece of concrete, and while carrying it the piece which his companion held broke, causing the concrete to fall on the plaintiff\u2019s fingers. Clearly these facts establish no cause of action at common law. Kalbach v. Ross, 145 App. Div. 55, 129 N. Y. Supp. 243; Beichert v. Reed, 20 App. Div. 635, 47 N. Y. Supp. 119; Hussey v. Coger, 112 N. Y. 614, 20 N. E. 556, 3 L. R. A. 559, 8 Am. St. Rep. 787.</p>\n<p id=\"AN5R\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The respondent claims that, even though he has no common-law action, he can sustain his judgment under the Employer\u2019s Liability Act (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 31). The difficulty in the way of sustaining this contention is that the plaintiff is limited to proving that the accident happened from one of the causes enumerated in the notice. Carron v. Standard Refrigerator Co., 138 App. Div. 723, 123 N. Y. Supp. 682. The notice alleges that :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1063-11\">\u201cThe other man let the heavy concrete slip put of his hands,\u201d (1) \u201cowing to the fact that he was hurried\u201d; (2) \u201cowing to the fact that there were beams and pieces of wood and other materials over which he tripped\u201d; (3) \u201cand also owing to the fact that the said piece of concrete was too heavy and clumsy for two men to carry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1063-12\">The evidence shows that the accident did not arise from any of the causes assigned. The accident happened from the fact that the concrete broke. This fact alone established no cause of action in the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-13\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
