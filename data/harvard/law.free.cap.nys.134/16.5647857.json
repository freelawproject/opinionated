Von Bremsen, 11 N. Y. Supp. 680; Anonymous, 60 N. Y. 262, 19 Am. Rep. 174), -and because the allegation that \u201chis business has been and will be damaged in the sum of $500\u201d did not adequately set forth special damages (King v. Sun Printing &amp; Pub. Ass\u2019n, 84 App. Div. 310, 82 N. Y. Supp. 787; Town Topics Pub. Co. v. Collier, 114 App. Div. 191, 99 N. Y. Supp. 575). The court below, however, denied defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the order of arrest upon condition that plaintiff pay $10 costs of the motion, <em>and serve, an amended complaint, </em>after which the motion to vacate might be renewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Under section 558 of the Code, as appellant claims, where the' order of arrest accompanies the complaint, the order must be vacated if the complaint fails to set forth a cause of action. It is only where the order of arrest is applied for <em>after </em>the service of the complaint that leave may be granted to serve an amended complaint. While the papers on this appeal do not show that the order of arrest was granted to accompany the summons and complaint, that fact was conceded by respondent on the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> Respondent contends that the court, nevertheless, had power, under section 768, as amended in 1911 (Laws 1911, c. 763), to permit an amendment of the complaint; but I do not think that the failure of the complaint to state a cause of action may be regarded as a \u201ctechnical defect\u201d or an \u201cinsufficiency,\u201d and surely not in this case, as one that can be \u201ccured or supplied without prejudice to intervening rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
