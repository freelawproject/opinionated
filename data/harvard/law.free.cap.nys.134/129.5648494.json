J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9A\">The County Court reversed the judgment of the Justice\u2019s Court on questions of law. The learned judge wrote a commendable opinion upon the law of the case, but we think he erred when he excised all testimony as to a return of the goods. The opinion reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-19\">\u201cThe justice erred in refusing to strike out\u201d certain testimony of the plaintiff, \u201cand as the testimony is the only evidence in the case given to establish the defense of rescission, the error is material.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-20\">And also that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-21\">\u201cThe only ground upon which the judgment could be sustained would be that there was an actual return of the goods, which the justice was not authorized to find upon the said evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>The testimony as to actual return is as follows: The defendant, called by the plaintiff, testified upon cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-3\">\u201cI received that letter and made copy at about the time goods were delivered. I returned goods to express company, with instructions to return to the manufacturers. Manufacturers\u2019 address on goods when left at .express office. I don\u2019t remember if took receipt. I have none with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\">\u201cRedirect examination: I delivered them to express company wagon myself, if my memory serves me correctly. I have a clerk. That is my impression. Q. Then your testimony that you delivered the goods to express company is based wholly on your impression? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">\u201cPlaintiff moves that all his testimony regarding the delivery of the goods to the express company be stricken out, because is immaterial, and because is based on an impression. Motion denied. Exception.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The learned county judge seems of opinion that this \u201cimpression\u201d was not evidence. An \u201cimpression\u201d may be derived from the recollection of the witness as to the facts. Then \u201cimpression\u201d is an expression in qualification of memory and is admissible as evidence. Such qualification can but affect the probative force of the testimony, as can such limitations as \u201cI think,\u201d or \u201cI am not sure,\u201d or \u201cto the best of my recollection,\u201d and the like. See Moore on Facts, \u00a7 1272, and cases cited. If, on the other hand, an \u201cimpression\u201d indicates that it is but an inference, or that it \u201cis not derived from recollection of the fact, and is so slight as to render it probable that it may have been derived from others, or may have been some unwarrantable deduction of the witness\u2019 own mind, it will be rejected.\u201d Greenleaf on Evidence (15th Ed.) \u00a7 440; Wigmore on Evidence, \u00a7 726, and cases cited; Kingsbury v. Moses, 45 N. H. 222; Whitman v. Morey, 63 N. H. 448, 2 Atl. 899; Humphries v. Parker, 52 Me. 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">We think that the justice did not err in the ruling, and, as this evidence was not disputed, it was sufficient to support his judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The judgment of the County Court of Nassau County is reversed, with costs, and that of the Justice\u2019s Court is affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
