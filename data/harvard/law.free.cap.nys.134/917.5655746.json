We are of the opinion that the evidence fell short of establishing any willful or contumacious insubordination, or violation of orders. The relator and his companion may well have hesitated as to what their- duty was under the circumstances. The statutes (section 338, Greater New York Charter; section 1844, Penal Law; section 165, Code Criminal Procedure) provide that a prisoner arrested by a policeman shall be taken before a magistrate, to be held or discharged as the case might require; and we find nowhere, nor have we been referred to, any statute conferring the power of magistrates upon police lieutenants, or authorizing them to decide whether a prisoner should be held or discharged. It is true that the rules of the department find the necessities of proper discipline-require that the members of the force shall promptly obey the lawful orders of their superior officers. But when an officer receives an order, such as the relator did in this case, which is designed to prevent his per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>formance of what seems to be a plain statutory duty, he is not to be convicted of insubordination because he stops for a few minutes to consider what course his duty as a policeman requires him to take. While we interfere reluctantly with the disciplinary measures of the police department, it is our duty to do so when the only offense charged fails of support from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">The writ must be sustained, the proceedings annulled, and the relator reinstated, with $50 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
