Accordingly, the order appealed from was made, postponing the hearing of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>motion, and permitting defendant, if so advised, to serve an amended answer; the court being of opinion, that section 768 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended in 1911 (Laws 1911, c. 763), permitted such practice. The amendment, so far as material, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-3\">\u201cUpon the hearing of a motion relief shall not be denied to any party because of defects or insufficiencies in the moving papers which can be cured upon the hearing or before the entry of the order thereon, but the court or judge shall direct that such insufficiencies be cured or supplied forthwith, and shall proceed to hear and consider the motion, or may direct the motion to stand over to be heard at a subsequent time or place.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">We think this amendment was not intended to authorize an amendment of pleadings to be ordered or authorized at Special Term, except upon motion for that express purpose. The order appealed from should be modified, by striking out the provisions permitting defendant to serve an amended answer, and substituting a provision giving defendant leave, if so advised, to move at Special Term to amend his answer. The motion to change the venue may be renewed upon the same papers and additional papers, including the amended answer, if one is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The order, as so modified, should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
