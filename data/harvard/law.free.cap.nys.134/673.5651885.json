Wherefore he has been damaged in the sum of $12,684, for which he asks judgment, with interest from the 15th of September, 1910.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The defendants demurred, upon the ground that the facts stated did not constitute a cause of action, and the plaintiff moved for judgment on the pleadings. The court granted the motion, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">\u201cWhile the allegations of the complaint are neither definite nor certain, the intendments necessarily drawn in favor of the pleader as on a demurrer require me to hold that contract for purchase of plaintiff\u2019s farm and a breach thereof by defendants is alleged. Motion granted, with leave to defendants-to plead over.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The respondent states that he has not attempted to allege an express contract to purchase by defendants, but has set forth facts which the law says throw upon the defendants the liabilities of purchasers;, that is, he claims that he is suing the defendants as agents for an undisclosed principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">There is no such allegation in the complaint. The allegation is. that the plaintiff furnished the defendants an option to secure a purchaser; that defendants informed him that they had, and asked him to send them a copy of the deed and a power of attorney to enable-them to convey. This is an allegation of an employment of defendants by plaintiff as agents to sell, and not to purchase. An option .to procure a purchaser is not an option to purchase. What plaintiff gave to defendants was merely an authorization to find a purchaser at a fixed price. When defendants reported that they had found such customer, and requested the necessary papers to make conveyance to-him, and said purchaser subsequently refused to complete, upon what principle can the obligation to purchase be transferred to the agent, who had undertaken to procure a purchaser? .</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Respondent has mistaken the basis of the rule of undisclosed principal. The liability of the agent arises out of a real contract made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>by the agent, and not out of an obligation imposed by law for a failure to discover the principal. No such contract is alleged. The liability of an agent upon the theory of undisclosed principal is. to the person with whom he deals as agent, ostensibly for himself, but really for his principal. It is not to his principal. His liability to his principal is to exercise good faith, to obey instructions, to account. Parts of several causes of action are hinted at in the complaint. But none are complete. Sufficient facts are not set forth to constitute the cause of action claimed by the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for judgment denied, with $10 costs, with leave to plaintiff to serve an amended complaint within 20 days on payment of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
