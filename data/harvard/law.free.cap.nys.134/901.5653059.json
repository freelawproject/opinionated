Smith against Elly Smith. From an order of the City Court of the City of New York, denying defendant\u2019s motion to vacate an order requiring defendant to appear for examination before trial, and from an order denying a motion to resettle the aforesaid order, so as to show a default on the part of plaintiff, and recite that the order for the examination of the defendant was vacated and set aside, defendant appeals. Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b926-11\">The opinion of Delehahty, J., on motion to vacate order, is as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b926-12\">Motion to vacate denied, and defendant directed to appear for examination herein \u00f3n February 19, 1912, at 10 a. m., in Special Term, Part 2, pursuant to order originally made herein. In Reed' v. Smith, 122 App. Div. 795, 10T N. Y. Supp. 893, it is held that plaintiff is entitled to examine his adversary before trial to prove that letters and telegrams were sent by defendant to plaintiff, where the affidavit fairly shows that the examination is sought to obtain a deposition for use upon the trial. This decision, in my opinion, is controlling upon this application; it being fairly shown that plaintiff intends in good faith to use the testimony upon trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b926-13\">Motion to Resettle Order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b926-14\">While it is true that plaintiff defaulted on the motion of defendant to vacate the order of examination herein, it does not follow that the court was bound to grant the relief simply because asked for. Rule 37 of the General Rules of Practice expressly provides that upon default the relief asked for may be granted \u201cunless the court shall otherwise direct.\u201d It would be ridiculous to claim that a moving party would be entitled to unlawful relief on his adversary defaulting in appearing. Such a situation arises here, and in denying the application my invention was made manifest thereon. The application to resettle order is denied, with $10 costs, and defendant directed to appear and submit to examination on February 21, 1912, at 10 a. m., at Special Term, Part 2, pursuant to order heretofore made herein.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b926-15\">Argued April term, 1912, before SEABURY, GUY, and GERARD, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b926-16\">Bernard Gordon, of New York City (Gaston Rosenstiel, of New York City, of counsel), for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b926-17\">Merrill &amp; Rogers, of New York City (Noah C.

I think that the plaintiff is entitled to this examination, in order to sustain his affirmative cause, and to prove that letters and telegrams were sent by the defendant to the plaintiff, and that money was received by her. See Reed v. Smith, 122 App. Div. 795, 107 N. Y. Supp. 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">The orders appealed from must be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. .
