The brother testified that defendant had said that he did not care to see the original packages then in the warehouse, adding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-16\">\u201cI know your goods, and I know they are all right, and you can ship them around by \"the truckman.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-17\">Being pressed on cross-examination, plaintiff\u2019s brother admitted that it was defendant\u2019s \u201cprivilege to examine the goods,\u201d and that \u201che did tell me at that time that he would examine the merchandise, after I guaranteed it to be according to sample.\u201d Upon defendant\u2019s receipt of the goods at his own warehouse, he immediately compared them with the samples, and forthwith rejected them, and, on plaintiff\u2019s refusal to accept their returp, stored! them at plaintiff\u2019s \u25a0\u201crisk and disposal,\u201d and so notified him.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-18\">Upon this state of facts, as shown on plaintiff\u2019s case, it is clear that the delivery was conditional, and that there was no acceptance sufficient to meet the plea of the statute. Hatch v. Gluck, 47 Misc. Rep. 122, 93 N. Y. Supp. 508. This point was properly raised by defendant at every stage of the trial, and due exception taken to its being overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-19\">Defendant was entitled to a dismissal of the complaint at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, and to a direction of a verdict in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>defendant on the close of his case, and the refusal of the learned trial judge to grant defendant\u2019s requests therefor are error.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Plaintiff makes some point of, the fact that when he told defendant that these goods were a \u201cjob lot,\u201d and that he did not wish them to go out to the trade with his original labels thereon, defendant told him that he might take the labels off and substitute numbers, suggested by defendant, and that they were so packed before shipping them to defendant. Plaintiff claims that this was the exercise of such dominion over the goods as constituted an acceptance of delivery in plaintiff\u2019s warehouse. It seems to me, however, that the matter referred to was of too trifling a nature, even standing by itself, to constitute acceptance; but, in any event, it neither destroys nor detracts from the admitted condition upon which the goods were soldi.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and complaint dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
