The notice of motion in this case was for judgment on the award against the appellants, and the appeal is by them individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The appellant, Solomon G. Salomon, cannot complain because a sum found due- the estate of which he is executor in a separate award was deducted from the sum found to be owing the respondent by him individually, and, of course, the respondent is not in a position to complain. We are not now concerned with the question whether the estate of Gustave Salomon is concluded by that offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
