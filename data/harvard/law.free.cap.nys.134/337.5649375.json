Laws 1909, c. 31) \u00a7 202, as amended by Laws 1910, c. 352, that it might be found that plaintiff\u2019s intestate assumed the risk, and that, if so, defendant would not be liable, and plaintiff thereupon requested a charge that, if the falling of the crust that killed the deceased was due to a defect which could have been discovered by the foreman by reasonable care or inspection, then the death of the deceased was not due to assumed risk. <em>Held, </em>that the requested charge called for a correction of the charge as to assumed risk, to conform to the statute, and that its refusal was reversible error.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b361-15\">[Ed.

In view of the charge upon 'this subject, plaintiff\u2019s counsel made a request to charge, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-11\">\u201cI ask your honor to charge the jury that, if they find as a fact that the falling of the crust that killed the deceased was due to a defect which could have been discovered by the foreman by the exercise of reasonable and proper care, test, or inspection, then and in that case the death of deceased was not due to assumed risk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">The court declined to so charge, and allowed an exception to plaintiff. We think this exception was well taken. It was the law of the case under this charge that the defendant was liable in case his foreman negligently set plaintiff\u2019s intestate to work at the place where he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>was injured without having used due care to ascertain whether it was saie. The request to charge must be construed in view of the charge as made, and, so construed, we think it fairly called for a correction of the charge as to assumed risk, to conform to\u201ethe amended statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The jury has found a verdict in favor of the defendant. There was ample evidence to support the verdict, either upon the ground that defendant\u2019s foreman was not negligent or that plaintiff\u2019s intestate was negligent; but we are unable to say upon this record that the jury may not have found upon these questions in favor of the plaintiff, and based their verdict upon the sole ground that plaintiff\u2019s intestate assumed the risk. Hence the plaintiff may have been prejudiced by the refusal to charge as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The judgment and order appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur, except ROBSON, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
