They then told him that they were state agents and asked him for a sample. He then gave them samples in bottles produced by the agents. The samples were drawn from a barrel marked on one end \u201cspirits of turpentine,\u201d and the defendant showed the agents a bill for this turpentine dated five days before. The samples taken were unquestionably adulterated spirits of turpentine. Upon these facts the trial justice gave judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-16\">It seems to me that this judgment is erroneous. The plaintiff relies upon section 7 of the Agricultural Law, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-17\">\u201cAny person who shall keep, store or display any article or product the manufacture or sale of which is prohibited or regulated by the chapter with other merchandise or stock in his place of business shall be deemed to have the same in his possession for sale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-18\">Unquestionably under this section it is a fair inference that the defendant had this turpentine for sale. If the sale or offer for sale were absolutely prohibited, then the plaintiff\u2019s case might be complete; but it was entirely lawful for defendant to sell or offer this turpentine for sale, provided the package in which it is sold is properly labeled. There is no claim that the defendant offered the turpentine for sale in the original barrel, and the fair inference is that he merely drew any turpentine which he offered for sale from the barrel into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>some other package. The defendant did not sell or offer to sell the turpentine to the agents, and there is no evidence that he ever sold or offered to sell adulterated turpentine, except in properly marked bottles.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and complaint dismissed, with costs to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">BIJUR, J., concurs.
