The Dart Cereal Company was adjudicated a bankrupt oifjune 26, 1911. The defendants are copartners. The defendants admitted the cause of action alleged in the complaint, and by way of set-off alleged that prior to the institution of the bankruptcy proceedings the Dart Cereal Company was indebted to Rubin, one of the defendants, in the sum of $350.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-10\">The learned court below directed a verdict for the plaintiff. We think that the direction of the court below was correct. The individual claim of one of the partners could not properly be set off against a claim against both partners upon their joint debt. Hunter v. Booth, 84 App. Div. 585, 82 N. Y. Supp. 1000; Thomas v. Noonan, 133 App. Div. 459, 118 N. Y. Supp. 25; Blumenthal v. Katz, 132 N. Y. Supp. 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-11\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
