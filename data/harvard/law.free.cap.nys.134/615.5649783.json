Laws 1909, c. 13). The defendant is a notary, and after he signed his name he stamped upon the will a seal and an impression, both containing the words \u201cNotary Public, New York County.\u201d It is true that these wprds are stamped on the edge of the paper, so that the impression of the words \u201cNew York County\u201d is not quite complete; but the impression is quite sufficient to be intelligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-15\">It seems to me that these words constitute a sufficient compliance with the statute. The plaintiff does not deny that they were sufficient to permit him to find the defendant without difficulty when he-desired his testimony. The county of New York is a political division entirely embraced within the city of New York, and is narrower than a designation of the city of New York as a place of residence. Unless, therefore, we are prepared to hold that the statute requires the witness,to add his street number in large cities, it sufficiently describes his place of residence. If this statute were a remedial statute, it might be so construed as to require a street number,in cities of great size; but it is a strictly penal statute, enacted prior to the year 1830, at a time when there were no large cities within the state. Moreover, it is somewhat significant of the legislative intent that in a recent statute (chapter 227 of the Laws of 1910; section 333 of the Real Property Law) the Legislature has used the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-16\">\u201cAfter September thirtieth, nineteen hundred and ten, a recording officer shall not record or accept for record any conveyance of real property, unless the residence of the purchaser and, if in a city of over five hundred thousand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>inhabitants according to the last federal census, the street number of the residence of the purchaser shall be stated therein, and such residence and street number shall be recorded with the conveyance. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">It seems to me that by this language the Legislature has implied that the word \u201cresidence,\u201d standing alone in a statute, does not require the addition of a street number. Certainly, if the language of the early penal statute is not entirely clear, its meaning should not be \u2022 enlarged beyond its strict construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The appellant also urges- that the statute is unconstitutional Certainly there are both strong reason in and high judicial authority <em>iov </em>his view (see dissenting opinion of O\u2019Brien, J., in Dodge v. Cornelius, 168 N. Y. 242, 61 N. E. 244); but since, in my opinion, the statute has not been violated, we should not pass upon its constitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Order setting aside the judgment should be reversed, with costs to appellant, and judgment reinstated. All\"concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
