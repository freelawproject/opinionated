The notes were signed by the defendant in West' Virginia, and, with certain stock collateral, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>were sent to Boston to be negotiated, for the purpose of paying the defendants subscriptions to the capital stock of a corporation of which he was president. The notes were made without interest, but the principal sum included an amount for interest equal to the amount of dividends then being paid on the preferred stock, pledged as security, which amounted to 8 */io per cent, on the sum required to pay the defendant\u2019s subscriptions. It is claimed that, pursuant to certain provisions of the laws of West Virginia, which were put in evidence, the notes are void as to any excess of interest above 6 per cent. We do not deem it necessary to decide whether the agreement was one to pay interest in excess of 6 per cent., or whether the defendant failed to prove that the case was not within the exception of the statute, for the reason that we are of the opinion that the case is governed by the laws of Massachusetts. The note was negotiated in Boston, where the defendant procured it to be sent for the purpose of having it negotiated. The fact that he signed it in West Virginia is of no consequence.' It had its inception in Boston. Tilden v. Blair, 21 Wall. 241, 22 L. Ed. 632; Hooley v Talcott, 129 App. Div. 233, 113 N. Y. Supp. 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It was not an abuse of discretion to deny the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw a juror and for leave to apply to Special Term to amend the answer, for the purpose of setting up matters which did not constitute a defense, even if there were no other reasons for denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
