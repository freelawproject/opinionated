(Health Net), denying the plaintiffs request for payment of orthodontic treatment for her minor daughter, Sarah Asadoorian (Sarah), who is an EPSDT recipient. The department and Health Net now appeal from the judgment of the trial court sustaining the administrative appeal and remanding the case to the department for further proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reverse the judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>the trial court and remand the case to that court with direction to render judgment dismissing the plaintiffs administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The department utilizes a points system known as the Salzmann Assessment as part of its method for determining whether orthodontic treatment is medically necessary for medicaid recipients in the EPSDT program. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17-134d-35 (e) (1); see also footnote 1 of this opinion. The Salzmann Assessment was created by J. A. Salzmann, a professor of orthodontics, and adopted by the American Association of Orthodontists \u201cto provide a method for establishing priority in accepting patients in public health and prepayment programs in keeping with available professional personnel and budgetary requirements . . . .\u201d J. A. Salzmann, \u201cOrthodontics in Public Health and Prepayment Programs,\u201d Orthodontics in Daily Practice (1974) p. 629. The Salzmann Assessment \u201cprovides a method for assessing the severity of a malocclusion according to [a] numerical rating of the maloccluded, missing, and maipositioned permanent teeth. The deviations and assigned point values (weights) employed [therein] are based on a consensus among orthodontists of their contribution to the severity of occlusal and dentofacial deviations that interfere with dental health, function, and esthetics.\u201d Id. The scoring is done on a standard form, and the assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>may be made using either molds of the patient\u2019s teeth or directly from the patient\u2019s mouth. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u201cThe total score for an individual provides an index to the need for treatment unaffected by subjective considerations of etiology, treatment planning, difficulty and duration of treatment required, or other professional judgments. However, special circumstances that affect the acceptability of an individual patient can be inserted under [the form category for] \u2018Remarks.\u2019 \u201d Id., p. 630. The score utilized under the assessment \u201cis then set at a [points total] that will include a sufficient number of children for treatment in keeping with available competent professional personnel and funds budgeted for orthodontics. . . . Practical experience in using the Index indicates that a score of about [twenty-six] points or more usually indicates a high-priority malocclusion that requires treatment.\u201d Id., pp. 630-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">The department\u2019s regulations deem orthodontic treatment to be medically necessary per se for any eligible recipient who receives a Salzmann Assessment score of twenty-four or more points. Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17-134d-35 (e) (1). If the recipient scores less than twenty-four points, the analysis proceeds to a second step whereby \u201cthe [department shall consider additional information of a substantial nature about the presence of other severe deviations affecting the mouth and underlying structures. Other deviations shall be considered to be severe if, left untreated, they would cause irreversible damage to the teeth and underlying structures.\u201d Id. The regulation also states that, \u201c[i]f the total score is less than twenty-four . . . points the [department shall consider additional information of a substantial nature about the presence of severe mental, emotional, and/or behavior problems, disturbances or dysfunctions\u201d that are related to the \u201cdentofacial deformity\u201d if \u201corthodontic treatment is necessary and . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>will significantly ameliorate the problems.\u201d Id., \u00a7 17-134d-35 (e) (2); see also footnote 1 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">In the present case, Sarah is a minor who is eligible for and receives medicaid EPSDT medical services, which are known in Connecticut as \u201cHusky A.\u201d Health Net is Sarah\u2019s managed care provider pursuant to its contract with the department. Russell Ferrigno, an orthodontist, examined Sarah and determined that she had an overbite of seven to eight millimeters, compared to a normal range of one to three millimeters. Ferrigno requested from Doral Dental (Doral), a subcontractor of Health Net, authorization to provide Sarah with orthodontic services. Ferrigno had determined that Sarah\u2019s condition placed her at thirty points on the Salzmann Assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Thereafter, Ferrigno sent X rays and molds of Sarah\u2019s teeth to Doral. A Doral orthodontist examined them and determined that her condition warranted only eight points on the Salzmann Assessment. Accordingly, Doral denied the plaintiffs request for Sarah\u2019s orthodontic services on the ground that such services were not medically necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">Subsequently, Ferrigno sent a letter to Doral explaining why he felt that Sarah required orthodontic treatment. Ferrigno stated therein that, although Sarah has a class I malocclusion, which means that her back teeth line up normally, she has other conditions requiring correction. A second orthodontist at Doral then assessed the initial denial of benefits and examined new X rays and molds of Sarah\u2019s teeth. He also assigned Sarah\u2019s condition eight points on the Salzmann Assessment. At oral argument before this court, the plaintiff conceded that Sarah\u2019s teeth were scored correctly as eight points on the Salzmann Assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">Thereafter, in October, 2002, an administrative hearing was held before a department hearing officer at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>request of the plaintiff. The hearing officer determined that Health Net and Doral properly had denied the plaintiffs request for orthodontic services. The hearing officer found that Ferrigno improperly had assigned sixteen points to Sarah\u2019s overbite, which was not sufficiently extensive to meet the definition of an overbite under the Salzmann Assessment; therefore, it did not warrant the assignment of <em>any </em>points on that scale. The hearing officer also found that Ferrigno improperly had assigned points to eight teeth for the overbite, even though the Salzmann Assessment permits only four teeth to be included in the overbite scoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The plaintiff appealed from the decision of the department hearing officer to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183. The trial court subsequently granted Health Net\u2019s motion to intervene as a party defendant. After considering the federal and state statutory and regulatory schemes, as well as applicable case law, including this court\u2019s decision in <em>Persico </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>191 Conn. 384, 465 A.2d 308 (1983), the trial court stated that, \u201cit is clear that attempts by the [department] to establish eligibility requirements for medicaid which are stricter than those authorized by the medicaid act are ineffective.\u201d The trial court concluded that the department\u2019s decision was incorrect because, although it \u201caddresses the elements of Connecticut\u2019s plan which deal with the criteria for orthodontic services, it ignores the mandate of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d (r) (5) that a state shall provide such other necessary health care ... to correct or ameliorate defects <em>whether or not such services are covered under the state plan.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) The trial court also concluded that the department\u2019s decision improperly established irreversibility of orthodontic damage as a criterion for treatment eligibility \u201cwithout authority to do so in federal or Connecticut statute or regulation . . . .\u201d Accordingly, the trial court rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>judgment sustaining the plaintiffs administrative appeal and remanded the case to the department for a new hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These appeals followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">On appeal, the defendants contend that the trial court improperly added a step to the medical necessity analysis by applying the catch-all provision of the EPSDT statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d (r) (5), which they argue is inapplicable because there is a different subdivision that pertains specifically to dental care, namely, \u00a7 1396d (r) (3). They also claim that the orthodontics regulation is a reasonable restriction on orthodontic treatment and, therefore, does not violate federal medicaid law, which permits states to impose reasonable utilization controls. Finally, the defendants assert that the trial court improperly concluded that the hearing officer was incorrect to consider \u201cirreversibility\u201d of damage in the medical necessity determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>In response, the plaintiff, supported by the amici,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> claims that the trial court properly considered \u00a7 1396d (r) in its entirety, rather than confining its inquiry to subdivision (3). The plaintiff contends that the trial court properly construed \u00a7 1396d (r) in a manner that effectuates \u201cthe breadth and beneficence of Congress\u2019 goal in creating EPSDT.\u201d Finally, the plaintiff claims that the orthodontics regulation is improperly restrictive, and therefore, violates federal medicaid law.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">We begin our analysis by setting forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cOrdinarily, [o]ur resolution of [such appeals] is guided by the limited scope of judicial review afforded by the [UAPA] ... to the determinations made by an administrative agency. [W]e must decide, in view of all the evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily or illegally, or abused its discretion. . . . Conclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\u201cA reviewing court, however, is not required to defer to an improper application of the law. ... It is the function of the courts to expound and apply governing principles of law. . . . We previously have recognized that the construction and interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the courts, where the administrative decision is not entitled to special deference .... Questions of law [invoke] a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Because this case forces us to examine a question of law, namely, [statutory] construction and interpretation . . . our review is de novo.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Director, Retirement &amp; Benefits Services Division </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>256 Conn. 764, 770-72, 775 A.2d 981 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">\u201cIt is well settled that in construing statutes, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Manifold </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>272 Conn. 410, 419, 862 A.2d 292 (2004); see also General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z (plain meaning rule);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Webster Bank </em>v. <em>Oakley, </em>265 Conn. 539, 554-55, 830 A.2d 139 (2003) (stating that \u201cprinciples of comity and consistency\u201d require this court to follow plain meaning rule in construing federal statutes), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 903, 124 S.

Subsection (r) further defines EPSDT services as, inter alia, \u2018[s]uch other necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures described in [\u00a7 1396d (a)] to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services, whether or not such services are covered under the [s]tate plan.\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d (r) (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u201cThus, EPSDT is a comprehensive child health program designed to assure the availability and accessibility of health care resources for the treatment, correction and amelioration of the unhealthful conditions of individual [m]edicaid recipients under the age of twenty-one. . . .

Indeed, states \u201cmay place appropriate limits on a service based on such criteria as medical necessity or on utilization control procedures.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.230 (d). It is well settled that these limits may not, however, be stricter than any set forth by federal statute or regulation. See, e.g., <em>Persico </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">This flexibility extends to dental services, which states are required to provide under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d (r) (3). See State Medicaid Manual, supra, \u00a7 5124 B 2 b, pp. 5-17 through 5-18; see also <em>Jacobus </em>v. <em>Dept. of PATH, </em>177 Vt. 496, 499, 857 A.2d 785 (2004).

The State Medicaid Manual elaborates further on the states\u2019 responsibilities with respect to dental care: \u201cDental care includes emergency and preventive services and therapeutic services for dental disease which, if left untreated, may become acute dental problems or may cause irreversible damage to the teeth or supporting structures.\u201d State Medicaid Manual, supra, \u00a7 5124 B 2 b, p. 5-18. After describing emergency and preventive dental services, the State Medicaid Manual states that therapeutic services include, inter alia, \u201c[o]rthodontic treatment when medically necessary to correct handicapping malocclusion.\u201d Id., \u00a7 5124 B 2 b, p. 5-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Section 17-134d-35 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies is the orthodontics regulation that gov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>ems the provision of orthodontic treatment under the state EPSDT program, and provides that the state will pay for orthodontic services pursuant to the EPSDT program if they are \u201cprovided by a qualified dentist\u201d and are \u201cdeemed medically necessary as described in these regulations.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17-134d-35 (a). Subsection (e) of \u00a7 17-134d-35, which is at issue in this appeal, provides a detailed procedure by which the department determines whether orthodontic services are medically necessary.

We conclude that \u00a7 1396d (r) (5) does not require a hearing officer to conduct a medical necessity analysis separate and apart from that prescribed by the orthodontics regulation because dental services are not governed by that subdivision. Instead, dental services are governed specifically by subdivision (3) of \u00a7 1396d (r).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Section 1396d (r) (5) requires the states to provide \u201cother necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures described in subsection (a) of this section to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services, whether or not such services are covered under the [s]tate plan.\u201d Subdivision (5) of \u00a7 1396d (r) refers to \u00a7 1396d (a), which defines the term \u201c \u2018medical assistance\u2019 \u201d as \u201cpayment of part or all of the cost of the following care and services,\u201d in twenty-seven enumerated categories, including, in relevant part: \u201cdental services\u201d; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d (a) (10); and \u201cearly and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services (as defined in subsection [r] of this section) for individuals who are eligible under the plan and are under the age of 21____\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d (a) (4) (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Congress enacted subdivision (5) of \u00a7 1396d (r) in 1989 as a general catch-all provision in \u201cresponse to the disappointing performance of the EPSDT treatment function as optional and within each state\u2019s discretion.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number><em>S.D. ex rel.

Indeed, the trial court\u2019s application of subdivision (5) renders superfluous subdivision (3). This, of course, violates cardinal principles of statutory construction because it is understood that \u201cthe legislature did not intend to enact meaningless provisions. . . .

Accordingly, subdivision (5) of \u00a7 1396d (r) is inapplicable to those medical services that already are addressed expressly in the other subdivisions of the statute, namely, vision, hearing and dental services. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d (r) (2), (3) and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Moreover, medical necessity remains the touchstone for the provision of services under either subdivision (5) of \u00a7 1396d (r) or subdivision (3). There is nothing in the text or legislative history of subdivision (5) that precludes states from using utilization controls to determine whether requested services are medically necessary. See H.R. Rep. No. 101-247, 101st Cong., 1st. Sess. 399 (1989), reprinted in 1989 U.S.S.C.A.N. 1906, 2125 (\u201c[w]hile [sjtates may use prior authorization and other utilization controls to ensure that treatment services are medically necessary, these controls must be consistent with the preventive thrust of the EPSDT benefit\u201d). Accordingly, the reliance by the amici and the plaintiff at oral argument before this court on the recent decision by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>S.D. ex rel. Dickson </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>supra, 391 F.3d 581, is misplaced. In that case, which provides a paradigmatic example of the application of \u00a7 1396d (r) (5), a physician had prescribed disposable incontinence underwear for a medicaid recipient who was a teenage boy with spina bifida suffering from bowel and bladder incontinence. Id., 584-85. The physician had concluded that the incontinence underwear was medically necessary because the boy had a lack of sensation below his waist, and therefore, was prone to infection. Id. The physician also \u201cdetermined that without such a prescription, [the boy] would be home bound, isolated and unable to attend school or engage in other age-appropriate activities.\u201d Id., 585. The state department of social services refused, however, to pay for the underwear, stating that diapers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>were \u201c \u2018specifically excluded from coverage\u2019 under the Louisiana State Medicaid Plan.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The Fifth Circuit concluded that the state was obligated by \u00a7 1396d (r) (5) to pay for the incontinence underwear because \u201cparticipating states must provide all services within the scope of \u00a7 1396d (a) which are necessary to correct or ameliorate defects, illnesses, and conditions in children discovered by the screening services.\u201d Id., 593. The court stated that, because it was undisputed on appeal that the incontinence underwear was medically necessary, the key question was whether the incontinence underwear was a service described by \u00a7 1396d (a). Id., 593-94. After reviewing CMS regulations and other states\u2019 plans that had been approved by CMS, the court concluded that incontinence underwear was included within the ambit of \u00a7 1396d (a) (7), which includes \u201chome health care services\u201d as a category of medical assistance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id., 595-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\"><em>S.D. ex rel. Dickson </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>supra, 391 F.3d 581, is distinguishable from the present case because, in that case, it was necessary to resort to the catch-all provision as the incontinence underwear was not a benefit addressed specifically by the other subdivisions of \u00a7 1396d (r). The underwear also was clearly medically necessary because of the recipient\u2019s condition, and the broad catch-all worked as Congress intended to ensure that the EPSDT recipient therein received the services that he needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Accordingly, we also disagree with <em>Jacobus </em>v. <em>Dept. of PATH, </em>supra, 177 Vt, 496, to the extent that the amici <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>rely on it for the proposition that \u00a7 1396d (r) (5) is applicable to orthodontic treatment. In <em>Jacobus, </em>the Vermont Supreme Court cited <em>both </em>subdivision (5) and subdivision (3) of \u00a7 1396d (r) only to support the unremarkable proposition that, \u201c[u]nder [the] 1989 amendments to the [m]edicaid [a]ct, dental screening and treatment for children under the age of twenty-one is mandatory.\u201d Id., 499. In our view, the Vermont court\u2019s citation to subdivision (5) in support of that proposition simply was redundant and unnecessary given the specificity of subdivision (3). Moreover, in <em>Jacobus, </em>the court specifically declined to reach the issue of whether the department secretary\u2019s administrative interpretation of \u201c \u2018medically necessary\u2019 \u201d as \u201c \u2018to identify and treat serious handicapping malocclusions\u2014those malocclusions that carry with them real functional deficit,\u2019 \u201d met the \u201cminimum federal treatment standard\u201d under \u00a7 1396d (r) (3).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court improperly construed \u00a7 1396d (r) (5) to create a required second step to the medical necessity test utilized by the department pursuant to the orthodontics regulation. That subdivision is inapplicable to the present case given the pertinence of subdivision (3), which speaks specifically to dental care. Accordingly, we now turn to the next issue in this appeal, which is whether the regulation meets the minimum standards required under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">WHETHER THE ORTHODONTICS REGULATION IS VALID AS A REASONABLE UTILIZATION CONTROL</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The defendants next contend that the trial court improperly concluded that the orthodontics regulation is invalid as an eligibility requirement that is more restrictive than the federal medicaid statutes and regulations permit. In response, the plaintiff contends that the orthodontics regulation violates this court\u2019s decision in <em>P\u00e9rsico </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 394, wherein we held that a blanket exclusion of orthodontic care violated federal medicaid statutes and regulations. The plaintiff attacks the substance of the regulation, and asserts that: (1) the Salzmann Assessment is antiquated and never was intended for determinations of medical necessity; and (2) the \u201csavings clauses\u201d in the second and third prongs of the regulation are useless because they are circular and impossible for recipients to satisfy. We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The United States Supreme Court has stated that, \u201c[although serious statutory questions might be presented if a state [m]edicaid plan excluded necessary medical treatment from its coverage, it is hardly inconsistent with the objectives of the [medicaid] [a]ct for a [s]tate to refuse to fund unnecessary\u2014though perhaps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>desirable\u2014medical services.\u201d <em>Beal </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>432 U.S. 438, 444-45, 97 S. Ct. 2366, 53 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1977) (upholding state\u2019s refusal to extend medicaid coverage to nontherapeutic abortions); see also <em>Pharmaceutical Research &amp; Manufacturers of America </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>538 U.S. 644, 665, 123 S. Ct. 1855, 155 L. Ed. 2d 889 (2003) (\u201cthe [m]edicaid [a]ct gives the [s]tates substantial discretion to choose the proper mix of amount, scope, and duration limitations on coverage, as long as care and services are provided in the best interests of the recipients\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). \u201c \u2018[T]hus, where the state sets stricter standards for eligibility than those enumerated by the pertinent federal law, the state standards are tacitly inconsistent with those federal provisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Persico </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 393, quoting <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>White, </em>168 Conn. 336, 344, 362 A.2d 505 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">We begin with this court\u2019s decision in <em>Persico </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 385, wherein the department had denied medicaid coverage for the orthodontic treatment of a thirteen year old boy who was the recipient of EPSDT benefits. There was undisputed evidence that the boy needed orthodontic treatment because his teeth were severely misaligned, with one front tooth being on top of the other, and they were becoming loose and his mouth was bleeding. Id., 387. The boy was withdrawn and self-conscious; he would cover his mouth whenever he talked or smiled. Id. After a fair hearing, the department denied his request for medicaid coverage for orthodontic treatment solely because of a department policy excluding orthodontic coverage except for \u201c[sjpecial consideration [which] may be granted, upon request, for these procedures of an unusual nature not included in the program, necessary to alleviate a serious health problem.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">On subsequent appeal, this court concluded that the department policy\u2019s \u201cdenial of orthodontic treatments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>to EPSDT beneficiaries, such as the plaintiffs son, violates the federal statutes and regulations and is, therefore, illegal and void.\u201d Id., 394. The court emphasized that the state\u2019s authority to impose utilization controls was not a license to provide less treatment than was envisioned by the federal statutes and regulations, which \u201crequir[ed] that a state agency provide dental care needed for relief of pain and infections, restoration of teeth and maintenance of dental health.\u201d Id., 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Consistent with the foregoing principles, we conclude that the orthodontics regulation at issue in the present case is valid as a reasonable utilization control that does not cause recipients to receive less care than was envisioned by \u00a7 1396d (r) (3). It is not a blanket exclusion like the policy that this court contemplated in <em>P\u00e9rsico. </em>Indeed a CMS publication, \u201cGuide to Children\u2019s Dental Care in Medicaid\u201d (2004), appendix A, p. 15 (Dental Guide), available at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ medicaid/epsdt/dentalguide.pdf, which was supplied to this court by the amici, explicitly references in its guidelines for pediatric dental care<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> indices such as the Salzmann Assessment as \u201ccommon approaches for assessing the severity of malocclusions in the transitional or adolescent dentition.\u201d The Dental Guide recognizes that state medicaid programs often use such indices as screening devices, and suggests supplementing their \u201cgeneral utility\u201d with \u201cdentists trained and experienced in pediatric orthodontic and dental-facial orthopedic care to develop and implement orthodontic treatment criteria that can be applied reliably and consistently.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Id. Moreover, a model dental bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>fits statement, promulgated by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry and appended to the Dental Guide, states that medicaid dental \u201c[s]ervices and benefits should include but are not limited to . . . [o]rthodontic services which shall include services for enrollees diagnosed with <em>severe malocclusion, </em>and for enrollees following repair of cleft palate; and for enrollees with other congenital or developmental defects or injury resulting in mal-alignment or <em>severe malocclusion </em>of teeth . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Id., appendix B, pp. 1-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Moreover, our conclusion is consistent with the only other decision addressing the Salzmann Assessment located either by the parties or this court\u2019s independent research. In <em>Chappell </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>834 F. Sup. 1030, 1032-33 (N.D. Ill. 1993), the minor plaintiffs brought a class action challenging the procedure by which the state evaluated EPSDT requests for orthodontic care. In <em>Chappell, </em>the state contracted with a dental managed care organization for prior approval of medicaid dental care, including orthodontia. Id., 1031-32. The contract stated that the managed care provider could grant prior approval of orthodontic treatment only to recipients with Salzmann scores of forty-two or above, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the managed care director had, on some occasions, granted prior approval requests to recipients with Salzmann scores less than forty-two. Id., 1032. In <em>Chappell, </em>the state department of public aid upheld the denial of orthodontic care to the two minor plaintiff class representatives, who had received Salzmann scores of thirty-nine and thirty-three. Id., 1032-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The federal District Court, resolving cross motions for summary judgment, framed the issue, noting that the parties did not dispute that \u201cunder the [mjedicaid law, the state must provide orthodontic services when medically necessary,\u201d and that \u201cthe state may decline to provide orthodontic treatment for purely cosmetic reasons, and that a state may impose a prior approval requirement.\u201d Id., 1034. The court noted that the state had, for fiscal reasons over a span of seven years, raised the Salzmann score required for treatment from thirty to forty-two. Id. The court then denied the parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment, identifying an issue of fact as to how the state and the managed care provider used the Salzmann Assessment. Id., 1035-36. The court concluded that the state and the managed care provider were in compliance with the statutes and regulations if the managed care provider \u201capprove[d] a request for orthodontic treatment in all cases where the child score[d] a [forty-two] or more on the Salzmann Index regardless of whether the malocclusion [was] thought to be handicapping, i.e., medically necessary, and . . . approve[d] a request for treatment in other cases where in the professional opinion of the consultant the malocclusion [was] handicapping and medical treatment [was] necessary regardless of the Salzmann score.\u201d Id., 1034. The court then stated that use of the Salzmann score as a bright line test for denying treatment, as had allegedly been the case with some plaintiffs, would violate the federal medicaid laws. Id., 1035. Accordingly, the court concluded that further factual inquiry was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>necessary, and denied the parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment. Id., 1035-36. The court then issued a subsequent order clarifying the decision and stated: \u201cTo comply with federal law the [state] must authorize orthodontic treatment to all eligible patients having handicapping malocclusions severe enough to have a medical need for such orthodontic treatment. The [state] need not provide orthodontic care to eligible patients having handicapping malocclusions if such conditions are not severe enough to have a medical need for such orthodontic treatment.\u201d <em>Chappell </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>United States District Court, Docket No. 91C4572 (N.D. Ill. November 24, 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">We conclude that the Connecticut orthodontics regulation is a reasonable utilization control that is consistent with the federal statutes and regulations. We note first that the orthodontics regulation ensures that recipients\u2019 individual circumstances are addressed in a competent manner because the assessment must be made by a designated \u201cqualified dentist . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17-134d-35 (e). Additionally, the screen-m score of twenty-four is significantly lower than the forty-two upheld by the District Court in <em>Chappell, </em>and is indeed lower than the twenty-six that Salzmann himself stated \u201c[practical experience . . . indicates [to be] a high-priority malocclusion that requires treatment.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> J. A. Salzmann, supra, pp. 630-31. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Moreover, a score of less than twenty-four will not necessarily result in the denial of orthodontic services because the orthodontics regulation provides two opportunities for additional consideration of individual cases.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">If the patient scores less than twenty-four points, the analysis proceeds to a second step whereby \u201cthe [department shall consider additional information of a substantial nature about the presence of other severe deviations affecting the mouth and underlying structures. Other deviations shall be considered to be severe if, left untreated, they would cause irreversible damage to the teeth and underlying structures.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Regs., Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>State Agencies \u00a7 17-134d-35 (e) (1). As the plaintiff points out, the use of the term \u201cother severe deviations\u201d conceivably could be read as limiting the additional information considered in an individual case to deviations <em>not </em>already accounted for in the Salzmann Assessment score under the first prong. See American Heritage College Dictionary (4th Ed. 2002) (defining \u201cother\u201d as: [1] \u201c[b]eing the remaining one of two or more\u201d; [2] \u201c[different from that or those implied or specified\u201d; [3] \u201c[o]f a different character or quality\u201d; and [4] \u201c[additional; extra\u201d). Presuming that the dentist performing the Salzmann Assessment would include in the total score every eligible defect, this process would significantly reduce the efficacy of the second prong as a safety net for the consideration of individual circumstances of recipients who have a genuine medical need for orthodontic treatment that is not reflected in their Salzmann score. This result is potentially problematic because the meaningful consideration of recipients\u2019 individual circumstances is a key factor in the validity of the regulation under the federal EPSDT statutes and regulations. See <em>Jacobus </em>v. <em>Dept. of PATH, </em>supra, 177 Vt. 500-502 (administrative interpretation of regulation invalid when it was too narrow in scope to permit for review of individual circumstances); see also <em>Chappell </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>supra, 834 F. Sup. 1034 (state complied with EPSDT statutes by reviewing individual circumstances in addition to using Salzmann Assessment). Thus, to keep the second prong of the regulation from falling into fatal conflict with the federal EPSDT statutes and regulations, we read the second prong of the regulation as requiring the department to consider \u201cadditional information of [a] substantial nature about the presence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>of <em>[any] </em>severe deviations affecting the mouth and underlying structures,\u201d regardless of whether they were included in the Saizmann Assessment under the first prong.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>217 Conn. 73, 79, 584 A.2d 1157 (1991) (\u201c[W]hen called upon to interpret a statute, we will search for \u2018an effective and constitutional construction that reasonably accords with the legislature\u2019s underlying intent.\u2019 . . . These principles . . . commend to us a search for a judicial gloss . . . that will effect the legislature\u2019s will in a maimer consistent with constitutional safeguards.\u201d [Citations omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Moreover, \u00a7 17-134d-35 (e) (2) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides, as an alternative to satisfaction of the second prong, that, \u201c[i]f the total score is less than twenty-four . . . points the [department shall consider additional information of a substantial nature about the presence of severe mental, emotional, and/or behavior problems, disturbances or dysfunctions\u201d that are related to the \u201cdentofacial deformity\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> if \u201corthodontic treatment is necessary and . . . will significantly ameliorate the problems.\u201d Accordingly, the regulation permits orthodontic treatment that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>ordinarily might be cosmetic, and not medically necessaiy for the malocclusion or deformity by itself, if the dental problem is causing the recipient significant mental health problems.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">Furthermore, we disagree with the plaintiffs contention that the regulation is invalid under the EPSDT statutes and regulations because it is an evaluation of \u201c \u2018appropriateness,\u2019 \u2019\u2019rather than \u201c \u2018necessity.\u2019 \u201d In <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Millstone, </em>369 Md. 575, 582-84, 801 A.2d 1034 (2002), which was relied on by the plaintiff, the plaintiffs in that case were EPSDT recipients who had needed liver transplants. Although the state initially had authorized medicaid benefits to pay for the liver transplants in each case, it declined subsequent preauthorization to pay for transplants after the transplant had failed in one case and the preauthorization had expired in the other case, determining that the subsequent transplants were neither \u201c \u2018necessary\u2019 \u201d nor \u201c \u2018appropriate\u2019 \u201d given the probability of postoperative complications, despite the fact that the children certainly would die without the transplants. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The Maryland Court of Appeals concluded that state regulations expressly imposing an \u201c \u2018appropriateness\u2019 \u201d analysis in addition to the \u201c \u2018necessity\u2019 \u201d requirement<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> were invalid because the federal EPSDT program \u201cmakes no mention of utilizing an \u2018appropriateness\u2019 analysis in determining whether a medicaid-eligible child should receive medically necessary treatments provided through EPSDT services. Nevertheless, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Maryland medicaid provision regarding preauthorization of services . . . requires that medically necessary treatment for a medicaid-eligible child must also be \u2018appropriate,\u2019 which is beyond the dictates of federal law. The federal guidelines allow states no discretion to use an \u2018appropriateness\u2019 test in deciding whether a person under [twenty-one] can receive medically necessary treatment. Therefore, because the provision imposes additional criteria upon qualified recipients, which illegally denies services to those who would normally receive medically necessary treatment, we agree with the plaintiffs that [the regulation] is partially invalid under federal law.\u201d Id., 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The situation confronted by Maryland\u2019s highest court in <em>Jackson </em>simply is not this case. In that case, a liver transplant was \u201cnecessary\u201d because it was the only way to save the recipients\u2019 lives, but it was not \u201cappropriate\u201d in the context of resource allocation for a variety of reasons, including cost and probability of success. In contrast, orthodontics present far more nuanced questions of medical necessity than do organ transplants, which virtually always are lifesaving procedures of last resort. We view the regulation as a reasonable attempt to balance objectively orthodontics as an option that may be <em>desirable </em>primarily for aesthetic reasons on the one hand, and orthodontics as a <em>medically necessary </em>method of treating significant malocclusions. See <em>Beal </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>supra, 432 U.S. 444-45. Accordingly, in the absence of more substantial empirical or statistical evidence demonstrating that the regulation is frustrating the goals of the EPSDT program; see footnote 17 of this opinion; we conclude that it is a reasonable utilization control measure, and we reverse the judgment of the trial court to the contrary.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment dismissing the plaintiffs administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b25-12\"> Section 17-134d-35 (e) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides: \u201cWhen an eligible recipient is determined to have a malocclusion, the attending dentist should refer the recipient to a qualified dentist for preliminary examination of the degree of malocclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-13\">\u201c(1) The need for orthodontic services shall be determined on the basis of the magnitude of the malocclusion. Accordingly, the \u2018Preliminary Handicapping Malocclusion Assessment Record,\u2019 available from the Department, must be fully completed in accordance with the instructions sections of the form. The Department deems orthodontic services to be medically necessary when a correctly scored total of twenty-four (24) points or greater is calculated from the preliminary assessment. However, if the total score is less than twenty-four (24) points the Department shall consider additional information of a substantial nature about the presence of other severe deviations affecting the mouth and underlying structures. Other deviations shall be considered to be severe if, left untreated, they would cause irreversible damage to the teeth and underlying structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\u201c(2) If the total score is less than twenty-four (24) points the Department shall consider additional information of a substantial nature about the presence of severe mental, emotional, and/or behavior problems, disturbances or dysfunctions, as defined in the most current edition of the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, and which may be caused by the recipient\u2019s daily functioning.

The state regulations governing the provision of orthodontics under the EPSDT program stated that such care would be provided if: (1) the child\u2019s condition met listed numerical criteria; or (2) the care was \u201c \u2018otherwise necessary\u2019 \u201d under a regulation that was an exact quotation of \u00a7 1396d (r) (5). Id., 500. The secretary interpreted the second prong as being limited to \u201c \u2018handicapping malocclusions . . . that carry with them real functional deficit\u2019 \u201d Id., 499. The Vermont Supreme Court concluded that this interpretation was invalid under federal law because it deprived recipients of an opportunity for individualized review of their cases. Id., 501. Moreover, the secretary\u2019s interpretation treated persons who required preventative or interceptive orthodontics differently than those who required treatment of existing malocclusions; the court reasoned that, under the secretary\u2019s \u201c \u2018handicapping malocclusions\u2019 \u201d standard, no recipient ever could qualify for preventative orthodontics. Id., 500. Accordingly, the court concluded that the interpretation violated federal statutes and regulations requiring comparable standards for all groups and prohibiting discrimination on the basis of diagnosis. Id., 499-501 (discussing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a [a] [17], and 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.230 [c]). Indeed, the court noted that the secretary had only applied the numerical criteria to the girls\u2019 cases, and had not conducted a review of their individual circumstances.

We are not unmindful of the importance of adequate oral health care to all members of our society, and the obstacles, particularly financial concerns, that may prevent certain members of our society from receiving the most extensive dental care extant. We also recognize, however, that this is a complicated problem, the resolution of which lies beyond the province of this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b49-7\"> A \u201c \u2018[qualified dentist\u2019 \u201d is defined as a \u201cdentist who:</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\u201c(A) Holds himself out to be an orthodontist in accordance with section 20-106a of the Connecticut State Statutes, or</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">\u201c(B) Documents completion of an American Dental Association accredited post graduate continuing education course consisting of a minimum of two (2) years of orthodontic seminars, and/or submitting three (3) completed case histories with a comparable degree of difficulty as those cases meeting the department\u2019s requirements in section (e) of the department\u2019s orthodontic policy if requested by the orthodontic consultant.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17-134d-35 (b) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b49-10\"> The plaintiff argues that the Salzmann Assessment was not intended to determine the medical necessity of orthodontic treatment in individual cases, but instead is a resource allocation method that focuses on how many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>children a community can afford to treat, rather than the children\u2019s actual need for treatment. We do not find the concepts of medical necessity and resource allocation as easily divorced from one another as the plaintiff suggests. See J. A. Salzmann, supra, p. 631 (score of twenty-six \u201cindicates a high priority malocclusion that requires treatment\u201d). Moreover, inasmuch as the orthodontics regulation is not inconsistent with federal medicaid law, arguments impugning the efficacy of the Salzmann Assessment as a partial method for determining medical necessity are best directed not to this court, but to the policymakers at the department with the relevant expertise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b50-8\"> The plaintiff attempts to demonstrate that the application of the second and third prongs of the regulation always is a circular inquiry whereby a child with a score of less than twenty-four points never will be able to prove necessity. Accordingly, the plaintiff also contends that the regulation sets a bar even higher than that which this court held invalid in <em>P\u00e9rsico </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 384. We disagree with the plaintiffs reading of the regulation\u2019s text, and we note that the record is devoid of any statistical or empirical evidence supporting the plaintiffs contention that resort to the savings clauses is a fool\u2019s errand. Cf. <em>Chappell </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>supra, 834 F. Sup. 1032 (noting state welfare department statistics demonstrating that \u201cexceptions were granted for approximately 1.7 percent of the individuals who scored less than [forty-two]\u201d on Salzmann Assessment). Moreover, we fail to see how the amorphous test of necessity espoused by the plaintiff would be any more effective than the objective standard presently utilized under the orthodontics regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b50-9\"> Accordingly, the trial court improperly concluded that the hearing officer was incorrect to consider irreversibility as a criterion for eligibility, and to deny treatment based in part on the treating orthodontist\u2019s failure to state that any damage would be irreversible. Irreversibility of damage is a criterion established by the plain language of the orthodontics regulation; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17-134d-35 (e) (1); and is indeed contemplated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>the CMS State Medicaid Manual.

We disagree because the plaintiffs argument fails even under the definition if om the American Association of Orthodontists Glossary that she provided in her brief, which defines \u201c[djentofacial deformity\u201d as \u201cdentofacial malformation characterized by dis-harmonies of size, form and function, malocclusion, cleft lip and palate and other skeletal or soft-tissue deformities, including various types of muscular dysfunction.\u201d This definition contemplates the existence of a wide variety of imperfections and deformities, but says nothing about: (1) their severity; or (2) whether they require treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b53-6\"> We note that the hearing officer discussed the third prong, but concluded that the plaintiff had not presented any evidence that Sarah suffered from any psychological problems.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b53-7\"> Under the regulations at issue, \u201c \u2018[n]ecessary\u2019 [was] defined as \u2018directly related to diagnostic, preventative, curative, palliative, or rehabilitative treatment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Millstone, </em>supra, 369 Md. 598. \u201c \u2018Appropriate\u2019 [was] defined as 'an effective service that can be provided, taking into consideration 1he particular circumstances of the recipient and the relative cost of any alternative services which could be used for the same purpose.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b54-7\"> Accordingly, we need not reach the department\u2019s contention that the trial court improperly concluded that the hearing officer had prejudged the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
