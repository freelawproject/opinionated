The defendants, Walter Werbiski and Joyce Werbiski,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appeal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court granting the application of the plaintiff, the town of Wallingford (town), for a permanent injunction permitting the town\u2019s representatives to access the defendants\u2019 property for the purpose of conducting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>land and wetlands survey. On appeal, the defendants contend that the trial court improperly: (1) construed \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (A) (iii); and (2) concluded that the town either did not need to plead or to prove, or in any event had established, the irreparable harm necessary for the issuance of an injunction. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The record reveals the following undisputed relevant facts and procedural history. In January, 2003, the town council voted to fund and authorize the town engineer, John Thompson, to study and to report on the potential for developing 270 acres of privately owned farmland that is located in a part of the town that is zoned for industrial expansion. The area presently is not served by roads or utilities, and Thompson proposed to study the feasibility of constructing roads and utilities such as water, gas, electric and telephone services therein in connection with the possible expansion of an industrial park that is located adjacent thereto. This study would require surveyors to enter upon, and to survey and map the property in order to gather necessary data about the topography of the land. The defendants own two parcels of real property located within this area that are used as working farms for the farming of hay and com for animal consumption, as well as the milking of dairy cows.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">In 2003, the town sent letters to property owners in the area, including the defendants, advising them of the town\u2019s interest in expanding the industrial park and the need to evaluate the area to determine the feasibility of constructing roads and utilities.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereafter, town officials met with these property owners, including the defendants, and explained the study further. The defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>dants nevertheless refused to consent to the town\u2019s surveyors entering upon their land, and have ordered them off on at least two occasions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thompson testified, however, that the feasibility assessment cannot be completed with an acceptable level of accuracy without surveying the defendants\u2019 properties. Thompson testified that the surveyors need access to a 300 foot corridor on the defendants\u2019 property to plan the centerline of a proposed roadway and to outline the location of wetlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Subsequently, the town, via an order to show cause, applied to the trial court for temporary and permanent injunctions requiring the defendants to allow town agents access to their property for the purpose of conducting a survey pursuant to \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (A) (iii). The trial court held a hearing on the order, which the parties stipulated would serve as the full and final hearing on the merits of the case. The trial court granted the town\u2019s application for a permanent injunction and rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that the town\u2019s surveying activities were not \u201cpublic improvements],\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (A) (iii), because they were limited to feasibility studies only. The trial court, noting that the \u201ctown has the power to take this land by eminent domain, [but] prefers to determine the physical and financial feasibility of the project before investing town funds in a taking that could prove to be detrimental to all concerned,\u201d concluded that the defendants\u2019 construction of the statute would preclude the town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>from engaging in \u201ccareful and informed planning . . . .\u201d The trial court did state, however, that it was \u201cdisturbed by the manner in which an earlier entry onto the subject property by town agents was conducted,\u201d and ordered that the surveying work be completed after the defendants\u2019 growing season had concluded, with other accommodations to be negotiated by the parties. The trial court retained jurisdiction over the matter for further review if necessary, and rendered judgment in accordance with its order. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">We begin with the defendants\u2019 first claim, which is that the trial court improperly concluded that the town was authorized to enter the defendants\u2019 land pursuant to \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (A) (iii), because the statutory term \u201cpublic improvement\u201d contemplates only projects that are either: (1) already in existence; or (2) less speculative than a feasibility study, with the municipality\u2019s willingness to proceed having been demonstrated through either the appropriation of funds or the acquisition of land by market purchase or eminent domain. The defendants also contend that the trial court\u2019s decision renders superfluous General Statutes \u00a7 48-13,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which permits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>condemning authorities, after filing a notice of condemnation and obtaining judicial approval, \u201cto enter upon and into\u201d the subject property \u201cfor the purpose of inspection, survey, borings and other tests.\u201d The town asserts in response that the trial court properly construed \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (A) (iii), because, notwithstanding the statute\u2019s failure to include the word \u201ccontemplated,\u201d the defendants\u2019 construction of the statute frustrates the responsible planning of public improvements, which is a matter distinct from the condemnation process. We agree with the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The defendants\u2019 claim raises an issue of statutory construction over which our review is plenary. <em>Manifold </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>272 Conn. 410, 419, 862 A.2d 292 (2004). \u201cIt is well settled that in construing statutes, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id.; and that \u201c[t]he meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">We begin with the text of the statute. Section 7-148 (c) sets forth the scope of the powers granted to municipalities,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which include, inter alia, the power to \u201c <em>[e]nter into or upon any land for the purpose of making neces</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number><em>sary surveys or mapping in connection with any public improvement, </em>and take by eminent domain any lands, rights, easements, privileges, franchises or structures which are necessary for the purpose of establishing, constructing or maintaining any public work, or for any municipal purpose, in the manner prescribed by the general statutes . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (A) (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">We conclude that the phrase \u201cpublic improvement,\u201d as used in \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (A) (iii), is not limited to projects that either already exist or have been approved and funded by the municipality. Accordingly, \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (A) (iii) includes within its ambit studies such as that undertaken in the present case, which are intended to determine the feasibility of a particular project. This conclusion is dictated by the broad language of \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (A) (iii), read both by itself, and in conjunction with the rest of the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">We first note that town officials are authorized to \u201c[e]nter into or upon <em>any </em>land\u201d to perform surveys \u201cin connection with <em>any </em>public improvement . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (A) (iii). This repeated use of the word \u201cany\u201d indicates the legislature\u2019s intention to give municipal officials a broad power of entry. See <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>270 Conn. 665, 707, 855 A.2d 212 (2004) (\u201c[t]he repeated use in [General Statutes] \u00a7 46a-58 [a] of the word \u2018any\u2019\u2014\u2018any person,\u2019 \u2018any other person,\u2019 and \u2018any rights, privileges or immunities, secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of this state or of the United States\u2019\u2014indicates an intention to protect a broad and inclusive range of persons from broadly specified forms of discrimination by a broad and inclusive range of actors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">This conclusion is reinforced when \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (A) (iii) is viewed in the context of related subparagraphs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>that statute that empower the municipality, inter alia, to: (1) \u201c[cjreate, provide for, construct, regulate and maintain all things in the nature of public works and improvements\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (A) (ii); (2) \u201c[l]ay out, construct, reconstruct, repair, maintain, operate, alter, extend and discontinue sewer and drainage systems and sewage disposal plants\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (B) (i); and (3) \u201c[l]ay out, construct, reconstruct, alter, maintain, repair, control, operate, and assign numbers to streets, alleys, highways, boulevards, bridges, underpasses, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, public walks and parkways . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (C) (i). A construction of \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (A) (iii) permitting feasibility studies aids, rather than hinders, municipalities in their exercise of these powers, especially those regarding the creation and laying out of public works and improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Moreover, \u201cthis [court] presum[es] that the legislature intends to create statutes with reasonable and rational results . . . [and] will not inteipret statutes in such a way that would lead to a \u2018bizarre or absurd result.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>First Union National Bank </em>v. <em>Hi Ho Mall Shopping Ventures, Inc., </em>273 Conn. 287, 294, 869 A.2d 1193 (2005). The construction of \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (A) (iii) proffered by the defendants would hamstring municipalities considering whether to undertake public works projects by forcing the towns to undertake costly, and frequently adversary, proceedings to condemn a property that the study ultimately might show is unnecessary or unsuitable for the project at issue. Under the defendants\u2019 construction of the statute, a municipality unwilling to condemn properties merely for the purpose of undertaking feasibility studies would be left in the position of having to gamble on the feasibility of the proposed project.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We presume that the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>ture did not intend such an irrational result. See id., 294 (rejecting construction of General Statutes \u00a7 49-31 that would \u201cpermit foreclosure of hens against state owned properties\u201d because that construction would result in \u201cthe state\u2019s loss of title and possession of state owned properties that are critical to the administration of state government, such as, for example, correctional facilities, courthouses and state owned hospitals\u201d). Accordingly, inasmuch as our reading of the plain language of \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (A) (iii), both by itself and with respect to \u201cits relationship to other statutes\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z; leads to a result that is not irrational or absurd, we must reject the defendants\u2019 construction of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">We also disagree with the defendants\u2019 contention that this construction would render superfluous \u00a7 48-13, which permits condemning authorities, with judicial authorization after the filing of a notice of condemnation, \u201cto enter upon and into land and buildings sought or proposed for public uses for the purpose of inspection, survey, borings and other tests.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See footnote 7 of this opinion. Adopting this construction of \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (A) (iii), which would require towns to resort first to condemnation proceedings, would foster the incongruous result of encouraging municipalities to use the eminent domain power without requiring those towns to demonstrate that the takings truly are neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>sary. See <em>Kelo </em>v. <em>New London, </em>268 Conn. 1, 87-89, 843 A.2d 500 (2004) (municipality\u2019s determination that land taken by eminent domain is \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for project is subject to judicial review for bad faith or abuse of power), aff'd, 545 U.S. 469, 125 S. Ct. 2655, 162 L. Ed. 2d 439 (2005). Moreover, \u00a7 48-13 provides explicitly that the power of entry under that section \u201cshall not limit or modify rights of entry upon private property otherwise provided for by law.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly construed \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (A) (iii) as authorizing the town\u2019s entry upon the defendants\u2019 land for purposes of the feasibility study.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">We next turn to the defendants\u2019 claim that the town failed to plead and to prove sufficiently irreparable harm. Specifically, the defendants contend that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the town proved the requisite irreparable harm was based on assumptions and speculation about the impact of their refusal to permit entry on the ultimate success of the industrial park expansion, and that the town did not prove that their actions had deprived it of any future financial benefit. In response, the town, citing Thompson\u2019s testimony, argues that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by ordering the injunction because the defendants\u2019 actions have prevented the town from accurately completing the feasibility study and exercising its statutory right pursuant to \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (A) (iii). We agree with the town.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">\u201cWe begin with the governing principles for our standard of review as it pertains to a trial court\u2019s discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>to grant or deny a request for an injunction: A party seeking injunctive relief has the burden of alleging and proving irreparable harm and lack of an adequate remedy at law. ... A prayer for injunctive relief is addressed to the sound discretion of the court and the court\u2019s ruling can be reviewed only for the puipose of determining whether the decision was based on an erroneous statement of law or an abuse of discretion. . . . Therefore, unless the trial court has abused its discretion, or failed to exercise its discretion . . . the trial court\u2019s decision must stand. . . . The extraordinary nature of injunctive relief requires that the harm complained of is occurring or will occur if the injunction is not granted. Although an absolute certainty is not required, it must appear that there is a substantial probability that but for the issuance of the injunction, the party seeking it will suffer irreparable harm. . . . We note also that, [i]n exercising its discretion, the court, in a proper case, may consider and balance the injury complained of with that which will result from interference by injunction.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tighe </em>v. Berlin, 259 Conn. 83, 87-88, 788 A.2d 40 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by issuing an injunction requiring the defendants to allow town agents access to their property. It was not improper for the trial court to credit Thompson\u2019s testimony that the feasibility project could not be completed with an acceptable level of accuracy without an assessment of the defendants\u2019 properties, and therefore, that the town would spend public moneys based on an incomplete assessment at its own peril. The trial court also properly considered the defendants\u2019 interference with the town\u2019s exercise of its statutory right of entry, which is a harm that could be remedied only by a grant of access to the subject properties. Moreover, the conditions attached to the injunction, and specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>cally, the requirement that the survey be performed after the growing season so as not to interfere with the defendants\u2019 farming activities, indicate that the trial court considered the equities involved. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting the town\u2019s application for an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">In this opinion KATZ and VERTEFEUILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 7-148 (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny municipality shall have the power to do any of the following, in addition to all powers granted to municipalities under the Constitution and general statutes . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">\u201c(6) Public works, sewers, highway.

I agree with and join the majority opinion. I write separately only to emphasize that, in my view, the issue of statutory interpretation in the present case cannot properly be resolved by looking only at the text of the statutory scheme. I disagree with the conclusion of the majority that General Statutes \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (A) (iii) is plain and unambiguous and that, therefore, our interpretive task is constrained by General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z. I therefore add these brief comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">In my view, the question of whether \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (A) (iii) requires a town to vote first, at least preliminarily, to adopt a public improvement before entering onto a citizen\u2019s property is not answered by the plain and unambiguous meaning of the statute, whether taken alone or in conjunction with other statutes. Put simply, the proffered interpretation of the defendant property owners, Walter Werbiski and Joyce Werbiski, namely, that no such entry is authorized unless and until the plaintiff, the town of Wallingford (town), votes in some fashion to adopt such an improvement, is reasonable; therefore, the statute cannot be considered plain and unambiguous in its meaning.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>First, I note that it was the defendants, not the town, that argued that the plain meaning of the statute favored their interpretation. They plausibly argued that the language of the statute does not include the planning process for potential public improvements. Similarly, the town conceded at oral argument before this court that its interpretation requires this court to read in the word \u201cpotential\u201d before \u201cpublic improvement.\u201d Thus, in effect, the town conceded that the meaning of the statute was not plainly in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Second, the defendants\u2019 interpretation of the statute is certainly reasonable. That interpretation is that, in order for the town to be able to exercise the drastic remedy of entering a citizen\u2019s land without the owner\u2019s permission\u2014in effect, to engage in conduct that would be a trespass but for the court\u2019s permission\u2014the statute should be read to require the town at least to take a preliminary vote to undertake a \u201cpublic improvement,\u201d and not merely to contemplate or envision such a public improvement. Of course, the town\u2019s vote could be conditioned upon a subsequent feasibility determination, which would be determined by the engineer\u2019s study.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Therefore, in order to resolve this case we have to go beyond the text of the statute to an appropriate extratextual source of its meaning, namely, its purpose. I would infer a broad public purpose of the statute, as the town argues, namely, to permit a rational planning process by the town, under appropriate supervision of the court, in imposing stringent limitations on the town\u2019s entry onto the land, without the town having to go through a formal vote to undertake a public improvement that might ultimately prove not to be feasible. Interpreted in light of this purpose, and for the other reasons stated by the majority, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-10\"> \u201cThe test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tamowsky </em>v. <em>Socci, </em>271 Conn. 284, 287 n.3, 856 A.2d 408 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
