On appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the plaintiff contends that the state: (1) impliedly waived its sovereign immunity when it voluntarily entered into the lease agreement; and (2) is not protected by the doctrine of sovereign immunity from the takings claim. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The record and the complaint<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> reveal the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>predecessor entered into two leases with the state on or about May 20,1998, for the administrative and industrial use of two suites by the state board of education and services for the blind (education board). Negotiations for the leases had begun in 1997, and lease proposal outlines were drafted by an assistant attorney general and signed by the plaintiff by the end of that year. These lease proposals also were signed by the commissioner of the department of public works and approved by the chairman of the state properties review board (review board) on April 6, 1998. At that time, both leases contained a provision indicating that the state would pay, as additional rent, increases in real estate property taxes for the duration of the lease agreements (tax escalation clause), using October 1, 1998, as the base date from which increases would be calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">On May 8, 1998, the plaintiff requested that the base date be amended to October 1,1997, in order to account for improvements that it had made to the property for the benefit of the education board during this period. The state offered to move the base date back even farther to October 1, 1996, which is the date that currently appears in the lease. On or about May 20, 1998, the state\u2019s representative signed the amended lease agreements. The state has, however, refused to pay the additional sums it allegedly owes under the tax escalation clauses, and has expressed an unwillingness to make such payments in the future. The education board nevertheless continues to occupy the plaintiffs premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">After failing to collect the additional rent allegedly owed by the state, the plaintiff brought the matter to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>state claims commissioner.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The claims commissioner held an adversarial hearing on June 18, 2002, and determined that the leases were subject to a comprehensive statutory program designed to monitor the purchase and lease of real property by the state. The claims commissioner concluded that the amended tax escalation clause is invalid pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4b-23 (e),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>which provides that \u201c[a]ll decisions made by the commissioner [of public works] . . . shall require review by the [review] board,\u201d because it never was submitted to the review board for approval. Accordingly, the claims commissioner denied the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>claim, as well as its request for permission to sue the state, and advised the plaintiff that its claim would be submitted to the General Assembly for a final determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The plaintiff, however, did not pursue the matter further with the General Assembly. Instead, the plaintiff brought this action against the state alleging that the state\u2019s failure to pay the moneys owed under the tax escalation clauses constituted: (1) a breach of the agreements; and (2) a taking of the plaintiffs property without just compensation. The plaintiff sought damages and a declaratory judgment stating that the tax escalation clauses are enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The trial court granted the state\u2019s subsequent motion to dismiss, primarily on the basis of sovereign immunity. The trial court concluded that: (1) the state had not waived its sovereign immunity with respect to its contract with the plaintiff; (2) the takings claims were barred because the tax escalation clauses were invalid as a matter of law; and (3) the plaintiffs claim for declaratory relief was barred because the claims commissioner had not acted unconstitutionally or in excess of his statutory authority when he found the tax escalation clauses to be invalid. The trial court further noted that the plaintiff had failed to pursue the one avenue of appeal that had been available to it, namely, review by the General Assembly. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the trial court improperly dismissed its claims for damages because: (1) the state impliedly waived its sovereign immunity by voluntarily and knowingly entering into lease agreements with the plaintiff; (2) sovereign immunity is not a defense to claims of takings without just compensation; and (3) the validity of the tax escalation clauses should not have been decided in the context of a motion to dismiss. Additionally, the plaintiff contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>that the trial court improperly dismissed its request for declaratory relief regarding the enforceability of the tax escalation clauses because requests for declaratory relief of a prospective nature fall into an exception to sovereign immunity. In response, the state claims that the trial court properly granted its motion to dismiss because: (1) there was no legislative intent impliedly to waive the state\u2019s sovereign immunity; (2) the facts pleaded do not support a claim of taking, but merely breach of contract; (3) this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear the present case pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-148 (c);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (4) the plaintiffs request for declaratory relief failed to involve the determination of a constitutional infringement. We agree with the state; accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Prefiminarily, we set forth the standard of review. \u201c[T]he doctrine of sovereign immunity implicates subject matter jurisdiction and is therefore abasis for granting a motion to dismiss. ... A determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. When . . . the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>265 Conn. 301, 313, 828 A.2d 549 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">WHETHER THE STATE IMPLIEDLY WAIVED ITS SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY BY VOLUNTARILY CONTRACTING WITH THE PLAINTIFF</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">We begin with the plaintiffs claim that the state impliedly waived its sovereign immunity for breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>contract when it voluntarily entered into the lease agreement with the plaintiff. As a matter of public policy, \u201c[a] sovereign is exempt from suit, not because of any formal conception or obsolete theory, but on the logical and practical ground that there can be no legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends. . . . We have held that a plaintiff seeking to circumvent the doctrine of sovereign immunity must show that: (1) the legislature, either expressly or by force of a necessary implication, statutorily waived the state\u2019s sovereign immunity ... or (2) in an action for declaratory or injunctive relief, the state officer or officers against whom such relief is sought acted in excess of statutoiy authority, or pursuant to an unconstitutional statute.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 313-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Accordingly, \u201cwe begin with a searching examination of the language of the [relevant] statute [or statutes] .... We [also] recognize . . . that the purpose or purposes of the legislation, and the context . . . are directly relevant to the meaning of the language of the statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 328. Moreover, \u201c[t]he meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The plaintiffs first claim sounds in breach of contract. Accordingly, we look to the language of the statutes pertaining to contracts and claims against the state. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 4-142 provides: \u201cThere shall be a Claims Commissioner who shall hear and determine all claims against the state except: (1) Claims for the periodic payment of disability, pension, retirement or other employment benefits; (2) claims upon which suit otherwise is authorized by law including suits to recover similar relief arising from the same set of facts; (3) claims for which an administrative hearing procedure otherwise is established by law; (4) requests by political subdivisions of the state for the payment of grants in lieu of taxes; and (5) claims for the refund of taxes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-158 (a),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the claims commissioner may approve immediate payment of just claims not exceeding $7500. By contrast, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-159,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the claims commissioner can only make <em>recommendations </em>to the General Assembly regarding payment for claims exceeding $7500, after a hearing. The General Assembly then may decide whether to accept or to reject any such recommenda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>tion and whether to grant the claimant permission to sue the state where it \u201cdeems it just and equitable and believes the claim to present an issue of law or fact under which the state, were it a private person, could be liable.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-159. Finally, General Statutes \u00a7 4-61 (a)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny person, firm or corporation which has entered into a contract with the state ... for the design, construction, construction management, repair or alteration of any highway, bridge, building or other public works of the state or any political subdivision of the state <em>may . . </em>. bring an action against the state to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford . . . [wherein] [a] 11 legal defenses except governmental immunity shall be reserved to the state. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) This is the <em>sole </em>Connecticut statute that expressly waives sovereign immunity for specifically enumerated contract actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The language of the relevant statutes does not provide or imply any waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to the lease agreements between the plaintiff and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>state. Section 4-142 requires that the claims commissioner determine claims against the state, and enumerates specific categories of claims that are exempt from the claims process. The only applicable exemption under that statute would be \u00a7 4-142 (2), which applies to \u201cclaims upon which suit otherwise is authorized by law including suits to recover similar relief arising from the same set of facts . . . .\u201d Our review of the statutory scheme reveals that the only statute providing for a waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to contracts is \u00a7 4-61, which expressly waives immunity from suit with respect to specifically enumerated public works contracts. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-61 (a) (waiving immunity with respect to contracts \u201cfor the design, construction, construction management, repair or alteration of any highway, bridge, building or other public works of the state or any political subdivision of the state,\u201d and stating that \u201c[a]ll legal defenses except governmental immunity shall be reserved to the state\u201d); see also footnote 9 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">It is well settled that statutory waivers of sovereign immunity are to be strictly construed. See, e.g., <em>First Union National Bank </em>v. <em>Hi Ho Mall Shopping Ventures, Inc., </em>273 Conn. 287, 293-94, 869 A.2d 1193 (2005) (\u201c[t]he scope of any statutory waiver \u2018must be confined strictly to the extent the statute provides\u2019 \u201d). Accordingly, we cannot construe \u00a7 4-61 beyond its express public works exceptions because to do so would render them superfluous, as well as violate the maxim that the legislature\u2019s inclusion solely of public works contracts necessarily implies the exclusion of other contracts, including the plaintiffs lease with the state. See, e.g., <em>Hatt </em>v. <em>Burlington Coat Factory, </em>263 Conn. 279, 295, 819 A.2d 260 (2003) (discussing \u201c \u2018expressio unius est exclusio alter\u00e1is\u2019 \u201d). Thus, in the absence of a statutory waiver of sovereign immunity, the plaintiff may not bring suit against the state for claims arising out of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>lease without authorization from the claims commissioner to do so. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-160 (a) (\u201c[w]hen the Claims Commissioner deems it just and equitable, he may authorize suit against the state on any claim which, in his opinion, presents an issue of law or fact under which the state, were it a private person, could be liable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The plaintiff further contends that, notwithstanding the statutory scheme, public policy supports a waiver of sovereign immunity for contract claims because such immunity undermines basic principles of contract law by fostering illusory contracts. In support of its policy argument, the plaintiff identifies states that, as a matter of common law, have recognized a waiver of sovereign immunity for state contract actions. We disagree with the plaintiff because this court previously has considered and rejected the notion that contracts with the state are illusory for lack of a judicial forum in which to enforce rights. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Lex Associates, </em>248 Conn. 612, 619, 730 A.2d 38 (1999), this court concluded that \u201cthe alleged inadequacy of one . . . remedy neither deprives a contract of mutuality of obligation nor establishes inadequacy of consideration.\u201d Furthermore, our legislature has created an alternative mechanism for reviewing breach of contract claims so as to ensure due process and \u201cwe know of [no authority] standing for the proposition that recourse to the claims commissioner is an inadequate remedy as a matter of law.\u201d Id. As undesirable as the plaintiff may find this statutory scheme, it nevertheless is the expression of a policy decision committed to the legislature. Thus, \u201c[w]e must resist the temptation which this case affords to enhance our own constitutional authority by trespassing upon an area clearly reserved as the prerogative of a coordinate branch of government.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nielsen </em>v. <em>State, </em>236 Conn. 1, 10, 670 A.2d 1288 (1996). Accordingly, in light of Connecticut\u2019s express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>statutory scheme, we conclude that the trial court properly granted the state\u2019s motion to dismiss with regard to the plaintiffs contract claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">We do, however, recognize, as the plaintiff points out, that other states have taken varied approaches to this issue. Some states have waived sovereign immunity for contract claims by: (1) judicial decision; see, e.g., <em>Grant Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>92 Idaho 408, 413, 443 P.2d 1005 (1968) (\u201cwhere . . . the state has entered into a contract pursuant to legislative authorization, the state has consented to be sued for alleged breaches of its contractual responsibilities and cannot invoke the protection of sovereign immunity\u201d); <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (2) statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>enactment; see, e.g., Ind. Code Ann. \u00a7 34-13-1-1 (a) (Michie 2004) (\u201c[a]ny person having a claim against the state arising out of an express or implied contract may bring suit within ten [10] years after accrual of the claim\u201d);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and (3) state constitutional provision. See, e.g., La. Const., art. XII, \u00a7 10 (A) (\u201c[n]either the state, a state agency, nor apolitical subdivision shall be immune from suit and liability in contract or for injury to person or property\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On the other hand, there are several states that very strictly abide by sovereign immunity and refuse to recognize <em>any </em>waiver, even for contract claims. See Ark. Const., art. V, \u00a7 20 (\u201c[t]he State of Arkansas shall never be made defendant in any of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>courts\u201d);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> see also <em>Drake </em>v. Smith, 390 A.2d 541, 543 n.3 (Me. 1978) (\u201cthe sovereign immunity of the [sjtate of Maine extends to actions which purport to assert a liability against the [s]tate other than liability in tort\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Finally, there is a large subset of states that, like Connecticut, recognizes various forms and degrees of limited waiver of sovereign immunity for contract actions, both by statute; see, e.g., N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 37-1-23 (Michie 2005) (\u201c[governmental entities are granted immunity from actions based on contract, except actions based on a valid written contract\u201d);<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>cial decision. See <em>State Board of Public Affairs </em>v. <em>Principal Funding Corp., </em>542 P.2d 503, 506 (Okla. 1975) (\u201c[w]e hold that where a person or entity enters into a valid contract with the proper [s]tate officials and a valid appropriation has been made therefor, the [sjtate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>has consented to being sued and waived its governmental immunity to the extent of its contractual obligations and such contractual obligations may be enforced against the [s]tate in an ordinary action at law\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The merits of the various sister state approaches notwithstanding, we are bound by the current scheme. Accordingly, we will not disturb a policy decision committed solely to the discretion of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">WHETHER THE DOCTRINE OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY BARS THE PLAINTIFFS TAKINGS CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">We next turn to the plaintiffs contention that the trial court improperly granted the state\u2019s motion to dismiss because sovereign immunity does not bar its claim that the state\u2019s failure to pay the full amount of rent allegedly due under the lease is an unconstitutional taking of the plaintiffs property for public use without just compensation. The plaintiffs takings claim is similarly unavailing because the state\u2019s failure to pay the full amount of rent allegedly due is not, as a matter of law, a taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>The plaintiff correctly notes that \u201c[t]he doctrine of sovereign immunity is not available to the state as a defense to claims for just compensation arising under article first, \u00a7 11, of the Connecticut constitution. . . . When possession has been taken from the owner, he is constitutionally entitled to any damages which he may have suffered . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tamm </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>222 Conn. 280, 283, 610 A.2d 590 (1992). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss on the ground of sovereign immunity, [however] a complaint \u2018must allege sufficient facts to support a finding of a taking of land in a constitutional sense.\u2019 \u201d Id., 284. We conclude that the plaintiff has failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">It is axiomatic that government action cannot constitute a taking when the aggrieved party does not have a property right in the affected property. \u201cWhether one\u2019s interest or entitlement rises to the level of a protected property right depends upon the extent to which one has been made secure by [s]tate or [federal law in its enjoyment.\u201d <em>Wilmarth </em>v. <em>Georgetown, </em>28 Mass. App. 697, 701, 555 N.E.2d 597 (1990). In the present case, the trial court properly concluded that the tax escalation clause was an invalid lease term because it had not been approved by the review board pursuant to \u00a7 4b-23 (e). See footnote 5 of this opinion. The facts in the complaint, even when construed broadly in a manner most favorable to the plaintiff, simply fail to support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>finding that the tax escalation clause was valid as a matter of law.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The complaint mentions nothing about review board approval, which is a necessary component of a valid contract at law pursuant to \u00a7 4b-23 (e). See footnote 5 of this opinion. The plaintiff, therefore, does not have an enforceable property interest in the income that would be generated by the tax escalation clause.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Accordingly, the claim was properly dismissed by the trial court.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-8\"> Article first, \u00a7 11, of the constitution of Connecticut provides: \u201cThe property of no person shall be taken for public use, without just compensation therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">The fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\u201d The fifth amendment\u2019s public use clause has been made applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.
