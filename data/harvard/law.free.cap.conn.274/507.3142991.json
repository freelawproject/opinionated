Lebr\u00f3n, appeals following our grant of certification<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>judgment of the Appellate Court affirming the judgment of the habeas court dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The petitioner claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the habeas court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his habeas petition because the petitioner was not in \u201ccustody\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 52-466<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> at the time his habeas petition was filed. See <em>Lebron </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>82 Conn. App. 475, 479, 844 A.2d 946 (2004). We disagree and affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following facts and procedural history. \u201cOn September 18, 1992, the petitioner was convicted of assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 and sentenced to a term of six months incarceration to be served consecutively to a sentence he already was serving for an unrelated assault.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After serving his sentence, the petitioner was released from custody on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>April 15, 1996. On May 12, 1997, the petitioner was arrested and charged with murder in connection with a May 11, 1997 shooting. On August 12, 1999, the petitioner pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55a and was sentenced to a term of thirty years incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">\u201cThe petitioner filed an amended writ of habeas corpus on October 7, 2002, challenging the 1992 conviction and setting forth claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and actual innocence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The petition alleged that the 1992 conviction enhanced his current sentence for the 1999 conviction and enhanced his inmate security classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">\u201cOn August 7, 2002, the respondent, the commissioner of correction (commissioner), filed a motion to dismiss the petition, claiming that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the petitioner could not demonstrate that he was \u2018in custody\u2019 for the 1992 conviction under attack at the time the habeas petition was filed. In his memorandum in opposition, the petitioner countered that the sentence enhancements to which he was subjected constituted collateral consequences sufficient to render him \u2018in custody\u2019 for purposes of a habeas attack on the 1992 conviction.\u201d Id., 476-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">During a hearing on the commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss, the habeas court asked the petitioner to clarify which conviction his habeas petition challenged. The petitioner informed the habeas court that his petition challenged the 1992 conviction because that conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>allegedly was used to enhance his sentence and security classification for his 1999 conviction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The habeas court \u201cconcluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the petition and granted the commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court reasoned that . . . the petitioner no longer was \u2018in custody\u2019 under the 1992 conviction because the sentence imposed for that conviction had been served fully by the time the habeas petition was filed.\u201d Id., 477-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>The petitioner claims on appeal that the habeas court failed to construe liberally his petition as a challenge to his 1999 conviction, as enhanced by his 1992 conviction and, therefore, improperly dismissed his petition. Alternatively, if this court agrees with the habeas court that the petition directly attacks the petitioner\u2019s expired 1992 conviction, the petitioner claims on appeal that: (1) the custody requirement in \u00a7 52-466 is not jurisdictional; (2) even if the custody requirement is jurisdictional, the collateral consequences of the petitioner\u2019s 1992 conviction are sufficient to render him in custody within the meaning of \u00a7 52-466; and (3) the habeas court improperly dismissed the petition in violation of the petitioner\u2019s federal and state rights to due process of law and in violation of the prohibition against the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in the Connecticut constitution. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">\u201cAs a preliminary matter, we set forth the applicable standard of review. The standard of review of a motion to dismiss is . . . well established. In ruling upon whether a complaint survives a motion to dismiss, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader. ... A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction. . . . [B]ecause [a] determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Neiman </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>270 Conn. 244, 250-51, 851 A.2d 1165 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Before addressing the substance of the petitioner\u2019s claims, we review the United States Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence concerning challenges to expired convictions pursuant to the federal habeas statutes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>In Maleng </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>v. <em>Cook, </em>490 U.S. 488, 489, 109 S. Ct. 1923, 104 L. Ed. 2d 540 (1989) (per curiam), the petitioner<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was convicted of robbery in Washington state court in 1958 and sentenced to twenty years of imprisonment. In 1976, while on parole from his 1958 conviction, the petitioner was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>convicted of various state charges and, in 1978, he was sentenced to two life terms and one ten year term of incarceration. Id. Under Washington law, the 1958 conviction increased by several years the mandatory minimum term that the petitioner had to serve on his 1978 sentences. Id. In 1976, the petitioner was also convicted of bank robbery and conspiracy in federal court and sentenced to thirty years imprisonment. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">In 1985, while in federal prison, the petitioner filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas coipus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. Id. The petition listed the 1958 Washington conviction as the \u201cconviction under attack.\u201d Id., 490. In addition to substantive challenges to the 1958 conviction, the petition also alleged that the 1958 conviction had enhanced illegally the length of the 1978 state sentences, which the petitioner had not yet begun to serve.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id. The question before the United States Supreme Court was whether the petitioner was \u201cin custody\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (c) (3). Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The court observed that \u201c[t]he federal habeas statute gives the United States district courts jurisdiction to entertain petitions for habeas relief only from persons who are <em>in custody </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The court noted that in <em>Carafas </em>v. <em>LaVallee, </em>391 U.S. 234, 238, 88 S. Ct. 1556, 20 L. Ed. 2d 554 (1968), it had \u201cinterpreted the statutory language as requiring that the habeas petitioner be \u2018in custody\u2019 under the conviction or sentence under attack <em>at the time his petition is filed.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Maleng </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>supra, 490 U.S. 490-91. The court had \u201cnever held, however, that a habeas petitioner may be \u2018in custody\u2019 under a conviction when the sentence imposed for that conviction <em>has fully expired </em>at the time his petition is filed.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The court concluded that the collateral consequences suffered by the petitioner, specifically, the enhancement of his subsequent sentence, were insufficient to render him \u201cin custody\u201d on his 1958 conviction. Id., 492. It reasoned that \u201c [w]hile [it had] very liberally construed the \u2018in custody\u2019 requirement for purposes of federal habeas, [it had] never extended it to the situation where a habeas petitioner suffers no present restraint from a conviction. Since almost all [s]tates have habitual offender statutes ... a contrary ruling would mean that a petitioner whose sentence has completely expired could nonetheless challenge the conviction for which it was imposed at any time on federal habeas. This would read the \u2018in custody\u2019 requirement out of the statute and be contrary to the clear implication of the opinion in <em>Carafas </em>v. <em>LaVallee, </em>supra [391 U.S. 294].\u201d <em>Maleng </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>supra, 490 U.S. 492.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court concluded that \u201conce the sentence imposed for a conviction has completely expired, the collateral consequences of that conviction are not themselves sufficient to render an individual \u2018in custody\u2019 for the purposes of a habeas attack upon it.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The court went on to conclude, however, that the petitioner was \u201cin custody\u201d on the 1978 state sentences that he had not yet begun to serve when he filed his habeas petition. Id., 493, citing <em>Peyton </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>391 U.S. 54, 67, 88 S. Ct. 1549, 20 L. Ed. 2d 426 (1968) (petitioner serving two consecutive sentences was \u201cin custody\u201d on second sentence he had not yet begun to serve), and <em>Braden </em>v. <em>30th Judicial Circuit Court of Kentucky, </em>410 U.S. 484, 488, 93 S. Ct. 1123, 35 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1973) (petitioner serving sentence in Alabama, who was subject to detainer filed by Kentucky officials, was \u201cin custody\u201d on outstanding Kentucky charge). Because the \u201chabeas petition, construed with the deference to which pro se litigants are entitled . . . can be read as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>asserting a challenge to the 1978 sentences, as enhanced by the allegedly invalid prior conviction\u201d; (citation omitted) <em>Maleng </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>supra, 490 U.S. 493; the court concluded that the defendant had \u201csatisfied the \u2018in custody\u2019 requirement for federal habeas jurisdiction.\u201d Id., 494. The court clarified that its holding was \u201climited to the narrow issue of \u2018custody\u2019 for subject-matter jurisdiction of the habeas court\u201d and expressed \u201cno view on the extent to which the 1958 conviction itself may be subject to challenge in the attack upon the 1978 sentences which it was used to enhance.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">In <em>Lackawanna County District Attorney </em>v. <em>Coss, </em>532 U.S. 394, 399, 121 S. Ct. 1567, 149 L. Ed. 2d 608 (2001), the petitioner filed a habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254; see footnote 6 of this opinion; alleging ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with three expired 1986 state convictions allegedly used to enhance the sentence on a subsequent state conviction. The District Court had determined that the petitioner \u201cwas arguing that his current sentence . . . was adversely affected by the 1986 convictions because the sentencing judge considered these allegedly unconstitutional convictions in computing [the petitioner\u2019s] present sentence\u201d and, therefore, that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the petition. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 400. <em>InLackawanna County District Attorney, </em>a majority of the United States Supreme Court agreed with this determination, concluding that \u201c[l]ike the [petitioner] in <em>Maleng, </em>[the petitioner\u2019s] . . . petition can be (and has been) construed as asserting a challenge to the [current] sentence], as enhanced by the allegedly invalid prior [1986] conviction[s].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 401-402.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The court then considered \u201cthe question . . . left unanswered in <em>Maleng: </em>the extent to which the [prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>expired] conviction itself may be subject to challenge in the attack upon the [current] senten[ce] which it was used to enhance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 402. A majority of the court concluded that \u201cconsiderations relating to the need for finality of convictions and ease <em>of </em>administration\u201d; id.; generally preclude a habeas petitioner from collaterally attacking expired convictions. Accordingly, the majority held that \u201conce a state conviction is no longer open to direct or collateral attack in its own right because the defendant failed to pursue those remedies while they were available (or because the defendant did so unsuccessfully), the conviction may be regarded as conclusively valid. ... If that conviction is later used to enhance a criminal sentence, the [petitioner] generally may not challenge the enhanced sentence through a petition under \u00a7 2254 on the ground that the prior conviction was unconstitutionally obtained.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 403-404.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The majority carved out one exception to this general rule\u2014it concluded that a habeas petitioner could challenge an expired conviction if the petitioner attacked his \u201cenhanced sentence on the basis that the prior conviction used to enhance the sentence was obtained where there was a failure to appoint counsel in violation of the [s]ixth [a]mendment, as set forth in <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>[372 U.S. 335, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1963)].\u201d <em>Lackawanna County District Attorney </em>v. <em>Coss, </em>supra, 532 U.S. 404. The majority determined that such an exception was appropriate because \u201c[t]he special status of <em>Gideon </em>claims in this context is well established in our case law.\u201d Id. A plurality of the court determined that \u201canother exception to the general rule precluding habeas relief <em>might </em>be available,\u201d although the circumstances of the case did not require the plurality to resolve the issue. (Emphasis added.) Id., 405. The plurality noted that \u201c[i]t is not always the case . . . that a defendant can be faulted for failing to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>timely review of a constitutional claim. For example, a state court may, without justification, refuse to rule on a constitutional claim that has been properly presented to it. . . . Alternatively, after the time for direct or collateral review has expired, a defendant may obtain compelling evidence that he is actually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted, and which he could not have uncovered in a timely manner.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id. The plurality cautioned, however, that \u201c[whatever such a petitioner must show to be eligible for review, the challenged prior conviction must have adversely affected the sentence that is the subject of the habeas petition.\u201d Id., 406. Because the plurality determined that the petitioner\u2019s subsequent sentence had not been enhanced by his 1986 convictions, it concluded that his petition could not be reviewed under the federal habeas statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id., 406-408.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The petitioner in the present matter first claims that the habeas court failed to construe his petition as an attack on his 1999 conviction as enhanced by his 1992 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>conviction and, therefore, improperly dismissed his petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to <em>Maleng </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>supra, 490 U.S. 488, and <em>Lackawanna County District Attorney </em>v. <em>Coss, </em>supra, 532 U.S. 394. Further, because the habeas petition includes an allegation of actual innocence, the petitioner claims that pursuant to <em>Lackawanna County District Attorney, </em>the illegality of his 1992 conviction can be challenged within his attack on his 1999 conviction. We conclude that the habeas court properly construed the petition and, therefore, we do not reach the petitioner\u2019s argument that a claim of actual innocence constitutes an exception to the conclusive validity of state convictions under <em>Lackawanna County District Attorney.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">It is well settled that \u201c[t]he petition for a writ of habeas corpus is essentially a pleading and, as such, it should conform generally to a complaint in a civil action. . . . The principle that a plaintiff may rely only upon what he has alleged is basic. ... It is fundamental in our law that the right of a plaintiff to recover is limited to the allegations of his complaint. . . . While the habeas court has considerable discretion to frame a remedy that is commensurate with the scope of the established constitutional violations ... it does not have the discretion to look beyond the pleadings and trial evidence to decide claims not raised. . . . The purpose of the [petition] is to put the [respondent] on notice of the claims made, to limit the issues to be decided, and to prevent surprise.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>52 Conn. App. 385, 406, 726 A.2d 657, cert. denied, 249 Conn. 920, 733 A.2d 233 (1999). Moreover, \u201c[t]he modem trend, which is followed in Connecticut, is to construe pleadings broadly and realistically, rather than narrowly and technically. . . . [T]he [petition] must be read in its entirety in such a way as to give effect to the pleading with reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>the general theory upon which it proceeded, and do substantial justice between the parties. . . . Our reading of pleadings in a manner that advances substantial justice means that a pleading must be construed reasonably, to contain all that it fairly means, but carries with it the related proposition that it must not be contorted in such a way so as to strain the bounds of rational comprehension.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Broadnax </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>270 Conn. 133, 173-74, 851 A.2d 1113 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The petition in the present matter was prepared with the assistance of counsel and it is undisputed that the petitioner\u2019s 1992 conviction had expired by the time it was filed. Although the petition asserts that the petitioner is \u201cnow being held and confined by\u201d the commissioner, it alleges that the current confinement is illegal because the petitioner received ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with his expired 1992 conviction and was actually innocent of that crime. The petition further alleges that the 1992 conviction illegally enhanced his sentence and security classification for the 1999 conviction. In response to the habeas court\u2019s inquiry regarding the conviction under attack, the petitioner repeatedly assured the habeas court that the petition directly challenged the petitioner\u2019s 1992 conviction. See footnote 5 of this opinion. When the habeas court informed the petitioner that it thought the petition attacked the wrong conviction, the petitioner responded: \u201cMaybe, maybe. Maybe so, Your Honor. I really\u2014I\u2019ve not addressed that in any of my research. Perhaps [the petitioner\u2019s] remedy is in the [1999] manslaughter conviction.\u201d The legal theory the petitioner presented to the habeas court was that the collateral consequences suffered by the petitioner because of his allegedly illegal 1992 conviction were sufficient to render him in \u201ccustody\u201d on that conviction within the meaning of \u00a7 52-466 and to bring the petition within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>subject matter jurisdiction of the court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, interpreting the pleadings consistent with the general theory advanced by the petitioner, we conclude that the habeas court properly construed the petition as an attack on the petitioner\u2019s 1992 conviction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Janusauskas </em>v. Fichman, 264 Conn. 796, 807, 826 A.2d 1066 (2003) (\u201c [o]ur law is well settled that a party may not try its case on one theory and appeal on another\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The petitioner next claims that even if the habeas court properly determined that his petition attacks his 1992 conviction, the habeas court improperly dismissed his petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Specifically, the petitioner argues that: (1) the custody requirement in \u00a7 52-466 refers to venue and is not jurisdictional; (2) even if the custody requirement is jurisdictional, the collateral consequences of his expired conviction were sufficient to render the petitioner in \u201ccustody\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-466; and (3) the habeas court\u2019s failure to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over the petition violated the petitioner\u2019s rights to due process of law under the state and federal consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>tutions and suspends the writ of habeas corpus in violation of the Connecticut constitution. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">We first address the petitioner\u2019s claim that the habeas court improperly dismissed his petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the custody requirement in \u00a7 52-466 is not jurisdictional. Specifically, the petitioner argues that \u00a7 52-466 \u201cprovides only for venue\u201d and that it does not \u201climit the common-law authority of judges to entertain writs of habeas corpus.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u201cWhile jurisdiction is the power and authority of the court to act, venue is the place where the power to adjudicate is to be exercised, that is, the place where the suit may or should be heard. The requirements of jurisdiction are grounded in the state\u2019s inherent judicial power, while the requirements of venue are grounded in convenience to litigants. Venue does not involve a jurisdictional question but rather a procedural one, and thus is a matter that goes to process rather than substantive rights. Moreover, although a court\u2019s lack of subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be waived, improper venue may be waived and may be changed by the consent of the parties.\u201d 77 Am. Jur. 2d 608, Venue \u00a7 1 (1997); see also <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Aronson, </em>214 Conn. 256, 263, 571 A.2d 696 (1990) (\u201c[sjtatutory venue requirements simply [confer] a privilege not to be required to attend court at a particular location\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">In determining whether the custody requirement in \u00a7 52-466 pertains to subj ect matter jurisdiction or venue, we look first to the language of the statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>52-466 (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus shall be made to the superior court or to a judge thereof for the judicial district in which the person whose <em>custody </em>is in question is claimed to be illegally confined or deprived of his liberty . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because the language of the statute is unclear as to whether the custody requirement is a prerequisite for \u201cthe [court\u2019s] power or authority to adjudicate\u201d habeas petitions or instead, merely \u201crefers to the place where that authority should be exercised\u201d; R. Casad &amp; W. Richman, Jurisdiction in Civil Actions (3d Ed. 1998) \u00a7 1-3, p. 14; we look to the history and purpose of the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\u201cWe [begin by taking] note of the basic purpose underlying what is one of the most extraordinary and unique legal remedies in the procedural armory of our law. . . . Although it is true that the United States Supreme Court has not always followed an unwavering line in its conclusions as to the availability of [t]he [writ of habeas corpus] . . . from the time the writ originated in seventeenth century England, its central purpose has been to test the legality of detention. English legislation and common law have been recognized by the United States Supreme Court as authoritative guides in applying the writ in the federal courts. <em>McNally </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>293 U.S. 131, 136-37, 55 S. Ct. 24, 79 L. Ed. 238 (1934), overruled on other grounds, <em>Peyton </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>[supra, 391 U.S. 54].</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">\u201cIn applying federal habeas statutes, the United States Supreme Court has said that [t]he purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>the proceeding defined by the statute was to inquire into the legality of the detention .... There is no warrant in either the statute or the writ for its use to invoke judicial determination of questions which could not affect the lawfulness of the custody and detention, and no suggestion of such a use has been found in the commentaries on the English common law. <em>McNally </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>[supra, 293 U.S. 136-37]; see also <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 136, [102 S.

Habeas corpus provides a special and extraordinary legal remedy for illegal detention. . . . The deprivation of legal rights is essential before the writ may be issued. . . . Questions which do not concern the lawfulness of the detention cannot properly be reviewed on habeas corpus. . . . When a habeas petition is properly before a court, the remedies it may award depend on the constitutional rights being vindicated. . . . Further, any remedy must be commensurate with the scope of the constitutional violations that have been established.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 815; see also <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>156 Conn. 630, 631, 239 A.2d 477 (1968) (custody is prerequisite to court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction); <em>Abed </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>43 Conn.

Swift, A System of the Laws of the State of Connecticut (1795) p. 99 (\u201cThe writ of habeas corpus, is a valuable privilege of the citizen, and is demandable of common right, for any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>person imprisoned under [color] of authority, or without it, except the imprisonment be on execution, or on conviction of some crime. The superior court grant this writ, which must be directed to the person who has the custody of the complainant, with a command to bring him before the court, with the cause of his detention. . . . When the person is brought forward before the court, with a return of the cause of his detention, the court will examine the matter, and if the detention be illegal, they may discharge him, or otherwise remand to prison.\u201d). We conclude that the history and purpose of the writ of habeas corpus establish that the habeas court lacks the power to act on a habeas petition absent the petitioner\u2019s allegedly unlawful custody. Accordingly, we conclude that the custody requirement in \u00a7 52-466 is jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The petitioner next claims that even if the custody requirement in \u00a7 52-466 is jurisdictional, the habeas court improperly determined that the collateral consequences of his expired 1992 conviction are insufficient to render him in \u201ccustody\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-466 and, thus, improperly dismissed his petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The petitioner first relies on federal law to support his claim. In <em>Maleng </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>supra, 490 U.S. 492, the United States Supreme Court expressly considered and rejected the petitioner\u2019s argument in the context of the federal habeas statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Specifically, the court concluded that \u201conce the sentence imposed for a conviction has completely expired, the collateral consequences of that conviction are not themselves sufficient to render an individual \u2018in custody\u2019 for the purposes of a habeas attack upon it.\u201d <em>Maleng </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>supra, 492. Accordingly, the court determined that the petitioner\u2019s claim that his subsequent sentence had</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>been enhanced by his prior expired conviction could be pursued only in a habeas attack on his current enhanced sentence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Id., 492-93. <em>In Lackawanna County District Attorney </em>v. <em>Coss, </em>supra, 532 U.S. 402, the court did not change this conclusion, but merely went beyond the jurisdictional question presented in <em>Maleng </em>to consider \u201cthe extent to which <em>the [prior expired] conviction itself may </em>be subject to challenge <em>in the attack upon the [current] senten[cej </em>which it was used to enhance.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>(Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Because the habeas petition in the present matter does not attack the petitioner\u2019s current, allegedly enhanced sentence, but instead attacks the petitioner\u2019s expired conviction directly; see part I of this opinion; <em>Lackawanna County District Attorney </em>has no bearing on the petitioner\u2019s claim. Accordingly, we conclude that the petitioner\u2019s reliance on federal law is misplaced.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The petitioner also relies on Connecticut law to support his claim. Specifically, the petitioner argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>the \u201ccollateral consequences [of a criminal conviction] are multiplying rapidly\u201d and that \u201cConnecticut common-law jurisprudence of habeas corpus has always included an analysis of collateral consequences in determining whether a court has jurisdiction over a habeas corpus petition.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We disagree. Connecticut courts, like the federal courts, have analyzed whether the collateral consequences of a conviction give the court <em>continuing </em>jurisdiction over a habeas petition that was filed when the petitioner was in custody on the conviction under attack, and thus properly invoked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>the jurisdiction of the court, or whether the subsequent expiration of the petitioner\u2019s conviction rendered the petition moot. See, e.g., <em>Herbert </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>199 Conn. 143,143-44 n.l, 506 A.2d 98 (1986) (habeas petition not moot despite petitioner\u2019s discharge from parole during pendency of appeal); <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>13 Conn. App. 708, 710-11, 539 A.2d 592 (1988) (same). <em>Herbert </em>and <em>Haynes </em>relied on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Carafas </em>v. <em>LaVallee, </em>supra, 391 U.S. 234, to conclude that the expiration of the criminal conviction did not render the petitioner\u2019s habeas claim moot because collateral consequences continued to flow from the petitioner\u2019s criminal conviction. See <em>Herbert </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 143-44 n. 1; <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>supra, 710-11; see also footnote 16 of this opinion. Like the federal courts, however, our courts have never held that the collateral consequences of a conviction that expired <em>before the habeas petition was filed </em>are sufficient to render a petitioner in \u201ccustody\u201d on the expired conviction within the meaning of \u00a7 52-466 and, thus, to invoke the subject matter jurisdiction of the court as an initial matter. Cf. L. Yackle, Postconviction Remedies (1981) \u00a7 49, pp. 215, 219 (noting that \u201crestrictions upon liberty sufficient to satisfy the \u2018custody\u2019 requirement in [federal] habeas corpus are substantially more severe than the burdens that will prevent questions from becoming moot\u201d and that \u201ccollateral effects standing alone are not enough to <em>initiate </em>a [federal] habeas petition\u201d [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">We conclude that a petitioner whose conviction has expired fully prior to the filing of a habeas petition is not in \u201ccustody\u201d on that conviction within the meaning of \u00a7 52-466, despite the alleged existence of collateral consequences flowing from that conviction. To construe the term custody in the broad manner proposed by the petitioner \u201cstretches the language [of the statute] too far.\u201d <em>Maleng </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>supra, 490 U.S. 491. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>the custody requirement has been construed liberally; see footnote 17 of this opinion; it has never been extended to \u201cthe situation where a habeas petitioner <em>suffers no present restraint from a </em>conviction.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 492. Such an interpretation \u201cwould mean that a petitioner whose sentence has completely expired could nonetheless challenge the conviction for which it was imposed at any time\u201d through a state petition for habeas corpus and would \u201cread the \u2018in custody\u2019 requirement out of the statute.\u201d Id. To the extent that the petitioner in the present matter claims that the alleged enhancement of his current sentence and security classification has \u201cdeprived [him] of his liberty\u201d under \u00a7 52-466 and has rendered him in custody, his loss of liberty stems solely from his current conviction. See id., 492-93. Accordingly, we conclude that the habeas court properly determined that the collateral consequences of the petitioner\u2019s expired conviction were insufficient to render him in custody on that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Lastly, the petitioner claims that the habeas court improperly dismissed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus in violation of the due process clause of the federal and Connecticut constitutions<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and in violation of the prohibition in the Connecticut constitution against the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Although the petitioner failed to raise his federal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>state constitutional claims before the habeas court,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we recognize that a party may prevail on unpreserved constitutional claims pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> if the party affirmatively requests and adequately briefs his entitlement to <em>Golding </em>review. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>261 Conn. 156, 171, 801 A.2d 788 (2002). In the present matter, however, the petitioner makes only a passing reference to <em>Golding </em>for the first time in his reply brief and fails to brief his entitlement to <em>Golding </em>review. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Peeler, </em>271 Conn. 338, 373 n.36, 857 A.2d 808 (2004) (\u201c[w]e generally do not consider issues raised for the first time in a reply brief\u2019 [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Garvin, </em>242 Conn. 296, 312, 699 A.2d 921 (1997) (\u201c[t]he reply brief is not the proper vehicle in which to provide this court with the basis for our review under . . . <em>[Golding] </em>analysis\u201d); see also <em>Ghant </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>255 Conn. 1, 17, 761 A.2d 740 (2000) (\u201c[i]t is not appropriate to engage in a level of review that is not requested\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Consequently, we decline to review the petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims because they are inadequately briefed. Accordingly, we conclude that the habeas court properly dismissed the habeas petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the petitioner was not in custody on the conviction under attack at the time his petition was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Apc\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b530-14\"> We granted certification limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the petitioner\u2019s habeas corpus petition?\u201d <em>Lebron </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>269 Conn. 914, 852 A.2d 743 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b531-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-466 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) An application for a writ of habeas corpus shall be made to the superior court or to a judge thereof for the judicial district in which the person whose custody is in question is claimed to be illegally confined or deprived of his liberty, provided any application made by or on behalf of aperson confined in the Connecticut Correctional Institution, Enfield-Medium or the Carl Robinson Correctional Institution, Enfield, shall be made to the superior court or a judge thereof for the judicial district of Tolland.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">\u201c(b) The application shall be verified by the affidavit of the applicant for the writ alleging that he truly believes that the person on whose account the writ is sought is illegally confined or deprived of his liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">\u201c(c) The writ shall be directed to some proper officer to serve and return, who shall serve the same by putting a true and attested copy of it into the hands of the person who has the custody of the body of the person who is directed to be presented upon the writ.

Id., 492-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">In the present matter, unlike in <em>Maleng, </em>there is no evidence that the petitioner\u2019s subsequent sentence was actually enhanced by his prior expired conviction. The petitioner did not have an opportunity, however, to present evidence of enhancement before the habeas court dismissed his petition on jurisdictional grounds. In our review of the habeas court\u2019s dismissal of the petition, we take as true all facts alleged in the petition, including the allegation that the petitioner\u2019s subsequent sentence and security classification were enhanced by his expired 1992 conviction. See <em>Neiman </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 250-51. We emphasize, however, that where a petition properly attacks the petitioner\u2019s <em>current sentence, </em>as enhanced by an allegedly illegal expired conviction, the petitioner must produce, inter alia, <em>actual evidence </em>of enhancement to prevail on the merits of his petition. See <em>Lackawanna County District Attorney </em>v. <em>Coss, </em>supra, 532 U.S. 406^408. Although the issue is not before us in the present matter, we doubt that a sentencing judge\u2019s mere mention of a prior expired conviction would satisfy this requirement. Id., 406 (sentencing judge\u2019s \u201c \u2018consideration\u2019 \u201d of criminal record as a whole insufficient evidence of enhancement).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b549-8\"> We reject the petitioner\u2019s argument that <em>Lackawanna County District Attorney </em>represents an exception to the rule in <em>Maleng </em>that the collateral consequences of an expired conviction are insufficient to render a petitioner in custody on the expired conviction at the time the petition is filed. Contrary to the petitioner\u2019s assertion, the court in <em>Lackawanna County District Attorney, </em>explicitly affirmed its conclusion in <em>Maleng. </em>See <em>Lackawanna </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number><em>County District Attorney </em>v. <em>Coss, </em>supra, 532 U.S. 401 (citing to <em>Maleng, </em>and concluding that petitioner is \u201cno longer serving the sentences imposed pursuant to his 1986 convictions, and therefore cannot bring afederal habeas petition directed solely at those convictions\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\"> The petitioner also relies on <em>Carafas </em>v. <em>LaVallee, </em>supra, 391 U.S. 234. In <em>Carafas, </em>the United States Supreme Court addressed whether a habeas petition is rendered moot by the petitioner\u2019s unconditional release during the pendency of the habeas litigation. The court concluded that the habeas petition was not moot because of the collateral consequences that continued to flow from the petitioner\u2019s allegedly illegal conviction. Id., 237-38 (\u201c[i]n consequence of his conviction, [the petitioner] cannot engage in certain businesses; he cannot serve as an official of a labor union for a specified period of time; he cannot vote in any election held in New York State; he cannot serve as a juror\u201d). The court went on to consider whether the jurisdictional \u201cin custody\u201d requirement of the federal habeas statutes was also satisfied. Id., 238. The court concluded that \u201cunder the statutory scheme, once the federal jurisdiction has attached in the District Court, it is not defeated by the release of the petitioner prior to completion of proceedings on such application.\u201d Id. Thus, the court determined that it had continuing jurisdiction over the petition. The petitioner argues that the court in <em>Carafas, </em>in resolving the jurisdictional \u201cin custody\u201d question, \u201crelied in part upon the collateral consequences that the petitioner continued to suffer as aresult of his assuredly illegal conviction . . . .\u201d We disagree. In <em>Maleng </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>supra, 490 U.S. 492, the court clarified its holding in <em>Carafas: </em>\u201c[w]hile we ultimately found [the \u2018in custody\u2019] requirement satisfied . . . we rested that holding <em>not </em>on the collateral consequences of the conviction, but on the fact that the petitioner had been in physical custody under the challenged conviction at the time the petition was filed. . . . The negative implication of this holding is, of course, that once the sentence imposed for a conviction has completely expired, the collateral consequences of that conviction are not themselves sufficient to render an individual \u2018in custody\u2019 for the purposes of a habeas attack upon it.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original.) Thus, the petitioner\u2019s reliance on <em>Carafas </em>is unavailing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b551-6\"> The petitioner also claims that the language of \u00a7 52-466 is broader than the language of the federal habeas statutes because it permits an individual who has been \u201cdeprived of his liberty\u201d to file a petition for writ of habeas corpus. He argues that \u00a7 52-466 is broad enough to encompass a challenge to a fully expired conviction when the petitioner suffers adverse collateral consequences from that conviction. Compare General Statutes \u00a7 52-466 with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241 and 2254. We disagree. It is well established that, in determining the scope of the writ of habeas corpus under state law, we look to the scope of the writ under federal law. See, e.g., <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 815 (\u201c[t]he history of our own [habeas] jurisprudence is wholly in accord\u201d with federal principles). This is because both state and federal law governing the writ derive from the English common law. See, e.g., <em>Rasul </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>542 U.S. 466, 473, 124 S. Ct. 2686, 159 L. Ed. 2d 548 (2004) (\u201c[h]abeas corpus is ... a writ antecedent to statute . . . throwing its root deep into the genius of our common law\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Wojculewicz </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>143 Conn. 624, 627, 124 A.2d 886 (1956) (\u201c[t]he writ of habeas corpus, as a remedy for illegal restraint, is a prerogative common-law writ providing a special and extraordinary legal remedy\u201d). Courts construing the term custody in the context of the federal writ of habeas corpus have concluded that the term is not limited to \u201cactual physical detention in jail or prison. Rather the term is synonymous with restraint of liberty\u201d; R. Sokol, Federal Habeas Corpus (2d Ed. 1969) \u00a7 6.1, p. 66; including those restraints in place when the petitioner is on parole; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>371 U.S. 236, 243, 83 S. Ct. 373, 9 L. Ed. 2d 285 (1963), and when he is released on his own recognizance. <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, San Jose-Milpitas Judicial District, </em>411 U.S. 345, 348-49, 93 S. Ct. 1571, 36 L. Ed. 2d 294 (1973). We conclude that the legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cdeprived of his liberty\u201d in \u00a7 52-466 was merely intended to recognize that, historically, actual physical detention is not a jurisdictional prerequisite for bringing a writ of habeas corpus. Accordingly, we conclude that the legislature did not intend to make the state writ of habeas corpus broader than its federal counterpart.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\"> The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, \u00a7 1, provides in relevant part: \u201c[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">Article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b553-10\"> Article first, \u00a7 12, of the constitution of Connecticut provides: \u201cThe privileges of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless, when in case of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it; nor in any case, but by the legislature.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\"> Additionally, we note that these claims were not raised before the Appellate Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b554-7\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, we determined that \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.
