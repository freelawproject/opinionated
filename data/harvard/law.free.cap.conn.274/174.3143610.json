In the first petition, the department sought to terminate the respondents\u2019 parental rights with respect to their daughter, H; in the second petition, the department sought to terminate their parental rights with respect to their daughter, L. In a separate, earlier proceeding, the department had filed a petition for termination of the parental rights of the father of A, who is H and L\u2019s half sister (A proceeding). All three petitions were tried to the court, <em>Trombley, J. </em>After commencement of the trial in the present case, the respondent, J,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a combined motion for mistrial and for sanctions in which he alleged that the department improperly had introduced materials in the A proceeding that contained information about him that was prejudicial and would deny him a fair trial. Judge Trombley denied the motion. Ultimately, Judge Trombley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>rendered judgment terminating the respondent\u2019s parental rights with respect to both H and L. The respondent now appeals,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claiming that Judge Trombley should have treated his motion for mistrial and for sanctions as a motion for disqualification and should have disqualified himself on the ground that he had presided over the A proceeding and, therefore, had prior knowledge of the history, facts and circumstances of the case. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The record reveals the following relevant facts. The trial on the two petitions for termination of the respondents\u2019 parental rights took place over three days, October 6 and November 25, 2003, and March 8, 2004. On October 30, 2003, the respondent filed his combined motion for mistrial and for sanctions. At the hearing on the motion, the respondent claimed that, in the A proceeding, the department had \u201cput prejudicial information before this court\u2014unredacted, naked, raw information about [the respondent] that had no business being in that . . . trial . . . .\u201d Judge Trombley asked the respondent, \u201c[W]hat\u2019s your solution to all this?\u201d The respondent replied that he wanted the court to order the department to provide a list of all exhibits produced in the A proceeding. The court granted the request and assured the respondent that \u201cthere is nothing that I saw in the exhibits or anything I read in writing that decision [in the A proceeding] that would [in] any way prejudice [the respondent].\u201d When the respondent reminded the court that he had requested that the A proceeding be tried separately from this case because he was concerned that he would be prejudiced by the evidence produced at the A proceeding, the court responded: \u201cI\u2019m telling you there was no prejudice, sir. This is the judge who has to decide this case telling you that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>whatever I read in the [A proceeding], I will not apply to this case.\u201d Later, the court ordered the department to provide the respondent with access to all records in its possession pertaining to the A proceeding and reiterated that it would \u201cclearly hold the state to its burden to demonstrate to me the statutory parameters by clear and convincing evidence and the best interest issue by clear and convincing evidence and nothing I read in [the A proceeding] is going to point me in any particular direction.\u201d The court then denied the motion for mistrial and for sanctions. After the conclusion of evidence, the trial court rendered judgment terminating the respondent\u2019s parental rights with respect to both children.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">On appeal, the respondent claims that the trial court should have construed his motion for mistrial and for sanctions as a motion for disqualification and should have granted the motion for disqualification. He further claims that the trial court was biased against him because it had prior knowledge of the claims, issues and evidence in this case, violated canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and was predisposed against the respondent as a result of presiding over both the A proceeding and the trial in the present case. Upon review of the briefs and record we conclude that the trial court properly denied the motion for mistrial and for sanctions. First, the respondent has provided no authority for the proposition that a judge\u2019s familiarity with a party\u2019s personal history by virtue of the judge\u2019s participation in a prior proceeding, standing alone and without any showing of bias, requires disqualification. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Cf. <em>Liteky </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 510 U.S. 540, 551, 114 S. Ct. 1147, 127 L. Ed. 2d 474 (1994) (opinion held by judge as result of what judge learned in earlier proceeding need not necessarily be characterized as bias or prejudice); <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 617-18, 646 A.2d 126 (1994). We see nothing in the portion of the record cited by the respondent to suggest that Judge Trombley was biased against him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Second, although the respondent never specifically identifies the portions of the evidence introduced in the A proceeding that were prejudicial to him, it appears that he was concerned about reports by Richard Sadler, a psychiatrist, and Bruce Freedman, a psychologist, that contained information about him. See footnote 4 of this opinion. Those reports, however, were also introduced as exhibits at trial in the present case without objection by the respondent. Accordingly, we cannot perceive how Judge Trombley\u2019s knowledge of those reports by virtue of his participation in the A proceeding could have biased him against the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Our examination of the record and briefs and our consideration of the arguments of the parties persuades us that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. The issues were resolved properly in the trial court\u2019s concise and well reasoned memorandum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>decision. See <em>In re Heather L., </em>49 Conn. Sup. 287, 877 A.2d 27 (2004). Accordingly, we adopt it as a proper statement of the issues and the applicable law concerning those issues. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>259 Conn. 45, 55, 787 A.2d 530 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-10\"> During trial, the respondent, K, consented to the termination of her parental rights. She is not a party to this appeal. All further references in this opinion to the respondent are to J.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\"> The respondent appealed to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b199-7\"> Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct provides in relevant part: \u201c(c) ... (1) A judge should disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where:</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">\u201c(A) the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding .. . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\"> The respondent points out that on October 6, 2003, Judge Trombley indicated that he was aware of the facts and circumstances of the A proceeding and that he had read a report by Richard Sadler, a psychiatrist, that had been introduced in that proceeding and contained information about the respondent. The respondent claims that Judge Trombley contradicted this statement on November 25, 2003, when he stated that he saw nothing in the evidence in the A proceeding that would prejudice the respondent. The respondent also points out that Judge Trombley indicated that because Bruce Freedman, a psychologist and expert witness for the state, had been qualified to testify in the A proceeding, he was qualified as an expert to testify in the present case. Finally, the respondent points out that Judge Trombley stated to K that he was aware of the difficulties that she had had with A\u2019s father. We see nothing in any of these statements to support the respondent\u2019s claim that Judge Trombley was biased against him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
