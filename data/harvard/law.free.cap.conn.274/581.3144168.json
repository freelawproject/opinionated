The state claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the defendant was deprived of his right to a fair trial by: (1) remarks made by the assistant state\u2019s attorney (state\u2019s attorney) during his closing and rebuttal arguments; and (2) the trial court\u2019s appearance of partiality in its instructions to the jury on the charge of manslaughter in the first degree. We agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>state, and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The Appellate Court opinion sets forth the following facts, which reasonably could have been found by the jury. \u201cAt approximately 4 a.m., on June 23, 2000, a Chevrolet Tracker was stopped at a red traffic signal on Chase Avenue in Waterbury. The vehicle the defendant was driving approached the traffic light traveling in the same direction as the Tracker. It struck the rear end of the Tracker at a speed of more than ninety miles per hour. The occupants of the Tracker, Stacy Maia and Nicolina Baratta, both died as a result of the collision. Cecilio Quinones, a passenger in the front seat of the defendant\u2019s vehicle, sustained fatal injuries as a result of the collision. Samuel Tirado, a second passenger in the defendant\u2019s vehicle sustained serious but nonfatal injuries as a result of the collision. It was later determined that the defendant was under the influence of marijuana and phencyclidine, also known as PCP, at the time of the collision. Immediately following the collision, the defendant climbed [through] the [broken] windshield of his vehicle as the driver\u2019s door would not open. The defendant pulled Quinones from the front seat of the vehicle. The defendant then collapsed next to Quinones on the street.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bermudez, </em>79 Conn. App. 275, 277-78, 830 A.2d 288 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The defendant subsequently was arrested and charged with three counts of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3), and one count of assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3). During a jury trial, after the state rested, the defendant sought to have the charges dismissed, and further sought a judgment of acquittal as to all four counts. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal, and the defendant subsequently was convicted of three counts of manslaughter in the first degree, and one count of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the lesser included offense of assault in the third degree. Id., App. 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The defendant then appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, claiming that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction, that the statements of the state\u2019s attorney during closing argument violated the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, that the trial court improperly excluded evidence of a witness\u2019 prior inconsistent statements, that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence the defendant\u2019s hospital records, and that the trial court created an appearance of partiality by overemphasizing the jury instructions on manslaughter in the first degree, which the defendant claimed further violated his right to a fair trial. Id., 277. The Appellate Court concluded that the defendant was deprived of his right to a fair trial because the state\u2019s attorney had engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by making improper statements during closing argument and because the trial court had created an appearance of partiality by overemphasizing the manslaughter juiy charge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Id., 277 and n.3 Accordingly, the Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court and ordered a new trial. Id., 277. Thereafter, we granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following question: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that: (1) prosecutorial misconduct deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (2) the trial court improperly overemphasized the charge of manslaughter in the first degree in its instructions to the jury?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bermudez, </em>266 Conn. 921, 835 A.2d 61 (2003). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">The Appellate Court concluded that the state\u2019s attorney had made numerous remarks during his closing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>and rebuttal arguments that constituted prosecutorial misconduct, and deprived the defendant of his right to a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bermudez, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 287-88. The state claims that four of the comments of the state\u2019s attorney at issue did not constitute prosecutorial misconduct. Although the state concedes that two additional comments were improper, it nevertheless claims that the remarks were not of the egregious nature necessary to be considered a violation of the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. The defendant counters that all of the comments of the state\u2019s attorney at issue were improper and rose to the level of a violation of his right to a fair trial. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review. Ordinarily, when a defendant fails to preserve a claim for appellate review, we will not review the claim unless the defendant is entitled to prevail under the plain error doctrine or the rule set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>261 Conn. 156, 171, 801 A.2d 788 (2002). \u201cUnder <em>Golding, </em>a defendant can prevail on an unpreserved claim of constitutional error only if the following conditions are satisfied: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>260 Conn. 466, 472, 797 A.2d 1101 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">In cases of unpreserved claims of prosecutorial misconduct, however, \u201cit is unnecessary for the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>to seek to prevail under the specific requirements of . . . <em>Golding </em>and, similarly, it is unnecessary for a reviewing court to apply the four-pronged <em>Golding </em>test. The reason for this is that the touchstone for appellate review of claims of prosecutorial misconduct is a determination of whether the defendant was deprived of his right to a fair trial, and this determination must involve the application of the factors set out by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987). . . . Regardless of whether the defendant has objected to an incident of misconduct, a reviewing court must apply the <em>Williams </em>factors to the entire trial, because there is no way to determine whether the defendant was deprived of his right to a fair trial unless the misconduct is viewed in light of the entire trial. The application of the <em>Williams </em>factors, therefore, is identical to the third and fourth prongs of <em>Golding, </em>namely, whether the constitutional violation exists, and whether it was harmful. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 240. Requiring the application of both <em>Williams </em>and <em>Golding, </em>therefore, would lead ... to confusion and duplication of effort. Furthermore, the application of the <em>Golding </em>test to unchallenged incidents of misconduct tends to encourage analysis of each incident in isolation from one another. Because the inquiry must involve the entire trial, all incidents of misconduct must be viewed in relation to one another and within the context of the entire trial. The object of inquiry before a reviewing court in [due process] claims involving prosecutorial misconduct, therefore, is always and only the fairness of the entire trial, and not the specific incidents of misconduct themselves. Application of the <em>Williams </em>factors provides for such an analysis, and the specific <em>Golding </em>test, therefore, is superfluous. In light of these observations, we conclude that, following a determination that prosecutorial misconduct has occurred, regardless of whether it was objected to, an appellate court must apply the <em>Williams </em>factors to the entire trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>\u201cThis does not mean, however, that the absence of an objection at trial does not play a significant role in the application of the <em>Williams </em>factors. To the contrary, the determination of whether a new trial or proceeding is warranted depends, in part, on whether defense counsel has made a timely objection to any [incident] of the prosecutor\u2019s improper [conduct]. When defense counsel does not object, request a curative instruction or move for a mistrial, he presumably does not view the alleged impropriety as prejudicial enough to seriously jeopardize the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. . . . [Thus], the fact that defense counsel did not object to one or more incidents of misconduct must be considered in determining whether and to what extent the misconduct contributed to depriving the defendant of a fair trial and whether, therefore, reversal is warranted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ancona, </em>270 Conn. 568, 591-93, 854 A.2d 718 (2004), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1055, 125 S. Ct. 921, 160 L. Ed. 2d 780 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">In examining claims of prosecutorial misconduct, \u201cwe engage in a two step analytical process. The two steps are separate and distinct: (1) whether misconduct occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that misconduct deprived a defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. Put differently, misconduct is misconduct, regardless of its ultimate effect on the fairness of the trial; whether that misconduct caused or contributed to a due process violation is a separate and distinct question that may only be resolved in the context of the entire trial . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Coney, </em>266 Conn. 787, 808, 835 A.2d 977 (2003). In order to determine whether any improper conduct by the state\u2019s attorney violated the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, we will consider the factors set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">We previously have recognized that \u201cprosecutorial misconduct of a constitutional magnitude can occur in the course of closing arguments. ... In determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>whether such misconduct has occurred, the reviewing court must give due deference to the fact that [cjounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument. . . . Thus, as the state\u2019s advocate, a prosecutor may argue the state\u2019s case forcefully, [provided the argument is] fair and based upon the facts in evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom. . . . Moreover, [i]t does not follow . . . that eveiy use of rhetorical language or device [by the prosecutor] is improper. . . . The occasional use of rhetorical devices is simply fair argument. . . . Nevertheless, the prosecutor has a heightened duty to avoid argument that strays from the evidence or diverts the jury\u2019s attention from the facts of the case.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>266 Conn. 440, 458, 832 A.2d 626 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">We turn now to the portions of the closing and rebuttal arguments of the state\u2019s attorney that the Appellate Court concluded were improper. The Appellate Court concluded that the state\u2019s attorney improperly expressed his opinions regarding the credibility of certain witnesses and the ultimate issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bermudez, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 282. Specifically, the Appellate Court concluded that during closing argument, the state\u2019s attorney improperly: (1) expressed his personal opinion about the credibility of Elliston Skyers, one of the state\u2019s witnesses; (2) personally vouched for the credibility of Thomas Meier, another of the state\u2019s witnesses; (3) suggested that Gloria Demaris Garcia, a defense witness, was lying during her testimony; (4) suggested that Garcia might be charged with perjury as a result of her testimony; (5) appealed to the jury\u2019s emotions; and (6) expressed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>personal opinion as to the defendant\u2019s guilt. Id., 287-88. We address each of these remarks in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Opinion Regarding the Credibility of Witnesses</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">We begin by setting forth the well settled rule that, \u201ca prosecutor may not express his own opinion, directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of the witnesses. . . . Nor should a prosecutor express his opinion, directly or indirectly, as to the guilt of the defendant. . . . Such expressions of personal opinion are a form of unsworn and unchecked testimony, and are particularly difficult for the jury to ignore because of the prosecutor\u2019s special position. . . . Moreover, because the jury is aware that the prosecutor has prepared and presented the case and consequently, may have access to matters not in evidence ... it is likely to infer that such matters precipitated the personal opinions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ancona, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 605. While a prosecutor cannot express his opinion as to the credibility of witnesses, he is permitted \u201cto explain that a witness either has or does not have a motive to lie.\u201d Id., 607. Further, \u201c[i]t is not improper for the prosecutor to comment upon the evidence presented at trial and to argue the inferences that the jurors might draw therefrom .... We must give the jury the credit of being able to differentiate between argument on the evidence and attempts to persuade them to draw inferences in the state\u2019s favor, on one hand, and improper unsworn testimony, with the suggestion of secret knowledge, on the other hand. The state\u2019s attorney should not be put in the rhetorical straitjacket of always using the passive voice, or continually emphasizing that he is simply saying I submit to you that this is what the evidence shows, or the like.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 465-66. \u201c[C]ounselis entitled to considerable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>leeway in deciding how best to highlight or to underscore the facts, and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, for which there <em>is </em>adequate support in the record. We therefore never have categorically barred counsel\u2019s use of such rhetorical devices . . . as long as there is no reasonable likelihood that the particular device employed will confuse the jury or otherwise prejudice the opposing party.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. Ancona, supra, 598. With these principles in mind, we turn to the state\u2019s specific claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Skyers</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The state\u2019s first witness at trial was Skyers, who witnessed the accident from his place of employment. Skyers testified that after he saw the collision, he ran to the defendant\u2019s vehicle, where he pulled a passenger, later identified as Tirado, from the back seat. When questioned about his motivation to testify, Skyers stated that he testified only as a result of a subpoena, and that he was not partial to either party. Garcia, a defense witness, later testified that she had pulled Tirado from the back seat, which conflicted with Skyers\u2019 testimony. During closing argument, the state\u2019s attorney referred to Skyers\u2019 testimony, stating that \u201cSkyers is a neutral witness. He doesn\u2019t know the defendant for ten years. He didn\u2019t want to be involved in this case. He came in and he told you what he saw after he had given a statement to the police. . . . Why would he make that up? How would he forget that? How could that be anything but the truth? I mean, examine the credibility of the witnesses. What would possess somebody to make that up? I submit to you that based on this evidence, Skyers is the person who pulled [Tirado] out of the back of that car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">The Appellate Court concluded that through these statements, the state\u2019s attorney expressed his personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>opinion as to the credibility and neutrality of Skyers. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bermudez, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 287. The state claims that these statements during closing argument were proper in that the state\u2019s attorney was emphasizing the evidence that supported Skyers\u2019 credibility as a witness. We agree. In making these remarks, the state\u2019s attorney did not offer his own opinion as to the credibility of Skyers\u2019 testimony. Rather, he argued that Skyers had no motive to lie about what occurred at the scene of the accident, and cited the evidence that supported the credibility of Skyers\u2019 testimony. This argument was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Meier</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">The state also called as a witness Meier, a lieutenant for the Waterbury fire department who arrived at the scene of the accident shortly after hearing the collision, which occurred next to the fire station to which Meier was assigned. Meier testified that he had observed the defendant climb out of his vehicle through the front windshield, and that he had observed a person, later determined to be Quinones, in the front passenger seat with the seat \u201cbuckled up against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">During closing argument, the state\u2019s attorney stated: \u201cThen you have another neutral party, someone who has nothing to gain, didn\u2019t know anybody involved in the case, is the lieutenant from the fire department. . . . Here\u2019s what I expect you to take away from [Meier\u2019s] testimony: He heard the crash. He woke up. He got out there as quickly as he could and he saw the defendant climbing through the windshield. That\u2019s not contradicted by any other testimony that the state presented in this case. And it\u2019s supported by the physical evidence. He sees the defendant climb out of the windshield, goes over to the passenger door, looks in the car and sees another person in the passenger seat. Doesn\u2019t see Tir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>ado in the back seat because the car door is not open. And Meier\u2019s testimony was he was assessing people. It didn\u2019t look like [Quinones] could be helped. That turned out to be true. So Meier goes back over to the Tracker [the car that was hit]. . . . When he\u2019s headed back over to the Tracker, his back is to the [defendant\u2019s car]. That\u2019s why he never sees Skyers pulling [Tirado] out of the back of the car. And that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t know until all these events have unfolded that, in fact, there was a third person involved. It\u2019s a hectic scene. He was asked about [twenty-five] times, \u2018Are you sure you saw somebody climbing out of the windshield?\u2019 Is that something you would forget? Is that something that he would make up? Of course not. That is reliable, sworn testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The Appellate Court concluded that, as with the comments made by the state\u2019s attorney about Skyers\u2019 testimony, this also was an improper expression of personal opinion regarding the credibility and neutrality of a state\u2019s witness. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bermudez, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 287. The state again argues that the remarks made by the state\u2019s attorney were based on the evidence and reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence, and accordingly, they were not improper. We agree with the state. As with his comments concerning Skyers\u2019 testimony, the state\u2019s attorney did not offer his own opinion as to the credibility of Meier\u2019s testimony. He argued that Meier was a neutral witness who had nothing to gain by testifying falsely about what he had observed at the scene of the accident, and that Meier\u2019s testimony was not contradicted by that of the other witnesses for the state. These statements were not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Garcia</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">Garcia, a defense witness, testified that, as she approached the scene of the accident, she had observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>the defendant exit his vehicle through the back seat on the driver\u2019s side. She further testified that the defendant did <em>not </em>exit the car through the windshield, and that she was \u201cpositive\u201d that Quinones was behind the steering wheel when she approached the car. On direct examination, the defendant\u2019s attorney asked Garcia if she was \u201chere to lie for anyone,\u201d to which she responded that she was not. On cross-examination by the state\u2019s attorney, Garcia was asked, \u201cAre you aware of the penalties for perjury?\u201d Garcia responded that she was, and when she was asked if she was aware that perjury is a felony that can result in incarceration, she responded that she was aware of that as well. On redirect examination, Garcia testified that in a previous out-of-court meeting, the state\u2019s attorney had warned her that she could be arrested for perjury, and she further testified that when she first met with the state\u2019s attorney, she had not yet spoken to the defendant\u2019s attorney. On recross-examination, Garcia confirmed that during the out-of-court meeting with the state\u2019s attorney, he had told her that if he could <em>prove </em>that she was lying, she could be arrested for perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">During his closing argument, the state\u2019s attorney said of Garcia\u2019s testimony: \u201cHer testimony makes no sense. And I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard to accept, but people do come in here, they raise their right hand and swear to tell the truth and they lie. And that\u2019s what the evidence in this case shows about [Garcia]. That\u2019s what I told her, as [defense counsel] brought out, when I heard her stoiy in my office. I said to her, if you get up there and you tell something that\u2019s not true and we can prove it, you\u2019re going to be arrested for perjury. Based on the record in this case, and the eyewitnesses, [Meier and Skyers], [Garcia] is not telling the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The Appellate Court concluded that the remarks made by the state\u2019s attorney during closing argument suggesting that Garcia could be charged with perjury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>were improper. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bermudez, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 287. The Appellate Court specifically determined that \u201c[t]he jury easily could have inferred from the prosecutor\u2019s remarks that he had information outside of the evidence that the witness was indeed lying. Those statements constituted an inappropriate attack on the witness\u2019 credibility because they implied that the prosecutor had knowledge outside the record about the witness\u2019 credibility.\u201d Id. The state, however, maintains that the state\u2019s attorney simply remarked on the testimony that was presented at trial, that he had a conversation with Garcia and informed her of the risk of perjuring herself. The state further argues that the state\u2019s attorney made clear in his closing argument that his statement that Garcia had lied was based on the evidence, including the testimony of the state\u2019s witnesses and the physical evidence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The state\u2019s attorney did not infer that he had information outside the evidence that Garcia\u2019s testimony constituted perjury. During closing argument, the state\u2019s attorney simply commented on evidence already in the record, e.g., that he had informed Garcia of the possible consequences of committing perjury. The state\u2019s attorney further argued that based on the other evidence presented at trial, Garcia\u2019s testimony could not be true. There is nothing improper in commenting on the evidence presented by both the defendant and the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Appeal to the Jury\u2019s Emotions</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">It is well established that, \u201c[a] prosecutor may not appeal to the emotions, passions and prejudices of the jurors. . . . We have stated that such appeals should be avoided because they have the effect of diverting the jury\u2019s attention from their duty to decide the case on the evidence. . . . When the prosecutor appeals to emotions, he invites the jury to decide the case, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>according to a rational appraisal of the evidence, but on the basis of powerful and irrelevant factors which are likely to skew that appraisal.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rizzo, </em>266 Conn. 171, 255, 833 A.2d 363 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">During closing argument, defense counsel commented on the state\u2019s attack on the credibility of the defense witnesses, saying, \u201c[the] [s]tate wants you to believe they are all liars. Only four people who can tell you anything of importance, but they are all liars. Why? Because it doesn\u2019t fit into their little agenda of convicting a live person for the bizarre acts of a man on PCP.\u201d During his rebuttal argument, the state\u2019s attorney stated: \u201c[T]here are so many areas that [defense counsel] talked about that I think they\u2019re just inaccurate. And it all goes under the heading, and this was a quote, of course, referring particularly to me and to the witnesses, of course they all have their hidden agendas. I have no hidden agenda against [the defendant]. The driver in that accident deserved to die. That would have been justice. If I had my way, that\u2019s how this case would have played out, not the innocent people dying. So my hidden agenda and the witnesses\u2019 hidden agendas is not to put responsibility where it doesn\u2019t belong, but what we do is we bring the case forward to you. And I don\u2019t understand, I really don\u2019t know how [defense counsel] can stand up in front of you and say with a straight face there is not one iota, not one iota of evidence that [the defendant] was driving the car. You sat here and listened to the case. There\u2019s a mountain of evidence that he was driving the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The Appellate Court concluded that by stating that justice would have been served had the defendant died instead of the victims, the state\u2019s attorney improperly expressed his personal opinion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bermudez, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 288. The state claims that when read in the context of the defendant\u2019s claims about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>state\u2019s \u201cagenda,\u201d the comments of the state\u2019s attorney were not an improper appeal to the jury\u2019s emotions. We disagree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">By telling the jury that justice would have been well served had the defendant died instead of the victims, the state\u2019s attorney improperly appealed to the jurors\u2019 emotions. The state\u2019s attorney could have responded to the accusation that the state had an agenda in prosecuting the defendant without making the inflammatory statement that the defendant deserved to die in the car accident. By injecting that comment, the state\u2019s attorney improperly appealed to the jurors\u2019 passions and emotions. Accordingly, we agree with the Appellate Court that this comment by the state\u2019s attorney was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Personal Opinion as to the Defendant\u2019s Guilt</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">During his closing argument, defense counsel told the jury: \u201cOver the last two weeks you may have thought that I pressed a witness unfairly. I think \u2018attacked\u2019 was the word used. That I urged an unfair advantage. That I asked an unworthy question, or I acted improperly either with brother counsel or with his Honor. If I exceeded the proper limits in your mind, I implore you to forgive me, but, you see, I\u2019m the only advocate for [the defendant]. I\u2019m the one who gets up here and does the best I can for him. And his life and his future is at stake, and I take it extraordinarily seriously, extraordinarily seriously. I have been doing it a quarter century. This is not my first homicide by any stretch of the imagination.\u201d In response, during his rebuttal argument, the state\u2019s attorney said, \u201cI may not have been practicing law for a quarter of a century or [twenty-five] years like [defense counsel], but I\u2019ll tell you, I tried a lot of criminal cases, and I\u2019ve stood in front of a lot of juries and I\u2019ve asked a lot of juries to convict a lot of people and they have.\u201d In discussing the defendant\u2019s recklessness, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>state\u2019s attorney further stated: \u201cOf course any one of us would know that driving around [at a high rate of speed while high on marijuana and PCP] is a risk and the evidence shows that he just ignored it. He\u2019s responsible. He killed three people. It\u2019s not a murder trial, but there\u2019s three people dead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The Appellate Court concluded that the state\u2019s attorney improperly buttressed his opinion of the defendant\u2019s guilt by comparing it to previous cases he successfully had prosecuted, and further that he expressed his opinion on the ultimate issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bermudez, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 288. The state disagrees, claiming that when read in context, the comments of the state\u2019s attorney simply responded to defense counsel\u2019s reference to his own experience as a defense attorney, and further, that the remarks on the defendant\u2019s recklessness were based on the evidence in the case and not on the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s personal opinion. We conclude that the remarks of the state\u2019s attorney with regard to recklessness were proper, but that his reference to the previous convictions he had obtained were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">As we stated previously, \u201ca prosecutor may not express his own opinion, directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of witnesses.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ancona, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 605. \u201c[I]t is well established that the evaluation of witnesses\u2019 testimony and credibility are wholly within the province of the trier of fact.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>90 Conn. App. 82, 95, 876 A.2d 561, cert. denied, 275 Conn. 924, 885 A.2d 1250 (2005). By referring to his experience prosecuting cases and convincing juries to convict defendants, the state\u2019s attorney improperly sought to have the jury trust his judgment and analysis of the evidence as previous juries had. It is for the jury, however, and not the state\u2019s attorney, to decide if there is reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>guilt. His remarks about the defendant\u2019s recklessness did not constitute his personal opinion as to the ultimate issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt, however, because they were tied to the evidence in the case. \u201c[T]he <em>evidence </em>shows that [the defendant] just ignored [the risk of driving recklessly].\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Due Process Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">We now consider whether the two identified improper statements, the comment of the state\u2019s attorney that the defendant deserved to die in the car accident and the reference by the state\u2019s attorney to his previous prosecutorial experience, \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the [defendant\u2019s] conviction a denial of due process. ... In other words, we must decide whether the sum total of [the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s] improprieties rendered the defendant\u2019s [trial] fundamentally unfair. . . . The question of whether the defendant has been prejudiced by prosecutorial misconduct . . . depends on whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury\u2019s verdict would have been different absent the sum total of the improprieties.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ancona, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 611-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">We evaluate whether the prosecutorial misconduct amounted to a denial of due process by considering the following factors: \u201c(1) the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense [counsel\u2019s] conduct or argument; (2) the frequency and severity of the misconduct; (3) the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case; (4) the strength of any curative measures taken; (5) the strength of the state\u2019s case; and (6) whether the defendant objected to the misconduct.\u201d Id., 612; see also <em>State v. Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540. After considering the application of these factors to the present case, we conclude, contrary to the determination of the Appellate Court, that the misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>by the state\u2019s attorney did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">As to the first <em>Williams </em>factor, the state claims that defense counsel invited both the remark made by the state\u2019s attorney that the defendant deserved to die and his statement that he successfully had convinced many juries to convict the defendants in cases he had prosecuted. We agree with the state. Although it was improper for the state\u2019s attorney to remark that justice would have been served had the defendant died, the comment was made in response to defense counsel\u2019s statement that the state had a \u201clittle agenda of convicting a live person for the bizarre acts of a man on PCP.\u201d Similarly, while it was improper for the state\u2019s attorney to comment to the jury about his prior experience convincing juries that the defendants in his cases were guilty, he was responding to defense counsel\u2019s statement that, \u201cI have been [advocating for defendants for] a quarter century. This is not my first homicide by any stretch of the imagination.\u201d While both statements by the state\u2019s attorney were improper, his argument was invited by defense counsel\u2019s statements of a similar nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">With respect to the second <em>Williams </em>factor, the frequency and severity of the misconduct, the state contends that the improper statements did not constitute severe misconduct and did not recur frequently during the state\u2019s closing arguments. We agree. We note first that the defendant did not object to the state\u2019s improper comments during closing and rebuttal argument. \u201c[W]e consider it highly significant that defense counsel failed to object to any of the improper remarks, request curative instructions, or move for a mistrial. Defense counsel, therefore, presumably [did] not view the alleged impropriety as prejudicial enough to seriously jeopardize the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. . . . Given the defendant\u2019s failure to object, only instances of grossly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>egregious misconduct will be severe enough to mandate reversal.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 479-80. We also consider it significant that the improper remarks made by the state\u2019s attorney consisted of only two instances of brief duration, which certainly is not grossly egregious when viewed in the context of the entire trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">As to the third <em>Williams </em>factor, the state claims that the misconduct was not central to the critical issues in the case because of the existence of physical evidence that corroborated the testimony of the state\u2019s witnesses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The outcome of the case, therefore, was not determined solely by weighing the credibility of the witnesses. Although the state\u2019s attorney did improperly appeal to the emotions of the jury and describe his success in front of previous juries, the crux of the present case was whether the jury was convinced that the defendant had been operating the car at the time of the collision. Thus, despite the improper nature of the remarks made by the state\u2019s attorney, they did not relate directly to the ultimate issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">As to the fourth <em>Williams </em>factor, the state further claims that the trial court mitigated the effect of the improper statements of the state\u2019s attorney through its charge to the jury. We agree. The trial court instructed the jurors: \u201cYou are the sole judges of the facts. It is your duty to find the facts. You are to recollect and weigh the evidence and form your own conclusions as to what the ultimate facts are. You may not go outside the evidence introduced in court to find the facts. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>means that you may not resort to guesswork, conjecture, or suspicion. And you must not be influenced by any personal likes or dislikes, opinions, prejudices, or sympathy. . . . Certain things are not in evidence. And you may not consider them in deciding what the facts are. And these include . . . [t]he arguments and the statements by the attorneys. The lawyers are not witnesses. What they have said in their closing arguments is intended to help you to interpret the evidence, but it is not evidence. If the facts, as you remember them, differ from the way the lawyers have stated them, your memory of the facts controls.\u201d This instruction likely alleviated the possible prejudicial effect of the improper statements of the state\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">As to the strength of the state\u2019s case against the defendant, the fifth <em>Williams </em>factor, the state claims that the physical and testimonial evidence presented to the jury strongly supported the defendant\u2019s conviction. We agree. We previously have noted the physical evidence supporting conviction. See footnote 2 of this opinion. In addition, the state presented the testimony of Skyers and Meier, both of whom were neutral observers.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Finally, we note that the defendant did not object to <em>any </em>of the remarks made by the state\u2019s attorney during his closing and rebuttal arguments. As we stated previously, \u201cwe consider it highly significant that defense counsel failed to object to any of the improper remarks, request curative instructions, or move for a mistrial. Defense counsel, therefore, presumably [did] not view the alleged impropriety as prejudicial enough to seriously jeopardize the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 479. Thus, after considering the factors set out in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540, we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly determined that the improper statements of the state\u2019s attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>ney during his closing and rebuttal arguments deprived the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">JURY CHARGE</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Although the Appellate Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction and ordered a new trial based on its determination of prosecutorial misconduct, the Appellate Court also stated in a footnote that, \u201cthe [trial] court violated the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial by overemphasizing the instructions on manslaughter in the first degree.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bermudez, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 277 n.3. The state claims on appeal that the trial court did not overemphasize the manslaughter charges when compared with the instructions for the lesser included offenses, and that the trial court did not suggest that the state had sustained its burden of proof as to the manslaughter charge. The defendant counters that the trial court read and explained the statute on manslaughter in the first degree five times when charging the jury, whereas it did not do the same when charging the jury on the lesser offenses, and accordingly, the trial court violated the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial by failing to maintain an atmosphere of impartiality. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cWhen reviewing the challenged jury instruction . . . we must adhere to the well settled rule that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. ... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>and sufficient for the guidance of the jury ... we will not view the instructions as improper.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Denby, </em>235 Conn. 477, 484-85, 668 A.2d 682 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">\u201cIn a criminal trial, the judge is more than a mere moderator of the proceedings. It is [the judge\u2019s] responsibility to have the trial conducted in a manner which approaches an atmosphere of perfect impartiality which is so much to be desired in a judicial proceeding.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>272 Conn. 106, 362, 864 A.2d 666 (2004). Specifically, in the context of the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury, the trial court\u2019s statements should \u201cdemonstrate the overall impartial and unbiased nature of the jury charge.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>255 Conn. 782, 799, 772 A.2d 559 (2001). With these principles in mind, we turn to the jury charge in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">During the third part of the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury, the trial court read the manslaughter in the first degree statute three separate times. Before reading it for the third time, the trial court said, \u201c[tjhere\u2019s three counts, so there\u2019s no harm in reading it three times.\u201d The trial court then read the elements of manslaughter in the first degree two more times in the context of explaining the other charges. After the trial court instructed the jury as to the specific charges, defense counsel took exception, stating: \u201cWith regards to your instructions on manslaughter in the first degree, Your Honor said it five times. You read it five times to them. Manslaughter in the second degree you read it twice. And negligent homicide you read once to them and only once to them. Therefore, I object to the emphasis on the manslaughter in the first degree, having read it to them five times.\u201d In response, the trial court explained its method of charging the jury, stating that, \u201crepeating is an effort on my part for them to understand the top charge. Once they understand the top charge, I don\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>need to repeat as often when I\u2019m talking about a lesser included offense which contains many of the same elements, and would be, I think, repeating that point, would become confusing to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">While the trial court did state the elements of manslaughter in the first degree with greater frequency than the elements of the lesser included offenses, it did so as part of its stated method of helping the jury understand the \u201ctop charge\u201d and then continuing with the lesser included offenses. Further, the defendant was charged with three counts of manslaughter in the first degree, so the first three readings of the statute accounted for the three different counts, as clarified by the trial court when the charges were read. The trial court\u2019s repeated reading of the elements of manslaughter in the first degree was an attempt to clarify to the juiy the differences between the various charges, and was not evidence that the trial court lacked impartiality. We carefully have reviewed the charge as a whole, and we do not see any evidence of partiality on the part of the trial court. Accordingly, we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly determined that the trial court violated the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial by overemphasizing the manslaughter charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to consider the defendant\u2019s remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-10\"> The Appellate Court further concluded that there was no merit to the defendant\u2019s insufficiency of the evidence claim, and it did not address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>defendant\u2019s remaining claims. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bermudez, </em>supra, 79 Conn.
