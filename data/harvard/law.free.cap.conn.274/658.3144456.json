The principal issue in these certified appeals is whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that violation of the <em>Niblack </em>rule is, by itself, plain error that requires reversal of a defendant\u2019s conviction, without regard to the facts and circumstances of a particular case. The state appeals, upon our granting of its petitions for certification,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgments of the Appellate Court reversing the judgments of the trial court, which: (1) found the defendant, Louis D\u2019Antonio, to be in violation of his probation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32; <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Antonio, </em>79 Conn. App. 683, 691, 830 A.2d 1187 (2003) <em>(D\u2019Antonio I); </em>and (2) convicted the defendant after a jury trial of criminal trespass in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-107 (a) (1), and two counts of interfering with an officer in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167a (a). <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Antonio, </em>79 Conn. App. 696, 830 A.2d 1196 (2003) <em>(D\u2019Antonio II). </em>We conclude that, under the facts and circumstances of this case, the trial court\u2019s presiding at the hearing, trial and sentencing of the defendant after it had participated in plea negotiations, although improper, was not plain error requiring rever<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>sal. Accordingly, we reverse the judgments of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The records and the Appellate Court decisions reveal the following facts and procedural history. \u201cOn October 24, 2000, the defendant, through his public defender, pleaded nolo contendere to two separate charges of operating under the influence on two separate occasions in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a and was sentenced by the court <em>[Clifford, J.] </em>to a total effective term of thirty months of imprisonment, execution suspended after twenty-four months, and one year of probation with special conditions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The special conditions of the defendant\u2019s probation were the same with respect to both violations and included, inter alia, substance abuse screening, evaluation and treatment as recommended by the probation officer, a total of 200 hours of community service and no operation of a motor vehicle while the defendant\u2019s operator\u2019s license was under suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">\u201cOn or about October 4, 2001, the defendant was released from prison and began serving his probation. After the defendant refused to participate in an alcohol treatment program, his probation officer applied for arrest warrants for violation of probation on December 10, 2001. On December 11, 2001, the defendant was arraigned on two criminal matters, criminal trespass in the first degree and interfering with an officer, respectively, and the court appointed a public defender as his counsel. On December 18, 2001, the defendant was arraigned on the violation of probation matters and denials were entered. At that time, the court appointed the public defender who was handling the defendant\u2019s criminal matters to represent him in the violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>probation matters. Thereafter, the court held several scheduled proceedings, often involving both the criminal and the violation of probation matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">\u201cOn January 15,2002, the defendant appeared in court with his counsel and indicated that he wanted to represent himself. The court <em>[Gordon, J.[ </em>told the defendant that before allowing him to represent himself, it was going to order a competency examination. On February 27, 2002, when the defendant appeared in court with his counsel, the court, <em>Fischer, J., </em>made an uncontested finding of competency based on the competency report in the file. Again, the defendant raised the issue of self-representation. The court, <em>Fischer, J., </em>allowed the defendant\u2019s counsel to withdraw from the violation of probation and criminal cases, and, on the same date, the defendant filed a pro se appearance in those cases. On March 20,2002, the court, <em>Clifford, J., </em>the prosecutor and the defendant engaged in an on the record plea discussion. The defendant refused any offered plea bargain and insisted on exercising his \u2018right for a trial.\u2019<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>\u201cOn April 3, 2002, the defendant again appeared before Judge Clifford for the violation of probation hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>ing. Although Judge Clifford recalled having some discussion with the defendant previously in the case, he proceeded to canvass the defendant on the issue of self-representation and advised the defendant of, inter alia, the state\u2019s burden of proof in the case and the defendant\u2019s various constitutional rights. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>indicated that he was \u2018prepared to continue\u2019 and to \u2018go forward,\u2019 and there was no mention by anyone of Judge Clifford\u2019s recusal. Thereafter, the hearing commenced and concluded, and Judge Clifford found that the defendant did violate a condition of his probation and that the beneficial aspects of probation were no longer being served. Judge Clifford sentenced the defendant to the remaining six months of imprisonment previously suspended on the sentence for the underlying motor vehicle offenses.\u201d <em>D\u2019Antonio I, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 685-89. Additional facts concerning the violation of probation hearing will be discussed in part I C of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">\u201cAt the conclusion of the sentencing phase of the violation of probation hearing, there was a brief on the record discussion of the defendant\u2019s pending criminal trespass and interfering cases. Judge Clifford again briefly canvassed the defendant on the issue of self-representation and appointed standby counsel to assist the defendant in the trial of the charges of criminal trespass in the first degree and interfering with an officer. On June 10, 2002, Judge Clifford granted the state\u2019s motion to consolidate those cases for trial. On the same date, during a discussion about whether Judge Clifford had signed an arrest warrant in the case, Judge Clifford asked the defendant, \u2018Do you have a problem with me sitting on [this case?]\u2019 The defendant responded that he had \u2018[n]o objection.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">\u201cThereafter, following jury selection on June 12,2002, the case proceeded to trial before Judge Clifford on June 12, 13, 14 and 18, 2002. During trial, there was no mention by anyone of Judge Clifford\u2019s recusal. On June 18, 2002, the jury returned a guilty verdict on one count of criminal trespass in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-107 (a) (1) and two counts of interfering with an officer in violation of \u00a7 53a-167a (a). Judge Clifford then sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of two years imprisonment, execution suspended after twenty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>months, with three years of probation.\u201d <em>D Antonio II, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 702-703. Additional facts concerning the criminal jury trial will be discussed in part I D of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The defendant filed timely appeals to the Appellate Court from the judgments of the trial court with respect to the judgments of conviction and probation violation. The Appellate Court reversed the judgments in the cases in two separate opinions, concluding that, notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s failure to move for recusal at trial, it was plain error for Judge Clifford to preside over the probation violation hearing and criminal trial after having participated in plea bargaining on the same charges on March 20, 2002, in violation of the <em>Niblack </em>rule. <em>D'Antonio I, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 693-94; <em>D'Antonio II, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 707. The Appellate Court relied on its decisions in <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>68 Conn. App. 884, 793 A.2d 274, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 924, 797 A.2d 521 (2002), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>39 Conn. App. 175, 664 A.2d 1153 (1995), and reasoned that a new hearing and a new trial were required because \u201cthe existence of impartiality might reasonably be questioned and the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceeding affected when a court presides over the violation of probation hearing after having participated actively in plea negotiations. In this case, the appearance of a fair trial has been lost and a new revocation of probation hearing is warranted.\u201d <em>D'Antonio I, </em>supra, 696; see also <em>DAntonio II, </em>supra, 710 (same conclusion for trial and sentencing in criminal matter). Thereafter, we granted the state\u2019s petitions for certification; see footnote 2 of this opinion; and these appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">On appeal, the state claims that the Appellate Court improperly reversed the judgments of the trial court on the basis of plain error because: (1) the defendant\u2019s claims with respect to the trial court\u2019s failure to recuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>itself axe unreviewable because he waived them by failing to raise them pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-39 (c)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> before the trial court in a Practice Book \u00a7 1-23<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> disqualification motion; and (2) the records in both the probation violation and criminal proceedings demonstrate that there was no actual bias on the part of the trial court, and that the impropriety was harmless because it did not affect the results of the proceedings. In response, the defendant argues that the Appellate Court properly: (1) reviewed the proceedings for plain error because \u201cjudicial neutrality is a core value of our judicial system\u201d; and (2) concluded that it was plain error for the trial court to preside because it is the potential appearance of partiality that requires the trial court to recuse itself after unsuccessful plea bargaining. The defendant also posits two alternate grounds for affirming the judgment of the Appellate Court, namely, that: (1) the trial court\u2019s presiding over the hearing and trial was a constitutional due process violation reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989); and (2) the February 27, 2002 canvass of the defendant by the trial court, <em>Fischer, J., </em>did not establish that the defendant made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel before he proceeded pro se during plea bargaining, the probation violation hearing and the criminal jury trial. Finally, the defendant also claims that his two interfering with an officer convictions violate federal and state constitutional protections against double jeopardy because they are for the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>We begin with the standard of review applicable to the defendant\u2019s plea bargaining claims, which were not raised before the trial court. \u201cA claim that a judge should not have participated in plea negotiations, based solely upon the appearance of partiality, does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Safford </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>223 Conn. 180, 190-91, 612 A.2d 1161 (1992) (unpreserved claim that judge improperly had sentenced defendant after participating actively in plea negotiations based solely on appearance of partiality not constitutional violation for habeas corpus purposes). Accordingly, and as the Appellate Court properly recognized, review is unavailable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, which is limited to constitutional claims. Review of the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claims must, therefore, be pursuant to the plain error doctrine, which \u201chas been codified at Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, which provides in relevant part that [t]he court may reverse or modify the decision of the trial court if it determines . . . that the decision is . . . erroneous in law. . . . The plain error doctrine is not ... a rule of reviewability. It is a rule of reversibility. That is, it is a doctrine that this court invokes in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial court, nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment, for reasons of policy. . . . The plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. ... A party cannot prevail under plain error unless it has demonstrated that the failure to grant relief will result in manifest injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Alston, </em>272 Conn. 432, 455-56, 862 A.2d 817 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S FAILURE TO RECUSE ITSELF FROM PRESIDING OVER THE DEFENDANT\u2019S HEARING AND TRIALS CONSTITUTED PLAIN ERROR REQUIRING REVERSAL</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Whether the Defendant\u2019s Failure to Raise His Recusal Claims Before the Trial Court Precludes Plain Error Reversal</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">We begin with the state\u2019s claim that the Appellate Court should not have determined whether the trial court\u2019s failure to recuse itself was reversible plain error because the defendant failed to raise his disqualification claims at trial. The state relies on General Statutes \u00a7 51-39 (c), and Practice Book \u00a7 1-23, which govern the disqualification of judges, as well as the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Maluk, </em>10 Conn. App. 422, 523 A.2d 928 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">A judge must recuse herself or himself from a matter, either sua sponte or \u201cupon motion of either party, if such judicial authority is disqualified from acting therein pursuant to Canon 3 (c) of the Code of Judicial Conduct . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7 1-22 (a). It is undisputed that Practice Book \u00a7 1-23 governs motions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>judicial disqualification, and requires such motions to \u201cbe in writing and shall be accompanied by an affidavit setting forth the facts relied upon to show the grounds for disqualification and a certificate of the counsel of record that the motion is made in good faith. The motion shall be filed no less than ten days before the time the case is called for trial or hearing, unless good cause is shown for failure to file within such time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">These mies of practice must be read in conjunction with \u00a7 51-39 (c), which provides that, \u201c[w]hen any judge or family support magistrate is disqualified to act in any proceeding before him, he may act if the parties thereto consent in open court.\u201d It is well settled that, in both civil and criminal cases, the failure \u201cto raise the issue of the referee\u2019s disqualification either before or during the trial, can be constmed as the functional equivalent of \u2018consent in open court . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>Timm </em>v. <em>Timm, </em>195 Conn. 202, 205, 487 A.2d 191 (1985) (noting that record revealed no evidence of bias when trial judge failed to disqualify himself after conducting pretrial negotiations in court case); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>257 Conn. 106, 117, 777 A.2d 580 (2001) (noting that record revealed no evidence of bias and defendant\u2019s failure to object after improper disclosure of part B information was \u201ctantamount to consent to the judge\u2019s participation in the case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The state\u2019s arguments, however, sweep far too broadly and are dramatically at odds with the purpose of the plain error doctrine, which does not exist to permit reversals as the result of unpreserved technical errors, but rather to prevent the occurrence of \u201cmanifest injustice [s]\u201d as the result of particularly \u201cextraordinary\u201d trial errors. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Alston, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 456. We find instmctive this court\u2019s decision in <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>187 Conn. 163, 444 A.2d 915 (1982). In that case, an issue developed at trial about $4000 that the defendant allegedly had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>failed to include in his financial affidavit. Id., 164. The defendant\u2019s attorney explained that the money had been deposited into a savings account, but the trial court demanded a deposit slip, stating that if one could not be produced, \u201c \u2018either you or your client is in serious trouble in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate a fraud upon this [c]ourt.\u2019 \u201d Id., 164-65. The court ordered the defendant to appear the following morning, and made derogatory comments about the defendant\u2019s attorney and some of his prior clients, while stating \u201cseveral times . . . that the defendant had lied under oath.\u201d Id., 165-66. The exchange continued the following morning when the trial court stated that it thought that the deposit slip that was produced had been \u201c \u2018tampered with,\u2019 \u201d and called the defendant to the witness stand, subsequently holding both the defendant and counsel in contempt of court; this judgment was vacated after counsel apologized. Id., 166-68. The defendant\u2019s attorney did not move for a mistrial or disqualification at any point.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">On appeal, this court stated that, \u201c[w]e would not ordinarily review on appeal a claim that a trial judge should have disqualified himself or declared a mistrial at a certain stage of the proceedings when no such request was made during the trial,\u201d but concluded that, \u201c[w]e are dealing here, however, with an accusation of prejudice against a judge, \u2018which strikes at the very core of judicial integrity and tends to undermine public confidence in the established judiciary.\u2019 \u201d Id., 168. The court invoked the plain error rule, concluding that the trial court\u2019s conduct toward the defendant and counsel caused the appearance of partiality, and that \u201c[i]t is quite evident from our review of the trial transcript that a serious departure from these high standards [of impartiality] occurred in the court below.\u201d Id., 169. The court stated that the trial court had expressed \u201ca preconceived view of the credibility of a witness who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>not yet testified before the trier and of an attitude of skepticism concerning any person represented by his counsel [that] must have been devastating to the defendant and astounding to any observer schooled in the simple faith that the court is an instrument of justice.\u201d Id., 170. Noting that \u201c[p]roof of actual bias is not required for disqualification,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he appearance as well as the actuality of impartiality on the part of the trier is an essential ingredient of a fair trial,\u201d the court concluded that the \u201crecord in this case discloses a situation \u2018which inevitably raises in the minds of litigants ... a suspicion as to the fairness of the court\u2019s administration of justice.\u2019 \u201d Id., 170-71. Accordingly, the court concluded that the trial judge sua sponte should have ordered a mistrial, and vacated the judgment of the trial court. Id., 171; <em>see Bieluch v. Bieluch, </em>199 Conn. 550, 553, 509 A.2d 8 (1986) (comparing <em>Cameron </em>and declining to consider disqualification claim not raised at trial when \u201cnothing on the face of this record demonstrates such a miscarriage of justice as would warrant a finding of plain error in the trial judge\u2019s failure to recuse himself sua sponte\u201d);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>65 Conn. App. 717, 728, 783 A.2d 1100 (declining to review unpreserved judicial bias claim based on court\u2019s conduct during trial when \u201c[t]he defendant has made no claim of plain error in this case\u201d), cert. denied, 258 Conn. 940, 786 A.2d 427 (2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>McDuffie, </em>51 Conn. App. 210, 217, 721 A.2d 142 (1998) (concluding that trial court\u2019s pretrial statement about defendant before probation violation hearing \u201cdid not affect the fairness or integrity of the proceedings, nor did it result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>in manifest injustice to the defendant\u201d), cert. denied, 247 Conn. 958, 723 A.2d 814 (1999).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Applying <em>Cameron </em>and its progeny, we conclude that the state\u2019s argument that these claims lay beyond the ambit of the plain error rule subverts the purpose of that doctrine, which exists to prevent \u201cmanifest injustices\u201d that otherwise might occur without consideration of certain \u201cextraordinary\u201d unpreserved claims. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Alston, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 456. Accordingly, we do not subject trial courts to reversal by ambuscade by reversing judgments on the basis of apparent judicial bias as manifested by genuinely egregious conduct, rather than technical violations of rules of practice. Accordingly, we now turn to the merits of the certified questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Whether Automatic Reversal is Required When a Trial Court Presides Over a Defendant\u2019s Trial After Having Participated in Plea Bargaining Negotiations</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">We now turn to the primary legal issue in these appeals, namely, whether it is per se plain error requiring reversal for a trial court to preside, in violation of the <em>Niblack </em>rule, over a defendant\u2019s trial after having participated actively in unsuccessful plea negotiations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>The state claims that the Appellate Court misapplied the plain error doctrine because the record does not show any actual bias against the defendant on the part of Judge Clifford, and, therefore, his presiding at the probation violation hearing and criminal trial likely did not affect the results of those proceedings. The state contends specifically that we should follow the lead of the federal courts and apply the doctrine of harmless error to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly presided after participating in plea negotiations. In response, the defendant argues that proof of actual bias is not required to mandate judicial disqualification and that per se reversal protects public confidence in the fairness of judicial proceedings and the conduct of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Our inquiry about whether violation of the well established <em>Niblaclc </em>rule constitutes per se plain error begins with a review of the purposes of the rule. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Niblack, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 281, we rejected the defendant\u2019s attack on his guilty pleas to charges of murder, escape from custody and robbery, and concluded that the defendant failed to raise issues of constitutional magnitude requiring <em>Golding </em>review because \u201cthe available record fails to indicate that the participation of the judge who presided over and supervised the challenged plea negotiations coerced a plea from the defendant.\u201d We also \u201capprove [d]\u201d in dicta of the method followed by the trial court and the parties with respect to judicial court participation in the plea bargaining process, stating that, \u201c[t]he plea negotiations involved an assistant state\u2019s attorney, defense counsel and eventually a judge who assisted the adversaries in reaching an agreement .... The judge was responsible for conducting plea negotiations and, if an agreement was reached, for holding a plea and sentencing hearing. If negotiations were not successful, however, a judge who was not involved in the plea negotiations would have presided at trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>and pronounced sentence if the defendant were found guilty.\u201d Id., 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">In so concluding, we discussed the criticisms of active judicial participation in plea bargaining described in prior cases. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Gradzik, </em>193 Conn. 35, 47, 475 A.2d 269 (1984), this court stated in dicta: \u201cIf the record revealed that the judge had been an active participant in negotiating the plea, we would view this claim differently. The dangers of such participation are obvious. In the first place, judicial participation in plea negotiations is likely to impair the trial court\u2019s impartiality. The judge who suggests or encourages a particular plea bargain may feel a personal stake in the agreement (and in the quick disposition of the case made possible by the bargain) and may therefore resent the defendant who rejects his advice. . . . Moreover, the defendant is likely to make incriminating concessions during the course of plea negotiations. ... In the second place, judicial participation in plea discussions creates a misleading impression of the judge\u2019s role in the proceedings. As a result of his participation, the judge is no longer a judicial officer or a neutral arbiter.

In <em>Safford, </em>we affirmed the denial of a habeas corpus petition, rejecting, inter alia, the petitioner\u2019s claim that the judge who had sentenced him was barred from doing so by the Code of Judicial Conduct because he had participated in the plea bargaining that led to the petitioner\u2019s guilty plea to sexual assault charges. Id., 188-90. We concluded that the claims were not appropriate for a habeas petition because \u201c[a] claim that a judge should not have participated in plea negotiations, based solely upon the appearance of partiality, does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. . . . Nor does it constitute a miscarriage of justice, or other prejudice justifying the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 190-91. We also rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move for the trial court\u2019s disqualification; id., 194; and we again recited our approval of the <em>Niblack </em>rule governing plea negotiations. Id., 194 n.16. We also stated that this \u201cprocedure must be distinguished from the situation where the judge who participates in plea negotiations is also responsible for conducting the trial and, therefore, for sentencing the defendant in the event of a conviction,\u201d because, that situation gives rise to the \u201cdangers we identified in <em>State </em>v. <em>Gradzik, </em>[supra, 193 Conn. 47] . . . .\u201d <em>Safford </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 194 n. 16. We noted that adherence to the <em>Niblack </em>rule eliminates these risks because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>\u201c[a]s long as the defendant is free to reject the plea offer and go to trial before a judge who was not involved in or aware of those negotiations, he is not subject to any undue pressure to agree to the plea agreement, and the impartiality of the judge who will sentence him in the event of conviction after trial is not compromised.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">We most recently addressed judicial participation in plea bargaining in <em>State </em>v. <em>Revelo, </em>256 Conn. 494, 497, 775 A.2d 260, cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1052, 122 S. Ct. 639, 151 L. Ed. 2d 558 (2001), wherein the trial court stated that it would sentence the defendant to eight years imprisonment in accordance with a plea offer that had been made. The defendant, however, wished to move for the suppression of certain evidence. Id. The trial court told the defendant that, if the motion was unsuccessful, the sentence would be nine years imprisonment. Id., 497-98. Thereafter, the trial court held a hearing and denied the motion to suppress, and then accepted the defendant\u2019s plea of nolo contendere and sentenced him to nine years imprisonment. Id., 498-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">On appeal, we concluded that \u201cprinciples of due process prohibit a court from retaliating against a defendant merely for exercising a statutory or constitutional right. In this case, the trial court told the defendant that he would be required to serve one extra year in prison if he agreed to plead guilty only after exercising his right to a judicial determination of his motion to suppress. By requiring that additional period of incarceration for no reason other than the defendant\u2019s decision to pursue his motion to suppress, the trial court punished the defendant for doing what the law plainly allow[ed] him to do ... . Although a corut may deny leniency to an accused who, like the defendant, elects to exercise a statutory or constitutional right, a court may not penalize an accused for exercising such a right by increasing his or her sentence solely because of that election.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>(Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 513. Although we noted that a trial court may advise a defendant during plea bargaining of the potential for a greater sentence after trial,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we concluded that \u201c[t]he court, in wielding its power as it did in this case, discharged its sentencing function in a manner that is legally indistinguishable from the kind of \u2018unilateral imposition of a penalty upon a defendant who ha[s] chosen to exercise a legal right\u2019 that has been held unconstitutional.\u201d Id., 515. In particular, we noted the trial court\u2019s failure to explain why the greater sentence \u201cmight be appropriate ... to dispel any suggestion that the court was prepared to punish the defendant merely for exercising his right to a judicial determination of his motion. Indeed, the failure of the trial court in this case to provide such an explanation is a critical factor in our conclusion that the court overstepped its constitutional bounds by adding one year to the defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Our analysis in <em>Revelo </em>included a comprehensive review of the restrictions on judicial participation in plea bargaining.

Citing our decision in <em>Safford </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 194 n.16, we contrasted the inherent \u201cdangers\u201d of a judge presiding over a defendant\u2019s trial after active participation in unsuccessful plea negotiations; <em>State </em>v. <em>Revelo, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 506 n.23; with \u201cjudicial involvement in plea discussions when it is clear to all concerned parties that, in the event a plea agreement is not reached, the judge involved in the plea negotiations will play no role in the ensuing trial, including the imposition of sentence upon conviction.\u201d Id., 506-507, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Niblack, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\"><em>Niblack </em>established a clear and bright line rule standing for the proposition that it is improper for a trial judge to preside over a defendant\u2019s trial after having participated actively in unsuccessful plea negotiations in the case. Moreover, although it is well established that the <em>Niblack </em>rule is itself not of constitutional dimensions; Safford <em>v. Warden, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 190-91; scrupulous adherence thereto nevertheless aids in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>enforcement of the constitutional requirement of an impartial judiciary and the constitutional prohibition against increasing defendants\u2019 sentences in retaliation for their having exercised their sixth amendment right to a trial. See <em>German </em>v. <em>United States, </em>525 A.2d 596, 601-602 (D.C.) (prohibition of judicial participation in plea bargaining is \u201cprophylactic\u201d and \u201crule of practice for trial courts; it does not embody a constitutional limitation\u201d), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 944, 108 S. Ct. 331, 98 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1987). Accordingly, violation of the <em>Niblack </em>rule is, <em>by itself, </em>not a \u201ctruly extraordinary [situation] where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Alston, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">We conclude that establishing a violation of the <em>Niblack </em>rule does not, therefore, excuse the defendant from \u201cdemonstrating] that the failure to grant relief will result in manifest injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Rather, the defendant must demonstrate on appeal that the record in the case actually implicates the dangers of judicial participation in plea negotiations, the primary examples of which were discussed in <em>Safford </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 194 n. 16.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, before reversing a judgment of conviction and a concomitant sentence, we must look beyond the fact of the <em>Niblack </em>violation and review the record as a whole for evidence of actual or apparent prejudice to the defendant. See German v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 525 A.2d 602 (noting \u201ccore concern\u201d of resentment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>defendant by court after unsuccessful negotiations and stating that \u201c[t]he selection of a proper remedy . . . merges into the question whether the defendant has been penalized for exercising his sixth amendment right to a jury trial\u201d); see also id., 603 (\u201cthe same standards and case law can be employed to determine both the [harmless error] inquiry and the constitutional question whether [the defendant] has been improperly penalized for exercising his sixth amendment right to a trial by jury\u201d). In doing so, we consider, in addition to judicial participation in unsuccessful plea negotiations followed by a harsher sentence than initially was offered, factors that include: \u201c(1) whether the trial judge initiated the plea discussions with the defendant ... (2) whether the trial judge, through his or her comments on the record, appears to have departed from his or her role as an impartial arbiter by either urging the defendant to accept a plea, or by implying or stating that the sentence imposed would hinge on future procedural choices, such as exercising the right to trial; (3) the disparity between the plea offer and the ultimate sentence imposed; and (4) the lack of any facts on the record that explain the reason for the increased sentence other than that the defendant exercised his or her right to a trial or hearing.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. State, 845 So. 2d 142, 156 (Fla. 2003); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Gradzik, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 47-48 (concluding that \u201cthe sentence imposed was eminently fair and compassionate\u201d in light of defendant\u2019s \u201clengthy criminal record, including five violations of probation\u201d and failure \u201cto avail himself of drug rehabilitation\u201d); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Messier, </em>16 Conn. App. 455, 459-60, 549 A.2d 270 (presiding trial judge did not improperly deny defendant\u2019s recusal motion when pretrial participation was brief and record provided \u201cno basis for concluding that the trial judge\u2019s pretrial activities so impaired, or appeared to impair, his ability to act as a judicial officer or a neutral arbiter that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>error to deny the motion for disqualification\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 209 Conn. 829, 552 A.2d 1216 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Indeed, our rejection of a per se reversal rule for <em>Niblack </em>violations is consistent with the approach to this issue taken by the federal courts and the majority of our sister states.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We, therefore, begin with a review of the federal approach. Unlike Connecticut trial judges, federal district judges are not permitted to participate in the plea negotiation process at all. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 (c).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This prohibition exists primarily to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>the appearance of coercion because \u201c[a] defendant may be motivated to enter an involuntary guilty plea if he fears that his rejection of the plea will mean imposition of a more severe sentence after trial or decrease his chances of obtaining a fair trial before a judge who he has challenged.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. Diaz, 138 F.3d 1359, 1363 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 913, 119 S. Ct. 259, 142 L. Ed. 2d 213 (1998). The federal courts, however, also have determined that an absolute ban on judicial participation \u201cserve [s] important prophylactic purposes\u201d by ensuring the appearance of judicial impartiality during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>trial and sentencing. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>60 F.3d 199, 205 n.11 (5th Cir. 1995). Despite the categorical ban, such participation nevertheless is subject to review for harmless error. Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">In conducting this harmless error review, in the absence of other claimed trial errors, the federal courts of appeal \u201cexamine whether the district court\u2019s participation might reasonably be said to have affected the court\u2019s impartiality in the conduct of the trial or sentencing.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>supra, 60 F.3d 205; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>supra, 138 F.3d 1364 (\u201cmost importantly, the district court based [the defendant\u2019s] sentence on entirely sound reasons and displayed no bias in sentencing him\u201d). For example, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>supra, 205, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that the trial court\u2019s participation in plea bargaining caused no harm with respect to the defendant\u2019s trial because the defendant did not raise any claims on appeal with respect to sufficiency of the evidence, evidentiary rulings, jury instructions or other trial procedure. The court did, however, conclude that there was harm with respect to the defendant\u2019s sentence because: (1) the government did not argue harmless error; and (2) comments made by the trial court during the plea negotiations indicated a \u201cpremature commitment to a sentence of at least a certain level of severity.\u201d Id., 205. Accordingly, it affirmed the defendant\u2019s convictions, but vacated the sentences and remanded for resentencing by a different judge. Id., 206-207.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">We also find helpful the approaches taken by other state courts, such as the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 845 So. 2d 152, wherein the court recognized that \u201cimposition of a harsher sentence, without explanation on the record after judicial participation in the plea negotiations, does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>raise concerns\u201d of judicial vindictiveness that are constitutional in scope.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court cited cases that \u201cillustrate the tension between the realistic expectation . . . that a guilty plea may justify leniency . . . and the constitutional imperative that a defendant should not be penalized by the judicial system for not accepting a plea and exercising his or her constitutional right to proceed to trial.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 156. The court adopted a totality of the circumstances analysis \u201cto employ to determine whether a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process of law was violated by the imposition of an increased sentence after unsuccessful plea discussions in which the trial judge participated.\u201d Id. The Florida court enumerated factors to consider, which, in addition to judicial participation in plea negotiations followed by a harsher sentence, include: \u201c(1) whether the trial judge initiated the plea discussions with the defendant ... (2) whether the trial judge, through his or her comments on the record, appears to have departed from his or her role as an impartial arbiter by either urging the defendant to accept a plea, or by implying or stating that the sentence imposed would hinge on future procedural choices, such as exercising the right to trial; (3) the disparity between the plea offer and the ultimate sentence imposed; and (4) the lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>any facts on the record that explain the reason for the increased sentence other than that the defendant exercised his or her right to a trial or hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Id., 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">The vast majority of our sister states have, despite their varying degrees of acceptance of judicial participation in plea bargaining, adopted approaches similar to that taken by both Florida and the federal courts for assessing any harm that may have befallen a defendant as a result of that practice. See <em>Pelmer </em>v. <em>State, </em>389 So. 2d 584, 589-91 (Ala. Crim.

The hearing began with the trial court and the defendant remembering each other from the prior proceedings, followed by a canvass of the pro se defendant to ensure that he was aware of his rights and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>the procedure for probation violation hearings, as well as his potential exposure for incarceration. At the beginning of the hearing, without prompting from the defendant, the trial court immediately ordered the defendant\u2019s handcuffs removed in accordance with a promise made at the March plea bargaining session. Kathleen Carabetta, the defendant\u2019s supervising probation officer, then testified that she had supervised him pursuant to a sentence for two driving while intoxicated convictions in 2000; it was a concurrent sentence of thirty months, with execution suspended after twenty-four months, with one year probation. The court\u2019s orders of probation were admitted into evidence, as well as the conditions of probation signed by the defendant in October, 2001. Those conditions were that the defendant was to: (1) refrain from operating a car while his license was under suspension; (2) obtain substance abuse screening, evaluation and treatment in accordance with the probation officer\u2019s recommendations; (3) perform 200 total hours of community service; and (4) refrain from assaulting, threatening or harassing his mother. In November, 2001, Carabetta received a postscreening recommendation that the defendant be placed inpatient at a residential treatment program because he had reported that he still was drinking; the clinician who did the screening also had reported to Carabetta that the defendant became hostile and started yelling that he was not going into a residential program.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Shortly thereafter, Carabetta met with the defendant to discuss the recommended treatment plan. At this meeting, the defendant became hostile; Carabetta told the defendant that, if he refused to go into the program, she would obtain a warrant for violation of probation. She testified that he told her to \u201c[g]o ahead and get your warrant and I\u2019ll see you in court at a hearing,\u201d and that he \u201ccould do six months in jail no problem.\u201d She then directed the defendant to leave, and obtained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>warrant. After being reminded by the court of his right to cross-examine Carabetta, the defendant declined the opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">After the trial court again reminded him of his right to remain silent, the defendant then testified on his own behalf. Shortly after the defendant was sworn, the trial court observed that he was \u201c[njervous\u201d and seemed like he was \u201cgoing to get emotional,\u201d and therefore, sua sponte offered him a break so that he could compose himself. After the break, the defendant explained, in narrative form, his version of what had occurred. He explained that he disagreed with the inpatient treatment and anger management classes directed by probation, and discussed his efforts to obtain employment and find a place to live. The defendant apparently became emotional again as the trial court offered him a glass of water during this narrative. After the defendant concluded his narrative, the state cross-examined him briefly. The defendant conceded on cross-examination that he had refused to comply with the directions of the probation officer. He offered no other witnesses or evidence on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The trial court then heard brief closing arguments from the state and the defendant, and concluded that the state had proven by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had violated the terms of his probation.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Faraday, </em>268 Conn. 174, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>183-84, 842 A.2d 567 (2004). The trial court then offered the defendant the opportunity to be heard with respect to the appropriate sentence, asking the defendant \u201cshould [I] just put you back on the probation or what . . . should [I] do with you?\u201d The defendant then stated that \u201cI never agreed to probation in the beginning,\u201d and after some discussion of the original plea canvass, that \u201cI don\u2019t know. I definitely do not want probation reinstated. It\u2019s just too difficult to get around and make appointments with people, try to keep your job, keep above water. I have no driver\u2019s license. At this point, sir, the bus situation, the transportation situation, is less than excellent in this particular part of the state from East Hampton to Middletown. The counseling services, I was not happy about that. I\u2019ve been to other counseling services and I feel that I should have\u2014the counseling services should have been a little bit more lenient to my condition, my particular case. ... I was trying to get back on my feet as a normal citizen of the state and they made it impossible for me, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">The trial court then acknowledged its sympathy with the defendant\u2019s \u201cfrustration,\u201d and the difficulties inherent in complying with the probation conditions while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>\u201cyou\u2019re trying to get back on the road. But the problem is it\u2019s not your call. See, that is what the problem is. It\u2019s probation\u2019s. Maybe you\u2019re right. Maybe originally you shouldn\u2019t have received probation. You\u2019re obviously not a probation kind of a guy because, you know, you didn\u2019t want to do this inpatient. So, I understand that.\u201d The trial court then considered the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and stated: \u201cI agree with the defendant, I think I can penalize him more if he sat in jail now for three and a half months\u2014I think the greater penalty would be if I sentenced you and kept you on the probation or extended the probation. I have the authority to extend the probation another two years. I think that would be a worse punishment to you if I said, well, I\u2019m not going to put you in jail for this. I\u2019m just going to extend the probation a couple of more years. I know you don\u2019t want probation. It\u2019s not going to work out with you in probation.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court stated that \u201cthe beneficial aspects of probation [are] no longer being served,\u201d and sentenced the defendant to complete the six months suspended portion of his sentence, with credit received for the three and one-half months pretrial detention. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Faraday, </em>supra, 268 Conn. 185 (\u201c[i] fa violation is found, a court must next determine whether probation should be revoked because the beneficial aspects of probation are no longer being served\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). The trial court, the state and the defendant then discussed the defendant\u2019s upcoming criminal trial, and the appointment of standby counsel to assist the defendant in those proceedings because of his continued desire to proceed pro se therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">We conclude that the trial court presided over the probation violation proceedings in a fair and even<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>handed manner, and the record reveals no manifest injustice therein. We begin by noting that the facts underlying the probation violation were not discussed during plea negotiations; see footnote 4 of this opinion; accordingly, they could not improperly have colored the trial court\u2019s factual findings. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant violated the terms of his probation was supported by a preponderance of the evidence on the record, and the defendant does not attack the validity of that finding on appeal. No reference was made at any point to the defendant\u2019s failure to accept the state\u2019s plea offer. The trial court was solicitous of the defendant throughout the hearing, offering him a break when necessary for him to regain his composure. Most importantly, the sentence was appropriate, and grounded both in the defendant\u2019s past criminal record and his admitted difficulties in complying with the terms of probation; indeed, the defendant explicitly stated that he did not wish to be placed back on probation. Accordingly, we conclude that the concerns of judicial vindictiveness contemplated by the <em>Niblack </em>rule were not realized in the probation violation proceedings, and, therefore, the Appellate Court improperly reversed the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Criminal Jury Trial on Interfering With an Officer and Trespass Charges</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">We next consider the record from the defendant\u2019s criminal jury trial on the trespass and interfering with an officer charges. When the trial began, the court ordered the removal of the defendant\u2019s handcuffs, but denied his motion for a bond reduction, finding no change in circumstances. The trial court then heard oral argument on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the interfering with an officer charges, which was based on the police officers\u2019 alleged attack on him and failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>to show their warrants, but the court denied that motion, explaining that it implicated actual defenses that presented issues of fact for the jury.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Pursuant to the state\u2019s joinder motion, the cases were then set for a consolidated trial on the various charges. Prior to the conclusion of the hearing on the joinder motion, the court, noting the importance of the defendant\u2019s appearance at trial, inquired about the availability of clothing other than the prison garb for the defendant, who was aided by standby counsel.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The trial court then recanvassed the defendant to ensure that he understood the role of standby counsel in the pro se proceedings, as well as his rights of cross-examination and the fifth amendment implications of testifying on his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>behalf.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> At the suggestion of the state\u2019s attorney, who noted his concern that the trial court had signed the arrest warrants in the case, the trial court then obtained the defendant\u2019s consent to preside at the trial.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Thereafter, a jury was empaneled and the trial commenced on June 13, 2002. The trial court ordered the removal of the defendant\u2019s handcuffs and leg irons before the jury entered the courtroom for the court\u2019s preliminary remarks.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Thereafter, the trial commenced, and the jury reasonably could have found the following facts from the exhibits and testimony adduced therein. The defendant had a falling-out with his mother, Frances D\u2019Antonio, who owned a home located at 137 Wopowog Road in East Hampton; she told him several times that he no longer was welcome at that house. In September, 1999, she obtained a restraining order from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>court, which was continued permanently until further order by the court, <em>Higgins, J., </em>in April, 2000.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> On the evening of December 9,2001, she returned from Florida to find the defendant in her home. He did not speak to his mother, but said to her daughter-in-law that \u201cI live here.\u201d The defendant\u2019s mother contacted the police from the nearby home of her other son. Two East Hampton police officers responded to her call; they went to the house and spoke to the defendant, who refused to leave the house. Thereafter, the police researched the orders, and found the April order on file at police headquarters, although they had some doubts as to its validity. The following day, the police obtained an arrest warrant for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">Five police officers returned to 137 Wopowog Road the next day to arrest the defendant pursuant to the warrant. When another officer telephoned the defendant there and directed him to surrender to the incoming police officers, the defendant hung up the telephone during the conversation. When the officers arrived at the residence, they saw the defendant in the kitchen cutting meat with a large filleting knife. They told the defendant that they had an arrest warrant for him, but he refused to come out of the house. Using a key provided by the defendant\u2019s mother, the officers entered the house with weapons drawn and ordered the defendant to drop the knife. The defendant placed the knife on a nearby counter, but remained within reach of the knife\u2014continuing to alternate looking at the officers and the knife. The defendant refused to comply with the officers\u2019 repeated directions to walk backward away from the knife. At that point, one officer sprayed the defendant with pepper spray and he began to scream <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>and thrash around as they attempted to handcuff him. The defendant continued to curse and kick at the officers until one struck him on the back of the calf with a police baton. The defendant then became physically compliant and was transported to the police station.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> On cross-examination, the defendant admitted disobeying the officers\u2019 directions as they executed the arrest warrant.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">During the proceedings, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the criminal trespass charges, contending that: (1) with respect to the charge based on the restraining order, the court should construe the restraining order as limited to six months; and (2) the state had produced insufficient evidence with respect to the charge based on his mother\u2019s statement that he was banned from the house. The state opposed the motion. The trial court denied the motion with respect to the restraining order personally communicated to the defendant, concluding that there was sufficient evidence to create a jury question, but granted the defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal with respect to the trespass charges based on the restraining order. The trial court concluded that \u201cespecially since it is an element of the crime I don\u2019t believe that there actually was a valid restraining order outstanding. There was a restraining order outstanding, but I don\u2019t believe it was a valid one, so I am going to grant a judgment of acquittal as to that count of criminal trespass.\u201d Thereafter, the defendant presented his defense, and the jury convicted him of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>one count of criminal trespass in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-107 (a) (2), and two counts of interfering with an officer in violation of \u00a7 53a-167a (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">After the jury\u2019s verdict was received, the trial court gave the defendant an option with respect to the scheduling of sentencing. He conferred with standby counsel and elected to be sentenced that same day. The state, citing the defendant\u2019s record of twenty prior criminal convictions, asked the court to impose the maximum possible sentence on all counts of three years. The defendant expressed his remorse for the effect of his actions on his family, and stated his desire to move on with his life. The trial court noted that imposing a consecutive sentence on the interfering with an officer counts might raise double jeopardy implications because they arose from the same conduct; see also part III of this opinion; and that the maximum available sentence was, therefore, two years. In discussing the various purposes of sentencing, the trial court discussed the defendant\u2019s criminal history and his history of psychological and substance abuse problems, and encouraged him to seek help.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The trial court discussed the defendant\u2019s conduct that gave rise to the charges, and sentenced him to a split sentence of two years, suspended after twenty months, followed by three years of probation with counseling as directed by probation, and an order to stay away from his mother and her home. The trial court determined that it wanted to keep some controls on the defendant after his release from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>prison in order to provide him with a behavioral incentive and ensure that he is seeking the help he needs. The sentence ran consecutive to the defendant\u2019s sentence for probation violation, which had concluded the day after the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Having reviewed the proceedings on these criminal charges, we conclude that the record demonstrates no manifest injustice requiring reversal under the plain error doctrine. First, the plea negotiations could not have colored the factual determinations because a jury was the fact finder, and, in any event, the facts were not discussed during plea negotiations. See footnote 4 of this opinion. Indeed, the defendant consented affirmatively to the trial court\u2019s presiding over the trial, despite the trial court\u2019s concerns with respect to the arrest warrant. Furthermore, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal with respect to the restraining order-based trespass charges, which was a decision that was different from the judge\u2019s preliminary assessment of the case during plea negotiations. See footnote 4 of this opinion. Moreover, during the trial, the court constantly was solicitous of the defendant by: (1) sua sponte offering him a break when he became upset while questioning his mother about his deceased father; (2) providing him with tissues and water when he became upset while testifying about the events that gave rise to his trespassing arrest; (3) explaining why it was permissible for the prosecutor to question him about the September, 1999 incident with his mother that gave rise to a restraining order; and (4) providing guidance with respect to various points of procedure, such as opportunities for rebuttal and the conduct of closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Moreover, although the trial court would have been better advised not to have commented at sentencing about the \u201creasonable disposition\u201d that previously had been offered to the defendant; see footnote 33 of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>opinion; the totality of the record demonstrates that the defendant received a fair trial and a reasonable sentence, both of which were not colored by judicial vindictiveness.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The trial court did not sentence the defendant to a maximum term of incarceration, but fashioned a thoughtful sentence that considered the defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history while maintaining an opportunity for the defendant to obtain mental health and substance abuse services in a structured, court supervised setting. Accordingly, the Appellate Court improperly concluded that it was plain error requiring reversal for Judge Clifford to preside over the defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">ALTERNATE GROUND FOR AFFIRMANCE: WHETHER THE DEFENDANT KNOWINGLY AND INTELLIGENTLY WAIVED HIS RIGHT TO COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The defendant posits, as an alternate ground for affirming the judgment of the Appellate Court, a claim that he proceeded pro se without making a knowing and intelligent waiver of his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel. Specifically, the defendant contends that the trial court, <em>Fischer, J., </em>did not adequately canvass him pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 44-3<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> on Feb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>ruary 27, 2002, and that the defendant was, therefore, deprived of the assistance of counsel during plea bargaining and trial preparation. The defendant concedes that he did not raise this claim before the trial court, and requests review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The state argues in response that both the February 27, 2002 canvass and the record as a whole demonstrate that, notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s failure to comply strictly with the prophylactic requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 44-3, the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel nevertheless satisfied the constitutional requirement that the waiver be knowing and voluntary. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, but we agree with the state that the defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel satisfied constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The record reveals the following additional facts and procedural history. In December, 2001, the trial court, <em>Fischer, J., </em>appointed a public defender to represent the defendant in both the criminal and probation violation matters. At proceedings conducted in January, 2002, the defendant expressed to the trial court, <em>Gordon, J., </em>his desire to represent himself, and to be placed on the speedy trial list. The trial court discussed the defendant\u2019s wish with him, ordered a competency examination pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>continued the matter.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Thereafter, on February 27, 2002, the trial court, <em>Fischer, J., </em>reviewed the competency report and found the defendant competent to represent himself.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The defendant reiterated his desire to proceed pro se, and to have the public defender withdraw from representing him. The trial court ascertained the degree of the defendant\u2019s education, warned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>him of the risks of proceeding pro se, and permitted the public defender to withdraw.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The trial court then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>granted the defendant\u2019s request and continued the matter to March 20, 2002, so that the defendant could complete research on his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">We begin with the applicable standard of review. We review the trial court\u2019s determination with respect to whether the defendant knowingly and voluntarily elected to proceed pro se for abuse of discretion. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Bangulescu, </em>80 Conn. App. 26, 43, 832 A.2d 1187, cert. denied, 267 Conn. 907, 840 A.2d 1171 (2003). Recognizing the constitutional implications attendant to <em>Golding </em>review, we do not review the proceedings for strict compliance with the prophylactic rule of Practice Book \u00a7 44-3, but rather for evidence that the waiver of counsel was made knowledgeably and voluntarily. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 429, 680 A.2d 147 (1996) (\u201cThe defendant, however, does not possess a constitutional right to a specifically formulated canvass. His constitutional right is not violated as long as the court\u2019s canvass, whatever its form, is sufficient to establish that the defendant\u2019s waiver was voluntary and knowing.\u201d); <em>State v. Gethers, </em>193 Conn. 526, 540, 480 A.2d 435 (1984) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>(\u201c[o]nce it is determined that there has been a constitutionally valid waiver of counsel, a defendant cannot be denied his right to try his own case simply because of some insubstantial nonconformity with [Practice Book \u00a7 44-3]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">\u201cThe right to counsel and the right to self-representation present mutually exclusive alternatives. A criminal defendant has a constitutionally protected interest in each, but since the two rights cannot be exercised simultaneously, a defendant must choose between them. When the right to have competent counsel ceases as the result of a sufficient waiver, the right of self-representation begins. . . . Put another way, a defendant properly exercises his right to self-representation by knowingly and intelligently waiving his right to representation by counsel. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>233 Conn. 813, 821, 661 A.2d 539 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">\u201cPractice Book \u00a7 [44-3] was adopted in order to implement the right of a defendant in a criminal case to act as his own attorney .... <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>[supra, 193 Conn. 532]. Before a trial court may accept a defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel, it must conduct an inquiry in accordance with \u00a7 [44-3], in order to satisfy itself that the defendant\u2019s decision to waive counsel is knowingly and intelligently made. <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 822. Because the \u00a7 [44-3] inquiry simultaneously triggers the constitutional right of a defendant to represent himself and enables the waiver of the constitutional right of a defendant to counsel, the provisions of\u00a7 [44-3] cannot be construed to require anything more than is constitutionally mandated. Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>211 Conn. 215, 220, 558 A.2d 669 (1989); <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Gethers, </em>supra, 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">\u201c[A] defendant need not himself have the skill and experience of a lawyer in order competently and intelligently to choose self-representation .... <em>Faretta </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number><em>California, </em>[422 U.S. 806, 835, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975)]. Rather, a record that affirmatively shows that [he] was literate, competent, and understanding, and that he was voluntarily exercising his informed free will sufficiently supports a waiver. Id.; <em>[State v. </em>Gethers], supra, [193 Conn.] 536. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 827-28. The nature of the inquiry that must be conducted to substantiate an effective waiver has been explicitly articulated in decisions by various federal courts of appeals. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cash, </em>47 F.3d 1083, 1088 (11th Cir. 1995) (court must inform defendant of charges, included offenses and possible range of punishment); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hurtado, </em>47 F.3d 577, 583 (2d Cir. 1995) (factors determining valid waiver include whether defendant understood that he had choice between proceeding pro se and with assigned counsel, understood advantages of having trained counsel, and had capacity to make intelligent choice) [cert. denied, 516 U.S 903, 116 S. Ct. 266, 133 L. Ed. 2d 188 (1995)]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Van Krieken, </em>39 F.3d 227, 229 (9th Cir. 1994) (defendant must be aware of nature of charges against him, possible penalties and disadvantages of self-representation) ....</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">\u201cNone of these authorities, however, stands for the proposition that a defendant must be specifically informed of the particular elements of the crimes charged before being permitted to waive counsel and proceed pro se. In fact, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stated that perfect comprehension of each element of a criminal charge does not appear to be necessary to a finding of a knowing and intelligent waiver. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>913 F.2d 712, 715 (9th Cir. 1990) [cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1104, 111 S. Ct. 1006, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1089 (1991)]. A discussion of the elements of the charged crimes would be helpful, and may be one of the factors involved in the ultimate determination of whether the defendant understands the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>nature of the charges against him. A description of the elements of the crime is not, however, a sine qua non of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights in this context. Indeed, in our cases we have approved of a defendant\u2019s assertion of the right to proceed pro se in a case in which the record did not affirmatively disclose that the trial court explained the specific elements of the crimes charged to the defendant as long as the defendant understood the nature of the crimes charged.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>237 Conn. 633, 654-57, 678 A.2d 1369 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">\u201cThe multifactor analysis of \u00a7 [44-3], therefore, is designed to assist the court in answering two fundamental questions: first, whether a criminal defendant is minimally competent to make the decision to waive counsel, and second, whether the defendant actually made that decision in a knowing, voluntary and intelligent fashion. ... As the United States Supreme Court recently recognized, these two questions are separate, with the former logically antecedent to the latter.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 822-23. Inasmuch as the defendant\u2019s competence is uncontested, we proceed to whether the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the defendant made the waiver decision in a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Although the transcript of the February 27, 2002 canvass does not itself adhere strictly factor-by-factor to Practice Book \u00a7 44-3, we conclude that the record demonstrates that the defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel was knowing and voluntary.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Judge Fischer advised the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>defendant repeatedly of his right to the assistance of counsel, and the advisability of retaining an attorney given the disadvantage he would face relative to the trained prosecutor. See Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 (1) and (4); see also footnote 39 of this opinion. Indeed, Judge Clifford reiterated those admonitions during the plea negotiations. See footnote 4 of this opinion. Moreover, Judge Fischer relied properly on the competency report and his discussion with the defendant with respect to the defendant\u2019s high school education and community college law courses in determining that the defendant \u201c[possessed] the intelligence and capacity to appreciate the consequences of the decision to represent oneself . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 (2). The record also demonstrates substantial compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 (3), namely, whether the defendant \u201c[comprehended] the nature of the charges and proceedings, the range of permissible punishments, and any additional facts essential to a broad understanding of the case . . . .\u201d The trial court reasonably relied on the competency report; see footnote 38 of this opinion; for the defendant\u2019s comprehension of the charges and proceedings, as well as the defendant\u2019s awareness and understanding of procedural devices such as speedy trial motions. See <em>State v. Bangulescu, </em>supra, 80 Conn. App. 46 (trial court properly relied on competency report describing defendant\u2019s awareness of pending charges and possible penalties, as well as his defense strategy and his \u201cadequate understanding of the nature of judicial proceedings as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>well as the roles of the courtroom personnel and courtroom procedures\u201d). Indeed, we also note that the defendant cited, without prompting, the charges pending against him in the initial January colloquy during the pretrial proceedings before Judge Gordon. See footnote 37 of this opinion.

Accordingly, the defendant asks for the convictions to be combined into a single conviction pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Chicano, </em>216 Conn. 699, 724-25, 584 A.2d 425 (1990), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1254, 111 S. Ct. 2898, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1062 (1991). The state, relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>40 Conn. App. 601, 672 A.2d 969, cert. denied, 237 Conn. 918, 676 A.2d 1374 (1996), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Lytell, </em>206 Conn. 657, 539 A.2d 133 (1988), contends in response that the two convictions are valid because each charge was directed to different officers and different conduct. This claim was not raised before the trial court, and we review it pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. See also footnote 36 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">\u201cDouble jeopardy analysis in the context of a single trial is a two-step process. First, the charges must arise out of the same act or transaction. Second, it must be determined whether the charged crimes are the same offense. Multiple punishments are forbidden only if both conditions are met.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Chicano, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 706. \u201cIt is well settled that [t]he proper double jeopardy inquiry when a defendant is convicted of multiple violations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>the same statutory provision is whether the legislature intended to punish the individual acts separately or to punish only the course of action which they constitute. ... As we noted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>198 Conn. 92, 109, 503 A.2d 136 (1985), the issue, though essentially constitutional, becomes one of statutory construction. We have recently interpreted a number of criminal statutes to determine the same issue: whether the legislature intended to allow punishment for two separate violations of the same statutory provision. ... In these cases, we found that the pivotal question was whether the statutes defined crimes against the individual persons.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lytell, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 665-66; see also id., 667 (upholding two convictions for single robbery of two victims because \u201cthe plain language of [General Statutes] \u00a7 53a-133 clearly mandates punishment for each and every robbery of each and every person, irrespective of whether the robbery was spatially linked with another robbery\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim is controlled by the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 40 Conn. App. 602-603, wherein three police officers attempted to apprehend a defendant as the suspect in an attempted carjacking. \u201cThe defendant pushed two officers away and attempted to flee. All three officers pursued the defendant until [Officer R] tackled the defendant. The defendant struggled with the three officers and attempted to grab [Officer R\u2019s] gun. During the struggle, [Officer R] sustained a painful cut on his elbow. At some point during the struggle, [Officer N] informed the defendant that he was under arrest. While being taken to a police vehicle, the defendant, by wrapping his legs around a signpost, further hindered [Officer N]. [Officer N] and [Officer R] forcibly removed the defendant from the post and placed him in the police vehicle. Once inside the vehicle, the defendant repeat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>edly struck his head against a window.\u201d Id., 603. The defendant was convicted of, inter alia, interfering with an officer and assault of a peace officer. Id., 602. The Appellate Court concluded that, although interfering with an officer is a lesser included offense of assault of a peace officer, the two separate convictions did not violate the double jeopardy clause because, although \u201cthe charges arose out of the same transaction, the sole issue is whether the crimes constitute the same offense.\u201d Id., 611. The Appellate Court followed this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Lytell, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 666, noting that \u201c[w]here crimes against persons are involved, a separate interest of society has been invaded for each violation. Therefore when two or more persons are the victims of a single episode there are as many offenses as there are victims.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 612. The court stated that the statutes used the word \u201cofficer\u201d in the singular, and quoted <em>Lytell </em>for the proposition that \u201cthere is no indication that the defendant can get a bargain rate . . . when two officers are involved.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 613, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Lytell, </em>supra, 667. The court concluded that the interfering with an officer and assault of a peace officer statutes, therefore, \u201cauthorize punishment for separate violations against each officer, regardless of whether the violations were spatially linked.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In the present case, the information charged and the defendant was convicted of two violations of \u00a7 53a-167a (a), that while arising from the same general series of events, indeed within minutes of each other, nevertheless were based on two distinct acts involving different officers: (1) refusing to surrender peacefully when he was told by telephone that the officers had an arrest warrant for him; and (2) refusing the order to walk away from the knife toward the officers and kicking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>and thrashing during the arrest. See also part I D of this opinion. Accordingly, we follow <em>Jenkins andLytell, </em>and we conclude that the defendant\u2019s constitutional protections against double jeopardy were not violated.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The judgments of the Appellate Court are reversed, and the cases are remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgments of the trial court in case SC 17096 and case SC 17095.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">In this opinion BORDEN, PALMER, VERTEFEUILLE and ZARELLA, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b683-4\"> In appeal Docket No. SC 17095, we granted the state\u2019s petition for certification limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly reverse the judgment of violation of probation and the ensuing imposition of sentence on the basis of plain error?\" <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Antonio, </em>266 Conn. 930, 837 A.2d 803 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In appeal Docket No. SC 17096, we granted the state\u2019s petition for certification limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly reverse the judgments of conviction on the basis of plain error?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Antonio, </em>266 Conn. 930, 837 A.2d 803 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The appeals were briefed separately, but were argued together before this court.

I\u2019m the one who sentenced you originally, right? You\u2019ve got [thirty] months, suspended after [twenty-four] months, correct? You\u2019ve got two [violation of probations] which basically you owe six months on that. You\u2019ve got a trespass one where you can get up to a year; interfering you can get up to a year. Your exposure is two and a half years. You understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes.

Let me just say this, sir. I know you are representing yourself. You know, violation of probation, with all due respect, you don\u2019t\u2014 they\u2019re not that hard to prove.

You\u2019re not even in front of a jury. It\u2019s in front of a judge. If the judge finds you in violation, bingo, you\u2019ve got six months.

I don\u2019t know what it means. Put this over for a hearing then.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: We can put the [violation of probation] down for a hearing. Start there. The other two cases\u2014start there. If we lose that or win that, fine, move on to the trial. Start with the [violation of probation].</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">\u201cThe Court: When do you want to have a hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b687-14\">\u201c[The Defendant]: As soon as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-15\">\u201cThe Court: All right.

This court rejected the defendant\u2019s claims, concluding that the trial court\u2019s statements that: (1) it only would accept a plea agreement without a sentencing recommendation; and (2) stated the procedure for disposing of probation violation charges against the defendant in the event of a guilty plea on the burglary charges, did not amount to participation requiring disqualification.

The defendant argues similarly with respect to states that have adopted procedural rales governing judicial participation in plea negotiations that are different from Connecticut\u2019s. These are, however, distinctions without a difference, because the risks attendant to judicial participation in plea negotiation are the same, regardless of the degree to which such participation is prohibited or permitted in a jurisdiction. Trial court adherence to the prophylactic rules governing participation in plea bargaining has the salutary effect of eliminating or minimizing those risks, as well as removing another arrow from the defendant\u2019s appellate quiver. Adherence or departure does not, however, alter the key inquiry, namely, whether the record discloses the realization of those risks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b705-6\"> Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure governs pleas, and provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Entering a Plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">\u201c(1) In General.

In <em>Fitzgerald, </em>the defendant was charged with driving while intoxicated in a two part information because, with two prior convictions for the same offense, \u201che was subject to the enhanced penalty provisions of [General Statutes] \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3).\u201d Id., 108. \u201cThe defendant was charged in a two part information according to the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 36-14, formerly \u00a7 619. Part A of the information charged the defendant with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Part B of the information charged the defendant with two previous convictions of the same offense.\u201d Id., 108-109. Prior to the commencement of a bench trial, the prosecutor improperly revealed to the trial court, the existence of the part B information in violation of Practice Book \u00a7 37-11. Id., 109-110. Thereafter, the defendant was convicted and the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. Id., 109. The Appellate Court had concluded that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s statement regarding the part, B information tainted the case and constituted plain error requiring a new trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>54 Conn.

Our review of the record reveals that any harm caused by the improper disclosure did not in any way undermine the validity of the guilty verdict. The trial court found that the evidence presented in the case sufficiently satisfied the state\u2019s burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Our careful review of the evidence supports this conclusion. Also we cannot conclude, as a finding of plain error requires, that the prosecutor\u2019s comment implicates the public confidence in our judiciary. Finally, we find nothing in the record that leads us to conclude that the trial court\u2019s verdict was unreliable or that it constituted a manifest injustice to the defendant.\u201d Id., 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In so concluding, we stated that \u201c[t]he Appellate Court should have reviewed the record to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial\u201d; id., 112; and we concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in that respect. Id., 112-13. We noted that on the facts of the particular case, posttrial comments demonstrated that the trial judge had forgotten about the prosecutor\u2019s comments, and that we could not conclude that, \u201cin the total absence of illicit motivation or biased judicial behavior, the prosecutor\u2019s comment here amounts to an error requiring a new trial.\u201d Id., 113. We held that, \u201c[o]n the facts of this case, the prosecutor\u2019s comment before the court appears to be more of a technical violation of the rules of practice rather than a substantive deprivation of the defendant\u2019s right to an impartial fact finder.\u201d Id., 114-15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b714-6\"> We discuss briefly the defendant\u2019s reliance on the Appellate Court\u2019s decisions in <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 884, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 175. We begin with <em>Washington, </em>a probation violation case, which we conclude is distinguishable on its facts because, in that case, the trial court had: (1) made its own offer to the defendant; <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 177; and (2) made comments during plea bargaining \u201cindicating the judge\u2019s prehearing belief that the defendant was probably engaged in illegal activities [that] along with the implicit notion of guilt associated with the offers, cast serious doubt on the court\u2019s impartiality.\u201d Id., 180; id., 179-80 (referring to \u201c \u2018probably illegal\u2019 \u201d reasons for defendant\u2019s possession of a beeper). Moreover, in <em>Washington, </em>the trial court made intemperate remarks to the defendant prior to sentencing him after finding him in violation of probation. Id., 181 (in addition to longer sentence than was offered, trial court reneged on plea bargain offer to allow defendant to get his affairs in order before starting sentence, and stated that \u201c \u2018[rjemember you had a chance to just get rid of everything and you did not, which was very foolish\u2019 \u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that <em>Washington </em>is distinguishable from the present case on its facts, and was, as a paradigmatic example of the appearance of judicial vindictiveness that is contemplated by the <em>Niblack </em>rule, a proper candidate for plain error reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The Appellate Court decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 884, is vastly closer to the present case than is <em>Washington. </em>In <em>Falcon, </em>the Appellate Court followed <em>Washington </em>and concluded that it was plain error for the trial court to preside over the defendant\u2019s trial after having participated in plea bargaining negotiations held more than two years earlier, a fact which none of the participants appeared to remember at the time of trial. Id., 889. The Appellate Court concluded that \u201cactual prejudice is not required,\u201d and that \u201cthe existence of impartiality might reasonably be questioned and the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceeding affected when a court presides over the trial and sentencing after participating actively in plea negotiations.\u201d Id., 889. Beyond a posttrial sentence greater than was offered during plea bargaining, the Appellate Court did not cite any examples of apparently biased conduct by the trial court. Accordingly, to the extent that the Appellate Court decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 884, conflicts with principles set forth in our opinion herein, it is overruled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b715-9\"> The dissent expresses concern about the dangers of judicial participation in plea bargaining, and states that \u201cwe as a reviewing court can neither indulge a presumption of regularity nor necessarily evaluate the resulting harm\u201d because, \u201c[i]n orderto evaluate with any degree of confidence whether <em>the </em>concerns associated with active participation in plea bargaining by the judge responsible for the trial have indeed materialized, the proceedings in their entirety would have to be open for inspection.\u201d The dissent then notes that, \u201conly one side of the equation is open for inspection\u201d because pretrial proceedings generally are not part of the record. We agree with the dissent\u2019s concerns with respect to the inherent impossibility of properly reviewing unrecorded proceedings, but we conclude that they simply are <em>not </em>a factor in the present case because the trials and the plea bargaining session at issue are entirely on the record, which is adequate for appropriate appellate review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b715-10\"> We discuss briefly the defendant\u2019s claim, as an alternate ground for affirming the judgment of the Appellate Court, that the trial court\u2019s failure to follow the <em>Niblack, </em>rule is a due process violation reviewable pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. <em>239-40. </em>We reaffirm our prior conclusions that the <em>Niblack </em>rule is not, by itself, constitutional in nature. See, e.g., <em>Safford </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 190-91. We acknowledge that the risks managed by the <em>Niblack </em>rule relate to the constitutional requirement that a defendant receive a trial before a court who, at the very least, appears free of bias.

But as far as deciding whether you violated the condition of probation, I know that the condition I put on you was substance abuse screening, evaluation and treatment as recommended by probation. That is clear from the exhibits that have been submitted. I don\u2019t disagree that there\u2019s nothing\u2014I didn\u2019t specifically put a condition of any anger management counseling, although I think probation has that inherent authority, especially when one of the conditions was [that] you do not assault, threaten or harass your mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">\u201cBut I\u2019m not concerned about that. I\u2019m more concerned about the fact that you just refused to do the inpatient treatment. I think it\u2019s a\u2014you were convicted as a third [driving while intoxicated] offense. You received a very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>serious sentence obviously, [thirty] months suspended after [twenty-four] months. And I think that was a reasonable condition of the probation by me for any substance abuse evaluation and treatment as necessary, and to me that does include inpatient if that\u2019s what is deemed appropriate. And it sounds like based on their meeting with you, based on the counselor\u2019s interview with you, the apparent admission that you had been drinking, with that history they certainly felt with that situation, the type of case it was, that you should be doing inpatient. So, I think that was a reasonable request.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">\u201cI feel if you differed with that, then maybe you could have filed a modification or come back before this court to attempt to modify your probation, but that\u2019s not exactly what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">\u201cSo I do find based on the reliable and probative evidence that was supplied here, based on a fair preponderance of the evidence that you did violate that condition by not complying with the inpatient treatment that was inherent in my general order of probation of substance abuse evaluation, treatment and testing as deemed appropriate. So I do believe and I am finding that you did violate that probation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\"> The trial court recited the defendant\u2019s convictions since 1991 of interfering with an officer, failure to appear, trespass, breach of the peace, disorderly conduct, driving while intoxicated, and operating a vehicle with a suspended license.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b721-6\"> The court explained to the defendant: \u201cI don\u2019t know if some of these things require testimony.

The state, however, contends in this court that the February 27, 2002 canvass satisfies constitutional standards, particularly when viewed in the context of the prior proceedings and the competency report. We will review the state\u2019s arguments because the Appellate Court decisions did not reach the waiver of counsel issue. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>229 Conn. 529, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>536 n.5, 643 A.2d 1213 (1994) (declining to permit state to modify its concession before Appellate Court that jury instruction was improper when Appellate Court decision under review relied on that concession, and issue was whether Appellate Court should have applied harmless error analysis). Accordingly, because our focus is on the February 27, 2002 canvass, which satisfied constitutional requirements, we also find the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>State </em>v. <em>Cohens, </em>62 Conn. App. 345, 352, 773 A.2d 363, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 918, 774 A.2d 139 (2001), misplaced, because that decision merely held that a defendant was deprived of the right to counsel when the trial court did not obtain his waiver until the second day of jury selection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b736-9\"> We discuss briefly the defendant\u2019s claim that his choice was not a knowledgeable one because the trial court improperly failed to inquire at the February 27,2002 canvass as to whether the defendant wanted a different appointed attorney. We conclude that this claim lacks merit, as this defendant, who was not shy about asserting his rights while proceeding pro se, did not ask the trial court for substitute counsel at any time, instead emphasizing his desire to proceed pro se. Moreover, it is well settled that \u201ca criminal defendant does not have the right to have the public defender of his choice.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Oliphant, </em>47 Conn.

In reversing the judgments of conviction rendered against the defendant, Louis D\u2019Antonio, and remanding the cases for a new trial, the Appellate Court reasoned that \u201c[t]he record discloses that during the plea negotiations, the [trial] court itself understood that it had participated actively in such a way as to make clear that a different judge would necessarily preside over the defendant\u2019s trial and sentencing. Although it seems unlikely, on the basis of the record, that at the time of the trial, the court recalled the nature of its previous involvement, we need not find, nor do we find, actual bias or prejudice on the part of the court. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Because the court presided over the trial and sentencing after having participated actively in plea negotiations, the appearance of a fair trial was lost.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Antonio, </em>79 Conn.

The Appellate Court, therefore, concluded \u201cthat the existence of impartiality might reasonably be questioned and the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceeding affected when a court presides over the trial and sentencing after participating actively in plea negotiations. In this case, the appearance of a fair trial has been lost and a new trial is warranted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Antonio, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 696; <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Antonio, </em>supra, 79 Conn.

If plea discussions ultimately do not result in a plea agreement, the trial of the case is assigned to a second judge who was not involved in the plea discussions and who is unaware of the terms of any plea bargain offered to the defendant. The judge responsible for trying the case also is responsible for sentencing the defendant in the event the defendant is convicted after trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Revelo, </em>256 Conn. 494, 508 n.25, 775 A.2d 260, cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1052, 122 S.

Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>although we recognize that pretrial or plea negotiations play a critical role in the criminal justice system, and the disposition of charges after plea discussions is highly desirable; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Revelo, </em>supra, 505; we also recognize that the legitimacy of that process and the integrity of the trial immediately become suspect when both proceedings are conducted by the same judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Thus, this court previously has recognized that \u201c[cjanon [3 (c) (1)] of the Code of Judicial Conduct <em>requires </em>a judge to disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned. The reasonableness standard is an objective one. Thus, the question is not only whether the particular judge is, in fact, impartial but whether a reasonable person would question the judge\u2019s impartiality on the basis of all the circumstances. . . . Even in the absence of actual bias, a judge must disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned, because the appearance and the existence of impartiality are both essential elements of a fair exercise of judicial authority.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 460-61, 680 A.2d 147 (1996).

I agree with the Appellate Court, however, that, in light of canon 3 (c), the trial court\u2019s conduct necessarily gives rise to a circumstance in which \u201cthe existence of impartiality might reasonably be questioned and the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceeding affected . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Antonio, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 710; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 889. Accordingly, I would conclude that harmless error analysis is inappropriate because the trial judge\u2019s failure to disqualify himself constituted a structural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">\u201cStructural [error] cases defy analysis by harmless error standards because the entire conduct of the trial, from beginning to end, is obviously affected .... These cases contain a defect affecting the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply an error in the trial process itself. . . . Such errors infect the entire trial process . . . and necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair .... Put another way, these errors deprive defendants of basic protections without which a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence . . . and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>271 Conn. 724, 733-34, 859 A.2d 533 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">\u201cWhen the error undermines the structural integrity of the tribunal, no review for harmless error or prejudice to the defendant need be made. Such an error can never be harmless and automatically calls for reversal and a new trial. See <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967). For example, an automatic reversal is required when the judge has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>a financial interest in the outcome of a trial despite the lack of any indication that his bias affected the outcome; <em>Tumey </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>273 U.S. 510, 535, 47 S. Ct. 437, 71 L. Ed. 749 (1927); or when there is a systematic exclusion from a grand jury of blacks; <em>Vasquez </em>v. <em>Hillery, </em>474 U.S. 254, 263-64, 106 S. Ct. 617, 88 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986); or when a defendant has been denied the assistance of counsel; <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 76, 62 S. Ct. 457, 86 L. Ed. 680 (1942); or when inherently adverse publicity has tainted the trial; <em>Sheppard </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>384 U.S. 333, 351-52, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L.

These cases do not involve trial error occurring during the presentation of the case to the jury but involve extrinsic factors not occurring in the courtroom. Nor do they require any showing of prejudice to the defendant. These cases recognize that violation of some constitutional rights, such as the right to a trial by an impartial jury, may require reversal without regard to the evidence in the particular case. This type of structural error renders a trial fundamentally unfair and is not susceptible to a harmless error analysis; see <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>478 U.S. 570, 577-78, 106 S. Ct. 3101, 92 L. Ed. 2d 460 (1986); or an analysis based on prejudice to a defendant.

A harmless error analysis presupposes a trial at which a defendant is represented by counsel, and evidence and argument are presented in the courtroom before an impartial judge and jury. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, 578. When a structural error analysis is undertaken and such an error exists, the proceeding is vitiated. See <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante, </em>[499 U.S. 279, 309-310, 111 S. Ct. 1246, 113 L.

Among \u201c[t]hose dangers are that (1) the trial judge\u2019s impartiality may truly be compromised by his [or her] own perception of a personal stake in the agreement, resulting in resentment of the defendant who rejects [the judge\u2019s] suggested disposition, (2) the defendant may make incriminating concessions during the course of plea negotiations, and (3) the trial judge may become or appear to become an advocate for his [or her] suggested resolution.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Revelo, </em>supra, 506 n.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">In light of such dangers, when error calls into question the objectivity of those charged with bringing a defendant to judgment, we as a reviewing court can neither indulge a presumption of regularity nor necessarily evaluate the resulting harm. Although we have a record of the trial proceedings, pretrial proceedings usually are conducted off the record and in the defendant\u2019s absence, and plea bargains that are rejected generally are not made a part of the record. Therefore, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>deciding whether the defendant can demonstrate the harm, only one side of the equation is open for inspection. In order to evaluate with any degree of confidence whether the concerns associated with the active participation in plea bargaining by the judge responsible for the trial have indeed materialized, the proceedings in their entirety would have to be open for inspection. Because they are not, the legitimacy of the process is called into question. Accordingly, this defect involves the framework of the proceedings, and I am not prepared to indulge in presumptions of fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Finally, I recognize the weight of authority to the contrary, but I am not persuaded. I fear that the path those jurisdictions follow ultimately could lead to an absolute ban on judicial participation in plea negotiations that the federal courts impose to ensure the appearance of judicial impartiality. See footnote 2 of this dissenting opinion. In my view, the value of having trial judges participating in plea negotiations is too great to risk such a remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">I recognize that, in the vast majority of cases, we require defendants whose rights have been violated during the course of a trial to make a specific showing of harm or prejudice. To do that in this case, however, would undermine the very purpose and nature of the structural error doctrine because the defect, in and of itself, by virtue of canon 3 (c), renders the trial process suspect.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cThe broad injunction against the \u2018appearance of impropriety\u2019 relates to the entire spectrum of judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>conduct. That no unethical or untoward act may occur is implicit in the canon\u2019s emphasis on \u2018appearance.\u2019 The conduct under scrutiny must therefore be evaluated from the perspective of the \u2018eye of the beholder.\u2019 <em>In the Matter of Lonschein, </em>50 N.Y.2d 569, 572, 408 N.E.2d 901, 430 N.Y.S.2d 571 (1980). Avoiding the appearance of impropriety is as important to developing public confidence in the judiciary as avoiding impropriety itself.\u201d <em>In re </em>Dean, 246 Conn. 183, 198, 717 A.2d 176 (1998). For this reason, because structural errors are defects affecting the trial\u2019s entire framework, \u201c[e]rrors of this magnitude are per se prejudicial and require that the underlying conviction be vacated.\u201d <em>Lainfiesta </em>v. <em>Artuz, </em>253 F.3d 151, 157 (2d Cir. 2001), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Lainfiesta </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>535 U.S. 1019, 122 S. Ct. 1611, 152 L. Ed. 2d 625 (2002); see also <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>508 U.S. 275, 280-81, 113 S. Ct. 2078, 124 L. Ed. 2d 182 (1993) (harm resulting from erroneous jury instruction on definition of reasonable doubt impossible to quantify because court can only speculate what properly charged jury might have done); <em>Vasquez </em>v. <em>Hillery, </em>supra, 474 U.S. 263-65 (harm resulting from racial discrimination in grand jury cannot be quantified because impossible to know whether decision to indict would have been assessed same way by properly constituted grand jury); <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 49 n.9, 104 S. Ct. 2210, 81 L. Ed. 2d 31 (1984) (harm resulting from denial of right to public trial unquantifiable because benefits of public trial are intangible, virtually impossible to prove); <em>State </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>254 Conn. 472, 497-99, 757 A.2d 578 (2000) (harm resulting from improper substitution of alternate juror for excused juror after deliberations had begun impossible to quantify because court cannot ascertain whether jurors would be capable of disregarding prior deliberations and receiving potentially nonconforming views of alternate juror).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">I agree with the Appellate Court that, \u201c[b]ecause the court presided over the trial and sentencing after having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>participated actively in plea negotiations, the appearance of a fair trial was lost.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>D'Antonio, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 708. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b741-6\"> I am somewhat confused by the majority opinion in this case, which essentially determines that the defendant\u2019s claim is subject to plain error review, but not reversal. \u201c[T]he plain error doctrine, which is now codified at Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 ... is not ... a rule of reviewability. It is a rule of <em>reversibility. </em>That is, it is a doctrine that this court invokes in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial court, nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment, for reasons of policy.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>251 Conn. 285, 343 n.34, 743 A.2d 1 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 841, 121 S. Ct. 106, 148 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2000). In addition, the plain error doctrine \u201cis reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. . . . Plain error is a doctrine that should be invoked sparingly. ... A party cannot prevail under plain error unless it has demonstrated that the failure to grant relief will result in manifest injustice.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Toccaline, </em>258 Conn. 542, 552-53, 783 A.2d 450 (2001). \u201cImplicit in this very demanding standard is the notion, explained previously, that invocation of the plain error doctrine is reserved for occasions <em>requiring </em>the reversal of the judgment under review. \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirk R., </em>271 Conn. 499, 507 n.14, 857 A.2d 908 (2004); id. (\u201cbecause the defendant\u2019s claim does not mandate a reversal of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>court\u2019s judgment, the present case is not an appropriate occasion in which to invoke the plain error doctrine\u201d). As I state in this dissenting opinion, the defendant\u2019s unpreserved recusal claims not only should be reviewed, but the judgments also must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Because I dissent to part I of the majority opinion and would affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court, I do not address the defendant\u2019s alternate grounds for affirming the judgment of the Appellate Court discussed in parts II and II of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b742-8\"> In recognition of the potential for undue pressure, \u201cmany jurisdictions bar judges from active participation in plea negotiations.\u201d <em>State </em>v.

By reaching the question of whether the trial court in this case committed \u201cper se plain error requiring reversal,\u201d the majority implicitly has concluded that the waiver provisions of \u00a7 51-39 are inapplicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b747-8\"> I further recognize that we treat structural error as constitutional error not subject to a harmless error analysis and that the error in this case is not constitutional. I nevertheless conclude that, because the nature of the defect involves consequences that are necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate, the impropriety of presiding over the defendant\u2019s probation revocation hearing, his trial and his sentencing after having participated actively in plea negotiations with the defendant unquestionably qualifies as structural error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
