She made an observation up and down Clinton avenue and saw no automobiles approaching. Again, as she was on the point of crossing the street she made a further observation. She then progressed, on the cross-walk, to the middle of the street between the car tracks where she was struck by an automobile owned and driven by the defendant. Plaintiff\u2019s course, expressed in terms of the direction in which defendant was driving, was from right to left, and her point of contact was at the left front headlight of the car. The defendant was driving at a \u201cpretty fast\u201d speed and had just passed another automobile which was traveling at a speed of twenty to twenty-five miles per hour. Although there was a large electric street light at the cross-walk, defendant did not observe the plaintiff until the automobile was about to hit her. &gt;</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">We think that a jury question was clearly presented and that the court\u2019s rulings were therefore without error.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Defendant also complains that the court charged the jury in the words of two requests presented by the plaintiff. The alleged fault is not that there was an erroneous statement of the law but that the evidence would not support a finding by the jury in that regard. The charges were impersonal. They consisted of abstract propositions of law and were pertinent to the issues. They present no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
