The judgment entered by the District Court upon that finding was rendered July 24th, 1935, in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant David Beloff, and it is from this judgment that David Beloff appeals. (See state of case, page 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">It further appears from the state of the case as settled by the trial judge that on July 25th, 1935, the defendant Beloff applied for and obtained a rule to show cause why a new trial should not be granted upon the grounds, among others, (1) \u201cthat said verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence;\u201d and (2) \u201cthat the said plaintiff has failed to establish a cause of action against the defendant.\u201d That rule was heard and was discharged. The defendant seems to contend that the rule was not discharged; but that contention is contrary to the fact. The state of the case shows (page 13) that the judge \u201con this 31st day of July, 1935, ordered that the rule to show cause entered herein on the 26th day of July, 1935, be discharged; and it is further ordered that the restraint therein contained be lifted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Now it will be noted that the defendant stated in his rule to show cause as reasons, that the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence and that the plaintiff has failed to establish a cause of action against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Upon examination we find that the specifications of determination as grounds of <em>appeal </em>are substantially the reasons stated and argued at the hearing of the rule to show cause before the trial court. This, therefore, precludes the defendant from now arguing on appeal any ground embraced in these reasons. Such specifications are <em>res adjudicata </em>and cannot be made the basis of appeal. <em>Cleaves </em>v. <em>Yeskel, </em>104 <em>N. J. L. </em>497; 141 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>814.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">In such situation the appeal must be dismissed, with costs, and such will be the order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
