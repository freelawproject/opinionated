The case was properly submitted to the jurjr, and the issues of negligence and contributory negligence were for them. <em>McPherson </em>v. <em>Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Co., </em>100 <em>N. J. L. </em>262; 127 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>23; <em>affirmed, </em>101 <em>N. J. L. </em>410; 128 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>231. Suffice it to say, that it clearly appears from the proofs that after the plaintiff had boarded the defendant\u2019s train the door was suddenly closed before she could reach a place of safety. The door caught her left hand causing the injuries of which she complained. She was carrying a large bundle which made it necessary to enter sideways.</p>\n<p id=\"An6\">Judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
