Under the obligation imposed by the burden of proof of guilt our conclusion is that upon the proofs taken before the judge of the Common Pleas Court on appeal (heard by him <em>de novo </em>under chapter <em>29 </em>of the laws of 1935, <em>N. J. Stat. Annual </em>1935, \u00a7 *136-1603a) a finding in favor of the defendant was properly made.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">A fact to challenge immediate attention is that the offenses, if committed at all, were committed nearly two years before the charges were made. Conviction, if justified, must rest substantially upon the testimony of a fellow officer named Bell and an illicit liquor dealer named Brown. Both of these men possessed in the fall of 1933 all the knowledge they claimed to have when testifying in 1936. Why Officer Bell should have kept the information to himself if he believed that the crime of bribery had been committed is not explained. Under these circumstances we conclude that the charges, specifically denied by the respondent, were not sustained and the judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
