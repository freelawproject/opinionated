Blunt, 114 <em>N. J. L. </em>85; 176 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>105. That case construed chapter 81 of the Pamphlet Laws of 1923, <em>Cum. Supp. Comp. Stat., p. </em>3904, \u00a7 **236-92 <em>et seq., </em>as follows: \u201cThe phrase \u2018compensation due for the two disabilities separately/ necessarily connotes that the disabilities are compensable. In other words, the seeming legislative purpose was to grant to the employe who is totally disabled by reason of the combined disabilities of two unrelated accidents, each producing disability compensable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation act, the compensation for total disability prescribed by the act, without imposing upon the employer a greater burden than that ordained by the statute for the disability proximately resulting from the last accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">In view of that decision, we can only conclude that the determination of the commissioner was proper. Relator\u2019s ease may not be distinguished from the facts in that case simply because both accidents from which he suffered occurred in industry. The first accident was not compensable because the Workmen\u2019s Compensation act had not then been enacted. Hence, he was entitled to nothing under the act of 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">A prior improper determination of a question by a public official gives rise to no rights by estoppel or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">The application will be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
