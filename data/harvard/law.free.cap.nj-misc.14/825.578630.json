Many municipal officers and employes will be necessary witnesses. The plaintiffs will be obliged to establish their case by calling a number of medical witnesses resident in Camden. Since the cost and inconvenience to the public must be considered, there is more than a mere inconvenience in requiring the defendant to appear in this suit at Camden, the county seat - of Camden county. <em>Keeley </em>v. Belmar, 97 <em>N. J. L. </em>98; 116 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>273; <em>Hesselbrock </em>v. <em>Burlington County, </em>111 <em>N. J. L. </em>177; 168 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>45.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">The venue should be changed to the county in which the cause of action arose. A rule to that effect may be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
