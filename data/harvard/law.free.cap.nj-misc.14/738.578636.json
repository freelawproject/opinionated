L. </em>1934, <em>p. 258; N. J. Stat. Annual </em>1934, \u00a7 56-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">The challenged resolution, in substance, recites the charge as aforesaid; that prosecutor was served with the complaint; that the cause was presented to the board on stipulation of facts, but does not set forth the facts so stipulated, and merely finds prosecutor \u201cguilty as charged in the complaint,\u201d and revokes his license to practice dentistry in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">We are met, <em>in limine, </em>both on the oral and written argument, with objection to the record. It is argued for the prosecutor that the challenged resolution is fatally defective in that it does not contain a statement of the evidence upon which the revocation was based. That is so. <em>Sawicki </em>v. <em>Keron et al., </em>79 <em>N. J. L. </em>382; 75 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>477; <em>Marter </em>v. <em>Repp et al., </em>80 <em>N. J. L. </em>530; 77 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>1030; <em>affirmed, </em>82 <em>N. J. L. </em>531; 81 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>1134; <em>O\u2019Driscoll </em>v. <em>Scott et al., </em>12 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>516; 172 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>797; <em>Freudenreich </em>v. <em>Borough of Fairview (Court of Errors and Appeals, </em>1934), 114 <em>N. J. L. </em>290, 292; 176 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>162.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Thus a decision of the question whether the board acted within the purview of the statute in confining the hearing to a consideration of the revocation only of prosecutor\u2019s license, and properly ignored the consideration of the suspension of his license; or, whether the provision of the act of 1934, supra, is unconstitutional will have to await the presentment of these questions in a proper record.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The challenged resolution is set aside, but without costs. <em>Board of Tenement House Supervision </em>v. <em>Schlechler, </em>83 <em>N. J. L. </em>88; 83 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>783.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
