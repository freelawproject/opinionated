GENERAL FINANCE COMPANY, RESPONDENT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b723-4\">Submitted May 15, 1936</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AGk\">Decided September 10, 1936.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b723-7\">Before Justices Pabkbk, Lloyd and Donges.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b723-8\">For the prosecutor, <em>Tucker &amp; Tucker.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b723-9\">Por the respondent, <em>Joseph M.

The testimony on the rule disclosed that in the case (which was an action in attachment to recover moneys claimed to have been improperly paid to get an automobile back and for loss of money and other property due to the action of the defendant in taking possession as plaintiff claims improperly) on the return day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>when the ease was called for trial the - defendant\u2019s attorney disclosed to the attorney of the plaintiff that the plaintiff had executed a full release to the defendant on its claim; that plaintiff\u2019s attorney recognized this as proper and agreed to discontinue the action and the record was so marked in pencil, and that defendant\u2019s counsel then left the court room. Instead of doing as he had agreed in open court, plaintiff\u2019s counsel then proceeded to prove his claim and obtained judgment. The court is certainly not powerless to correct the injustice and it was so held in <em>Geithner </em>v. Paechiana, 8 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>384; 150 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>240.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The order is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
