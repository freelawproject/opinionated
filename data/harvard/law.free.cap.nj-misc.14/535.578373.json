At the time of his appointment an ordinance had been adopted on January 9th, 1936, under which the building department and the office of building inspector were vested in the director of parks and public property. In pursuance of that ordinance prosecutor was, on May 25th, 1936, appointed building inspector by Commissioner McMahan, who was the director of parks and public property.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">It appears that the prosecutor had been building inspector for some years prior to the last election of commissioners. He was, however, dismissed before the last election of commissioners by the then director of parks and public property in charge of the building department. He sought a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to review that dismissal and the writ was denied by Chief Justice Brogan on May 2d, 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">All this notwithstanding, it is now urged for the prosecutor- that the board of commissioners were without authority or power to adopt the challenged resolution of May 19th, 1936. The alleged lack of authority or power is rested upon the contentions that the commissioners could not, under the law, effect the change from one department to the other, as aforesaid, and, at all events, it could not be effectuated by a resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>The contentions are without merit. Section 4 of the Walsh act provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c* * * The Board of Commissioners <em>shall </em>determine the powers and duties to be performed by each department and <em>shall assign such powers and duties </em>to such <em>departments as they in their judgment deem, appropriate </em>* * <em>Pamph. L. </em>1930, <em>p. </em>996, <em>ch. </em>221; <em>Cum. Supp. Comp. Stat. </em>1925-1930, <em>p. </em>1271, \u00a7 **136-8, <em>subdiv. </em>4. This evinces a clear legislative mandate; its words are imperative. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>City of Orange, </em>91 <em>N. J. L. </em>554; 103 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>743. The ordinance operating on the construction urged for prosecutor would prevent the board of commissioners from carrying out the absolute obligation imposed upon it under the act. Such a construction is untenable. (See <em>State of New Jersey, ex rel. Orre et al., </em>v. <em>Roosma et al., </em>14 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>529, wherein Circuit Court Judge Wolber reviews the cases on the point here involved.) Nor is the contention that the redistribution of powers could not be effected by resolution sound. It is, of course, true that under the Home Buie act <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1917, <em>ch. </em>152) an office must be created by ordinance. <em>Toomey </em>v. <em>McCaffrey, </em>116 <em>N. J. L. </em>364; 184 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>835. Obviously, that question is not in this case. What the <em>certiorari </em>seeks to review is not Pieken\u2019s right to office. It merely seeks to review the resolution of May 19th, 1936, by which the building department including the office of building inspector were removed from the department of parks and public property to the department of public works. It was clearly within the power and authority of the respondent to make the change in the manner employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The rule is discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
