She claimed that she had a contract, made in July, 1930, for wages at the rate of $80 per month, afterwards reduced, by agreement, to $75 per month, which sum was paid until July, 1932. Plaintiff testified that on or about July 4th, 1932, Mrs. Jewett told plaintiff that her husband \u201chad suffered financial reverses and cannot pay regularly now but when things pick up we will settle;\u201d that thereafter she received chocks for various sums covering a fifteen mouths period, amounting in all to $785. During the first ten months, from August, 1932, to and including May 1st, 1933, she received $345 and claimed the difference, at the rate of $75 per month. Plaintiff further testified that she spoke to Mr. ,Jewett some time in April, 1933, \u201cabout the money\u201d and he replied, \u201cI have no money now. I have given you as much as T possibly could always.\u201d \u201cI hope to be able to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>you again regular wages when I can.\u201d \u201cI will take care of this matter.\u201d Mrs. Jewett, on July 12th, 1933, handed plaintiff a check for $40, and said, \u201cthis is to make up for the back months in which you did not get your full wages.\u201d In October, 1933, Mrs. Jewett told plaintiff \u201cwe will have to reduce .you again to $70 a month,\u201d and plaintiff agreed to the reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Mrs. Jewett testified that she told plaintiff that her husband had suffered financial reverses; that Mr. Jewett could no longer pay plaintiff any wages, and that plaintiff could stay on, without wages, for her board and lodging as long as she desired to stay, or she could find another position whenever she wanted or was able, and that plaintiff assented to the arrangement. She testified to the conversation between plaintiff and Mr. Jewett, that Mr. Jewett said to plaintiff, \u201cI have always given you as much as I could. I hope soon to be able to pay you regular wages again, but I can\u2019t now. I have no money now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The testimony presented a question of fact and, so far as the record discloses, no questions of law were raised for the determination of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The testimony warranted the conclusion of the trial judge, and the judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
