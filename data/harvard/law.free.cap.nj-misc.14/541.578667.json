L. </em>1914, <em>ch. </em>49, <em>p. </em>75; <em>Cum. Supp. Comp. Stat. </em>1911-1924, <em>p. </em>359, \u00a7 35-13; <em>Pamph. L. </em>1929, <em>ch. </em>293, <em>p. </em>683; <em>Cum. Supp. Comp. Stat. </em>1925-1930, <em>pp. </em>209, 210, \u00a7\u00a7 35-14-15-17. The note was made and delivered on June 9th, 1928, and, concededly, the transaction was within the statute referred to. The plaintiff\u2019s license to transact business under that statute expired on Pebruary 15th, 1930, and on the 18th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>of the following month its corporate name was changed as indicated in the title. Thereafter it collected interest at the rate stipulated in the contract; and the District Court judge held that appellant\u2019s \u201cacceptance of interest,\u201d after the expiration of its license, \u201cat the rate permitted by the Small Loan act * * *, and its charge of interest thereafter at such rate, constituted doing business after the expiration of its license;\u201d and that \u201cthe operation of such business after the change of its name * * *, in the absence of the statutory license, was conduct by a corporation not licensed\u201d under that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">In so holding, the judge fell into palpable error. As to the first ground, see <em>Continental Finance Corp. </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>10 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>607. And it is obvious that, for like considerations, the mere change of corporate name did not create such disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion; costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
