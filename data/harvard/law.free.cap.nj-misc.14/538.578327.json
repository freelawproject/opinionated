L. </em>1921), amended by chapter 171, <em>Pamph. L. </em>1931 (operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor). He was sentenced to pay a fine of $200 and costs and his driver\u2019s license was revoked. On August 18th, 1935, relator was allowed a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to review that conviction. Pending determination of the writ, respondent placed relator\u2019s name on what is eharac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>terized as the permanent prohibitory list of drivers, due to the fact that relator was a second offender by reason of a prior conviction (section 14, chapter 171, <em>Pamph. L. </em>1931, <em>p. </em>368; <em>N. J. Stat. Annual </em>1931, \u00a7 135-63, 14, (3). On September 18th, 1935, the <em>certiorari </em>proceedings were discontinued. On September 19th, 1935, the recorder set aside the conviction of August 6 th, 1935. The case was retried. We are told that for the first time relator was represented by counsel and his witnesses were heard. Eelator was acquitted and the complaint against him was dismissed. He then made application for the return of his license on the ground that the revocation thereof was without sufficient cause. The application was denied. The return admits, in the main, the material averments of the writ. Eelator demurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In justification of respondent\u2019s refusal, the single point is made that the recorder was without jurisdiction to change, alter or open his decision when, as here, a mandatory penalty is fixed for the violation under the Motor Vehicle act.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Chapter 171, <em>Pamph. L. </em>1931, <em>pp. </em>376, 377, \u00a7 25, <em>subdiv. </em>1, \u00b6 3; <em>N. J. Stat. Annual </em>1931, \u00a7 135-76, 25 (1), If 3 of the Motor Vehicle act, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\u201cIn any proceeding instituted pursuant to the provisions of this act, except w'here a mandatory penalty is fixed herein, the magistrate is authorized and empowered, after conviction or after a plea of guilty or non-vult, to suspend the imposition or execution of sentence, and also to place the defendant on probation * *</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">It is undoubtedly true that a conviction for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor carries with it a mandatory penalty. But obviously a conviction is <em>sine qua non; </em>it is a condition precedent to the resultant penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">It will be observed that no attack is made on the merits upon which the recorder set aside the conviction. Eespondent\u2019s argument is tantamount to the contention that once there is a conviction the penalty for which is fixed, the recorder, the judge of the court, is without power to do any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>thing about it. If that be sound it follows that no matter how convinced a judge may be that he reached an erroneous, illegal or void result he is powerless to remedy or correct it. Such a contention is contrary to all fundamental principles of justice. On the rights of a judge with reference to erroneous, void or voidable judgments' compare <em>Westfield Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Court of Common Pleas, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>86; 178 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>546; <em>affirmed, </em>116 <em>N. J. L. </em>190; 183 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>165; <em>Dorman </em>v. <em>Usbe Building and Loan Association, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>337; 180 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>413; <em>Wardell </em>v. <em>Warshofsky, </em>10 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>519; 159 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>694.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The court did not merely \u201csuspend the imposition or execution of [its prior] sentence.\u201d It set aside the judgment. When that judgment fell the resultant penalty necessarily fell with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Nor is it made to appear that the revocation by respondent of relator\u2019s license was made \u201cafter due notice in writing\u201d as required by chapter 49, <em>Pamph. L. </em>1934, <em>p. </em>136; <em>N. J. Stat. Annual </em>1934, \u00a7 135-55, 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">In fine, let it be further marked that section 25 of the Motor Vehicle act, <em>supra, </em>evinces a legislative policy merely concerning punishment; it does not purport to, nor does it in fact in anywise abridge or curtail the inherent right and power of courts over their judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The demurrer is sustained. Peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>is awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
