In opposition to the motion the plaintiff swore to <em>twenty-five </em>witnesses in the county of O., <em>ten </em>of whom were attorneys and counsellors at law, but omitted to answer the matters specially set forth in the defendant\u2019s affidavit. <em>Held, </em>that the motion should be granted.</headnotes>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b509-10\"><em>J. Edwards, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARJ1\">moved to change the venue from Oneida to Chenango county, on an affidavit that the defendant had <em>twenty </em>witnesses in the latter county. The affidavit further stated that the action was brought to recover attorney and counsel fees in several suits conducted by the plaintiff while he lived in the county of Chenango, and that if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>plaintiff should claim to have more than one witness [naming him] in the county of Oneida, they could only he material for the purpose of proving the value of the services for which the plaintiff sought to recover, which might as well be proved by witnesses residing in Chenango.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b510-5\"><em>W. McCall, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZe\">read the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit, stating that he had <em>twenty-fine </em>witnesses in Oneida, but saying nothing about that part of the defendant\u2019s affidavit which was special. It appeared that <em>ten </em>of the witnesses mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit were attorneys and counsellors at law.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b510-6\"><em>By the Court, </em>Bronson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVH\">As the plaintiff has given no answer to the matters specially alleged in the moving affidavit, he has virtually admitted that ten of his witnesses in Oneida are only material for the purpose of proving the value of his services as an attorney and counsellor at law, which fact can as well be proved by witnesses residing in Chenango where the services were rendered. If those ten witnesses are deducted, as we think they should be, there will then be the greatest number of witnesses in Chenango.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
