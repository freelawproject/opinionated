Finn sued out a writ of replevin against the plaintiffs in this suit, which was executed by one of the coroners of the city and county of New-York, Acker being sheriff. The usual bond was given to the coroner, executed by Finn and two sureties. Judgment -was rendered in favor of the defendants in that suit for the sum of $2891,16 damages and costs, and, after failing to collect the amount by execution, they procured an assignment of the bond from the coroner and commenced the present action against the obligors. The defendants demurred to the declaration, specifying for cause, among other things, that the coroner was not authorized by law to assign the bond, and that the suit should have been brought in his name. The plaintiffs joined in demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-10\"><em>M. T.
