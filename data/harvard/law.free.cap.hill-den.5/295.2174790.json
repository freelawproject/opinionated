There had been a previous trial of the prisoner under the same indictment, followed by a disagreement of the jury. OneBlackman was sworn at the first trial as a witness for the people; and, he having since removed from the state, the district attorney proposed to give in evidence his former testimony. ' The prisoner\u2019s counsel'objected; but the court received the evidence. Exception. The jury rendered a verdict of guilty; whereupon judgment was stayed, and the proceedings brought to this court by certiorari, pursuant to 2 <em>R.

But if the rule were otherwise in respect to civil cases, we are of opinion that it should not be applied to criminal proceedings. This was expressly adjudged in <em>Finn </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth, </em>(5 <em>Rand. </em>701, 708.) It was there said by Brockenbrough, J, that even the <em>death </em>of the witness would not, in a criminal case, be allowed as a reason for receiving his former testimony; <em>(and see 2 Ev. Poth. </em>229; 1 <em>Tenn. Rep. (Overt.) </em>229;) though a different opinion was intimated in <em>Crary </em>v. <em>Sprague, (12 Wend. </em>44, 5.) It is not now necessary, however, to decide that point, the present case being one of mere absence from the territorial jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">New trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
