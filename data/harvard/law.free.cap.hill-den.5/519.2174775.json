These defects were supplied by a further notice, given after the lapse of more than ten days from the filing of the writ of error, and after papers for this motion had been served.

But now, the writ of error issues from this court, and we have the same control over it as we have over our own writs and process in other cases. The notice is, to quash the writ, or <em>for such other rule or order </em>as the court may think proper to grant;<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and if there is any dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>ficulty in <em>quashing </em>the writ, it may be <em>superseded. (Ferguson </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>12 <em>Wend. </em>241.) We think, however, that either order may he made.

S. </em>597, \u00a7 34.) This means filing in the court to which the writ is directed. The notice served Within the ten days was not sufficient; hut as the defect has now been supplied, I think the writ should be allowed to stand on payment of the costs of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b519-12\"> As to the effect of this clause in a notice of motion, see <em>Barstow </em>v. <em>Randall and others, (ante, p. </em>518.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
