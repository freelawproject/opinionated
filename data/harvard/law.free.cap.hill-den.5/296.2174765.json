L. of </em>\u201932, <em>p. </em>189, \u00a7 4, instead of giving security, and, after the time for appealing had expired, the circuit judge revoked the order; <em>held, </em>that the party was precluded from prosecuting his appeal, though the revocation was granted on an <em>ex parte </em>application.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-10\">Motion to strike cause from calendar, made on Friday of the second week of term. The defendants having obtained a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>verdict at the circuit, the plaintiff moved the circuit judge for a new trial, which was denied. On the 17th of October, 1842, due notice of the depisipn was served upon the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, who, on the 20th of the same month, obtained from the circuit judge an order staying proceedings, with a view to an appeal. <em>(/See /Sess. Laws of </em>1832, <em>p. </em>189, \u00a7 4.) Notice of the order was served on the defendant\u2019s attorney within the time prescribed by the 81st general rul.e of the court. After the time for appealing had expired, viz. on the 9th of March, 1843, the circuit judge revoked the order staying proceedings upon an <em>ex parte </em>application of the defendant\u2019s attorney, who thereupon gave notice of the revocation to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and entered up judgment. Without any further proceedings on the part of the plaintiff, his attorney noticed the cause for argument at the present term, and caused the same to be placed upon the calendar.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-5\"><em>S. W. Jones, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQT\">insisted that the revocation of the order staying proceedings annulled the right of prosecuting the appeal, and that the cause should therefore be stricken from the calendar.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-6\"><em>N. Hill, Jun., </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aj_\">contended that the only effect of the revocation was to give the defendant the right of entering up judgment and collecting the same by execution. The appeal having been duly, made in pursuance of the statute, the right to prosecute it could not be taken away by the circuit judge, especially on an <em>ex parte </em>application.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b297-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AGu\">The statute <em>(/Sess. Laws of </em>1832, <em>p. </em>189, 14) prescribes two modes of appealing from the decision of the circuit judge, viz. by giving security, and by obtaining an order to stay proceedings. If the party choose to adopt the latter mode, he must do so at the peril of losing his right to prosecute the appeal on a revocation of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
