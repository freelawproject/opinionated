Johnson arrested the defendant on a warrant issued by the inspectors of election of the city of Utica for interrupting the proceedings at the election by disorderly conduct in the presence of the inspectors. (1 R. <em>S. </em>137, \u00a7 37.) The warrant was regular and sufficient upon its face. The defendant resisted the officer, and for that assault he was indicted. The defendant offered to prove that he had not been in the presence or hearing of th'e inspectors at any time during the election, and <em>that Johnson knew it. </em>The court excluded the evidence, and the defendant was convicted. He now moved for a new trial on \u00e1 bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b440-7\"><em>W.

The knowledge of the officer that the inspectors had no jurisdiction is not important. He must be governed and is protected by the process, and cannot be affected by any thing which he has1 heard or learned out of it. Thete are some <em>dicta </em>the othef way; but we have held on several occasions that the officer is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>protected by process regular and legal upon its face, whatever he may have heard going to impeach it.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">And without hearing <em>T. </em>Jenkins, (district attorney,) who was to have argued for the people,</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">New trial denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\"><em> </em>See <em>Webber and Hand </em>v. <em>Gay, </em>(24 <em>Wend, </em>485;) <em>also Watson </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>(9 <em>Conn.
