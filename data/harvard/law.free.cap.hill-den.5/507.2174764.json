Accordingly, in this case, we affirmed the judgment of the justice\u2014that being the judgment which we thought the C. P. should have rendered. Had the C. P. given that judgment, the right of Dunham to $20 costs would have followed as a matter of course, and without any special order of the court. <em>(Sess. Laws </em>of 1840, p. 332, \u00a7 12.) In perfecting a judgment in this court for his costs in the C. P., Dunham has only followed out the consequences of-affirming the judgment of the justice. He has got nothing more than what the court below should have awarded to him. He was not entitled to any costs in this court; <em>(Sess. Laws of </em>1836, p. 794, \u00a7 2;) and none were included, in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
