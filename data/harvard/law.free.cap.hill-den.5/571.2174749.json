The title to the property last mentioned being disputed, and claimed by a third person, it was replevied at his suit. While the replevin was pending, and after the return day of the fi.fa., the plaintiff discovered other property belonging to the defendant <em>Buckle; </em>whereupon a second <em>fi. fa. </em>was issued and the property of Buckle seized under it, the first <em>fi.fa. </em>being not yet returned but kept running in order to its final execution should the suit in replevin fail. The second <em>fi. fa. </em>was endorsed the same as the first in respect to the amount directed to be levied and collected. There had been no sale under the first, <em>fi.fa., </em>nor was the property seized under it of sufficient value to satisfy it, but fell much short. Buckle was the principal debtor in the judgment, the other defendants being sureties; and the delay to sell the books and furniture of Beek<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>man was .at his instance.

The rule is very strongly expressed in several cases cited on the argument. No qualification has been allowed, and none should be except in a case of necessity. I do not see any necessity in the present case. \u2022 The plaintiff delayed a sale as to one defendant, at his request and for his accommodation. ' He might have sold the goods and returned the execution with ordinary diligence in time to issue the second one. That can scarcely be called a necessity which he has himself voluntarily created. Then as to the necessity of retaining the execution as a justification against the replevin; its return-would have detracted nothing from its force as a justification, n.or would it have taken from the sheriff, the power to sell on the goods being returned. He might have returned the seizure and replevin,, which would have shown a part execution; and the goods might have, been afterwards disposed of in virtue of a <em>venditioni expon.as, as </em>in the ordinary case of a return that fio purchasers can be obtained. <em>(Tidd, </em>1020, <em>Am. ed. of </em>1840 ;<em>Bing. On Judgm. &amp;c. </em>262, 3.) The rule laid down in <em>Clerk </em>v. <em>Withers, </em>(1 Salk. 323, 2 <em>Ld. R. </em>1074, <em>S. C.,) </em>is, that where tire sheriff returns not sold for want of buyers, a <em>venditioni </em>goes if he be still in office ; if he be out, he is still bound to sell the goods; and may be distrained and compelled' to do so by <em>distringas </em>to the newsheriff This shows that no power is taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>away from the sheriff by his return of a case which precludes an immediate sale. It may be more convenient to the plaintiff if we allow the sheriff to retain the first j/t. <em>fa. </em>while the plaintiff proceeds to another; but this does not form a ground of exception. The motion must be granted with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
