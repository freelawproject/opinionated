P. Van Cott sued Harriott in the court below in trespass <em>da bonis, </em>and the case was this: Harriott brought an action in the marine court of the city of New-York against one Bailey as the maker and Van Cott as the endorser of a promissory note. The suit was commenced by long summons, which was served on Van Cott more than six days before the return day, and on Bailey less than six days before the return day. Van Cott resided in the county of Kings, and Bailey in the city of New-York. As the summons had not been served upon the latter in due time, Harriott discontinued the action as to him, and took judgment against Van Cott, who did not appear. An execution on the judgment was levied upon Van Cott\u2019s goods, and for that taking he brought this action of trespass. The C. P. decided that the marine court did not acquire jurisdiction, for the reason that Van Cott, being a nonresident, should have been sued by short summons, and consequently that trespass would lie against Harriott. A verdict and judgment having passed for Van Cott, Harriott brought error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-9\"><em>N. B. Blunt, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2I\">said the justice had jurisdiction to issue a long summons as the first process for the commencement of a suit, and although not the appropriate process in this particular case, the justice acquired jurisdiction, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>trespass would not lie. The question was decided in <em>Hoose </em>v.

He is not protected by the judgment if the process was irregular and the defendant did not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\"><em>Blunt </em>then said, the justice acquired jurisdiction, and the judgment was valid, for the reason that Van Cott was sued with Bailey, who, as a resident of New-York, was liable to be proceeded against there by long summons.
