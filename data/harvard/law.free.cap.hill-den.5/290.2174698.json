Judge, at the New-York circuit, in July, 1841. The declaration contained the common counts and concluded .by claiming <em>one thousand dollars </em>damages. The defendant pleaded <em>no\u00f1-assumpsit. </em>He afterwards interposed a plea, averring that, <em>since the last continuance </em>&amp;c., to wit, on &lt;fcc., he paid to the plaintiffs <em>the several sums of money mentioned in the declaration. </em>The plaintiff replied, taking issue. On the trial, the defendant, who held the affirmative of the issue, proved that the plaintiff were the holders of a promissory note against him amounting to $535, and that he paid the same .on the day mentioned in the plea. The circuit judge held this a complete defence, no evidence of any further claim being given by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel excepted. The jury rendered a verdict in favor of the defendant ; and the plaintiffs now moved for a new trial on a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b290-9\"><em>A. Crist, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVy\">By pleading <em>puis, </em>the defendant waived his previous plea, and there thus being no general issue in the case, the defendant was bound t\u00f3 prove that he had paid the whole amount of damages laid in the declaration, .</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b290-10\"><em>J. S. Carpentier, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b290-11\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ALP\">No doubt the general issue was'waived by the plea <em>puis. </em>But although* the plea of payment in assumpsit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>admits some damages, it does not admit the whole amount laid ip the declaration, any more than a default or demurrer. If the defendant had given no evidence under his plea, the plaintiffs would have been entitled to a verdict for six cents; but they could not have got more without proving that they had a larger demand. When the defendant proved that he had paid $535, it was for the plaintiffs to show that they had a further claim before they could have a verdict. It would have been so if the defendant had proved the payment of a single dollar.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The defendant has pleaded payment in the usual form. He \u2022 was only bound to prove the substance of the issue. That does not depend on the form of words.' The substance of the issue was, that the plaintiffs had been paid their debt or demand. On proving the payment and acceptance of any sum of money, the burden was thrown on the plaintiffs of showing that their whole debt was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">New trial denied.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b291-7\"> See <em>Cowen Hill's Notes to Phill.
