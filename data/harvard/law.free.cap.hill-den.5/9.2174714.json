But when the cause has not been noticed by the party who is to furnish the papers, the other party must show, in his affidavit for the motion, that he has noticed the cause for argument. When he states that fact, it is not necessary that he should add that the cause is on the calendar.\" It is enough that it appears upon the calendar at the time the motion is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b10-6\">Motion granted.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b10-7\"><em> </em>See <em>Rules Sup.
