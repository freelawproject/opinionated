Judge. The action was for -words charging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the plaintiff with having committed perjury in. testifying upon the trial of a cause before a justice. Plea, the general issue, with notice of justification and former recovery. The plaintiff had previously obtained- a verdict against the defendant for a like charge in relation to the same testimony; and, in opening the cause to the jury, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated, among other things, that the obj\u00e9ct of the present action was to recover damages for a repetition of the charge since the former trial! After proving the testimony given by the plaintiff before the justice, the witness called for that purpose was asked what he had heard the. defendant say in respect to the plaintiff\u2019s having committed perjury, &amp;c. The-circuit- judge-thereupon remarked that, as he understood the opening of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, it was confined to words spoken since the former trial, and the witness could not therefore be allowed to speak of other words. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel replied that he must have been misunderstood by the judge, but, in order to correct all misapprehension upon the point, proposed to explain or modify his opening so as to include any words spoken- since the commencement of the former suit, but before the trial thereof, provided they came within \u25a0 the pres-' ent declarationand he accordingly offered evidence of such words. The circ\u00fait judge refused to allow a modification of the opening, and rejected the evidence offered. The trial progressed, but the plaintiff failed to establish his case under the limitation prescribed by the judge, and a nonsuit was therefore ordered. The plaintiff now moved for a new trial on.a case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AHh\"><em>N.

They relate to instances where the discretion of the circuit judge has been exercised in confining a party to the case made by his <em>proof. </em>Here the party, <em>before </em>characterizing his case by proof, disclaimed any intention of confining his right of recovery to words spoken since the first trial, and the offered evidence was rejected on the sole ground of its not being consistent with the <em>opening. </em>We think the discretionary power which a judge has in controlling proceedings at the trial does not extend so far.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">New trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
