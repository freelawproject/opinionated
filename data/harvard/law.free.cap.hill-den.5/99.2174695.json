L. </em>\u201941, <em>p. </em>137,) is not to be construed as operating a general repeal of the twenty-fourth section of the act of 1830; but merely as creating an exception of certain cases arising since the passage of that act.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-8\">Error <em>to </em>the New-York C. P., where the defendants in error sued the plaintiff in error in debt to recover the penalty given by the 26th section of the \u201c act to amend the acts heretofore passed for the prevention of fires in the city of New-York,\u201d passed April 20th, 1830. (Ness. <em>Laws of </em>1830, <em>pp. </em>349, 352.) The 24th section of the act provides that it shall not be lawful for any person or persons to have or keep any quantity of gunpowder exceeding twenty-eight pounds in weight, in any one house, store, &amp;c. in the city of New-York, to the southward of a line running through the centre of Fourteenth street, &amp;c. The 26th section imposes a penalty of .$125 for every .hundred pounds of gunpowder kept in violation ,of the above provision, and in that proportion for a greater or less quantity. The second section of the act of 1841, (Ness. <em>Laws of </em>1841, <em>p. </em>137,) authorizes any person dealing in gunpowder in the city of New-York to receive and keep it in his store for a time not exceeding two hours in any one day \u00abfee., for the purpose of packing &amp;c.; but not in any quantity exceeding five quarter-casks at any one time. On the trial in the court below it appeared that., on the 12th of September, .1840, the-fire-wardens of the city of NewYdrk found at the\u2019Store of.-the, defendant, a liquor merchant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>within the prohibited district, twenty-five kegs of powder each containing twelve and a half pounds. The powder had been in the store but fifteen minutes, and was in process of packing for shipment to Mobile when the wardens seized it, a cart being then at the door for the purpose of taking it to the vessel. The court below charged the jury that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover, and the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted. Verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs. The defendant sued out a writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b100-5\"><em>Brady &amp; Maurice, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXM\">insisted, 1. That the 24th section of the act of 1830 ought not to be so construed as to make a party liable for having or keeping powder in his store, unless placed there for <em>sale, </em>on <em>deposit </em>or <em>storage ; </em>and that the act did not apply to a case like the present, where the powder was in the store for the mere purpose of repacking and shipment in the ordinary course of mercantile business. 2. That if the act were susceptible of the construction contended for by the defendants in error, it would be unconstitutional, as interfering with the exclusive power of congress over commerce between the several states. 3. That the 24th section of the act of 1830 was repealed by the 2d section of the act of 1841.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b100-6\"><em>C. T. Cromwell, </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b100-7\"><em>By the Court, </em>Cowen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Al\">It is supposed that the words, \u201cit shall not be lawful for any person or persons to have or keep any quantity of gunpowder,\u201d &amp;c., <em>(Laws of </em>1830, <em>p. </em>352, \u00a7 24,) do not extend to the act of receiving it into the store of the defendant below for the purpose of being packed and sent to Mobile for sale, the labor of packing being prosecuted with diligence, and the whole transaction in good faith. The provision that no person shall <em>have </em>powder in his store, dec., is, however, too plain to be got over. It comprehends every act of possession, whether for the immediate purpose of removal or not, if such possession be in a store or other building or place, except indeed when the powder is on its passage in the street secured in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>maimer provided for in the 29th section of the same act. In the common phrase, the defendant <em>had </em>the powder in his store. The statute declared he should <em>not have </em>it there.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The statute is a mere police regulation\u2014an act to prevent a nuisance to the city\u2014and is not, therefore, objectionable as coming ha conflict with that clause in the United States constitution which grants to congress the power of regulating commerce between the states.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">There is no ground for saying that the 2nd section of the act of 1841, <em>(Sess. Laws of </em>1841, <em>p. </em>137) operates as a general repeal of the section on which this action was brought. It merely creates an exception of cases like that in question arising after the passage of the act of 1830.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Judgment affirmed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
