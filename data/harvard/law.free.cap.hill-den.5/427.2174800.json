On the trial, the prosecutor failed to prove that the defendant had been convicted of the forgery charged; and the court instructed the jury that, notwithstanding the frame of the indictment, they might find the defendant guilty of petit larceny simply. Exception. Verdict that the defendant was guilty of the petit larceny, though not as a second offence. After judgment, the defendant brought error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-7\"><em>N.

They are <em>descriptive </em>of the second offence, being introduced to characterize and distinguish it from that species of larceny which is punishable as a mere misdemeanor; <em>(The People </em>v. <em>Youngs, </em>1 <em>Cain.

The statute as to convi\u00e9ting of an inferior degree of the offence charged, does not apply. (2 <em>R. S. </em>702, \u00a7 27.)
