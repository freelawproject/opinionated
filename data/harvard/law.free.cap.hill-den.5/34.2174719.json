Judge, at the Albany circuit in June, 1842. The bond bore date July 10th, 1840, and was conditioned to pay all such claims and demands as had been exhibited, and should be established to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>subsisting liens on the <em>steam canal boat </em>or vessel called the <em>Red Bird. </em>The bond was taken in a proceeding under the statute authorizing the attachment of ships and vessels on account of liens for work, materials, &amp;c. (2 <em>R. S. </em>493, <em>tit. </em>8.) On the trial, it appeared that the plaintiff had furnished an engine and other things to the master of the boat, for the purpose of fitting it to navigate the canal by steam. The boat was at the time in the basin at Albany. The witness had never seen it navigated except in the canal between Albany and Troy. It was a \u201ccommon <em>ordinary canal </em>boat\u201d of 40 or 50 tons burthen. The defendants moved for a nonsuit on the ground that this was not a <em>ship or vessel </em>within the meaning of the statute, which motion was denied. The plaintiff had a verdict, and the defendants now moved for a new trial on a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-5\"><em>S.

The present statute is substantially like the former ones. It only applies to ships and vessels which navigate the ocean, and such as are required to have a coasting license under the laws of the United States. If this were a new question, I should be of that opinion. In common parlance, a canal boat is not a \u201c ship or vessel.\u201d But it is enough that the question is decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">New trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
