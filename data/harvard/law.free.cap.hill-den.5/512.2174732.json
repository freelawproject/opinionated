The suit was commenced since 1840, and the declaration was in trover for divers bank notes and bank checks.

All the counts were alike, except that the conversions were laid on different days; and the plaintiffs swore that they expected to prove as many distinct acts of conversion as there were counts in the declaration. The counsel cited <em>Stante </em>v. <em>Pricket, </em>(1 <em>Campb. </em>473;) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Milles, </em>(1 <em>T. R. </em>475, 479;) A<em>tkinson </em>v. <em>Matteson, </em>(2 <em>id. </em>172, 177;) <em>Sess.

But however that may be, as the plaintiffs have not inserted more counts than they expect to prove separate causes of action, and as the costs of the declaration are no longer charged by the folio, <em>(Sess. Laws of </em>1840, <em>p. </em>328,) the defendant has no ground for complaint</p>\n<p id=\"AI7\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
