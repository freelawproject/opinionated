The indictment contained nine counts, in which the offense was variously set out \u2014 some of the counts specifying more or less of the particulars of the case,, four of them ch\u00e1rging that the defendant harbored the slave, well-knowing that she was a slave and a fugitive from service. The-first count, omitting the form of introduction and conclusion, was in these words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-12\"><em>\u201c </em>That James G-. Birney, on March 1, 1837, and for a long time* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>previous thereto, to wit, for six months, at the township aforesaid, in the county aforesaid, did unlawfully harbor and secrete a \u2022certain mulatto girl by the name of Matilda, the said Matilda then being a slave and the property of one Larkin Lawrence, contrary to the form of the statute,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-5\">The record shows that, at the trial of the cause, the counsel for the traverser excepted to four different positions ruled by the \u25a0court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-6\">1. The court ruled that it was competent for the prosecution to prove that the person harbored was the property of Larkin Lawrence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-7\">2. The court refused to charge the jury that the ordinance and \u25a0\u2022constitution of Ohio precluded the existence of slavery within her territorial limits so effectually as that no proof could be received, in her judicial tribunals, that such a condition existed in \u2022the state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-8\">3. The proof for the prosecution having shown that the alleged master of Matilda brought her, under his own charge, in a steamboat, to the Cincinnati landing, on the Ohio river, where she remained until she left it for the service of^the traverser, the court refused to charge the jury, that by the operation of the ordinance .and constitution upon the facts, Matilda became emancipated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-9\">4. The court refused to instruct the jury that it was incumbent on the prosecution to produce and prove the constitution and laws \u2022of the state, establishing the condition of slavery under which Matilda was claimed to be the slave of L. Lawrence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-10\">The jury found the traverser guilty on the first count, and not guilty on all the others. The court adjudged him to pay a fine *of $50, the utmost penalty of the law, and the costs of the suit \u2014 to reverse this judgment the writ of error was brought. The errors assigned were, the first common general assignment, that the judgment was against the plaintiff in error, when it should have been for him, and, in addition, the errors indicated \u2022by the bills of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-11\">5. P. Chase, for the plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-12\">The count, in the indictment of which the defendant was found .guilty charged that he \u201cunlawfully harbored and secreted a certain mulatto girl by the name of Matilda, then <em>being a slave and \u25a0the property </em>of one Larkin Lawrence.\u201d The act, under which the prosecution was instituted, makes it a penal offense to \u201c harbor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>or secrete any black or mulatto person,' <em>being the property </em>of any person whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-5\">I maintain that it is impossible, in Ohio, to commit the offense of harboring, or secreting a person <em>being .the property </em>of another person. I maintain that the relation of owner and property, as-existing between person and person, has, or can have, no existence in this state; and I maintain these propositions as the inevitable results of a sound interpretation of the constitution of Ohio ; and as in full harmony with every provision of the constitution, of the United States, and of the ordinance of 1787. If I can establish these propositions as 1 maintain them, it must follow that so much of this act of 1804, as inflicts a penalty for violating a relation which can not constitutionally exist, must be repugnant to the constitution, and therefore void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-6\">And, certainly, no argument is needed to prove that the relation of owner and property, as between man and man, can not exist under the constitution of Ohio. This instrument declares \u2022\u2018that all men are born <em>equally free </em>and independent, and have certain natural, inherent, and unalienable rights, among which are the enjoying and defending life and liberty; acquiring, possessing and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.\u201d It also declares as a direct consequence of these fundamental truths, \u201cthat there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in this state, otherwise than for the-punishment of crimes;\u201d and that \u201cno alteration of the constitution shall ever take place, so as to introduce slavery or involuntary servitude into this state.\u201d From these extracts, it appears,, that the one principle which the framers were especially anxious to make ^prominently conspicuous, and to surround with safeguards the most impregnable, was the <em>equal freedom of all men ; </em>and the one thing which they sought to brand with deepest reprobation, and to exclude forever from the institutions of the state, was the <em>slavery of man to man. </em>It can not be doubted, then, that were Ohio a distinct and independent nation, no such relation as owner and property could exist, as between man and man ; nor could any law, recognizing and protecting such a relation, be of the least validity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-7\">But Ohio is not a separate and independent nation. We regard the federal constitution and the ordinance of 1787, as of higher-authority than our state constitution. If these recognize this-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>relation and sanction it, state legislation may constitutionally recognize and protect it. <em>We </em>must examine, then, and endeavor to .ascertain the import of the provisions in the ordinance, and in the constitution of the United States. The provision in the ordinance is in these words \u2014 \u201c any person escaping into the same\u201d <em>(i. e. </em>the Northwest Territory) \u201cfrom whom labor or service is .lawfully claimed in any one of the original states, maybe lawfully reclaimed and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or service, as aforesaid.\u201d The provision in the federal constitution was, obviously taken from that in the ordinance, and is as follows: \u201cNo person, held to service or labor in one state, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of .any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor; but shall be -delivered up on claim of the party to whom such labor or service may be due.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-5\">In order to arrive at the true import of these provisions, it is proper to refer to the history of the country at the time when they were incorporated, first into the fundamental compact of the territory and people northwest of the Ohio with the states and people of the Union; and soon after, into that of all the states with each other. It was then acknowledged that, in some of the states, institutions existed so incompatible with slavery, that the slave who might escape into them would become a free man the moment he should enter their territory, while in other states, .slavery was recognized and protected by fundamental law and legislative enactments. This state of things is implied in the \u25a0constitutional provision just cited. Institutions must have existed in some states, by the operation of which, the servant escaping into them, was discharged from his involuntary service, for otherwise this claim would have been nugatory. And Mr. Madison, *in the course of the debates in the convention of Virginia, speaking of the condition of things then existing, says: \u201cAt present, if any slave elopes to any of those states where slaves are free, he becomes emancipated by their laws.\u201d The slaveholding states were apprehensive of the losses they might sustain in consequence of this state of things, and all dreaded its consequences to the Union. To obviate the apprehended evil, the clause, which has just been cited, was introduced into the constitution as a clause \u25a0of compact between the states, similar to the clause which had been just before inserted in the ordinance, and expressly declared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>to be a clause of compact between the original states and the people and states of the northwest territory. It was cautiously framed, so as to avoid all recognition of the condition of slavery, or the relation of ownership between man and man. It left the several states free to create, or continue, or abolish such relations between individuals within their several territories as they pleased, just as they had been under the articles of confederation. It required each state to deliver up servants escaping into its territory from other states, to their lawful masters \u2014 to deliver them up as servvants, not as slaves \u2014 far less as property. It bound each state to recognize and protect, in a particular class of cases, the relation of-master and servant, as established by the laws of sister states, but no other additional relation. It left the whole responsibility of all other relations upon the states which might establish or continue them. I am very confident that this construction exhibits the true import of this constitutional provision, and the more confident, because the very terms of the provision seem to exclude every other interpretation. For who is.to be delivered up ? Any person held to service and escaping. Are slaves and human chattels alone held to service ? Surely not. To say nothing of servvants for hire, there is the great class of apprentices who are <em>\u201c </em>held to. service\u201d in-the strictest sense of the terms, and are yet neither slaves nor property. It can not be denied that the provision embraces the case of an escaping apprentice, and if so, all argument,whether or not it recognizes property as a relation of one human being to another, must be at an end. It recognizes no such relation. On the contrary, the exact reverse of such recognition is strongly implied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-5\">Another argument that no such recognition was intended, is to be found in the statute books of that period. I refer the court especially to the statutes of Virginia. Tate\u2019s Digest, 25, 476, 491. It will be found that those statutes describe three classes *of persons held to service \u2014 apprentices, servants, and slaves; and that the right of recapture is provided for in regard to each class. It could not be said then that a statute of Virginia, providing for \"the recapture of persons held to service, would contain any recognition of the relation of property as between persons. It would only recognize a general relation which might exist, indeed, in connection with that other relation, but might also exist independ* ent of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>If I am correct in this construction of the constitution and the-ordinance, it follows that there is nothing in either which requires or authorizes the legislature of any state to pass laws for the protection of the right of property in human beings. Every purpose intended to be answered by the provisions in either instrument,, may be effectually accomplished without any such degradation of the non-slaveholding states. And if so, the provision of the act. under which this indictment was found, abhorrent as it is to the-whole spirit of our institutions, and to the exq&gt;ress provisions of our constitution, must bo void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-5\">The second question presented by the record, and the only remaining question to which I wish to call the attention of the court,, is this : Was the woman, Matilda, at the time she was employed by the defendant as a servant, the slave of Larkin Lawrence ?' Admitting, for argument\u2019s sake, the prosecution to be constitutional, was the offense, charged in'the indictment, actually committed ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-6\">Now, it is certain that slavery, wherever it exists, is a creature' of positive institutions. It has no support in natural right; ou the contrary, it is in direct derogation of natural right. Before slavery can be, natural right must be overborne by force, custom, or legislation. In the language of the highest court in Louisiana,. Lunsford <em>v. </em>Coquillon, 14 Martin, 401, \u201cthe relation of owner and. slave is, in the states of this Union, in which it has a legal existence, a creature of the municipal law.\u201d In the still more emphatic' language of the Supreme Court of Mississippi, Harvey et al. <em>v. </em>Decker and Hopkins, Walk. 36, \u201cSlavery is condemned by reason and the laws of nature. It exists, and can only exist, through municipal regulations ; and in matters of doubt, is it not an unquestioned rule, that courts must lean <em>in favorem vitos et libertatis?\u201d </em>It is also certain that the municipal regulations of no state have <em>proprio vigore, </em>any extra territorial force. \u201cThere is no doubt,\u201d says Chancellor Kent, \u201c of the truth of the general proposition,. that the laws of a ^country have no binding force beyond its own territorial limits, and their authority is admitted in other-states, not <em>ex proprio vigore, </em>but <em>ex comitate, </em>or in the language of Huberus, <em>lquatenus sine prendido indulgentia fieri potest.\u2019\u201d </em>It is. also certain that \u201cno nation is under any obligation to give effect to the laws of another nation, which are prejudicial to itself or its citizens; that in all cases each nation must judge for itself what. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>foreign laws are so prejudicial or not; and it is only in oases not so prejudicial that a spirit of comity and a sense of mutual utility ought to induce every nation to allow full force and effect to the laws of every other nation.\u201d Story on Confl. of Laws, 75.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-5\">It is also undeniably true that in all enlightened nations, which do not tolerate slavery, the laws of other states in which it is tolerated, are held to be so prejudicial to the non-slaveholding states and their citizens, and so repugnant to the spirit of their institutions, that slaves held under such laws, cease to be slaves the moment they come within their territories. \u201cIt has been decided that the law of England abhors and will not endure the existence of slavery within the nation; and consequently, as soon as a slave lands in England he becomes, <em>ipso facto, </em>a free man, and discharged from the state of servitude.\u201d Ib. 92. So that the fervid exclamation of Cowper is, in truth, an undisputed axiom of English law</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-6\">\u201cSlaves can not breath\u00f3 in England; if their lungs</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-V\">Receive our air, that moment they are free:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-7\">They touch our country, and their shackles fall.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-8\">That\u2019s <em>noble! </em>\u2014 \"</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-9\">So also in France. <em>\u201c </em>That such is the benign and liberal effect of the laws and customs of that county,\u201d is declared by the highest court of Louisiana. Marie Louise <em>v. </em>Mariot, 8 Martin, 375. It is then not to be questioned that the comity of nations has in no instance, induced any enlightened state to tolerate the slavery, created by the laws of another state, within its territory. On the contrary, it has been uniformly held by the tribunals of slaveholding states, that slaves, permitted by their masters to reside within the limits of non-slaveholding states, become free, through the operation of their laws. 14 Martin, 401; 2 Marsh. 467; Gilman (Va.), 143. It being true then that each nation and state must determine for itself to what'extent it' will admit, upon the principle of comity, the laws of other nations and states to operate within its limits, *it remains to inquire, so far as the present question is concerned, how far the State of Ohio admits, upon that principle, the operation of laws that sanction slavery. And the scope of this inquiry is very limited. We have but to turn to the ordinance, and we find the fundamental and unalterable compact, between the original states and the people and states of the Northwestern Territory, that there shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>neither slavery nor involuntary servitude within that territory; forever. Turning to the constitution of the state, we find the same express interdict reiterated, in the same terms, by the voice of the people. The ordinance then, and the state constitution, expressly prohibit the apjdication of the principles of comity to cases of this description. There is an excepted class of eases, it is true \u2014 excepted in the ordinance and excepted in the constitution of the United States, which is paramount to the state constitution. But upon every slave brought within the limits of Ohio, and not embraced within the strict terms of the exception, this great interdict operates with unbroken force. \u201c Independent of the provisions of the constitution of the United States,\u201d says Judge \u2022Story, \u201c for the protection of the rights of masters in regard to-\u2022domestic fugitive sales, there is no doubt that the English principle pervades the common law of the non-slaveholding states in America; that is, foreign slaves would no longer be deemed-such, after removal thither.\u201d Story on - Conflict of Laws, 92. The -courts of this state then are tied up from deciding any person to rbe a slave, unless that person falls strictly within the exception -of the federal constitution. They have nothing to do with the .principles of comity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-5\">What then is that exception? What persons compose that unfortunate class, whose fetters can not be broken by the spirit of \u2022 our state institutions? The clause creating the exception has \u2022been already cited. It provides that no persons held to service \u25a0,in one state, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall \u2022by any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service. .Persons held to service in one state, and escaping into another, then, compose the class which are not to be enfranchised by the \u2022operation of the ordinance and our state constitution. Was the woman Matilda a person of this class? Was she held to serviee ;in one state, and did she escape into another? Plainly not. At \u2022the time she left the individual who claimed to be her master, she was within the territorial limits of Ohio, by the consent of that \u25a0individual. If she had ever been a slave, she had ceased to be \u2022 such that moment when she was brought by Lawrence within *these limits, and she had power to go whithersover she \u2022 chose. Her act in leaving Lawrence, under these circumstances, vwas in no just sense of - the term, an escape. It was the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>exercise of that freedom, which the constitution of Ohio had conferred upon her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-5\">I am aware that some decisions can be found which maintain that slaves, traveling with their masters through free states, will not become free : but these decisions, so far as I have become_acquainted with them, were made by the courts of slaveholding states, under do solemn obligation to maintain the constitution of the non-slaveholding states, to which they denied, in these cases, its legitimate effect; and I look in vain for any warrant for such decisions. Where is the authority for adding to the class of fugitive servants excepted by the federal constitution from the otherwise inevitable operation of free institutions, another class, namely, that of slaves traveling with their masters? The constitution of the United States declares that the provisions of the state constitution shall not affect the condition of servants escaping from the other states into Ohio, and the state constitution yields to the paramount authority of the federal constitution. And then some judge decides that the state constitution shall not affect the condition of slaves traveling through Ohio with their masters Shall the state constitution yield to this decision ? Plain common, sense, fortified by every principle of sound construction, answers no, and must prevail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-6\">It follows, then, that at the time the woman Matilda was received into the service of the defendant she was not a slave, or the property of any person, and of course that the offense charged has not been, in fact, committed..</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-7\">No argument was submitted for the state.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b249-8\">Judge Wood</author>\n<p id=\"A2E\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">The statute upon which the indictment is predicated enacts, \u201cthat if any person shall harbor or secrete any black or mulatto person, the property of another, the person so offending shall, on conviction thereof, be fined any sum not less than ten nor more than fifty dollars.\u201d We are first called to consider whether, under this enactment, the indictment is sufficient?</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">It is required that every indictment shall have a precise and sufficient certainty. The omission of a word of substance is fatal. 2 Haw. P. C. chap. 25, sec. 4. Here the plaintiff in error is ^charged with harboring and secreting a certain mulatto girl, by the name of Matilda, the <em>property of L. Larkin. </em>There is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>no averment that the plaintiff in error <em>knew the facts </em>alleged, that Matilda was a slave, and the property of L. Lai-kin, or of any other person; and such is not the legal inference in a state whose constitution declares that all are horn free and equal, and that there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude within its limits, except as a punishment for the commission of crimes. On'the contrary, the presumption is in favor of freedom. The scienter, or knowledge of the plaintiff in error, of this material fact, was an ingredient necessary to constitute his guilt. This knowledge should have been averred in the indictment, and proved on the trial, for, without such knowledge, the act charged as a crime was innocent in its character. We know of no case where positive action is held criminal, unless the intention accompanies the act, either expressly or necessarily inferred from the act itself. <em>\u201cIgnorantia facti </em>doth excuse, for such an ignorance, many times, makes the act itself morally involuntary.\u201d 1 Hales P. C. 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">It is true that the statute, upon which the indictment is founded, omits the <em>scienter, </em>and the indictment covers all the facts enumerated in that statute. But this is not sufficient; it can not be assumed that an act which, independent of positive enactment, involves no moral wrong, nay, an act that in many cases would be highly praiseworthy, should be made grievously criminal, when performed in total unconsciousness of the facts that infect it with crime. This court has determined differently. In the caso of Anderson against the state, 7 Ohio, part 1, 255, the plaintiff in error was indicted for uttering and publishing forged certificate of deposit, without averring his knowledge of such forgery. The statute under which the indictment was found does not, in express terms, make this knowledge a constituent of the crime. Never- ' theless, the court held that the criminality could not exist without the knowledge, and that an indictment did not aver it was defective. That case runs upon all fours with this,- and the further investigation of the principles upon which it is based confirms the court in -the conviction that it is correct. This judgment must be reversed for this cause, and it thus becomes unnecessary to decide upon -the other points, so laboriously argued for the plaintiff in error, and of a character too important in their bearing upon the whole country to be adjudicated upon without necessity.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
