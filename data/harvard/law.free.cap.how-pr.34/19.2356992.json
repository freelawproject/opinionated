The defendant took possession of the horse about October 37, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>1866, and retained him about a week. Theplaintiff demanded the horse two or three times, and the defendant refused to deliver him up.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-5\">The plaintiff) on Satin-day, November 3d, caused his attorney to prepare* the papers in this action. The papers were delivered to the sheriff for service, between six and seven o\u2019clock in the evening, in Batavia. The next day (Sunday) the defendant. put the horse in the plaintiff\u2019s lot, and so informed the plaintiff. The plaintiff put the horse in his own bam, where he was when the sheriff came to serve the papers in the action, on Monday, about noon. The sheriff had just served the summons upon the defendant, and then called at the plaintiff\u2019s, and found the horse in the plaintiff\u2019s bam. The father of the defendant was with the sheriff. The sheriff said, if the parties did not settle, he should put the horse in a third man\u2019s hands, and he put him into Mook\u2019s hands, a' neighbor, where he remained some days, the plaintiff taking care of him, and then took him home. The plaintiff went with the sheriff to Mook\u2019s, and led the horse (a colt).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-6\">The defendant first took the horse into his possession under a claim of right, as the horse was trespassing upon his premises. The right of the defendant to retain the horse was disputed, and a suit threatened.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-7\">The defendant\u2019s counsel moved for anon-suit, on the ground that the horse being in possession of the plaintiff at the time the action was commenced, and not in the possession of the defendant, the action could not be sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-8\">The motion was denied, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-9\">The court charged that \u201c the act of the defendant in tum- ' ing the horse upon another lot on plaintiff\u2019s premises,..was in itself a wrongful act on his part. That if the jury should find that the defendant then intended to return the horse to the plaintiff\u2019s possession, and the plaintiff thereupon accepted the horse, and took him into .his possession, then the action could not be sustained.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-10\">The counsel for the defendant then insisted that under this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>charge and instruction, there was no question to submit to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-4\">The court declined so to hold, but submitted the case to \u2022 the jury, and the defendant excepted thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-5\">To understand the charge, it will be proper to state some more of the evidence. The plaintiff) as a witness, testified, that <em>\u201c </em>the defendant told him he had put the horse into his (plaintiff\u2019s) lot; that he (plaintiff) objected to his doing it in that <em>way; </em>that he was a young horse, and would not be contented.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-6\">The horse had been put in the pasture next the road,'not the lot he was pastured in.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-7\">The plaintiff took the horse from the lot and put him in the bam.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-8\">M.

The undisputed evidence is, that the papers were not served until about noon, on Monday, November 5th.

He having on the day before, taken the horse from his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>lot and put Mm into Ms own bam. Mo ok, plaintiff\u2019s witness, says : \u201c When I first saw colt, CMistie was leading him ; plaintiff fed the colt at my bam, and took him away.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-6\">Christie was told '\u201c on Saturday, if he would stop proceedings, they would give up the horse,\u201d and Wakeman told' him same day, \u201c it could be got along with without a law suit.\u201d The horse thus trespassing on defendant\u2019s premises, was taken up in good faith, under act of 1862, and actually restored to plaintiff, and taken into his manual custody the day before service of papers. It does not. detract from the legal effect of the return, that the horse was put back into another or less suitable lot. Nor does the grumbling of plaintiff, that he objected to his-turning him back in that way; that he would not be contented, &amp;c., affect the fact of the actual, return of the animal to plaintiff\u2019s adjoining lot, and the taking and shutting him up by plaintiff personally.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-7\">II. Replevin (in the <em>detinet) </em>is simply an action to recover the possession of personal property <em>(Code, \u00a7 </em>206), and it claims the \u201c immediate delivery \u201d of such property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-8\">\u201c The action to recover the possession of personal property is based upon a wrongful detention of it, and such wrongful detention must exist at the time of the commencement of the action.\u201d <em>(Savage </em>agt. <em>Perkins, </em>11 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>22; <em>Opin. by </em>Bowen, <em>J. and cases cited; Elwood </em>agt. <em>Smith, </em>9 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>528; <em>Roberts </em>agt. <em>Bandall, Gen. Term Sup. Court, </em>5 <em>Id. </em>328.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-9\">This is not a case where \u201cthe defendant-before suit has wrongfully parted with the possession,\u201d to a third party. <em>(Brockway </em>agt. <em>Burnap, </em>16 <em>Barb. </em>315.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-10\">The cases bearing on this point, are elaborately reviewed in <em>Nichols </em>agt. <em>Michael </em>(23 <em>N. </em>Y. <em>R. </em>264 <em>to </em>275). Says Selden, J. <em>(p. </em>272): \u201c Where a person is in possession of goods belonging to another, wMch he is bound to deliver on demand, if he parts with that possesssion to one who refuses to deliver them, he is responsible in <em>detinue </em>equally with the party refusing.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>We insist that this is not a case where, in any sense, it can be claimed, that the defendant wrongfully or improperly parted with the possession of the horse, or where he delivers pos session to another before action brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-5\">Hence it follows that a non-suit on the whole case should have been granted by the court, it appearing that there had been an actual return, of the horse by defendant, and an actual receiving of the horse into possession by plaintiff before suit commenced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-6\">This particular form of action will not lie, where, in point of fact, the plaintiff has the identical property in his own custody when the action is commenced. Such a ruling works no injustice. The party can still have redress for the original taking and detention. He can recover damages therefor, but it is a palpable absurdity to award to him possession of that which he already has.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-7\">HI. As matter of law, the facts disclosed in the. evidence constituted an acceptance of the horse by plaintiff, as set up in answer number three.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-8\">No other objection was made by plaintiff, than as to the horse being too young to be put into <em>that </em>lot, and while so saying, at the same time he <em>took up </em>the animal and put him into his bam. The taking of the horse by the sheriff from plaintiff\u2019s barn, and turning him, over to Hook\u2014to be fed and taken care of by plaintiff\u2014was a nullity so far as the sheriff was concerned, and a farce on the part of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-9\">\u2022 IV. Defence number two was ruled out <em>in tofo, </em>on the ground that the court of appeals had expressly decided the law of 1862, in relation to strays, as wholly unconstitutional and void. We had no access to any opinion or decision that afreet this point, and hence desire the point should be reviewed on this motion.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b27-10\"><em>By the </em>court, Marvin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAN\">By the Code <em>(\u00a7 </em>99), the action is commenced when the summons is served. At the time this action was commenced, the horse was in the actual pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>session of the plaintiff. The defendant had returned the horse, and made no further claim to detain him. It seems to me that this simple statement must decide the case. The action was to recover the <em>possession </em>of the horse, <em>wrongfully detained. </em>At the time the action was commenced, the wrongful detention had ceased, and the plaintiff was in full possession of his property. As I understand it, the learned justice at the circuit was of the opinion, and so charged, that if the defendant, by turning the horse into the jdaintiff\u2019s lot on Sunday morning, intended to return the horse to the plaintiff\u2019s possession, and the plaintiff accepted the horse, and took him into possession for that purpose, the action could not be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The counsel for the defendant, in view of this charge, claimed that there was no question .for the jury, but that the court should dispose of the case. The counsel was, I think, right: Assuming that there was some importance in the question of the intention of the parties, I think the evidence was so decisive, that the court should have decided the case. It appears that the defendant took up the colt as a trespasser, and was proceeding under the act of 1862, and had incurred some costs. He was willing the plaintiff should have the horse, on paying the costs. This the plaintiff was unwilling to do. Counsel was taken in Batavia, on Saturday, when the defendant was probably advised that the statute under which he was proceeding would not protect him, and he concluded to restore the horse to the plaintiff. He did this on Sunday morning, by putting him into plaintiff\u2019s pasture, adjoining the highway, and he notified the plaintiff thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">What objection did the plaintiff make, as he states as a witness ? He says: <em>\u201c </em>I objected to his turning him back in that way; that he was a young horse, and would not be contented ; it was Sunday morning; he turned him into the lot next to the road, not the lot he was pastured in.\u201d In another place.he says: \u201c I took the horse from my lot, and put him in my stable.\u201d Now as I understand this evidence, there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>an absolute, unqualified return of the horse, and the plaintiff unqualifiedly accepted him. The only objection he made was, that <em>\u201c </em>the colt was put into the wrong pasture; that he was a young horse, and would not be contentedand thereupon he went and caught the colt, and put him in the stable. I do not see any occasion for the remark of the judge, that <em>u </em>the act of the defendant in turning the horse upon another lot of the plaintiff\u2019s premises, was in itself a wrongful act on his part.\u201d But if this was even so, the plaintiff waived it, and went and took the colt and put him in the stable.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">There was no question for the jury. The court should have decided the matter, and non-suited the plaintiff, or directed the verdict for the defendant. The jmy must have found, under the charge, that the defendant did not intend to return the horse to the plaintiff\u2019s possession, or that the plaintiff did not accept the horse, or take him into his possession for that purpose; a finding, as I think, directly against the evidence. We are, however, examining the case only upon the exceptions. I think the exception to the refusal to non-suit was well <em>taken; also to </em>the refusal <em>to </em>direct a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">This case does not belong to the class of cases referred to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, where the defendant has wrongfully parted with the property to a <em>third person, </em>before the commencement of the action. <em>(Brockway agt. </em>Burnap, 16 <em>Barb. 309; Nichols </em>agt. <em>Michael, 23 N. Y. R. </em>264.)</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">In this case the defendant restored the horse to the plaintiff) who took him into his possession, and had full power and control over him before the action was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">There must be a new trial, costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
