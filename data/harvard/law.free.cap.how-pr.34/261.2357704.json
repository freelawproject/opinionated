At the August special term, upon the complaint and affidavits, and the answer and affidavits, after full argument, the injunction was dissolved, on the <em>ground </em>that the proper parties defendants were not included in the action; that the metropolitan board of health, and the mayors of New York and Brooklyn, who, with the defendants commissioners of quarantine, or a majority of them, constituted the board who were authorized to select the location for quarantine site for landing and boarding station, on the west end of Coney Island.

Said sites shall be selected as near to each other as the <em>safety of the </em>public health and the convenient discharge of the duties of the health officer will permit. As soon as said sites, or either of them, shall be determined upon by said commissioners, the metropolitan board of health and the mayors of said cities, or a majority of them, they shall certify that fact in writing to the governor, lieu.tenant-governor and comptroller; and if the site or sites so selected shall be approved by them, or a majority of them, they or such majority shall make and sign a certificate of the fact, specifying particularly therein the site or sites so selected,, and file the same in the office of the secretary of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>state; and thereupon the said commissioners shall become and be deemed to be empowered to acquire title to the lands specified in said certificate, and fit up the same for quarantine purposes, as thereinafter specified.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-5\">And it was also thereby provided, that as soon as a site or sites shall have been selected and determined upon in the manner thereinbefore provided, if they shall be unable to acquire title thereto in behalf of the people of the state by purchase, at a price which shall be approved by the governor, they may acquire title thereto in behalf of the said people, in the same manner and by the same proceedings as as are prescribed for acquiring title to lands by railroad corporations, in and by the provisions of chapter 140 of the laws of 1850, and the acts amendatory thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-6\">And the plaintiffs further show, that, in pursuance of said act, the commissioners of quarantine, the metropolitan board of health, and the mayors of the cities of New York and Brooklyn, duly selected, as the defendants claim, as the site for a landing and boarding station on Coney Island, a tract of land upon said Coney Island by the following description: All that part of Coney Island, in the county of Kings, which lies westerly of a line drawn from the southwest corner of the house erected at Bath, on the shore of Long Island, owned or occupied by C.

Upon information and belief, they deny that the plaintiffs are the owners in fee simple or otherwise of Coney Island, situate within the town of Gravesend, in the county of Kings; and on the contrary thereof, they allege that said plaintiffs have no interest whatever in said island, or any part thereof, but that the same is owned by Martin Schoonmaker, Nicholas Stilwell, and a large number of other persons residing mostly in said town.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-6\">II. They allege that, pursuant to the act of the legislature mentioned in the complaint, all that part of said island which is described in said complaint has been duly designated and selected as a site for a landing and boarding station, for the purposes in said act specified, and a certificate of such selection has been duly filed, as required by said act; that they have been unable to acquire title thereto at a price approved by the governor; and they admit that, in consequence thereof, they design to acquire title thereto by the legal pro ceedings authorized by said act, and that they have given notice that a petition for that purpose will be presented by them to this court, at a special term thereof to be held in the city of New York, On the first Monday of August, 1867.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-7\">ITT. These defendants are ignorant of the precise quantity of land embraced within that portion of said island which has been so selected and designated as aforesaid, but upon information and belief they deny that it embraces the quantity or has the water front stated in said complaint, and they deny that it grossly exceeds, or in any manner or respect exceeds in quantity what is necessary for the legitimate purposes of a landing and boarding station; and they deny that a landing and boarding station, within the intent and meaning of the law, is only a place for the location of the health officer and his subordinates, from which to go to board vessels arriving at the port of New York, or that five acres square of upland, with the water front adjacent to it, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>be amply sufficient for the purpose and afford every convenience. And said defendants further deny, that they, or the officers and boards mentioned in the acts aforesaid, have, in fact or in substance, selected, or that they are proceeding to acquire title to more than sixty times, or any other number of times, as much land as is necessary for the purposes authorized by law or by the act aforesaid, or that they have selected or are proceeding to acquire title to more than ten times or any number of times as much as would be necessary for the whole quarantine establishment, including hospitals and a place for persons not sick, who have been exposed to contagious or infectious diseases; bnt, on the contrary thereof, these defendants aver that the quantity of land selected and designated as aforesaid, considered with reference to its peculiar character and location and surroundings, in no respect exceeds, but in fact falls short of, what is really required for the purposes specified in the act aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-5\">IY. These defendants further deny that their proceedings have been in any respect wrongful or fraudulent as against the plaintiffs or any other parties or persons, or that these defendants are in any respect grossly or wrongfully exceeding the power given them by law to acquire title to a landing and boarding station, or that under cover or pretence of said law, but in contravention thereof, and in violation of law or of right, and for ulterior objects and purposes not sanctioned by law, they are proceeding to acquire title to and get possession of a large tract of land, with an extensive water front, not necessary for the purposes for which alone the legislature allowed any land on Coney Island to be taken for quarantine purposes; but on the contrary thereof, these defendants allege that, in all their proceedings under the act aforesaid, they have been actuated solely by the intent to carry out what they conceived to be the real object and purposes of said act, and with a view to secure to the state what they believed to be absolutely essential to the due administration and observance of the quarantine rules and regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>of the port o.f New York.

(Cooper\u2019Cos. in Ch.77), </em>the chancellor ordered an issue to ascertain whether the- land sought to be acquired was within the limits of the canal fixed by the act</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-15\">It is important to observe that the railroad act, made applicable to this case, provides that, upon the completion of the proceedings to ascertain the compensation and payment thereof, or deposit of it in court, the commissioners are authorized to take possession and use the land, \u201c <em>and all persons made parties to the proceedings are forever haired and divested of all light, estate or interest in the land.\u201d (Laws of </em>1850, <em>p. </em>29, \u00a718.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-16\">It is much more than doubtful whether, if the proceedings to acquire title wer\u00ab <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>completed, ejectment or trespass would lie, and the points upon which we rely could not be raised and tried in the proceedings to fix the compensation, nor upon certiorari*</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-5\">So that the remedy by injunction is not only the proper one, but probably the only one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-6\">III. The board of health and the mayors of the two cities are not necessary or pro* per parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-7\">They have no interest whatever in the matter, and nothing further to do in regard to it. They were mere agents in selecting the site, and having done that, <em>arg functus oficio.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-8\">By the act, if they had not concured in selecting a site within thirty days from the passage of the act, their power would have been gone ,and others were to act in their stead.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-9\">If we should malee them parties, it is plain that they would have a clear right to have the complaint dismissed, with costs, as to them, on the ground that they have no interest in the matter. Of course we could have no injunction against them, for they have nothing to do and are doing nothing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-10\">By the law, the quarantine commissioners alone, after the selection of the site, are to proceed to acquire the titile, and alone are so proceeding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-11\">Besides, no such point is made by demurrer or answer, and a defect of parties must be raised by one or the other. <em>(Code \u00a7\u00a7 </em>148,144.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-12\">IV. The case made by the complaint and affidavits on the part of the plaintiffs, is not changed or impaired by the answer and affidavits on the part of the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-13\">1st. The legislature intended to provide, and did provide, that no part of the quarantine establishment, hut merely the landing and boarding station, should be located upon Coney Island. They specially provided for the location of every part of the establishment which might he dangerous or infectious elsewhere. A landing and boarding station was evidently considered, and, if used for its legitimate purposes only, no doubt is perfectly inoxious.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-14\">2d. The allegation of the oomplaint and affidavits, that five acres of land, with the water front adjacent, is all that is necessary for the actual uses and purposes of a landing and hoarding station, is in no\" way contradicted or denied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-15\">It was all that they had for that purpose on Staten Island, and all that they reserved for that purpose out of the sale of their lands there, and the station on Coney Island, was, by the act, to he instead of that on Staten Island.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-16\">No uses of such a station are-set out requiring more than five acres.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-17\"><em>Swinburne </em>enumerates the uses and makes the most of them, but he does not say that those uses require more ground than we alleged was sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-18\">3d. It is undisputed that the site they claim to have selected embraces several hundred acres of land, with about three miles water front. That it includes the whole west end of the island, and all the water front upon the whole island capable of' being used for docks or landings, thus cutting off the rest of the island from access by water.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-19\">4th. The purport of all fhe opposing affidavits is, that the main object which the commissioners had in view in making the selection-was isolation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-20\">They have not, in fact, selected a site for a landing and boarding station, but have taken territory to <em>include </em>and <em>isolate </em>one. The site is yet to be selected out of the territory which they have designated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-21\">5th. There is nothing in the opposing papers to negative the charge which we make as an inference from the above facts, that they have not made the selection <em>bonafde </em>for the purposes of a landing and boarding station, but for other purposes not authorized by the act; and if they had in view purposes not authorized by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>act, it is of no consequence that they may have thought those purposes meritorious and beneficial to the public.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-5\">V.

They had no power conferred upon them but to select a suitable site upon the west end of Coney Island, tor the actual uses and purposes of a landing and hoarding station.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-7\">They had no right to take plaintiffs\u2019 property for the purpose of <em>isolating </em>such site or station.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-8\">2d. They have shown no necessity or good reason for isolating it,</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-9\">They talk about <em>invasion </em>and <em>danger from communication </em>with the people.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-10\"><em>Swinbuime </em>thinks it desirable to erect a <em>banner across the island </em>on its eastern boundary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-11\">It is said it would he very improper to have persons bathing near it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-12\">Another object was to prevent people from starting from the island at night in boats to visit vessels at quarantine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-13\">They had no right to take plaintiffs\u2019 land for any such purposes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-14\">The <em>invasion </em>spoken of must mean for the purpose of destroying the buildings and property to he put there.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-15\">They had no power given them to take land for that purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-16\">3d. It does not appear that it couldn\u2019t be <em>isolated </em>as well, if confined to five acres, as if it embraced five hundred*</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-17\">4th. The action of the commissioners in this alleged selection of a site shows a reckless, wanton and high-handed disregard of the rights of the owners of the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-18\">The only object seems to have been to take as much land as might ever be warned for any purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-19\">They might as well have gone upon any other housetop and run a line due south, or due east, and have taken the whole island.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-20\">5th. The affidavits on the part of the defendants are of the most vague and unsatisfactory kind. When carefully examined, there is nothing in them upon which any court can form any satisfactory judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-21\">It would he permitting a gross outrage upon private rights to allow a large and valuable tract of land to be taken upon these vague, unmeaning allegations about the necessity or desirableness of <em>isolation.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-22\">VI. We, however, maintain that the ground of isolation set up in their affiadvits is merely a convenient subterfuge; that they have made the selection, not <em>bona fde </em>for the uses and purposes of a landing and hoarding station, but for other purposes not authorized by law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-23\">What their motives and purposes were, it is unnecessary for us to show. They liave undertaken to <em>u secure a tract of land ten times more than sufficient for the whole quarrntme establishement, on a grand scale.\u201d </em>They may not intend to use it for all quarantine purposes until further legislation, and they may or may not intend to obtain further legislation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-24\">VII. It is claimed, no doubt, in this case, that the commissioners had a discretion, in making the selection, which cannot he interfered with. That is, no doubt, the rule, where the discretion is exercised according to law and in good faith, and with fairness; hut illegality and unfairness have always been exceptions to the rule. <em>(Phillips </em>agt. <em>Wickham, </em>1 <em>Paige, </em>590; <em>The Oswego Falls Bridge Co. </em>agt. <em>Fish. </em>1 <em>Barb Ch. </em>547; <em>Walker </em>agt. <em>Deverevx, </em>4 <em>Paige, </em>230; <em>Agar </em>agt. <em>Regent's Canal Co. </em>1 <em>Cooper's Cas. in Ch. </em>77; <em>Webb </em>agt. <em>Manchester Railway, a Railway Case, </em>575.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-25\">VIH. The admitted facts in the case being such as to justify and sustain the inference that this ground was not <em>bona fde </em>selected only as a site for a landing and board<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>ing station, but with a view to other purposes, if the answer and affidavits upon the other side are supposed to controvert that position, the injunction should be allowed and continued until that question is decided at the hearing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-5\">It cannot be supposed that defendants\u2019 affidavits settle that question in favor of the defendants; and we should have an opportunity to try it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-6\">It is a proper case for an issue, <em>(Agar </em>agt. <em>The Regent's Canal Co.

The act of 1851, in relation to state officers and state bonds of officers, does not apply to these commissioners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-8\">The second section shows clearly that it only refers to those general state officers for whom it was the duty of the attorney general to appear, and that the law was made for his benefit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b276-9\">So decided, N. <em>Y. and Harlem R.
