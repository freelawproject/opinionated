The appeal is from the order vacating the original order of removal. .</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">I have.looked into the authorities, and without citing them, I think the order of Justice Barnard was irregular, and cannot be sustained for the following reasons :</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">1. I think the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys were entitled to notice of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">2. I think the entry of the defendant\u2019s appearance was irregular. The appearance contemplated by the act of congress, is doubtless an appearance to be entered in the minutes of the court; but the rules of this court have prescribed the manner in which the defendant\u2019s may appear, and what shall be deemed an appearance. This is by service of notice of retainer. On filing such notice, the defendant may, doubtless, enter his appearance in the proper clerk\u2019s office, and at the same time file his petition for the removal of the cause. Having filed his petition, he may then apply to the' court at special term for an order of removal; and, if necessary, obtain a stay of the plaintiff\u2019s proceedings until his application can be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">But whatever may be the correct practice in respect to entering the defendant\u2019s appearance, there is no difficulty in giving notice of the application at the same time the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>ant enters and gives notice of his appearance. <em>(Redmond </em>agt. <em>Russell, </em>12 <em>Johns.
