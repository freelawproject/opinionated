R. </em>452. Through some mistake probably, Judge <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>opinion was published in the newspapers, from which we took it as an <em>unreported cafe.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b292-16\">The case of <em>Batterman </em>agt.

On the contrary, <em>Cheat-ham </em>agt. <em>Sampson </em>(4 <em>Term. R. </em>318) is against him. A case <em>(Rosewell </em>agt: <em>Prior, Salk. </em>460) was cited by counsel, to show that an action was maintained against the owner of premises, who was not. in possession, for a nuisance in making an erection which stopped ancient lights. Buller, J., in delivering his opioion in <em>Cheetham </em>agt. Sampson, refers to <em>Rosewell </em>agt. <em>Prior, </em>and remarks that it was very distinguishable from the case then under consideration. \u201cFor there,\u201d he says, \u201cthe owner let the premises with the nuisace complained of, which had been before erected upon them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">The injury to the plaintiff in the present case arose, not from any want of repairs arising out of the use, but from the defective construction and dangerous condition of the pier. The defendants, the owners, let the pier \u201cwith the defects complained of,\u201d and are, consequently liable for the injury sustained by the plaintiff. .</p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">There should be judgment for the plaintiff on the verdict,. with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">Sutherland and Ingraham, Justices, concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
