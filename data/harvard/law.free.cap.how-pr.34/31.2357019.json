G. at Special Term, </em>33 <em>How. </em>3, <em>and concurring in Judge </em>Ingraham\u2019s <em>views on this point.)</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b35-7\">The statute giving <em>double </em>costs, when adopted, applied exclusively to actions and pro ceedings in courts of law, and not to suits in equity j consequently it is not applicable to actions of purely equitable cognizance.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b35-8\"><em>New York General Term, October, </em>1867.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b35-9\"><em>Before </em>Leonard, P. <em>J. </em>Fullerton <em>and </em>J. C. Smith, <em>Justices.</em></p>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-10\">An injunction was granted restraining the defendants from interfering with or hindering the plaintiff in his business, and the defendants severed in their answer. The injunction was subsequently dissolved, and the action discontinued on payment of taxable costs. The clerk, on taxation, disallowed the costs of the police commissioners, but allowed double costs and double disbursements to the attorneys for the sanitary commissioners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-11\">The plaintiff and the police commissioners appealed from the adjustment of the clerk to the special term. It was there decided by Ingraham J. (33 <em>How. p. </em>3), that the clerk was right in refusing to tax more than one bill of costs ; that the defendants sued as the board of health, could not sever so as to be entitled to two bills of costs, and that the statute allowing double costs to a public officer for official acts, applies only to actions brought for an act done, or for an omission to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>do an act in the line of his duty, and not to a proceeding where no damages were sought or relief asked, either for acts done or omitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-5\">The defendants appealed from the order directing a retaxation, and denying double costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-6\">Abraham R.\" Lawrence, Jr., <em>attorney for plaintiffs.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-7\">George Bliss, Jr., <em>attorney for Sanitary Commissioners.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b36-8\"><em>By the court, </em>James C. Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFq2\">I think this case is not within the statute giving double costs, or taxed costs and one-half thereof in addition. (2 <em>R. S. </em>617, \u00a7 24, <em>sub. </em>1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\"><em>1st. </em>The only actions against public officers to which the statute applies, are those brought for some act done by such officer by virtue of his office, or for the omission by him to do some act of which it was his duty to perform. The only pmpose of the present action was to restrain the defendants from doing a threatened or anticipated act, alleged to be injurious to the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not recover damages nor ask for relief, either by reason of acts done or omitted; he sought to prevent certain official action, contemplated by the defendants. Such a case is not within the statute. This was the ground on which Justice Ingraham disposed of the question at the special term, and I fully concur in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\"><em>2d. </em>I think the statute when adopted, applied exclusively to actions and proceedings in courts of law, and not to suits in chancery, and, consequently, it is not now applicable to actions of purely equitable cognizance.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">I am in favor of affirming the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">Leonard, P.
