Crossett Co. v. United States (Ct. Cl.) 50 F.(2d) 292, this date decided. The claim for refund in this case contained no claim of the right to include any amount in invested capital on account of good will, and presented no facts that would support such a claim! For the reasons stated in the Crossett Case, supra, and upon the authorities cited therein, the petition in this case must be dismissed. It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
