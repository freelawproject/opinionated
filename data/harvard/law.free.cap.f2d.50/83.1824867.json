HAND, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ain-dedup-0\">(after stating the facts as above).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">The agreement set forth in the amended bill of complaint involved a violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 1-7, 15 (United States v. Pacific <em>&amp; </em>Arctic Co., 228 U. S. 87, 33 S. Ct. 443, 57 L. Ed. 742; Thomsen v. Cayser, 243 U. S. 66, 37 S. Ct. 353, 61 L. Ed. 597, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 322), at least in the absence of approval by the United States Shipping Board pursuant to section 15 of the Shipping Act (46 USCA \u00a7 814). That section provides that \u201call agreements * * * made after the organization of the board shall be lawful only when and as long as approved by the board, and before approval or after disapproval it shall be. unlawful to carry out in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, any such agreement. * * * Every agreement * * * lawful under this section shall be excepted from\u201d the Sherman Act and acts supplementary thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-14\">As the amended bill alleges that the agreement declared upon has not been approved by the Shipping Board, the exception of section 15, supra, does not apply. Prom this the plaintiff reasons that an injunction may be properly sought under section 16 of the Clayton Act (15 USCA \u00a7 26), which permits \u201cinjunctive relief\u201d to private parties \u201cagainst threatened loss or damage by a violation of the anti-trust laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-15\">Prior to the enactment of the Clayton Act in 1914, private parties were not entitled to sue to restrain violations of the anti-trust laws embodied in the Sherman Act, though injunctive remedies were given to the government. Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co., 194 U. S. 48, 24 S. Ct. 598, 48 L. Ed. 870; Paine Lumber Co. v. Neal, 244 U. S. 459, 37 S. Ct. 718, 61 L. Ed. 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-16\">The Clayton Act (section 16 [15 USCA \u00a7 26]) provided that no person except the United States shall be entitled \u201cto bring suit in equity for injunctive relief against any common carrier subject to the provisions of the Act to regulate commerce * * * in respect of any matter subject to the regulation, supervision, or other jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission.\u201d The Supreme Court has held that, while a combination of land carriers to fix rates may be il<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>legal under the Anti-Trust Acts and may <em>he\u00a1 </em>prosecuted by the United States, private^ shippers who claim to be injured must seek their remedies against such a combination under the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA \u00a7 1 et seq.) (Texas &amp; Pac. Ry. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U. S. 426, 27 S. Ct. 350, 51 L. Ed. 553, 9 Ann. Cas. 1075), and cannot even sue at law to recover dam-, ages under section 7 of the Sherman Act (15 USCA \u00a7 25). Keogh v. C. &amp; N. <em>W. </em>Ry. Co., 260 U. S. 156, 43 S. Ct. 47, 67 L. Ed. 183. The court below, per Caffey, J.,; applied similar reasoning to the combination of water carriers in the ease at bar and dismissed the amended bill on the ground that relief must be sought under the Shipping Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">It is said, however, that the Clayton Act contains no exception, affecting carriers by water, similar to the provision of section 16 of that act (46 USCA \u00a7 815), which precludes private parties from bringing suits for injunctive relief against land carriers in respect to matters subject to the regulation of the Interstate Commerce Commission; and it is therefore- insisted that the general provisions of the Clayton Act permitting in-junctive relief to private parties \u201cagainst threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws\u201d should have unrestricted application to the ease at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">But, in spite of the provision in the Interstate Commerce Act that nothing contained therein \u201cshall in any way abridge or alter the remedies * * * existing at common law or by statute\u201d and that its provisions \u201care in addition to such remedies\u201d (49 USCA \u00a7 22), the Supreme Court has been increasingly disposed to treat the remedies afforded by that act as exclusive. Private parties have not been permitted to pursue remedies under the Sherman or Clayton Acts in cases where the Interstate Commerce Act has afforded relief. Keogh v. C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., 260 U. S. 156, 43 S. Ct. 47, 67 L. Ed. 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">It is said that remedies afforded by the Interstate Commerce Act have been held exclusive only where administrative questions have been involved. But the tendency to extend the requirement of a preliminary inquiry by the Commission is significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">In the pioneer ease of Texas &amp; Pac. Ry. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U. S. 426, 27 S. Ct. 350, 51 L. Ed. 553, 9 Ann. Cas. 1075, it was held that the right of a shipper to recover a rate alleged to be discriminatory must first be submitted to the Interstate Commerce Commission. Robinson v. Balt. <em>&amp; </em>Ohio R. R., 222 U. S. 506, 32 S. Ct. 114, 56 L. Ed. 288, and Mitchell Coal Company v. Penna. R. R. Co., 230 U. S. 247, 33 S. Ct. 916, 57 L. Ed. 1472; were to the same effect. In Balt. &amp; Ohio R. R. v. Pitcairn Coal Co., 215 U. S. 481, 30 S. Ct. 164, 54 L. Ed. 292, Morrisdale Coal Co. v. Penna. R. R., 230 U. S. 304, 33 S. Ct. 938, 57 L. Ed. 1494, and Midland Valley R. R. v. Barkley, 276 U. S. 482, 48 S. Ct. 342, 72 L. Ed. 664, the question involved was whether a distribution of coal ears to shippers was discriminatory. It was held that the matter involved preliminary action by the Interstate Commerce Commission, in \u201ethe absence of which the federal courts had no jurisdiction. Similarly in Tex. &amp; Pac. Ry. Co. v. American Tie Co., 234 U. S. 138, 34 S. Ct. 885, 58 L. Ed. 1255, the question whether a tariff established by the-Commission covered a certain product was held to require the preliminary determination of the Commission. In Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. Solum, 247 U. S. 477, 38 S. Ct. 550, 62 L. Ed. 1221, the reasonableness of a practice of routing shipments was held to involve preliminary administrative determination. In Western &amp; Atlantic v. Public Service Comm., 267 U. S. 493, 45 S. Ct. 409, 69 L. Ed. 753, a bill which was filed to enjoin a state commission from enforcing an order directing a railroad to maintain service on-an industrial switch track was dismissed because the question was one which must first be presented to the Interstate Commerce-Commission. In Board v. Great Northern Ry., 281 U. S. 412, 50 S. Ct. 391, 74 L. Ed. 936, it was held that the question whether intrastate railroad rates ordered by state authority should be set aside as working unreasonable discrimination against interstate-commerce must be determined in the first instance by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and a suit to enjoin a state commission from enforcing an order as to such rates was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">In the following situations suits were allowed without preliminary resort to the Interstate Commerce Commission because pure questions of law were thought to be involved: In Pennsylvania R. R. v. Sonman Coal Co., 242 U. S. 120, 37 S. Ct. 46, 61 L. Ed. 188, the coal company sued to recover damages from the railroad on the ground that the latter had failed to supply a sufficient number of cars and had discriminated against it unjustly. It was found that conditions of traffic were normal and that the railroad had plenty of cars for the coal company if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>chose to supply them. In these circumstances there was no administrative question to be passed upon. The court emphasized the fact that section 22 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA \u00a7 22) preserved such \u201cappropriate common law or statutory remedies\u201d as could be enforced consistently with the purpose of the act, that no administrative question was presented, and held that the claim might therefore be prosecuted without any precedent action by the Commission. In Great Northern Ry. v. Merchants\u2019 Elev. Co., 259 U. S. 285, 42 S. Ct. 477, 66 L. Ed. 943, where the question whether a tariff established by the Commission covered a certain product involved no matters of fact as it had in Tex. &amp; Pac. Ry. Co. v. American Tie Co., 234 U. S. 138, 34 S. Ct. 885, 58 L. Ed. 1255, but only a construction of the meaning of the word \u201clumber\u201d in the tariff, a suit by a shipper to recover alleged overcharges by the railroad was sanctioned without preliminary resort to the Commission. In Tex. &amp; Pac. Ry. v. Gulf, etc., Ry., 270 U. S. 266, 46 S. Ct. 263, 70 L. Ed. 578, a direct judicial remedy was allowed under paragraph 20 of section 402 of the Transportation Act of 1920, 49 USCA \u00a7 1 (20). In Turner Lumber Co. v. C., M. &amp; St. Paul Ry., 271 U. S. 259, 46 S. Ct. 530, 70 L. Ed. 934, the question whether the Commission had violated the Constitution in fixing so-called penalties for demurrage of cars was held properly determinable by a court without prior resort to the Commission, since it involved the jurisdiction of that body and its right to proceed at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">It seems evident that the Supreme Court, after first holding in the Abilene Case, 204 U. S. 426, 27 S. Ct. 350, 51 L. Ed. 553, 9 Ann. Cas. 1075, that prior resort to the Commission must be had where uniformity of rates is affected by the decision of a question of fact, has proceeded far beyond the natural limitations of such a doctrine, and has, in general, insisted upon prior resort to the Commission wherever complicated questions of fact will arise and experience in technical matters is required. Thus in Midland Valley R. R. v. Barkley, 276 U. S. 482, 48 S. Ct. 342, 72 L. Ed. 664, the carrier\u2019s practice of distributing coal cars was involved. Though the question was not one of discrimination \u2022or of rates, but of the reasonableness of the practice, yet prior resort to the Commission \u25a0was held to be necessary. So in Northern Pac. Ry. v. Solum, 247 U. S. 477, 38 S. Ct. 550, 62 L. Ed. 1221, it was specifically contended that the rule which requires preliminary determination of questions by the Commission applied only to cases where a particular rate was unreasonable or a particular practice was discriminatory, but the court said, at page 483 of 247 U. S., 38 S. Ct. 550, 553: \u201cIt applies, likewise, to any practice-of the carrier which gives rise to the application of a rate.\u201d In Board v. Great Northern Ry. Co., 281 U. S. 412, 50 S. Ct. 391, 393, 74 L. Ed. 936, where a commission of the state of North Dakota had made an order prescribing intrastate class rates and reducing the existing rates about 10 per cent., a suit was brought by the carriers against the state commission 'to enjoin enforcement of its order pending the determination by the Interstate Commerce Commission of the Question whether the intrastate, rates would cause unreasonable discrimination against interstate commerce. In discussing the powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the court said: \u201cThe controlling principle, * * * was derived from a consideration of the nature of the question and of the inquiry and action required for its solution. The inquiry would necessarily relate to technical and intricate matters of fact, and the solution of the question would demand the exercise of sound administrative discretion. The accomplishment of the purpose of Congress could not be had without the comprehensive study of an expert body continuously employed in administrative supervision. Only through the action of such a body could there be secured the uniformity of ruling up <em>on </em>which appropriate protection from unreasonable exactions and unjust discriminations must depend.\u201d It was held that the federal court had no authority to1 enjoin the enforcement of the state order pending the determination by the Interstate Commerce Commission of the question whether the intrastate rates unduly affected interstate commerce. The question was primarily not one of discrimination, for within the state of North Dakota there would have been no discrimination. It was really whether the rates so affected interstate business as to be unreasonable under all the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">It seems evident under the most recent interpretation of the Interstate Commerce Act that questions of reasonableness and of fact affecting land carriers must first be raised before the Interstate Commerce Commission. The Sherman Act as now construed only prevents unreasonable restraints of trade. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U. S. 1, 31 S. Ct. 502, 55 L. Ed. 619, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 834, Ann. Cas. 1912D, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>734; Am. Tob. Co. v. United States, 221 U. S. 106, 31 S. Ct. 632, 55 L. Ed. 663; National Ass\u2019n of Window Glass Mf\u2019rs v. United States, 263 U. S. 403, 44 S. Ct. 148, 68 L. Ed. 358. Therefore, even had the agreement set forth in the present bill related to land carriers, it would have had to be passed upon by the Interstate Commerce Commission before resort to the courts. In Keogh v. C. <em>&amp; </em>N. W. Ry. Co., 260 U. S. 156, 43 S. Ct. 47, 49, 67 L. Ed. 183, it was observed that damages for the exaction of rates which the Commission had found to be illegal because unreasonably high or discriminatory would be recovered in proceedings before the Commission, and that it could not be supposed that Congress had intended to provide the shipper \u201cwith an additional remedy under the Anti-Trust Act.\u201d In the opinion in the Keogh Case it was further observed that a combination of carriers to fix nondiseriminatory rates might still be illegal under the Anti-Trust Acts and the government might have redress by criminal proceedings under section 3 (15 USCA \u00a7 3), by injunction under section 4 (15 USCA \u00a7 4) and by forfeiture under section 6 (15 USCA \u00a7 6); but, while the approval of the rates by the Commission would not bar proceedings by the government, a private shipper who had lost the benefit of rates which except for the conspiracy he would have enjoyed, could not recover damages under section 7 of the Sherman Act (15 USCA \u00a7 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The decisions that the Sherman Act can be invoked by the government against combinations involving the fixing of rates by land carriers can therefore have no application to original suits by private parties, whether brought under section 7 of that act or otherwise. Actions at law under section 7 are barred by no statutory proscription such as section 16 of the Clayton Act (15 USCA \u00a7 26), which forbids injunctive relief in respect to matters \u201csubject to the regulation, supervision, or other jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission,\u201d but because the remedies given by the Interstate Commerce Act are exclusive. Keogh v. C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., 260 U. S. 156, 43 S. Ct. 47, 67 L. Ed. 183; Central Stock Yards Co. v. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co. (C. C.) 112 F. 823; Cohen v. Schofield, 299 Pa. 496, 149 A. 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The trial judge said in his opinion: \u201cThe means alleged to have been employed were unreasonably excessive differentials between contract rates and open or tariff rates, coupled with viciously discriminatory practices in applying the differentials. Shippers, in a variety of ways, were thereby coerced, it' is said, to divert general cargo from the line-of the plaintiff to the lines of the defendants. Without a scale of unreasonably high tariff.' rates or unreasonably low contract rates, the-differentials could not have existed as a device.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">If, as we believe, the foregoing analysis-of the charges in the amended bill is correct, the gravamen of the cause of action in the case at bar was the unreasonableness of the-agreed rates of carriage, which, had land carriers been concerned, would have been a matter requiring primary resort to the Interstate Commerce Commission. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">But a reason, other than the analogy off the rule, starting with the Abilene Case, that' administrative questions must first be submitted to the Interstate Commerce Commission, required the decision of the \u2022 court below. That rule was originated by the Supreme-Court, and has been extended in scope in spite of section 22 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA \u00a7 22), prescribing that1 nothing contained therein should \u201cin any way abridge- or alter the remedies * * *\u2022 existing at common law or by statute, but the-provisions of this act are in addition to such remedies.\u201d The Shipping Act, on the other hand, contains no clause preserving general legal and equitable remedies, but provides ample remedies of its own. It empowers the Shipping Board under section 15 (46 USCA \u00a7 814) to approve such agreements as it shall; not find to be \u201cunjustly discriminatory or-unfair as between carriers, shippers, exporters, importers, or ports, or between exporters-from the United States and their foreign-competitors or to operate to the detriment of the commerce of the United States, or to be in violation of this Act. * * *\u201d The-act broadly forbids only contracts that are-\u201cunfair or unjustly discriminatory\u201d (section 14 [46 USCA \u00a7 812]), and the giving of \u201cany undue or unreasonable preference or advantage\u201d (section 16 [46 USCA \u00a7 815]). It thus seems evident that Congress has set up-a standard for the shipping business quite-different from that applicable to trade agreements affecting business on land. Approval-under section 15, supra, does not depend on whether a trade agreement fixes rates or restricts competition, but on whether it injures the welfare of the industry. The determination of whether an agreement fixing rates is for the benefit of the industry or is an unreasonable and oppressive burden which cannot be justified requires a special fact finding tribunal having an intimate acquaintance-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>with the needs and practices of the business \u25a0and constant experience in resolving the merits of conflicting interests in a vast and complicated industry. We have no doubt that the questions arising in this case should be passed upon by the Shipping Board, and that the Shipping Act created a tribunal \u2022adapted to exercise this precise function.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The most important objection to the conclusion of the trial court that the jurisdiction of the Shipping Board is primary and exclusive is due to the provision of section 15 (46 USCA \u00a7 814) of the Shipping Act that \u2022agreements made after the organization of the Shipping Board' \u201cshall be lawful only \u25a0when and as long as approved by the board, \u2022and before approval or after disapproval it shall be unlawful to carry out in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, any such agreement. * * *\u25a0\u201d While 'section 15 excepts from the operation of the Sherman Act, and acts supplementary thereto, agreements \u201clawful under this section,\u201d it excepts none other, \u2022and, as the agreement set forth in the amended bill is alleged not to have been approved 'by the Board, it is ex vi termini unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">It is said that the foregoing clause leaves \u2022a private suitor free to seek an injunctive remedy under the Clayton Act so long as the agreement has not been filed and approved. Doubtless the government would have such a right, but it does not follow that \u2022the right inheres in private persons. The Shipping Act provides complete remedies for .all the alleged wrongs, and, in the absence of investigation by the Shipping Board, it is impossible to say whether there is a substantial grievance. The exception as to \u201capproved\u201d agreements seems to have been inserted in the act in order to make it clear that some agreements may be sanctioned by the Shipping Board which would offend the Anti-Trust Acts, rather than for the purpose \u25a0of retaining remedies which under the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA \u00a7 1 et seq.) and the Packers <em>&amp; </em>Stockyards Act (7 USCA \u00a7 181 et seq.) have been held to be superseded by remedies afforded by those acts. Keogh v. C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., 260 U. S. 156, 43 S. Ct. 47, 67 L. Ed. 183; Sullivan v. Union Stockyards Co. (C. C. A.) 26 F.(2d) 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Section 15 of the Shipping Act (46 USCA \u00a7 814) provides that every carrier by water \u201cshall file immediately with the board a true copy, or, if oral, a true and complete memorandum, of every agreement, with another such carrier * * * to which it may be a party * * * fixing or regulating transportation rates or fares; giving or receiving special rates, accommodations, or other special privileges or. advantages; controlling, regulating, preventing, or destroying competition; * * * or in any manner providing for an exclusive, preferential, or cooperative working arrangement. * * *\u201d The Board shall approve such agreements as it does not find \u201cto be unjustly discriminatory or unfair.\u201d Section 14 (46 USCA \u00a7 812) prohibits agreements to allow \u201cdeferred rebate\" and likewise prohibits \u201cunfair or unjustly discriminatory\u201d contracts with shippers \u201cbased on the volume of freight offered.\u201d Section 16 (46 USCA \u00a7 815) provides that it shall be unlawful for any common carrier \u201cto make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, locality, or description of traffic in any respeet whatsoever, or to subject any particular person, locality, or description of traffic to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respeet whatsoever.\u201d Section 17 (46 USCA \u00a7 816) prohibits carriers by water from demanding any rate that is \u201cunjustly discriminatory\u201d and authorizes the Board to make orders to discontinue charging such rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">It appears from the foregoing that the failure <em>to secure the approval of such an </em>agreement as is alleged, the granting of deferred rebates, the alleged spreading of false rumors about the business of the plaintiff, and the persuasion of shippers to cancel existing contracts with it, are all forbidden by the Shipping Act, and come either within its express prohibitions or within the general language of section 16 (46 USCA \u00a7 815), which makes it unlawful \u201cto subject any particular person * * * to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respeet whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">Section 17 (46 USCA \u00a7 816) specifically authorizes the Board to order that a carrier discontinue \u201cany * \u25a0* * unjustly_discrim-inatory or prejudicial rate.\u201d Section 22 (46 USCA \u00a7 821) allows \u201cany person\u201d to file with the Board a complaint setting forth \u201cany violation of tfie Act\u201d by a common carrier by water and asking reparation for the injury, if any, caused thereby. It provides that the Board shall \u201cinvestigate it in such manner and by such means, and make such order as it deems proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">The words of section 22 (46 USCA \u00a7 821) authorizing the Board upon complaint and investigation to \u201cmake such order as it deems proper\u201d and to \u201cdirect the payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>* * * of full reparation,\u201d and the words of section 17 (46 USCA \u00a7 816) authorizing the Board to make an order that the carrier shall discontinue charging any \u201cunjustly discriminatory or prejudicial rate, fare, or charge,\u201d afford ample remedies for all the, \u2022wrongs recited in the amended bill., Section 29 (46 USCA \u00a7 828) covers the enforcement of orders of the Board against recalcitrant persons and provides that any party injured by the violation of an order \u201cmay apply to a district court having jurisdiction of the parties; and if, after hearing, the court determines that the order was regularly made and duly issued, it shall enforce obedience thereto by a writ of injunction or other proper process, mandatory or otherwise.\u201d Section 31 (46 USCA \u00a7 830) makes the judicial procedure in regard to orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission applicable to orders of the Shipping Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We believe we have shown that, where a tribunal like the Shipping Board has been created with supervisory powers over a business and with peculiar facilities for dealing with complicated questions of administration and economies, the remedies afforded under the aet creating it ought to be exhausted before recourse may be had to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The Shipping Board may determine whether any agreement such as is described in the bill has actually been made, and, if it has, may order it filed and require the parties to cease from acting under it unless and until it is approved. Under section 22 of the aet (46 USCA \u00a7 821) the Board may award reparation to the plaintiff for any wrongs it has suffered because of practices forbidden by sections 14 and 16 and under section 17 (46 USCA \u00a7 816) may require the defendants to discontinue any unjustly discriminatory rates. Proof of the existence and extent of the grievances complained of will require investigations in a special field demanding expert knowledge. The alternative to proceeding before the Board seems appalling. In every ease where complaints like the present are made by private persons, it would be necessary for a court to enter upon the trial of an anti-trust suit in order to determine whether the alleged illegal combination and practices exist and at any moment to become substantially ousted of jurisdiction by the filing of the agreement (if shown to have been entered into), with a resultant reference to the Shipping Board of the question as to how far it should be canceled, modified, or approved. It is difficult to suppose that Congress ever intended to give private parties two sets of remedies, under each of which reparation as well as other relief might be had, and still harder to imagine that these remedies might be pursued pari passu. If suits for violations of the Anti-Trust Acts cannot be brought either at law or in equity against land carriers, though the Interstate Commerce Aet has in terms preserved judicial remedies, it is hard to see why they may be brought against ocean carriers, where the .Shipping Aet contains no such reservation and has provided for the approval of agreements which, at least so far as the parties are concerned, may not accord with the requirements of the Anti-Trust Acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">No doubt, if the allegations in the amended bill are' found to be correct, the Anti-Trust Acts have been violated, but the . Shipping Act has been violated as well. Though the remedies under the Anti-Trust Acts are thought by plaintiff\u2019s counsel to apply, it does not follow that they do, where the frame of the Shipping Act indicates another procedure. We find that all the wrongs alleged are violations of the Shipping Act, and hold that the plaintiff must seek its remedy thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">It is said that the present suit ought to- ' lie-because the Shipping Board has already held in the proceeding of Eden Mining Co. v. Bluefields Fruit <em>&amp; </em>Steamship Co., 1 U. S. S. B. 41, that exclusive contracts similar to those set forth in the amended bill are-unlawful. It is true that certain decisions-under the Interstate Commerce Aet to some-extent support this reasoning. Mitchell Coal Co. v. Penna. R. R. Co., 230 U. S. 247, 33 S. Ct. 916, 57 L. Ed. 1472; National Pole Co. v. Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. (C. C. A.) 211 F. 65. But the Interstate Commerce Aet preserved legal and equitable remedies,whereas the Shipping Act contains no such reservations, and prior resort should be had to it as to all matters within its jurisdiction. Moreover, without having a burdensome trial, it is impossible to know whether the situations in the Eden proceeding and the present suit are parallel. Certainly they are -prima facie much less comparable than eases relating to rates of transportation for identical' services, where in one of them the rate-making function has already beqn exercised, as in Mitchell Coal Co. v. Penna. R. R., supra. The difficulty with treating a single decision of the Shipping Board as a binding precedent, where it deals with a rate agreement involving complicated and difficult questions of law and fact, may be appreciated by exam-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>fining the opinion of Judge Lacombe in United States v. Prince Line (D. C.) 220 F. 230, in which the three other Circuit Judges \u2022of this circuit concurred. It held that an \u2022extensive combination of steamship companies, which had agreed upon rates, restricted \u2022competition, and even granted rebates, was .not so far repugnant to the \u201crule of reason\u201d that it violated the Sherman Act. Irrespective of the legal merits of that decision as a precedent for the construction of the Sherman Act, it certainly indicates how slight a \u2022basis the interpretation of a single trade \u25a0agreement furnishes for settling the law relating to other combinations. Especially is this so since the creation of the Ship- \u25a0 ping Board and the delegation to it of broad powers to approve trade <em>agreements </em>which will benefit the shipping business as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">It may possibly be suggested that the facts set forth in the amended bill have been .admitted on demurrer and that consequently no administrative questions are left for determination by the Shipping Board. But the Shipping Act, as we have already said, does . not provide that nothing* contained therein ' \u201cshall in any way abridge or' alter the rem- \u2022 edies * * * existing at common law or by statute,\u201d but, by its own terms, empowers the Board to \u201cmake such order as it deems proper\u201d to remedy private wrongs and also \u25a0 empowers any injured person to apply to the courts for enforcement of orders of the Board which are not obeyed. Not only, therefore, may the Board consider and determine \u2022questions of law as well as of fact affecting matters within its jurisdiction, but admissions taken to be made because of the motion to dismiss, which was founded primarily \u2022 on the objection that the plaintiff had no right to apply for an injunction in advance \u2022of resort to the Shipping Board, cannot justify the continuance of the present suit. It is notorious that such charges as are made here are not disposed of by admissions, but \u2022in the end result in protracted trials and in the resolution of complicated problems, and \u2022disputed questions of fact and economics. A choice must be made between the two possible \u25a0remedies of a suit under the Anti-Trust Acts and a proceeding before the Shipping Board. Every practical consideration favors resort to a tribunal specially equipped and experienced to deal with such matters. The Shipping Board seems to have been designed to aid the courts and to relieve them by its investigation and preliminary determination. We think that every reason of policy and convenience should prompt the courts to \u201ctake arms against a sea of troubles\u201d by requiring resort to the Shipping Board in situations like the present. That tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction here, because of the nature of the questions involved and the broad powers given to it under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">It is argued that private suits for violation of the anti-trust statutes ought to lie by the analogy of the decisions under the Eederal Trade Commission Act (15 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 41-51). But that act not only in terms preserves remedies under the Anti-Trust Acts, as the Shipping Act does not, but, under the ruling of the Supreme Court, is held not to afford private persons an administrative remedy. The analogy therefore fails. Federal Trade Comm. v. Klesner, 280 U. S. 19, 50 S. Ct. 1, 74 L. Ed. 138, 68 A. L. R. 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">It seems clear that any disposition of this suit other than that by the court below would not only add enormously to judicial labors, but would hopelessly complicate the situation we have before us by applying ,two separate and in some respects inconsistent remedies to transactions already difficult enough in themselves. We hold that the analogy of the decisions under the Interstate Commerce Act is complete, and that the broad powers given by the Shipping Act furnish added reasons for denying injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b119-14\">SWAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Al_\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-15\">I am not convinced that the Shipping Act (46 USCA \u00a7 801 et seq.) should be construed to oust the courts of jurisdiction to issue an injunction under the circumstances here disclosed. The agreement under which the carriers acted and are threatening to act to plaintiff's prejudice has not been filed with and approved by the Board. Hence the acts don\u00e9 under it are forbidden by the Shipping Act as well as by the Sherman AntiTrust Act (15 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 1-7, 15). Conceded-1 y, on the facts alleged, the plaintiff should have an injunction unless this remedy has been taken away from him because similar relief may be obtained from the Shipping Board. The act does not expressly repeal existing rights and remedies, and repeals by implication are not favored. An injunction forbidding the carriers from acting under the agreement unless and until they shall file it and obtain the Board\u2019s approval of it would in no way hamper the Board\u2019s administrative functions; indeed, under the allegations of the complaint (admitted by the demurrer), the Board could not legally ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>prove the agreement, nor can I see that such an injunction would he inconsistent with the rights and remedies given the plaintiff by the Shipping Act. The attempt to apply the principle that repeals by implication are not favored leads me to the belief that the similar injunctive relief which I have assumed the plaintiff might obtain from the Board, though the language of the act does not seem to be so clear as to put the matter entirely beyond question, should be considered an additional remedy, not a remedy in substitution for that which the plaintiff might seek in the courts. While the construction placed by the Supreme Court on the Act to Regulate Commerce in such cases as Keogh v. C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., 260 U. S. 156, 43 S. Ct. 47, 67 L. Ed. 183, and Texas &amp; Pac. Ry. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U. S. 426, 27 S. Ct. 350, 51 L. Ed. 553, 9 Ann. Cas. 1075, tends to support the view taken by my colleagues, I do not regard the decisions as controlling of the present problem. In the Keogh Case the rates complained of as violating plaintiff\u2019s rights had been approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and in the Abilene Case the tariff schedule had been duly filed and published and not found unreasonable by the Commission. In the ease at bar, however, the agreement complained of has not been, and cannot legally be, approved by the Shipping Board. I think the decree should be reversted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
