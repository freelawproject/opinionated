He represented certain coal mines, and under date of July 8, 1921, entered into three contracts with appellee railway company for the sale to the latter of coal. The contracts are identical, except that they are for different quantities, being for 70,000, 35,000, and 65,000 tons,, respectively, each terminating March 31, 1922, and specifying two kinds of coal, viz., \u201cmine run\u201d and \u201cegg,\u201d at appellee\u2019s option, \u201cmine run\u201d at $2.70 and \u201cegg\u201d at $2.90 per ton. The contracts specified the mines to supply the coal, and provided that the ap-pellee should \u201cplace orders for daily shipments of coal under this contract in as uniform daily amounts as practicable, due allowance being made- for the accumulation of a reasonable amount of coal in stock by the Railway at times when the natural conditions make it advisable to accumulate such stock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-17\">The practice was for appellee to send Murray weekly orders specifying the daily requirements for the week, which orders were transmitted by him 'to the mines, which thereupon shipped the coal to the points directed, notifying both Murray and appel-lee; and therefrom Murray rendered to ap-pellee monthly invoices\u2019, upon receiving which appellee paid Murray.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-19\">It appears that during the last three months of the contracts there were shipped to appellee 34,000 tons of \u201cmine\" run\u201d and 27,580.31 tons of \u201cegg\u201d; but the written orders which appellee from time to time placed for all this coal specified \u201cspecial mine run\u201d coal, none of. them specifying \u201cegg.\u201d The invoices, however, which Murray, sent ap-pellee during that period specified \u201cmine run\u201d and \u201cegg\u201d in the above-indicated aggregates; but in each of these invoices the price stated for all the coal was $2.70 per ton, and it was at this price that appellee made its settle* ments with Murray.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-20\">\u2022 The action was for the difference on the \u201cegg\u201d coal between the contract price of $2.-90 pe\u00ed; ton and the $2.70 per ton which ap-pellee paid. The cause was heard by the court without a jury, and judgment was given for appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-21\">Murray testified that just prior to the beginning of the last three-month period Sed-don, who was appellee\u2019s purchasing agent, asked him to include in future shipments as much \u201cegg\u201d coal as was possible, and that it was because of this oral request of Seddon that the \u201cegg\u201d coal was thenceforth included. Seddon, testifying some seven years after the occurrence, when he was an old man and retired from his near half century of employment with appellee, said that some such conversation did take place, but he did not know whether any orders had ever been placed on such basis. While at first seeming to confirm Murray\u2019s version, he afterwards stated that on his own initiative he requested that \u201cegg\u201d coal be sent for one week as an experiment, and that he was not certain how it happened to be sent thereafter. Prom a reading of his testimony it does not appear to be definite or convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-22\">It does not definitely appear how appellee came to employ the term <em>\u201cspecial </em>mine run\u201d in its orders. The contracts do not specify such grade. It was testified that it might indicate a modified \u201cmine run\u201d or a modified \u201cegg.\u201d It is very possible that in the conversation between Murray and Seddon \u25a0 it was suggested that somewhat larger coal be supplied, short of the grade of \u201cegg,\u201d and that thereafter the order specified \u201cspecial mine run\u201d while the mines called it \u201cegg,\u201d and Murray charged it at $2.70.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Murray was not a producer of coal, but a seller, whose business was not so large but that it was* conducted by himself and his stenographer; and yet it appears that for four years after the billing, by him of the \u201cegg\u201d coal at $2.70 per ton, and payment therefor on that basis, he did not, as. he testified, know of the supposed error, and became aware of it then only through an examination of his books by income tax agents of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">The fact that one in Murray\u2019s situation did not in all that time discover this error against him, involving over $5,000, was a circumstance tending to corroborate the conclusion that at the time of the transactions <em>\u201cegg\u201d </em>instead of \u201cmine run\u201d coal was sent for shippers\u2019 convenience, or that it was then mutually understood by the parties that the price should not be in excess of $2.70 for any of the coal. Such conclusion finds further corroboration in the testimony of witnesses to the effect that the grades were produced by screening the coal, and that in filling their orders the mines would frequently accumulate a larger supply of \u201cegg\u201d than was needed, and, in order to keep their mines running and shipments moving, would often supply \u201cegg\u201d upon orders for \u201cmine run.\u201d This would tend to explain how it happened that, while no \u201cegg\u201d was specified in appel-lee\u2019s orders, \u201cegg\u201d was billed, but was priced and paid for as \u201cmine run,\u201d which would tend to support appellee\u2019s contention that the supplying of the \u201cegg\u201d upon orders for \u201cmine run\u201d was for the convenience of the shippers of the coal.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The controversy involves facts only, and the District Court heard the contradictory evidence thereon \u2014 largely of witnesses testifying in open court. We are not at liberty to disturb the court\u2019s findings, and its judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
