The fact is that the plaintiff\u2019s advertising slogan was \u201cLooks like a phonograph but is a furnace,\u201d in variant forms; and in many ways plaintiff\u2019s advertising emphasized the idea that the \u201cHeatrola\u201d looked like a phonograph, but really was not. In a broad way, as to the public impression produced, there is not much substantial difference between the fact and our erroneous assumption ; but defendant had a right to make this style of heater, and to use as an advertising text its resemblance to a phonograph; and, lacking that specific and unpermissible appropriation which we mistakenly found, defendant\u2019s conduct cannot be made the basis of legal condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-24\">Our former decision must be vacated, *,nd the decree below affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
