According to the reeord, the \u201cChicken of the Sea\u201d trade-mark has been used by opposer and its predecessors since 1914, and opposer spends approximately $60,000 annually in advertising this brand' of tuna. Its sales, amounting to approximately five million cans annually, are made in all parts of the United States, and in Hawaii and Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">Appellee has used the term \u201cWhite Chicken\u201d on its goods since October 14, 1926. The Commissioner held that the goods of the two parties were identical, and that the only question involved for his decision was the question of confusion. He states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-11\">\u201c \u2018 In the ruling in the adjudicated case of Van Camp Sea Food Co., Inc. v. Westgate Sea Products Co., 28 F.(2d) 957 (C. C. A. 9th Cir.) it was finally determined that the notation \u2018Breast o\u2019 Chicken,\u2019 was not confusingly similar to the opposeris mark \u2018Chicken of the Sea.\u2019 The court found that the word \u2018chicken\u2019 had been widely used in a descriptive sense in connection with various foods, including fish, and that the opposer was not entitled to claim exclusive rights to the use of this word alone. Since the mark of the applicant here .\u2018White Chicken,\u2019 is obviously no more similar to the opposeris mark than is the mark of the defendant in the adjudicated case, the finding of the court in that case is regarded as determinative of the question of similarity of the\u2019 marks involved in the instant proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">The reeord shows that the Van Camp Sea Food Company Ine., brought suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Westgate Sea Products Company for infringement of its mark \u201cChicken of the Sea,\u201d and alleged that the defendant\u2019s infringing mark was \u201cBreast o\u2019Chicken.\u201d The District Court dismissed the bill without hearing evidence. Appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, which court held [Van Camp Sea Food Co., Inc., v. Westgate Sea Products Co., 28 F.(2d) 957, 958] that the trial judge had the right to dismiss the bill without taking evidence. The Circuit Court of Appeals stated, evidently inadvertently, that the West-gate Products Company caused its \u201cBreast o\u2019 Chicken\u201d trade-mark to be registered. It is conceded that the term had not been registered. The court then held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-15\">\u201cWere the word \u2018chieken,\u2019 common to the two trade-marks, a purely fanciful term, and made equally prominent in both, we might have a case of sufficient doubt to warrant a hearing of evidence. But, as registered, the two combinations are similar neither in appearance nor in sound, and if, as appellant contends, it be conceded that \u2018chicken\u2019 is the dominant word in its combination, it cannot be said to have such prominence in that of the defendant. Moreover, \u2018chicken,\u2019 as used by the plaintiff, is not a purely fanciful term, but is measurably descriptive. Truei in its primary or most popular meaning, it designates the young of the domestic hen, and less, commonly, the young of wild birds, but it is sometimes used to denote living things of the sea as well as of the land. Its application has been so extended apparently because in a figurative sense it has come to signify something young and tender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-16\">\u201cAt page 336 of volume 2 of Murray\u2019s New English Dictionary of the Philological Society it is stated that, since early in the 1700\u2019s, \u2018chicken\u2019 has been so used as denoting a young and inexperienced person, and in Farmer and Henley\u2019s Dictionary of Slang and Colloquial English it is said that \u2018tender as chicken\u2019 dates backs to the fourteenth century. In the Century Dictionary it is referred to as a name applied with qualifying adjectives to various fishes. In the same work chicken halibut is defined as \u2018a halibut weighing from ten to twenty pounds.\u2019 And in the edition published as early as 1889 chicken lobster is said to be \u2018an undersized lobster,\u2019 too small to be legally marketable under the laws of some states. It will thus be seen that the term is not only more or less' generally applied to sea life, but, when so used, it is understood to be descriptive of class or quality. We are not to be understood as necessarily holding that plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark is invalid; the combination as a whole may have validity. But, in view of 'the considerations just suggested&gt; appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>lant cannot, as in effect it seeks to do, abandon all but tbe word \u2018chicken\u2019 and claim that as its trade-mark. \u2018Chicken,\u2019 when applied to tuna, would, as when applied to halibut or lobster, denote young and tender meat, and hence would be descriptive of quality. That terms merely descriptive of quality cannot be appropriated as trademarks is too well settled to require citation of authorities. On the point that generally a registered trade-mark is to be considered as an entirety, see John Morrell &amp; Co. v. Hauser Packing Co. (C. C. A.) 20 F.(2d) 713; Ostermoor <em>&amp; </em>Co. v. Rose Spring &amp; Mattress Co., 55 App. D. C. 307, 5 F.(2d) 268; Loughran v. Quaker City, etc. (C. C. A.) 296 F. 822; Beckwith v. Commissioner of Patents, 252 U. S. 538, 40 S. Ct. 414, 64 L. Ed. 705.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">The record shows that, after the decision by the Circuit Court of Appeals, supra, a suit by the Van Camp Sea Food Company was begun against the appellee herein in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, Central Division, and that in September, 1930, that court held in substance, among other things, that there was not sufficient similarity between the alleged trade-marks to produce confusion, and that the mark \u201cWhite Chicken\u201d did not infringe \u201cChicken of the Sea,\u201d and that the defendant had not committed acts of unfair competition against the plaintiff. It also held that the term \u201cof the Sea,\u201d when used on a fish product, designated the place from which the product came, and added nothing to the descriptive word \u201cchicken,\u201d and that the legend \u201cChicken of the Sea\u201d was therefore invalid when used as a trade-mark for tuna.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">Under the statute, our duties in reviewing decisions of the Commissioner of Patents in trade-mark cases are quite different from those of a District or Circuit Court of Appeals in actions such as have been hereinbefore referred to. We determine the correctness of the Commissioner\u2019s ruling on the registrability of the trade-mark. The District and Circuit Courts of Appeals, in the above cases, were not concerned with this question. Our jurisdiction involves the question of the right to register, while the jurisdiction in the eases above referred to involves the right to use. California Packing Corp. v. Tillman &amp; Bendel, 40 F.(2d) 108, 17 C. C. P. A. 1048; B. F. Goodrich Co. v. Hockmeyer, 40 F.(2d) 99, 17 C. C. P. A. 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">Section 5 of the .Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905 (15 USC\u00c1 \u00a7 85) provides definitely that a trade-mark shall not be registered if such mark is so similar to a mark owned and used by another, when used upon goods of the same descriptive properties, as to be likely to cause confusion. It also provides definitely that the mark shall not be registered if it consists merely in words which are descriptive of the goods with which it is used or of the character or quality of such goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">While the decisions of the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals, supra, involved issues which differ from those at bar, it is true that in their decisions they made certain findings with which we are concerned. We do not understand that their decisions on the subject of the descriptive quality of the term \u201cChicken of the Sea\u201d or their findings on the question of similarity between \u201cChicken of the Sea\u201d and \u201cBreast o\u2019Chieken\u201d in an infringement action are to be considered by us as res adjudieata or controlling of the issue of the registrability of the term \u201cWhite Chicken.\u201d Decisions of this character, when applicable, ought to be and are entitled to great respect here and by the Patent Office tribunals. They are, however, to be regarded as persuasive but not conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">If \u201cChicken of the Sea\u201d is descriptive of the goods, it is, of course, an invalid trademark, and should not have been registered, and, under the authority of the Trade-Mark Act, it could be cancelled upon, proper petition. If \u201cChicken of the Sea\u201d is descriptive, certainly \u201cWhite Chicken\u201d is more so. But, in view of our conclusion reached herein, it will not be necessary for us to determine whether or not \u201cWhite Chicken\u201d is either descriptive or misdeseriptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">The Commissioner of Patents should have refused registration of the term \u201cWhite Chicken\u201d for the reason, if for no other, that it was confusingly similar to \u201cChicken of the Sea,\u201d both marks being applied to goods of the same descriptive properties, and the word \u201cChicken\u201d being the predominant word of the terms in sound, appearance, and significance. The Commissioner of Patents in his decision, in determining the question of confusion, was, evidently, erroneously influenced by the same consideration that seemed to influence the decisions in the District Court and Circuit Court of Appeals above referred to, that is to say, that the word \u201cChicken\u201d is descriptive, and, when the same is eliminat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>ed, there was no confusion between the word \u201cWhite\u201d and the words \u201cof the Sea,\u201d and that \u201cChieken,\u201d being descriptive, should not be taken into consideration in determining the question of confusion. In this view of the case, it is regarded as proper for us to consider, somewhat in detail, the characteristics of the mark \u201cChieken of the Sea\u201d with respect to whether it is descriptive or suggestive, not with a view, however, of passing judgment upon the validity of appellant\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\"> While \u201cChicken of the Sea\u201d is somewhat suggestive, we cannot conclude that it is descriptive. We think it is an arbitrary and fanciful mark. Furthermore, the word \u201cChicken,\u201d when used in connection with the words \u201cof the Sea,\u201d is, in our opinion, not descriptive. If used alone on tuna, it is urged that it might be descriptive or misdescriptive. It is not used alone in appellant\u2019s mark, and should not be eliminated from consideration in the determination of the question of confusion. There is not one syllable of proof or one word of printed authority pointed out which supports a conclusion that there is such a thing as a chieken tuna. True enough, as has been suggested in the quoted portion of the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, in some instances the word \u201cChieken\u201d connotes immaturity. This is no doubt true when the word is applied to halibut, turtles, lobsters, and to female members of the human family, but, unless it is descriptive of tuna, it does not fall within the prohibition of the statute. The only testimony in the ease on this question is by a witness, connected with the appellant fish canning firm, who is familiar with the mark, and is to the effect that the word suggests white-meated tuna which is in layers like pressed chieken, and that some people think that the flavor of a certain kind of tuna resembles the flavor of the white meat of chieken. \u201cChicken of the Sea\u201d is surely not even suggestive of a fowl. It is well settled in adjudicated eases that a valid trademark may be highly suggestive (in our opinion cftimes the best ones are), without being offensively descriptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">In Le Blume Import Co. v. Coty (C. C. A.) 293 F. 344, 351, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-7\">\u201cThe Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905 (section 5 [15 USCA \u00a7 85]), denies registration to a mark which consists merely in words or devices which are descriptive of the goods with which they are used, or of the character or quality of such goods. It was claimed at the argument that Coty\u2019s trade-mark is descriptive, within the meaning of section 5, and so was incapable of registration. The general rule is unquestionable that a word which is descriptive of the article upon which it is used, of its ingredients, quantities, or characteristics, cannot be a valid trade-mark. Standard Paint Co. v. Trinidad Asphalt Manufacturing Co., 220 U. S. 446, 31 S. Ct. 456, 55 L. Ed. 536. The rule, however, is not without qualification. The cases show that the courts under certain circumstances protect the use of words as trade-marks, even though they suggest the ingredients, qualities, or characteristics of the goods. The distinction is between words which are \u2018descriptive\u2019 and those which are merely \u2018suggestive.\u2019 Neither is it necessary that words to be available as trade-marks should cany no suggestion of any meaning. The line of demarcation may not be easy to draw but it exists. See Nims on Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks (2d Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 200-202.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">In Orange Crush Co. v. California Crushed Fruit Co., 54 App. D. C. 313, 297 F. 892, 893, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-10\">\u201cThe Trade-Mark Act * * * prohibits the registration of a mark which consists \u2018merely in words or devices which are descriptive of the goods with which they are used, or of the character or quality of such goods.\u2019 In this provision Congress evidently intended to draw a distinction between descriptive and merely suggestive marks. Marks of the former character, as we many times have declared, are not suspeetible of exclusive appropriation, while those of the latter class may be. The difficulty is not so much in the statement of the rule as in its application to the facts of a particular case.\u201d '</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-12\">In United Lace &amp; Braid Mfg. Co. v. Barthels Mfg. Co. (D. C.) 221 F. 456, 461, we think the correct rule of distinction between trade-marks that are merely descriptive and those that are suggestive is stated in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-13\">\u201cThe utmost that can be said is that the term \u2018beaded,\u2019 as applied to these tips, is somewhat suggestive of their appearance. In other words, it is used figuratively. This, however, is not enough to take it out of the range of lawful appropriation as a trademark. Every good trade-mark is suggestive; once seen or heard, its association with the product is readily fixed in the mind. If there were no association of ideas between the two, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>it would require an independent effort of memory to recall the connection. It is not necessary to the validity of a trade-name that it should be utterly devoid of aptitude. It is enough that it leaves open to every one all words that are really descriptive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">While appellee here concedes that both trade-marks at bar are not descriptive, it certainly produces an anomalous situation for appellee to contend in an infringement suit that it has the right to use the term because it is descriptive and to contend in the Patent Office that it is not descriptive and is registrable. It is obvious that appellee seeks to reap where it has not sown. Doubts are resolved against the newcomer in trade-mark registration proceedings. Appellee is the newcomer, and in selecting its mark it should select one, not with a view of profiting by the confusion that would result, but with the purpose of avoiding confusion. There is no such poverty of words in the language of commercial men as to require the selection of a term as a trade-mark which confuses the public and invades property rights.
