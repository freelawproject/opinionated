Section 235 of Compiled Laws, page 563, provides that, \u201c until the expiration of the time allowed for redemption, the Court may restrain the commission of waste on the property; and, also, under the same section, \u201c but it shall not be deemed waste for the person in possession of the property at the time of the sale, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>entitled to possession afterwards, during the period allowed for redemption, to continue to use it in the same manner in which it was previously used.\u201d This section most clearly contemplates an adverse possession to the purchaser until the time has expired lor redemption. The succeeding section of the Act allowing to the purchaser the value of the use and occupation, affords the only remedy he is entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The judgment below is affirmed, and the petition is dismissed, at the costs of the petitioner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
