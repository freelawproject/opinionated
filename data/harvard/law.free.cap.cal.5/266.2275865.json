The defendant entered into the land in controversy when, according to the evidence, it had been for more than two years in possession of the plaintiffs, had been improved by them, and at the time of the entry, in their absence, was in express charge of their agents. There could not be legally any more conclusive evidence of actual possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">Let the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
