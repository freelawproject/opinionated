ROBINSON, Appellant, <em>v. </em>PIOCHE, BAYERQUE <em>&amp; </em>CO., Respondents.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b460-8\">Intoxication of the plaintiff is no defense to an action for damages for injuries caused by falling through an uncovered hole in the sidewalk of a public street.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-9\">Appeal from the Superior Court of the City of San Francisco.

B Hart, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-8\">Cited, Blake <em>v. </em>Feins, 1 Seld., 49. Earles <em>v. </em>Hall, 2 Met., 358. Mayor of New York <em>v. </em>Bailey, 2 Denio, 435, and cases cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b461-9\"><em>Cook &amp; Olds, </em>for Respondents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-10\">Drunkenness on the part of the plaintiff, was proper to be considered by the jury, in arriving at the fact as to whether the plaintiff was free from fault. Hartfield <em>v. </em>Roper, 21 Wend., 615. Lane <em>v. </em>Crombie, 12 Pick., 176. Pluckwell <em>v. </em>Wilson, 5 Car. &amp; P., 375. Williams <em>v. </em>Holland, 6 Ib., 23.

J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">The Court below erred in giving the third, fourth and fifth instructions. If the defendants were at fault in leaving an uncovered hole in the sidewalk of a public street, the intoxication of the plaintiff cannot excuse such gross negligence. A drunken man is as much entitled to a safe street, as a sober one, and much more in need of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
