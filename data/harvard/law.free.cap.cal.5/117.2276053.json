An examination of the record discloses that the canse was properly tried by the Court below. The question of jurisdiction has already been decided by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-15\">The District Court is a Court of general original jurisdiction, its process is eo-extensive with the State. Causes may be removed from one district or county to another county or district, in the maimer provided by statute; but this, I apprehend, would not be permitted after the party had appeared and answered to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-16\">The appeal is clearly for delay. The judgment is therefore affirmed, with fifteen per cent, damages.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
