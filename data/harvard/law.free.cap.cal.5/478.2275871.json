A. Sutter to A. C. Peachy, and also a deed from said attorney to Frederick Billings. It does not appear that an exception to the admissibility of the deeds referred to, was taken on the trial of the cause. The point cannot, therefore, be considered on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">Second\u2014the Court erred in refusing to give the following instruction: \u201c If there is a reasonable uncertainty, as to whether the power of attorney introduced by plaintiff, includes this identical lot, defendant should have a verdict.\u201d From the record, it appears that evidence was submitted, tending to establish a tenancy in the defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s case, not depending alone on the evidence mentioned in the instruction, it was properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
