The Court also finds that the respondent did not re-deliver the scow as required by the agreement, nor did he make an offer equivalent to a delivery. Upon these findings, the Court gave judgment for respondent for the sum of eight hundred and two dollars, balance due.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The findings of the Court are conclusive as to the delivery of the wood, according to the agreement of the parties. From the answer of Hooker, the defendant in the Court below, it appears that Albretson called upon him at his house, situated about five miles from the <em>embarcadero </em>of Sonoma, and informed him that the scow was at the <em>embarcadero, </em>and that he, Albretson, was ready to deliver it. The respondent could do no more than announce his readiness to deliver\u2014treating the conditions of the contract to be performed by the respondent as conditions precedent, as appellant\u2019s counsel argues in his brief; yet the Court has found that he has performed all he was bound to perform, except the re-delivery of the scow, and the answer of Hooker is satisfactory upon that point,</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Id would need no authority to show that the party was not bound to deliver the vessel upon <em>dry land </em>at the residence of the defendant. The respondent could only be required to return the vessel in the same element in which he found it; and in the absence of a place designated in the contract, to return it to the place from which it was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">The notice of a readiness to deliver, given to the person owning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>vessel, where he does not see fit to come forward and accept the delivery, must be treated under the contract as an actual delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The answer shows that the finding of the Court upon the subject of the delivery of the vessel, was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The judgment of tise Court below is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
