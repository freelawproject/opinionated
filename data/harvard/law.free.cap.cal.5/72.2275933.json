The depositions were read to them, and this was done during the absence of the prisoner. The rule is familiar that the prisoner, in a case of felony, must be present during the whole of his trial; and reading evidence taken by deposition, although it was done after the jury had retired, is a part of the trial as much as any other. In favor of life, the strictest rule which has any sound reason to sustain it, will not be relaxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-16\">The judgment is reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
