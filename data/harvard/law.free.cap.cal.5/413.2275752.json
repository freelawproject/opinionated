The question was hypothetical, and assumed a certain state of facts not in proof. As this was one of the principal items of the plaintiff\u2019s demand, it must result that this testimony induced part of the verdict rendered by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The Court below, in delivering its opinion upon the motion for a new trial, admits that the question thus asked, is objectionable, both in form and substance; but seems to think it admissible, by a misapprehension of the decision of this Court, in the case of Innis <em>v. </em>The Steamer Senator, 1 Cal., 459. An examination of that case, will show that there is no analogy between it and the one before us, and that the question there asked of the witness was neither speculative or hypothetical.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">For these reasons, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
