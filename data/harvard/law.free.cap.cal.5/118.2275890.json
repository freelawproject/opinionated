SMITH, Respondent, <em>v. </em>A. D. BROWN, Garnishee of Hutchinson, Greene &amp; Co., Appellant.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b118-8\">A garnishee should be allowed to amend his answer whenever it appears that he has committed a mistake or fallen into an error, which could not reasonably have been avoided.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b118-9\">This Court will not interfere ill this respect with the proceedings of the Court below, unless the record shows a gross abuse of discretion.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b118-10\">An order requiring a garnishee to pay into Court the amount for which judgment has been rendered against him, may be considered as improper.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b118-11\">Appeal from the District Court of the Sixth Judicial District, Sacramento County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-12\">The facts are stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b118-13\"><em>Winans </em>&amp; <em>Hyer </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-14\">The Court erred in refusing to permit the appellant <em>to </em>amend his answer. Carrique <em>v. </em>Sidebottom, 3 Met., 297. Pollock <em>v. </em>Hunt, 2 Cal, 193.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b118-15\"><em>Harmon </em>&amp; <em>Sunderland </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-16\">The petition of Brown <em>to </em>amend his answer discloses no new fact which, if allowed to be shown, would change his liability, and Courts will allow an answer of a garnishee to be amended in extreme cases only. Smith <em>v. </em>Babcock, 3 Sumner, 583.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b118-17\">Murray, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AVZ\">Heydenfeldt, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-18\">This appeal is taken from an order of the Court below, refusing appellant\u2019s application <em>to </em>amend his answer as garnishee.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-19\">The application was directed to the discretion of the Court, and as such discretion does not appear to have been grossly abused, we will not attempt to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-20\">To subserve the purposes of justice, Courts should allow a garnishee to amend his answer whenever it appears that he has committed a mistake or fallen into an error which could not reasonably have been avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-21\">This case shows no facts to recommend it to the interposition of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Court; but, on the other hand, all the circumstances might very well warrant the Court below in the suspicion of fraud, with which it has decided the whole transaction is tainted.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The whole proceeding of the District Court was irregular. It was the duty of the Court simply to render a judgment against the garnishee for tlie amount found due, and the order to pay the same into Court may be considered as improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">This, however, makes no difference in the substantial rights of the parties, as the plaintiff is entitled to have said money applied on his execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Judgment affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
