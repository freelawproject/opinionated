S WASHBURN, Respondent, <em>v. </em>SOLOMON E. ALDEN, SIMON B. HUNT, and LLOYD MINTURN, Appellants.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b463-5\">General words in powers of attorney are limited and controlled by particular terms and designations.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b463-6\">Where B authorizes A to do all acts in his name concerning their mining operations, followed by the authority to sign B\u2019s name to any company articles, does not authorize A to sign B\u2019s name to a promissory note, even where the money was used in carrying on their joint mining operations.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b463-7\">The authority to sign his name in this particular instance, is a limitation upon what might otherwise be considered a general power.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b463-8\">A defendant who has suffered default, is not a competent witness to prove that he was authorized by his co-defendant to sign his name to a note, as by so doing, he would reduce the amount of judgment against himself.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-9\">Appeal from the District Court of the Twelfth Judicial District, San Francisco County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-10\">The action was brought upon a promissory note, of which the following is a copy :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-11\">$500. <em>Grass </em>Valley, <em>April </em>24, 1851.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-12\">One day after date, we jointly and severally agree to pay Mowry W. Smith, or order, the sum of five hundred dollars, value received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-13\">Simon B. Hunt,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-14\">Solomon E. Alden,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-15\">By his Attorney, Simon B. Hunt,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-16\">Lloyd Minturn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-17\">The note was endorsed by Smith without recourse, and transferred to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-18\">Hunt suffered a default, and Alden answered, denying the execution of the note, and alleging that his name had been signed to it without his authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-19\">Plaintiff, in order to fix Alden\u2019s liability, produced a power of attorney from Alden to Hunt, authorizing him to perform, in Alden\u2019s name, all acts concerning certain mining operations, in which he and Hunt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>were engaged, and also empowering him to sign his name to any company articles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-5\">Plaintiff also offered to \u00a1Drove by Hunt, that Alden had authoriz ed him to sign the note, which testimony the Court ruled out. Plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-6\">It was in proof that the money for which the note had been given had been used in carrying on their joint mining operations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-7\">The Court decreed a nonsuit, and afterwards set the order aside and granted a new trial. Defendants appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b464-8\"><em>Haights &amp; Gary, </em>for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-9\">To the point that Hunt had no authority to bind Alden by signing the note, cited Rossiter <em>v. </em>Rossiter, 8 Wend., 494.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b464-10\"><em>G. P. Fobes, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-11\">In support of Hunt\u2019s authority, cited 21 Wend., 279. 6 Cow., 354. 2 Kent's Com., 792, 804. Ch. on Cont., 199. 15 Johns., 44. 10 Wend., 275. 17 Ohio, 466. 4 Met., 529. 4 Cow., 659. 1 Denio, 119. Hunt's testimony was admissible\u20144 McCord, 412.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b464-12\">Murray, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A6_\">Heydenfeldt, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">This is an appeal from an order setting aside a judgment of nonsuit, and granting a new trial. It does not appear from the record upon what ground the judgment was set aside, and we are therefore led to the conclusion, that it must have been in consequence of some supposed error committed on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-14\">It is a familiar principle, that general words in powers of attorney are limited and controlled by particular terms and designations. The authority granted by B to A, \u201c to do all acts in his name, concerning their mining operations,\u201d followed by the authority to sign B\u2019s name to any \u201c company articles,\u201d does not authorize A to sign B\u2019s name to a promissory note, even where the money was used for the purpose of carrying on their joint mining operations. The authority to sign his name, in this instance, is a limitation upon what might otherwise be considered a general power.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-15\">There was no error in excluding the testimony of Hunt; he was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>defendant, and had suffered a default. If admitted, to prove that he was authorized by Alden to sign the note, he would thereby have reduced the amount of the judgment against himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The order granting a new trial is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
