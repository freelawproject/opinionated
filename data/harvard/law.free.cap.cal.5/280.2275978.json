J., and Heydenfeldt, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">This is an action brought by the appellant for the purpose of obtaining a divorce. The complaint alleged an abandonment and desertion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>by the husband from his wife for over three years. The report of the referees, to whom the cause was referred establishes that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">There is no analogy between this cause and the case of Kashaw <em>v. </em>Kashaw, 3 Cal., 312, as the record seems to indicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In the case of Kashaw <em>v. </em>Kashaw, the wife followed the husband to this State, and having resided in the State less than six months, sued for a divorce. A question arose in that case as to domicil, it being held that the wife\u2019s domicil should be considered in the case referred to, as that of her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">. In the cause before us there is evidence of a palpable desertion upon the part of the husband, and for a time defined by law as sufficient to afford to the wife a proper reason for an application for a divorce. The desertion of the husband entitles the wife to her own domicil.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">We deem that the Court below erred in its ruling, and the judgment must be reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
