This is beyond the jurisdiction of the Justice as we have determined at this term in the case of Zander <em>v. </em>Coe. The judgment was therefore properly reversed by the County Court, but it should have dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">The reversal of the County Court is affirmed, and the cause dismissed from the consideration of the Justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
