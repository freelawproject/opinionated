The deed described the tract as containing thirteen and one-half acres, more or less. After the conveyance, a survey for the first time was made of the property, and it was found to contain eighteen and one-half acres. Prior to the sale, plaintiffs at different periods represented the tract to contain from ten to sixteen acres. Before the sale, plaintiffs had sold all the adjoining lands, leaving this strip unconnected with any other tract. On the day of making the deed, and before the same was made, the defendants objected to completing the purchase until the tract should be surveyed ; they were assured by Chipman, one of the plaintiffs, that the tract contained at least thirteen and one-half acres.' The contract was, that neither party should be responsible for excess of land or deficiency. The land was sold in gross, and not by the acre, and tile exact quantity of laud was not an essential element in the bargain. The Court gave judgment for the defendants, and plaintiffs appealed</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-9\"><em>A. M. Crane </em>and J. <em>B.
