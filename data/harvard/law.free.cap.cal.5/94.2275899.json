WHARTENBY and others, Respondents.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b94-11\">When an action has been commenced in a District Court in good faith for a sum greater than two hundred dollars, exclusive of interest, a judgment may be rendered for an amount less than the sum limiting the jurisdiction of the Court in the commencement of the action, as prescribed in the Constitution.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b94-12\">Appeal from the District Court of the Tenth Judicial District, Nevada County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-13\">The facts fully appear in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-14\"><em>E.

Bagley upon William B-Holmes, another Secretary of the \u201c Slate Creek Company,\u201d for money as wages due Hutt, which order was accepted by Holmes, as Secretary of the company, and transferred by Bagley &amp; Hildreth, or associates, to the plaintiff, for value received.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">It appears from the record sent up, that after the plaintiff had closed his case, having introduced evidence of his claims, that the Court, upon motion of defendants\u2019 counsel for a nonsuit, after stating that there was evidence sufficient to sustain a judgment for the sum of one hundred dollars in plaintiff\u2019s favor, proceeded to grant a nonsuit, assigning, as a reason, that the Court had no jurisdiction of such an amount. Section 6 of the sixth Article of the Constitution, provides that \u201c the District Courts shall have original jurisdiction in law and equity in all civil cases where the amount in dispute exceeds two hundred dollars, exclusive of interest.\u201d The amount here in dispute, as appears from the record, was eight hundred and fifty-one dollars, and the action seems to have been commenced in good faith for that amount. Where an action has been commenced in a District Court in good faith for a sum greater than two hundred dollars, exclusive of interest, a judgment may be rendered for an amount less than the sum prescribed by the Constitution limiting the jurisdiction of the Court in the commencement of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">It was error in the Court to grant a nonsuit in this cause; judgment below is, therefore, reversed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
