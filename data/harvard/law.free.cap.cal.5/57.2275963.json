The principal question raised by the record in the cause, is whether the use of the language, \u201c audited and approved,\u201d aud \u201c we certify the above to be correct,\u201d is language sufficient in the meaning of the statute to warrant us in the opinion, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>it constitutes an instrument of writing, and is not barred by that portion of the statutes of limitation applying to accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">We are of the opinion that the above language, used by the Trus-\u2019 tees of \u201c The Laura Virginia Association,created <em>a </em>liability of a higher character than that arising from a mere account, and that it constituted the matters sued upon, instruments of writing within the meaning of the statute; and,, that the Court below, therefore, erred in its judgment of law at the trial o\u00ed the cause, in holding the papers sued upon to be mere accounts, and the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">There seems to have been some irregularity in the proceedings at the trial of the cause, and we deem that the ends of justice may be better subserved by ordering a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The judgment of the Court below is, therefore, reversed with costs, and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
