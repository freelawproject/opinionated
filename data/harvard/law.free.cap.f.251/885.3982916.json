After testifying that he was a miner employed by the defendant company as a car dumper, plaintiff said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-4\">\u201cI was in the employ of defendant company as a car dumper, working underground on the 1,500-foot level of the defendant\u2019s mine on Douglas Island. Dor several years prior to the injury I had been in the employ of said company, and engaged in doing all kinds of laboring work inside the mine, except machine work. On the date mentioned there was working within 6 or 8 feet of me another employe of the defendant, by the name of \u2018Shortie,\u2019 whose work consisted in dumping ore cars over grizzlies into ore chutes. There was one large rock which \u2018Shortie\u2019 was endeavoring to break by striking it with a hammer, and while he was so engaged a piece of the rock flew from under the hammer so used by \u2018Shortie\u2019 and struek me in -the right eye, so injuring me that in consequence thereof I have entirely lost the sight of that eye.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">That was the whole of the testimony of plaintiff. Olson, the shift boss when the accident occurred, also an experienced miner, testified for plaintiff that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-6\">\u201cIn breaking rock with a hammer, when the hammer is 'swung from right to left against a rock, pieces of the rock are likely to be driven from the right to the left.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">Upon this evidence defendant moved for a nonsuit, on the ground that no evidence had been introduced showing or tending to show negligence on the part of defendant or its agents. The motion was granted, judgment went in favor of defendant, and plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">The position of plaintiff is best stated by the following quotation from his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-9\">\u201cA close scrutiny of the record discloses the fact that the plaintiff has made substantial proof of his injury, and, adopting the theory that an employer is required to exercise reasonable care in providing an employ\u00e9 with a safe place to work\u00bb and must be held unreasonable in damages for neglect of this duty, brings us to the conclusion that from the evidence presented there was sufficient proof upon which the trial court should have sent the case to the jury for its conclusions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-10\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> But there is no evidence of negligence on the part of defendant. There is nothing whatever tending to show that it was improper or careless for the mining compa.ny to use grizzlies in sorting the rock to fall into the ore'chutes below. Obviously, in using a grizzly, it is often necessary to break larger rocks by use of a hammer. There is nothing at all tending to show that \u201cShortie\u201d was careless in the manner in which he broke the rock, for in breaking any rock with a hammer pieces are likely to fly in various directions. Nor is there the slightest bit of evidence that the place in which the plaintiff was working was in itself unsafe, or that the work involved any hazard not usual or incidental to the risk of the employment plaintiff was engaged in.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Negligence is not to be inferred, but must be proved by the party charging it. The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is not applicable, for it is impossible to say that the accident and the circumstances under which it occurred naturally raise the presumption that the mining company violated any duty which the law imposed upon it.
