Whenever the Kim Company made such film, however, they wore to furnish Monchen with one exemplar \u201cexpressly designed to moot trade conditions in America.\u201d Leblanc by a separate writing substantially agreed to Monchen\u2019s arrangements with the Film Company. In 1916 De Croisset and Leblanc agreed with Monchen that the \u201cstage play,\u201d Arsene, Lupin, might be included among the stories aforesaid and used \u201cas the subject for the fh-st film to be produced\u201d under the agreements above referred to, and on the same date the Film Company received written permission from De Crol\u00bbset et al. to use the said stage play as \u201cthe subject for the first, film\u201d to be produced under the Film Company's arrangement with Menehen. Later in the same year the Film Company -as is alleged \u2014 \u201cby one Cromelin, for the benefit of\u201d the plaintiff, copyrighted in the United States a \u201cmotion picture photoplay\u201d called \u201cArsene Lupin, by Maurice Leblanc,\u201d and adapted by one 'tucker. In so doing Cromelin is said to have acted as \u201cagent of\u201d the Film Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-5\">Itarly in 191T defendants are alleged to have made a \u201cmotion picture photoplay\u201d of their own, described ast by one Paul Potter, called \u201cArsene Lupin,\u201d and depicting substantially the sequence of episodes and characters in De Croisset and Leblanc\u2019s drama as copyrighted in 1009, and this the defendant Vitagraph Company copyrighted in its own name. The bill, showing diversity of citizenship, prayed injunction against any \u201cdealing with\u201d defendant\u2019s play, an accounting, and that the copyright by defendant Vitagraph Company be adjudged null and void.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b273-6\">On motion, under rule 29 (ISO Fed. xxxiv, 79 C.

The language of the bill, construed by the contracts appended to and made part thereof, leaves us in considerable doubt as to the pleader\u2019s intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">Viewed as a copyright bill it must rest either on the registration of 1909 as to the drama or \u201cstage play,\u201d or that of 1916, by Cromelin, of the motion picture photoplay. In either aspect it falls on the face of the pleading, because as to the first assumption there is no endeav- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>or to show or allege ownership of the copyright of 1909, or to negative as to defendant\u2019s production the fact that there may be a separable and several copyrightable property in the photoplay, though it tells substantially the same story as does the earlier stage play. Harper v. Kalem, 169 Fed. 61, 94 C. C. A. 429, affirmed 222 U. S. 55, 32 Sup. Ct. 20, 56 L. Ed. 92, Ann. Cas. 1913A, 1285. In respect of the second supposition, the registration by Cromelin is, as pleaded, void, for under the act no power exists in an \u201cagent\u201d to copyright anything; that privilege is reserved to \u201cauthors or proprietors.\u201d Act March 4, 1909, c.,320, \u00a7 8, 35 Stat. 1077 (U. S. Comp. Stat. .\u00a7 9524).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><bracketnum>_ [3]</bracketnum> The only meaning we can extract from the bill \u2014 if it does not fail for lack of ownership of any copyright, nor rest on that statute \u2014is that plaintiff believes and intends to assert that defendants are enjoying profits from a film or the story depicted thereon, made by the Fondon Film Company, and by that concern permitted to be sold and exhibited in the United States in violation of the series of contracts above summarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">But it is not so pleaded; on the contrary, the bill declares that, months after Cromelin\u2019s registration of what Tucker had adapted, defendants made their own film from a scenario by Potter. To be sure, it is plain enough that both these writers derived their ideas from the stage play of 1909; but it is not even alleged that Potter infringed (i. e., substantially copied) Tucker. Much less is it stated that defendants have obtained or pretend to have any rights derived by assignment or otherwise from Cromelin, De Croisset, Feblanc, or the Fondon Film Company, or that any of the foregoing is co-operating with defendants, or deriving profit from what they have done and are doing.</p>\n<p id=\"AqJ\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> The only other contention possible on the part of appellants is that because they procured from Feblanc and De Croisset the exclusive right to make films depicting the story of \u201cArsene Fupin,\u201d and reserved the United States as their own territory, when assigning that right to Fondon Film Company, therefore they have, independent of all copyright registration by any one, or without such registration, the right to pursue in equity those who by photoplay -tell the same story within the reserved territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">This, of course, assumes that, if De Croisset and Feblanc had never copyrighted Arsene Fupin in this country, they could have brought such an action as this. Whatever might have been possible without seeking copyright protection, it is pleaded that these authors did take out copyright in 1909, and that extinguished their so-called common-law rights. Photo-Drama Co. v. Social, etc., Co., 220 Fed. 448, 137 C. C. A. 42. Therefore nothing but a copyright bill will serve, and as above stated the suit is not sustainable on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Decree affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
