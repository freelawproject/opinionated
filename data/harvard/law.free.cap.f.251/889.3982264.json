IS, 40 Slat. 82. At the argument, however, the question was abandoned, and an examination of the record discloses no oilier point that needs discussion. Edward Banks and his wife were indicted and convicted for furnishing liquor to soldiers in uniform, and in each case there was direct and positive testimony connecting the defendant with the charge. The verdicts are therefore beyond our power.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">Each judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
