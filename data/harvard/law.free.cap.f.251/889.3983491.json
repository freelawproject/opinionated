Judge Chattfield in the District Court, who remanded the relator, also allowed the appeal, and has refused a stay. If I had allowed the appeal, I would have had power to grant a stay; but the case is now-in the Circuit Court of Appeals, and I do not think a single judge of the court has power to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">The motion is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
