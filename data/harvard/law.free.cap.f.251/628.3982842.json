C. A. \u2014), we held that the two patents \u2014 i. e., Nos. 1,028,790 and 968,590 \u2014 did not cover the same ground and were both valid. This we now reaffirm. The alleged infringing machine being made, as we find, in accordance with the disclosures of the Stiles patent, was protected thereby, and appellant\u2019s act was properly treated as an infringement of appellee\u2019s Stiles patent, and enjoined accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-18\">The decree of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
