This contention must be rejected both on principle and authority. See Yates v. Jones National Bank, 206 U. S. 158, <em>27 </em>Sup. Ct. 638, 51 L. Ed. 1002; Thomas v. Taylor, 224 U. S. 73, 32 Sup. Ct. 403, 56 L. Ed. 673; Witters v. Soules (C. C.) 31 Fed. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Appellant further contends that the general finding quoted above must give way to a special finding made by the master to the effect that the \u201cprofit and loss account\u201d was at times \u201cswollen\u201d by the credit of so-called \u201cdummy\u201d notes signed \u201cInterest and Discount,\u201d which notes represented the earned, but uncollected, interest on many obligations running to the bank, and such practice was known to the directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">This contention must likewise be rejected, because it does not appear from the record in this case that the apparent net profits, exclusive of this item of uncollected interest, did not equal or exceed the amount of the dividend so declared. In other words, the general findings are not inconsistent with the special finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Whether the directors were justified in including the earned, but uncollected, interest in determining net profits, we need not decide. The directors were justified in declaring an annual divideud out of the net profits. The record fails to show that any dividends were declared or paid out of the uncollected interest account.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
