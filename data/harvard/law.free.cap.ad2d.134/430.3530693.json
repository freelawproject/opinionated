The appellant established that the periodic contracts pursuant to which that work was performed had become less plentiful because of a decline in exploratory oil drilling. Moreover, he actively sought work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>in the marine diving field for a number of months before accepting temporary employment performing unrelated, less lucrative work. There is no basis in this record for an inference that the appellant\u2019s undisputed reduction in income was self-imposed for the purpose of avoiding his support obligations (c<em>f., Hickland v Hickland, </em>39 NY2d 1, <em>cert denied </em>429 US 941).</p><p id=\"b473-4\">Considering the current, albeit reduced potential for work in the appellant\u2019s chosen field, we find that his support obligation should have been reduced to a total weekly sum of $140, effective upon the August 27, 1986, filing of the petition for downward modification. While there is no basis for reduction of arrears accruing prior to that date <em>(see, </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7\u00a7 451, 460), the record is inadequate for determination of the appropriate amount of total arrears. Thompson, J. P., Niehoff, Fiber, Sullivan and Harwood, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
