The opinion of the District Court (Judge Keech) sets forth the facts in some detail. Allied Civic Group, Inc., v. Public Utilities Commission, D.C. 1954, 125 F.Supp. 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">The appellant relies in this court on two principal contentions, both of which the District Court over-ruled: first, that under the circumstances of this case the Commission cannot properly use a rate base resting on the original cost of the Transit Company\u2019s properties, and, second, that the Public Utilities Commission has jurisdiction, which it failed to exercise, to regulate fares for Transit\u2019s operations between points within the District of Columbia and points within Maryland. These two contentions are dealt with in Parts 10 and 12 of the opinion of the District Court. 125 F.Supp. 460, 461. In reference to the second point mentioned, we are satisfied that there is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">. The importance of the first question presented needs no ' underscoring. The choice of a proper rate base is, of course, vital to the setting up of a sound and workable fare structure. In that regard the Commission\u2019s opinion has this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">\u201cRate Base</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">\u201cThe Commission has in the past consistently stated, as the rate base, the amount reflecting the historical cost of property used and useful in the Company\u2019s transit operations in the District of Columbia, stated at the cost to the owner first devoting the properties to public use, less accumulated depreciation per books\u2014 plus a single working capital allowance in respect of the cost of materials and supplies. See In re Capital Transit Company, Formal Case No. 417, decided August 21, 1952; id., Formal Case No. 413, decided January 4, 1952; id., Formal Case No. 396, decided June 28, 1950.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">\u201cFor the purposes of the present \u25a0proceedings, the Commission staff lias developed on this method the amount of $23,420,691, representing the weighted investment in rate base property for the Future Annual Period, adjusted <em>inter alia </em>in respect of depreciation in accordance with the stipulation in Formal Case No. 427 mentioned above, and allocated on a 93+% basis to the District of Columbia. (Commission Exhibit 38, Schedule 3.) The Company, which had contended for certain higher amounts representing rate base in their exhibits and testimony, has accepted the figure thus developed by the Commission staff. (Company Brief, p. 4.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-10\">\u201cFor the purposes of this proceeding, we find and conclude that $23,-420,691 is the Company\u2019s rate base on which a return is allowable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-11\">\u201cAlthough an \u2018original cost\u2019 basis for rate making is thus continued for the purposes of the present case, it is to be observed that the real value in the market place of the Company\u2019s operating properties have been seriously affected by the steady and rapid decline in passenger riding sustained, over a long period of time, except for a brief period during World War II. Economically, the transit industry and the Company are contracting, capital-wise, rather than stable or expanding operations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-12\">\u201cThis fact was reflected in the sale, on September 12, 1949, from the North American Company to S. E. Wolfson and Associates (hereafter called the \u2018Wolfson Group\u2019) of 45.61% of the Company\u2019s stock, carrying effective control of the Company, for $20 per share. On this basis, the then value of 100% of the stock was $4,800,000. Under somewhat similar circumstances, when 100% of the property of a transit company was sold for $7,-500,000, the California Commission determined a rate base of $7,950,-000 (the price at which the properties had been offered for sale) despite indicated historical costs on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>the order of $25,000,000 and book value of over $41,000,000 covered by Commission approved securities of over $37,000,000. This rate base was sustained by the Supreme Court, because of the economic plight of the street railway involved. Market Street R. Co. v. Railroad Comm. of Cal., 324 U.S. 548, 564-568 [65 S.Ct. 770, 89 L.Ed. 1171]. As observed by Justices Black, Douglas and Murphy, concurring in the Nat. Gas Pipeline Co. case [Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co.] supra, [315 U.S. 575] at page 608, [62 S.Ct. 736, 753, 86 L.Ed. 1037] \u2018The investor and consumer interests may so collide as to warrant the rate-making body in concluding that a return on historical cost or prudent investment, though fair to investors, would be grossly unfair to consumers.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-4\">\u201cWe do not suggest that the Company\u2019s present situation demands that the determination of rate base on original cost methods be abandoned at this time. We do note that continuation or accentuation of present riding declines may in the future produce a situation \u2014 due to economic circumstances rather than Commission action \u2014 in which a return within the conventionally \u2018reasonable\u2019 range cannot realistically be estimated on an original cost rate base to be produced from reasonable fares.\u201d (Order, pp. 4-5)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In its discussion of \u201cControlling Principles,\u201d which prefaced the passage just quoted, the Commission said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">\u201cIn considering the rights of the investors, we properly give weight to the Company\u2019s practical situation as a unit of a \u2018generally sick industry\u2019, beset by competition, and with an investment \u2018already impaired by economic forces.\u2019 Market Street R. Co. v. Railroad Comm. of Cal., 324 U.S. 548, 554 [65 S.Ct. 770, 89 L.Ed. 1171]. In this industry, we can and do take account of the practical results of fare increases in respect of the withdrawal of public patronage \"from the Company; Id., 324 U.S. at [page] 563-564 [65 S.Ct. 770],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">\u201cIn view of rapid current decline in transit riding, discussed later, it is obviously in the long-term interest of the investors, as well as the interest of transit riders and the community, that fares be kept at the lowest level consonant with the preservation of the Company in private hands, in a healthy operating condition. Thus, the investors would suffer with the public if, as suggested in the record, excessive fares produced a boycott of the use of mass transit. It is clear that the interests of all are fostered by fare structures and Company policies designed to encourage mass riding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">\u201cSecond, we have no duty to impose unreasonable transit fares in order simply that stockholders may earn dividends. Covington &amp; L. Turnp. Road Co. v. Sandford, 164 U.S. 578, 596. [17 S.Ct. 198, 41 L.Ed. 560]. We should attempt to-set fares sufficient to secure a fair-return to the investors \u2018provided the business is capable of earning it. But regulation does not insure that, the business shall produce net revenues.\u2019 Federal Power Comm. v.. Nat. Gas Pipeline Co., 315 U.S. 575, 586 [62 S.Ct. 736, 86 L.Ed. 1037]. No more can be exacted from the public than the service is reasonably worth (Smyth v. Ames, 169 U.S. 466, 547 [18 S.Ct. 418, 42 L.Ed. 819]).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-11\">\u201cThird, we are not bound to the use of any single formula or combination of formulae in setting rates-of fare. Rate making bodies are-\u2018free, within the ambit of their statutory authority, to make the pragmatic adjustments which may be called for by particular circumstances.\u2019 Federal Power Comm. v. Nat. Gas Pipeline Co., 315 U.S. 575, 586-[62 S.Ct. 736, 86 L.Ed. 1037]; Federal Power Comm. v. Hope Nat. Gas-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Co., 320 U.S. 591, 602 [64 S.Ct. 281, 88 L.Ed. 333]. \u2018The particular cir-_ cumstances\u2019 of the Company include not only the conventional problems of rate base, expense and rate of return, but in addition include (1) problems general to the transit industry such as \u2018normal decline\u2019 in numbers of passengers and additional decline in passengers attributable to refusal to pay higher fares, (2) special additional problems of the Company, such as the traffic conditions in Washington, with concomitant community interest in mass transit as a partial solution to overcrowded streets, and deterioration of public relations due to public reaction against dividend policies of the present management.\u201d (Order, p. 3)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The findings and conclusions we have quoted could well, we think, have supported a conclusion by the Commission that the rate base should be set at a level reflecting the current value of the company\u2019s properties, viewed realistically. Market Street Railway Co. v. Railroad Commission, 1945, 324 U.S. 548, 65 S.Ct. 770, 89 L.Ed. 1171. But the Commission did not then adopt such a rate base. Instead of following its quoted findings to what would appear to be their logical conclusion, the Commission reached a different conclusion. As we have seen, it arrived at a rate base in the amount of $23,420,691, representing the company\u2019s original property investment, as weighted and adjusted by the Commission. And the Commission\u2019s reasons for using the original cost rate base do not clearly appear from its opinion and order. This gives us our present concern, not because we mean to intimate which base should predicate Commission action, but because we cannot properly exercise our appellate function unless the Commission states the reasons for the course it decided to follow. The fact, of course, that the original cost rate base had been used on previous occasions is not a sufficient reason, without more, for continuing its use. As we said in a somewhat similar context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">\u201cWhile under certain circumstances, reliance on a prior proceeding for this purpose might be permissible, such circumstances do not exist in this case. There is nothing before us to indicate that pertinent local conditions and economic conditions generally have remained static during the intervening years.\u201d Washington Gas Light Co. v. Baker, 1950, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 115, 121, 188 F.2d 11, 17, certiorari denied, 1951, 340 U.S. 952, 71 S.Ct. 571, 95 L.Ed. 686.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">On the larger issue, that of granting increased rates to the Transit Company, the Commission\u2019s basic reasons for the grant appear to be evidenced by the following quotations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">\u201cWithin the limitations of general transit economies, we propose to determine fares sufficient to provide the Company with a return adequate, under efficient and economical management, to support the Company\u2019s credit and to maintain its financial soundness.\u201d (Order, p. 24)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">\u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, we are unable to fix a rate of return high enough to restore the economic decline in the market value of the Company\u2019s stock which occurred many years ago. We further conclude that a return that is sufficient to protect the financial integrity of the Company, that will permit of the raising of such additional capital as may be needed for the foreseeable future, and will permit of the payment of reasonable dividends to the investors in equity capital, constitutes a fair rate of return, and that a return falling within the range of 6-1%. % to 6-%% will meet these requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-10\">\u201cUnder the fare structure determined upon considerations hereafter detailed, the Company may reasonably anticipate a rate of return of approximately 6.32% on the original cost rate base devoted to rendering service in the District of Columbia, which, under all the circumstances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>is fair and reasonable to the Company and to the investors.\u201d (Order, p. 26)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">\u201cAfter establishing that it is necessary to raise the present level of fares in order that this Company may have a reasonable prospect of earning a fair return (see page 20), the next problem is to determine the form which the higher schedule of fares should take.\u201d (Order, p. 30)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The considerations just indicated may, of course, properly be taken into account by the Commission in reaching its final decision. But they must be balanced against other relevant factors. They cannot be regarded, standing alone, as justification for adopting the original cost rate base as contrasted with other possible bases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cThe investor and consumer interests may so collide as to warrant the rate-making body in concluding that a return on historical cost or prudent investment, though fair to investors would be grossly unfair to the consumers.\u201d Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., 1942, 315 U.S. 575, 608, 62 S.Ct. 736, 753, 86 L.Ed. 1037 (concurring opinion; quoted by the Commission in its order here under review at p. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\"> We are not here expressing a judgment as to what rate base the Commission should have adopted. That is not our function; we could not substitute our own view on such a question\u2014 if we had reached a view \u2014 -for that of the Commission. Federal Power Commission v. Colorado Interstate Gas Co., 1955, 348 U.S. 492, 75 S.Ct. 467. Nor are we saying that the Commission may not ultimately be able to justify its adoption of the original cost rate base, if it decides to adhere to that course. But we do say that the decision of the Commission must be based on a \u201csuitably complete statement\u201d of its reasons for its conclusions. Florida v. United States, 1931, 282 U.S. 194, 215, 51 S.Ct. 119, 75 L.Ed. 291, citing Beaumont, S. L. &amp; W. Ry. v. United States, 1930, 282 U.S. 74, 86, 51 S.Ct. 1, 75 L.Ed. 221. And see Capital Transit Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 194, 205, 213 F.2d 176, 186-187 (separate opinion of Chief Judge Stephens), certiorari denied, 348 U.S. 816, 75 S.Ct. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">Concluding, as we do, that the report and order of the Commission do not reflect an adequate statement of its reasons for adopting the original cost rate base, we must reverse the judgment of the District Court, with directions to remand the case to the Commission for such further action on its part as may be consistent with this opinion. Pending such further action, which should be taken without unreasonable delay, the District Court may permit the Commission\u2019s order to remain in effect. Any new finding or order issued by the Commission will be subject to judicial review in the ordinary course. Under the circumstances, we do not deem it necessary to pass on the remaining contentions of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-11\">. The same may be said of the Commission\u2019s findings \u2014 made in connection with its examination of the investors\u2019 sit\u00faation rather than its study of the rate base problem \u2014 that \u201cthe Company is in an excellent condition financially, as compared to the transit industry generally\u201d (Order, p. 7), and that the market price of its stock in 1953 was about three times what it was in 1949 (Order, p. 5).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
