United States, 6 Cir., 180 F.2d 284; Hudspeth v. United States, 6 Cir., 183 F.2d 68;</p>\n<p id=\"b624-25\"> And it appearing further that, where the motion and court records show that the convicted prisoner is not entitled to any relief, the convict is not entitled to a hearing on the issues presented by his motion to vacate, Risken v. United States, 8 Cir., 197 F.2d 959; nor is there reason for the filing of findings of fact and conclusions of law when it conclusively appears from the face of the motion and from the court records that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>prisoner is entitled to no relief, Brown v. United States, 6 Cir., 212 F.2d 589;</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court overruling appellant\u2019s motion to vacate judgment and set aside sentence is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
