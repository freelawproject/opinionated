It is not licensed in the State of Wisconsin. Francis Meehan, not a party to this lawsuit applied to his cousin Cyril Wiedner, May 7, 1951, as one of Hawkeye\u2019s agents for automobile liability insurance on his (Meehan\u2019s) Chevrolet. Wiedner and Meehan were Iowa residents and the vehicle was then stored at Meehan\u2019s home in Iowa. Just prior to that application Meehan entered military service, and told Wiedner that he (Meehan) planned taking his Chevrolet to his assignment at Chanute Air Force Base, near Rantoul, Illinois. When Mee-han was a civilian Hawkeye had written coverage, but that policy expired. \u201cThe Hawkeye agent (Wiedner) told Meehan that the Company was not anxious to write automobile liability policies for servicemen, but he felt the Company would accept Meehan again if he agreed that the insurance should not be in effect when the car was driven by another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>serviceman unless Meehan was also in the car.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hawkeye was licensed to do business in Illinois, where it maintained a claims office, and applied its Illinois premium rate to the policy in issue. Wiedner personally recommended Mee-han as an \u201cA-l\" risk to defendant. Meehan signed the following typewritten statement, dated May 7, 1951, prepared on a form captioned \u201cWiedner Agency:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ao-dedup-0\">\u201cI understand and agree that the insurance on my car is not in force when driven by any other member of the Armed Forces unless I am also in the car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Without that foregoing assent Wiedner could not recommend Meehan because Hawkeye\u2019s underwriters concluded that the lending of cars by and to fellow servicemen entailed additional hazards. Consequently, in the opinion of defendant\u2019s underwriters, this endorsement (Exhibit 3) equalized the risk to the civilian rate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">\u201cSpecial Endorsement It is agreed that such insurance as is afforded by this policy shall be of no force or effect while the described automobile is being operated by any member of the Armed Forces <em>other than </em>(1) the Named Insured, or (2) a member of the Armed Forces who is a member of the Named Insured\u2019s immediate family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">This endorsement is subject to all the terms, conditions and exclusions of the policy and of forms and endorsements attached thereto which are not inconsistent herewith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">This endorsement shall take effect on the 7th day of May, 1951 at 12:01 A.M. and shall terminate with this policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">This endorsement, when countersigned by a duly authorized agent of the Company and attached to Pol-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-9\">icy No. A33603, issued to Francis Meehan shall be valid and form a part of said policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-10\">Hawkeye-Security Insurance Company,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-11\">A. R. Nelson,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-12\">President.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-13\">Countersigned at Waukon, Iowa this 14th day of May, 1951.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-14\">Authorized Agent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-15\">(Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-16\">After Wiedner forwarded Meehan's application, accompanied by the aforesaid assent, defendant issued a policy of automobile liability insurance consisting of three parts: (i) Policy No. A33603, (ii) Declarations and, (iii) the foregoing Special Endorsement. These documents were forwarded by Hawkeye to its agent Wiedner, .who executed that part of the policy captioned \u201cDeclarations,\u201d but did not sign the \u201cSpecial Endorsement.\u201d However, that endorsement was signed by defendant\u2019s president. Meehan received these three documents at Rantoul, Illinois from Wied-ner. When anybody asked Meehan for the use of his automobile he would tell them \u201c * * * it wasn\u2019t covered, that there was a restrictive endorsement on the policy, and that * * * (he) * * * didn\u2019t want them to drive it.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Meehan and another serviceman, Gelhar, stationed at Chanute Air Force Base, agreed to the joint purchase of a 1949 Pontiac from a Rantoul automobile dealer on July 9, 1951. Meehan and Gelhar further agreed to and did share equally all expenses in maintaining, operating and insuring the Pontiac, including the premium on the liability policy underlying this appeal. \u201cThey owned the car jointly though title was placed in Mee-han's name alone because Gelhar was then only twenty years of age.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The next day Meehan wrote<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> his cousin, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Hawkeye\u2019s agent in Waukon, Iowa, advising him that the Pontiac had been purchased and specifically inquiring: \u201cSay how about making new policy so another kid can drive it besides myself. He has an interest in the car. His name is Francis R. Gelhar, also an instructor in Electrics Branch here at the base.\u201d This communication allegedly evoked the following reconstructed letter, July 12, 1951, from Wiedner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-4\">\u201cCorporal Francis Meehan 3356 Student Training Squadron Chanute Air Base Rantoul, Illinois Dear Buddy:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">I have to have a motor and serial number of the car \u2014 also whether it is a 2 door or 4 door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">The Hawkeye Insurance Company would not be interested in keeping the policy in force on your car if another person had an interest in the car. If your friend Gelhar is to have an interest in the car, you should secure other insurance from an insurance man near Chanute field and send back the policy you got from me for cancellation.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acq\">We qualify that letter marked (Exhibit 34) because in finding of fact numbered 7, the district judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">\u201cWhile the defense contends that on receipt of Meehan\u2019s letter by Wiedner advising him of the joint ownership of the Pontiac he immediately wrote Meehan that if Gelhar was to have an interest in the Pontiac, the policy should be sent back for cancellation * * * Wiedner was unable to produce the original or copy of his alleged letter to Meehan, but did offer a reconstructed version of what he recalled the letter contained. Meehan\u2019s testimony, as well as Wiedner\u2019s, as to this alleged communication was conflicting, unreliable and very unsatisfactory, and the court finds that no such communication was had between Meehan and Wiedner at that time. The policy was not returned for cancellation and no further inquiry or demand for its return was made on Meehan by Wiedner or the defendant. Defendant never offered or made a refund to Meehan for the premium paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">\u201cQ. And at their request, did you prepare the constructed copy of the letter? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">But it does appear from Exhibit 35 that on July 11, 1951 Wiedner sent a request for endorsement to Hawkeye, viz.: \u201cPlease endorse for following car; 49 Pontiac Sedan Coupe M #P6 RH11615 Model 6R List H, possession 7/10/51, used * * * \u201d This was received by Hawkeye at Des Moines, 8:50 A. M., Monday, July 16 and a Change of Car Endorsement (Exhibit 4), effective July 11, 1951, was forwarded to Wiedner, who countersigned it July 17, 1951. This endorsement, for Meehan\u2019s policy A33603, clearly described the Pontiac and was transmitted by Wiedner to Mee-han. No further correspondence between Meehan and Wiedner appears of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">In September, 1951 Gelhar on furlough took the Pontiac to his home near Wau-sau, Wisconsin, and Meehan remained at the Air Force Base. On September 27, 1951, while operating the Pontiac, Gelhar was involved in a collision with another automobile, as a result of which actions were commenced against him by several persons injured in that episode. When defense of these tort claims were tendered to Hawkeye it declined on the ground that Gelhar was excluded from coverage under the policy\u2019s terms. Judgments against Gelhar totalled $45,-619.03 in addition to which he incurred $2,490.22 for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">Grounding their complaint on these judgments in tort, and diversity of citi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>zenship, Gelhar and the injured persons filed suit, August 26, 1953, against Hawkeye in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin. After denying, on October 8, 1953, defendant\u2019s motion to: (i) quash the return of service and, (ii) dismiss the action, the district court proceeded to hear the merits, without a jury. Plaintiffs amended their complaint and defendant filed a counterclaim. Then the proceedings below culminated in judgments against Hawkeye and Gelhar for $20,595.69 and $1,415.93, respectively. Hawkeye asks us to review the district judge\u2019s refusal to quash service and dismiss this action and has also appealed the foregoing money judgment. Findings of fact and conclusions of law were made by the trial judge.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>\u201cQ. And is Exhibit 34 your preparation of that reconstruction? A. Yes, sir.\u201d (T.R. 205.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>One other aspect of the proceedings below requires notice. Plaintiffs and defendant, through their attorneys, executed a stipulation for judgment on the claim of Ruth Petrowski, wife of John M. Petrowski, a plaintiff, under which it was agreed that Ruth\u2019s claim was valued at $12,500. That stipulation is shortly explained by its paragraph numbered 3 (T.R. 43):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">\u201cThat Ruth Petrowski is being joined as a party to the above entitled action at the request of the defendant in order that a determination in this action of the issue of insurance coverage by the defendant upon the car driver by Francis Gel-har at the time and place of the said accident will be binding upon all of the persons having any claim or cause of action whatsoever arising out of the said automobile accident and will likewise be binding upon the defendant, and in order that the determination of the said issue in this action will be <em>res judicata </em>between all of the persons having any claim or cause of action arising out of the said automobile accident and the defendant herein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Paragraph one, of that stipulation, on which a separate judgment was entered in favor of Ruth Petrowski against Francis Gelhar in the sum of $12,500, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">\u201cThat each of the parties to this stipulation voluntarily submits to the jurisdiction of the above entitled Court without service of process herein, the same as if personal service had been obtained by each against the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">As part of its counterclaim, defendant sought to restrain certain plaintiffs from instituting any other actions against Hawkeye or Gelhar. Moreover, Hawk-eye prayed for a declaration that none of the plaintiffs were entitled to recover under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">Looking at all the findings of fact and conclusions of law filed below, we are compelled to conclude that the district court interpreted defendant\u2019s resolution and power of attorney as leaving Hawk-eye amenable and vulnerable to process whatever were the jurisdictional facts. Having decided that Hawkeye was within the court\u2019s jurisdiction all that remained was to invalidate the restrictive endorsement on the grounds that Hawk-eye had also assented that its policies \u201care varied to comply with the\u201d laws of Wisconsin, where such endorsements are prohibited. But a preliminary jurisdictional question, inextricably woven into other aspects of the case, crystallized by defendant\u2019s motion to quash the process confronts us.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">Hawkeye filed a resolution, with the proper Wisconsin officials, authorizing its appropriate officers to execute a power of attorney constituting and appointing the Commissioner of Motor Vehicle Department of the State of Wisconsin its attorney in that State \u201cto accept service on its behalf of notice or process in any action arising out of a (prior) (subsequent) motor vehicle accident in the State of Wisconsin under 85.09 of the Wisconsin Statutes.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Two other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>clauses in that resolution warrant quotation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-4\">\u201c2.

For despite what first appears as clear language appointing the Wisconsin Commissioner as attorney to accept service, Hawkeye interposed a motion to quash the process by which the instant proceeding was commenced. Hawkeye, in substance, asserted that: (i) the district court had no jurisdiction over the defendant, and (ii) \u201csuch defendant has not been properly served with process in this action since the defendant is an Iowa corporation and was not and is not subject to the service of process within the Western District of Wisconsin except pursuant to a Power of Attorney filed with the Commissioner of the Motor Vehicle Department of the State of Wisconsin * * * that such Power of Attorney does not authorize the Commissioner to accept process for the defendant in the above entitled action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-22\">After setting out the pertinent portions of defendant\u2019s power of attorney, the district judge made these findings:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqg\">\u201cThat by filing said resolution and power of attorney, defendant agreed that its auto policies should comply with and be governed by all the applicable Statutes of Wisconsin relating to auto insurance policies, in the event the auto it insured became involved in an accident in Wisconsin, and defendant is now estopped to deny that the said Wisconsin Statutes governing and controlling the terms and conditions of auto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>liability insurance policies became a part of the policy involved herein as to the automobile accident in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-4\">\u201cThat the defendant\u2019s policy referred to herein was amended when isued so as to comply with all of the said Wisconsin Statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnL\">\u201cThat the service of the process in this action upon the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles for Wisconsin, pursuant to said power of attorney, was valid and this court has jurisdiction over the defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">This is an appropriate juncture to recapitulate several significant facts readily established by our canvass of the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">1.

Wisconsin was the site of Gelhar\u2019s accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-14\">7. Gelhar\u2019s home was near Wau-sau, Wisconsin and he was stationed at Chanute Air Force Base, Rantoul, Illinois when the accident occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-15\"> Hawkeye refrained from certifying its policy under Wisconsin Safety and Financial Responsibility Law because the company contends that Gelhar\u2019s operation of the Pontiac was an excluded risk. Its resolution, already quoted, provides <em>inter alia \u201c </em>* * * in all cases <em>wherein a certificate is filed </em>* * * the insurance policy, <em>declared by said certificate, </em>shall be deemed to be varied to comply with the laws of Wisconsin * * Clearly without such a certificate having been filed policy A33603 could not be varied to comply with Wisconsin laws so as to strike down the restrictive endorsement. We think the resolution and power of attorney must be read together since defendant\u2019s Board of Directors authorized only that which their resolution embodies. But we say that resolution and power of attorney are without vitality until such time as the carrier activates them with a certificate of insurance. Wis.Stats.1953, 85.09(17) et seq., and 85.09(20). Or, it might be also said that policy A33603 did not become a motor vehicle liability policy since it had never been certified as proof of financial responsibility under Wisconsin statutes. Hill v. Standard Mutual Casualty Co., 7 Cir., 1940, 110 F.2d 1001; State Comp. Ins. Fund v. Bankers Indemnity Ins. Co., 9 Cir., 1939, 106 F.2d 368. The substituted service was ineffective because Hawkeye\u2019s certificate is a jurisdictional element in this instance,</p>\n<p id=\"b179-17\">Section 85.09 of Wisconsin Statutes 1953 embraces two captions, i. e., \u201cSafety Responsibility Law\u201d \u00a7 85.09(5) to (16) (c) and \u201cFinancial Responsibility Law\u201d \u00a7 85.09(17) to (31m). However, plaintiffs in this complaint spelled out contents of \u00a7 321A, Iowa Code 1950, I.C. A., concerning the, Iowa Financial Responsibility Law \u2014 these provisions are counterparts of the Wisconsin statute. As we read the Wisconsin statute it appears that their thrust strikes at owners and operators of vehicles. A driver, holding a policy with a non-licensed insurance company can protect himself, from the impaet of either Safety or Financial Responsibility Law provisions only if his out-of-state insurer qualifies and certifies under those legislative clauses. Yet we find nothing in 85.09 conferring jurisdiction over defendant, by substituted service in the absence of a certification of policy A33603. Hawkeye\u2019s resolution and power of attorney contains no mention of any specific policy much less any itemization of the one involved. Morris &amp; Co. v. Skandinavia Ins. Co., 1929, 279 U.S. 405, 49 S.Ct. 360, 73 L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Ed. 762; General American Life Ins. Co. v. Carter, 1944, 222 Ind. 557, 54 N. E.2d 944. Of course, Hawkeye\u2019s non-certification stems from its position that : the automobile driven by Gelhar was not \u2022 covered by policy A33603 since there was a specific provision that the policy \u25a0 \u201cshall be of no force or effect while the \u25a0 described automobile is being operated by any member of the Armed Forces\u201d\u2014 viz., Gelhar. But jurisdiction cannot be obtained over Hawkeye by merely invalidating that restrictive endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Without certification of policy A33603, by Hawkeye, its power of attorney alone, was insufficient and dormant, and this state of affairs nullified substituted service on the Wisconsin Commissioner. For these reasons Hawkeye was not within the jurisdiction of the district court and it was error to overrule defendant\u2019s motion to quash the process. In its answer, we note in passing, Hawkeye expressly denied that its power of attorney appointed the Commissioner as its agent for the service of process in any and all instances.</p>\n<p id=\"A3F\">Our holding here pivots on the jurisdictional question. Nothing in Watson v. Employers Liability Assur. Corp., 1954, 348 U.S. 66, 75 S.Ct. 166, freely cited by plaintiffs, collides with the views expressed in this case. For there the Louisiana code provisions were applicable to all insurance contracts. Section 204.30 (3), Wisconsin Statutes 1953, relied upon by plaintiffs, is delimited by these words: \u201cNo such policy shall be issued or delivered <em>in this state </em>*. * \u201d Moreover, Olander v. Klapprote, 1953, 263 Wis. 463, 57 N.W.2d 734, 735, and Schneider v. Depies, 1954, 266 Wis. 43, 62 N.W.2d 431, are, accordingly, inapplicable to the issues before us though they hold that section 204.30(3) \u201cdenies to the insurer the right to exclude from its policy provisions of indemnity to the person responsible for the operation of the automobile.\u201d Policy A33603 was neither issued nor delivered in Wisconsin.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-16\">Various points asserted by plaintiffs in this appeal are simply facets of a basic attempt to attack jurisdiction and once argued then, quite understandably plaintiffs attempt to eradicate the restrictive endorsement. But this circular reasoning fails to supply the requisite certificate of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-17\">So tenuous are plaintiffs\u2019 contentions resting on waiver and estoppel that a detailed disposition of them is unnecessary. Since our decision hinges upon lack of jurisdiction there is no need to discuss other points urged by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-18\">The judgments and orders appealed, and this cause, is reversed and remanded to the District Court with directions to sustain defendant\u2019s motion to quash the return of service of summons on it and to dismiss the action filed against Haw-keye-Security Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-19\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-20\">SCHNACKENBERG, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-21\">The majority opinion, in reversing the judgment of the district court, sustains the defendant\u2019s attack upon the jurisdiction of that eourt over the person of defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *However, the record shows that, according to well established principles of waiver, defendant on March 18, 1954, waived its theretofore asserted objection to the district court\u2019s jurisdiction of its person. This was prior to the entry of the judgment appealed from.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly the jurisdictional question is not before this court for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-22\">The record of this case shows that the judgment, which the majority opinion now reverses and remands, was entered after the following proceedings had taken place in the district court case.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-23\">John M. Petrowski, Grace Ringle and Francis Gelhar, filed a complaint against Hawkeye on August 26, 1953, demanding judgment against defendant and in favor of John M. Petrowski and Grace Ringle, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>respectively, for the amounts of judgments which they had theretofore obtained against Francis Gelhar resulting from injuries sustained in a collision between an automobile driven by Gelhar and another automobile, and demanding a judgment in favor of Francis Gelhar and against defendant declaring that defendant\u2019s policy of insurance provided full coverage to Gelhar as an additional insured, as well as a judgment in favor of Gelhar for attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses incurred in defending the actions of the other two plaintiffs against him. On September 16, 1953, defendant filed a motion to quash the service of summons on it on the ground that the court did not have jurisdiction over the person of defendant and on other grounds. That motion was denied on October 8, 1953, and on October 28, 1953, defendant filed an answer to the complaint, which <em>inter alia </em>reasserted its motion to dismiss. On February 8, 1954, defendant filed a counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">On March 18, 1954, a stipulation was filed, agreeing that the complaint be amended by joining Herlene Gelhar and her guardian <em>ad litem, </em>as well as Ruth Petrowski, as party plaintiffs in the action and that suitable amendments of the complaint be made. It was further agreed that defendant\u2019s answer be amended to include the denial of the new allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">On the same day another stipulation was filed <em>in the same case, </em>signed by Ruth Petrowski and her attorney, Francis Gelhar, and his attorney, as well as defendant and its attorney. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">\u201cIt Is Hereby Stipulated by and between Ruth Petrowski, Francis Gelhar and Hawkeye-Security Insurance Company, a corporation, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">1. That each of the parties to this stipulation voluntarily submits to the jurisdiction of the above entitled Court without service of process herein, the same as if personal service had been obtained by each against the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">2. That Ruth Petrowski has a claim and cause of action against Francis Gelhar in her own behalf for her damages resulting from bodily injuries sustained by her as a result of an automobile accident which occurred on September 27, 1951 on Highway 29 in Marathon County, Wisconsin, which claim and cause of action is above and beyond and in addition to the judgment or judgments obtained by John M. Petrow-ski in the Circuit Court in and for Marathon County, Wisconsin on the 10th day of June, 1953, marked Exhibit D and attached to plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint in the above entitled action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">3. That Ruth Petrowski is being joined as a party to the above entitled action <em>at the request of the defendant </em>in order that a determination in this action of the issue of insurance coverage by the defendant upon the car driven by Francis Gel-har at the time and place of the said accident will be binding upon <em>all of the persons having any claim or cause of action whatsoever arising out of the said automobile accident and will likewise be binding upon the defendant, </em>and in order that the determination of the said issue in this action will be <em>res judicata between all of the persons having any claim or cause of action arising out of the said automobile accident and the defendant herein.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">4. That the defendant, Hawkeye-Security Insurance Company, Francis Gelhar and Ruth Petrowski stipulate and agree that the value of Ruth Petrowski\u2019s claim and cause of action against Francis Gelhar is $12,500 above and beyond the previous judgment obtained by John M. Petrowski under date of June 10, 1953.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\">5. That the Court may forthwith, without further notice and without costs to any party enter judgment in favor of Ruth Petrow-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>gki and against Francis Gelhar in the sum of $12,500, which judgment shall be in full satisfaction of the said claim and cause of action of Ruth Petrowski, personally, against Francis Gelhar as a result of the said automobile accident of September 27, 1951.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\">6. That it is expressly agreed by and between the. parties to this stipulation and agreement that the entry of judgment in conformance herewith will not and does not constitute a waiver of any defense which the defendant, Hawkeye-Se-curity Insurance Company, may have <em>on the issue of insurance coverage and its liability, if any, under any policy of automobile liability insurance upon the automobile operated by Francis Gelhar at the time and place of the said automobile accident </em>of September 27, 1951; that the defendant, Hawkeye-Security Insurance Company, does not admit any liability to Ruth Petrowski, Francis Gelhar or any of the other parties to this action by reason of any policy of automobile liability insurance issued by the defendant or by reason of the said accident; that this stipulation is entered into between the parties hereto <em>so that the value of all claims and causes of action of all persons </em>arising out of the said automobile accident may be determined and established by final judgment and in order that <em>all issues of insurance coverage as to all persons having a claim or cause of action .arising out of the said accident may be determined in these proceedings and action now pending </em>in the above entitled Court to avoid multiplicity of suits and to expedite the trial of the above entitled action upon the said issues of insurance coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Italics are supplied for emphasis.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">On the same day the court entered judgment for Ruth Petrowski against Francis Gelhar for $12,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Thereafter, following a trial at which the evidence of the respective, parties was received, the court made findings of fact and conclusions of law and a judg\u25a0ment against defendant was entered on October 25, 1954. This judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">awarded to the various plaintiffs the amounts which they had heretofore recovered against Francis Gelhar, with interest, and also $2,490.22 for GeJhar\u2019s .attorney\u2019s fees, as well as plaintiffs\u2019 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">Having raised by motion and answer .its objection to the jurisdiction of the district court over its person, the defendant thereafter saw fit to join in the second stipulation filed March 18, 1954. By the terms thereof defendant \u201cvoluntarily\u201d submitted to the jurisdiction of the court \u201cwithout service of process herein.\u201d Said stipulation referred to Ruth Petrowski\u2019s claim and cause of action against Francis Gelhar resulting from the automobile accident on September 27, 1951, \u201cwhich claim and cause of action is above and beyond and in addition to the judgment or judgments obtained by John M. Petrowski.\u201d This stipulation expressly recited that Ruth Petrowski was being joined as a party to the action \u201cat the request of the defendant in order that a determination in this action of the issue of insurance coverage by the defendant upon the car driven by Francis Gelhar\u201d in said accident would \u201cbe binding upon all of the persons having any claim or cause of action whatsoever arising out of the said automobile accident and will likewise be binding upon the defendant, and in order that the determination of the said issue in this action will be <em>res judicata </em>between all of the persons having any claim or cause of action arising out of the said automobile accident and the defendant herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">While the stipulation does state the entry of judgment thereon \u201cwill not and does not constitute a waiver of any defense which the defendant, Hawkeye-Se-curity Insurance Company, may have on the issue of insurance coverage and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>liability, if any, under any policy of automobile liability insurance upon the automobile operated by Francis Gelhar,\u201d and defendant \u201cdoes not admit any liability to Ruth Petrowski, Francis Gel-har or any of the other parties to this action by reason of any policy of automobile liability insurance issued by the defendant or by reason of the said accident;\u201d it fails in any way to save the question of the jurisdiction of the court over the person of the defendant, the stipulation expressly stating that it was \u201centered into between the parties hereto so that the value of all claims and causes of action of all persons arising out of the said automobile accident may be determined and established by final judgment and in order that all issues of insurance coverage as to all persons having a claim or cause of action arising out of the said accident may be determined in these proceedings and action now pending in the above entitled Court to avoid multiplicity of suits and to expedite the trial of the above entitled action upon the said issues of insurance coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">A judgment was thereupon entered in favor of Ruth Petrowski in accordance with the agreement to which defendant was a party. It was entered in the same case and by the same court which entered the order of October 25, 1954, from which defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The advantages which defendant sought by entering into the stipulation aforesaid, it procured through the action of the court whose jurisdiction it now questions. Whether defendant, when invoking or submitting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction, as it did by this stipulation, could have excepted therefrom its right to insist that the court had no jurisdiction over the defendant\u2019s person, it is unnecessary for us to decide. The fact is that it made no such exception in the stipulation. The reservations in the stipulation cover only the issues of insurance coverage and the defendant\u2019s liability on the policy in question. Those are the issues involved in the merits of the case on this appeal and they are matters which this court should now review. By voluntarily submitting these issues to the district court for determination as to all of the plaintiffs, including John M. Petrowski, defendant waived any right theretofore asserted by it to challenge the jurisdiction of the court over it. 21 C.J.S., Courts, \u00a7 109, p. 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">I believe this court should proceed with a consideration of the merits of the case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-19\">.
