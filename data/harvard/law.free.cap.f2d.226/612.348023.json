This is that the testimony as a whole, indeed plaintiff\u2019s own testimony, conclusively establishes: that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were not proximately caused or contributed to by any negligence of defendant; but that his own negligence was the sole proximate cause of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Conceding that the record must be examined in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and every reasonable inference drawn therefrom in his favor, Wilkerson v. McCarthy, 336 U.S. 53, 69 S.Ct. 413, 93 L.Ed. 497, and citing many cases<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> holding that to take a case of this kind to the jury there must be evidence both that defendant was negligent and his negligence was not merely a condition but a proximate cause of the injury, appellant insists that his motion for a directed verdict should have been granted, and, because it was not, the judgment must be reversed with directions to enter judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">Appellee on his part citing Wilkerson v. McCarthy, supra; Kansas O. &amp; G. Ry. v. Woodward, 10 Cir., 198 F.2d 322; Mooney v. Terminal R. Ass\u2019n, 352 Mo. 245, 176 S.W.2d 605,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> presses upon us that with the negligence of the defendant, in furnishing a defective hose, established, what and all that appellant is endeavoring to do is in effect to insulate that negligence as a proximate cause by putting forward defendant\u2019s contributory negligence as an absolute defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-13\">We agree with appellee that this is so. While, therefore, we agree with appellant that plaintiff was certainly guilty of contributory negligence and his damages ought to have been, and no doubt were, diminished because thereof, we are bound to hold that in law and in fact there is no basis in the record for appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>lant\u2019s view that plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence must, as matter of law, be held to be the sole proximate cause and thereby operate as a bar to his suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-7\">. The evidence taken most favorably for the plaintiff, is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">On Oct. 8, 1951, and for a number of years before that, Tom Riley and two other colored men, W. Gifford and Lex-ton Bell, were employed by the Florida East Coast Railway Company as section laborers. Part of their work included oxjerating a weed burner to burn weeds off the railroad right-of-way. All were experienced men. Riley and Gifford handled the two flame throwers on the weed burner, and Bell operated the pump on the kerosene tank which was connected to the two burners by lengths of rubber hose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">On Friday, Oct. 5, 1951, plaintiff had asked the section foreman, J. M. Skinner, for some new hose for the weed burner and was told to use some hose that was in the tool house which had been taken off some two years before, and, though he advised the foreman that this hose was old, ho was told that there was no other available, to use it until he could obtain some more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">On Monday, Oct. 8, 1951, Riley, Gifford and Bell went to work at 7:00 a.m. They were again burning weeds along the railroad right-of-way. At about 9:30 a.m. tbat morning one of the hoses broke at the junction where the hose connected to the burner. In helping to repair it, plaintiff\u2019s clothing became saturated with the kerosene that was used as fuel for the weed burner. He returned to work and was again burning weeds. About fifteen or twenty minutes later a woman walking across the tracks yelled at him that there was fire around his ankle, his trousers felt hot, he looked down and his trousers wore on fire. He grabbed his trouser leg and looked down and the flames jumped up on him. He had no idea where the flames came from.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b659-15\">. Wolfe v.
