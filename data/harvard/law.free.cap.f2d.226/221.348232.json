The defendant was represented by counsel on the trial; and, although appeal was noted, no further action was taken by appellant. The appeal might be dismissed; but, as we have examined the record certified by the trial court, including the letter written to the trial judge, and find therein no reason to think that the appellant was not properly convicted, the judgment appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
