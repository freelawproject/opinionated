No appearance has been filed in this court on behalf of respondent. Respondent has filed no brief in opposition to the petition, though such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>brief was due to be filed on August 8, 1955, nor has any extension of time been applied for. Under the circumstances, pursuant to an unopposed motion by the Board, we entered an order on September 12, 1955, to the effect that the case be submitted to the court forthwith upon petitioner\u2019s brief and record appendix thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">From an examination of the record appendix, we are satisfied that the Board had jurisdiction of the administrative proceeding before it; that the Board\u2019s findings of fact as to the commission of certain unfair labor practices are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole; and that the Board\u2019s remedial order is appropriate and within its discretion, being in routine terms as applicable to the type of unfair labor practices here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">A decree will be entered enforcing the order of the Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
