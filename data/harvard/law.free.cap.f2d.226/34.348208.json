His chief, though not his only, contention on this appeal is that the District Court erred in instructing the jury that it was immaterial whether or not the woman was pregnant, if at the time the defendant believed she was pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-23\">If the statute makes pregnancy immaterial, the indictment cannot make it material. The government\u2019s brief contains a table showing that the so-called abortion statutes of many states explicitly make pregnancy necessary <em>(e.g., </em>\u201cany pregnant woman\u201d); those of many other states explicitly make it unnecessary (e. <em>g., </em>\u201ca woman whether pregnant or not\u201d); and those of a few states say \u201cany woman\u201d, or \u201ca woman\u201d, without mentioning pregnancy. Formerly the District of Columbia statute used the expression \u201cany pregnant woman\u201d or \u201cany woman in any condition of pregnancy\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But the Code of 1901 omitted all reference to pregnancy and adopted the phrase \u201cany woman\u201d, which has since been retained.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A similar change in the English statutes has long been recognized as making preg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>nancy unnecessary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We think the change in our statute has the same effect.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">We find no error affecting substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b80-15\">.

At the time of the alleged offense the statute read: \u201cWhoever, with intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman, prescribes or administers to her any medicine, drug, or substance whatever, or with like intent uses any instrument or means, unless when neees-sary to preserve ber life or bealtb and under the direction of a competent licensed practitioner of medicine, shall be imprisoned for not more than five years; or if the woman or her child dies in consequence of such act, by imprisonment for not less than three nor more than twenty years.\u201d D.C.Code (1901) \u00a7 809, 31 Stat. 1322; D.C.Code (1951) \u00a7 22-201.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b81-15\">.
