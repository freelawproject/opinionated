That order is said to be beyond the court\u2019s power on the theory that a new cause is introduced after the statute of limitations has run. Pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>our practice where extraordinary writs are sought, we have examined this petition and its supporting brief to determine whether the petitioner has stated such a case for extraordinary relief that respondent should be required to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Considerations which ultimately precluded extraordinary relief by mandamus -in Hazeltine Corp. v. Kirkpatrick, 3 Cir., 1948, 165 F.2d 683, appear in limine here and are decisive against the petition for the extraordinary writ of certiorari. Cf. Kay Ferer, Inc., v. Hu-len, 8 Cir., 1947, 160 F.2d 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The petition will be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
