Traub v. United States,-U.S-App.D.C.-,-F. 2d -. On November 24, 1954, he moved that the District Court (1) direct the United States Marshal to return to him or his attorneys the books and papers which he brought to court in compliance with the subpoena and left in the Marshal\u2019s possession, and (2) enjoin the attorneys for the United States from further interrogating him before the same grand jury. This appeal is from an order denying that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-25\">In regard to the question of further interrogation, the motion is premature. But government counsel have conceded in open court that Traub is entitled to the return of the books and papers. With respect to them the order is reversed. In other respects it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-26\">Reversed in part; affirmed in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
