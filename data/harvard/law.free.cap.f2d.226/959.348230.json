Philco joined as third party defendant Oliver B. Cannon &amp; Son, Inc. who-were painting contractors doing work on Philco\u2019s premises. Philco settled with Tozar. At this stage of the litigation Philco seeks indemnity against Cannon by virtue of a contract and a release executed by Cannon which, Philco says, constitutes a promise to indemnify. The district court gave judgment against Philco and it appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-34\">We think that Judge Lord\u2019s opinion in the district court is an accurate statement of the problem and a satisfactory answer to it. We have nothing more to. add and therefore, affirm the judgment on the opinion of the district judge reported in 130 F.Supp. 554.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
