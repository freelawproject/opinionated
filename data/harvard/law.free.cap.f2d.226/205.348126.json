Bradford Welch, Inc., the taxpayer, was adjudicated a bankrupt on July 23, 1951. John O. England was thereafter appointed Trustee in Bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-23\">On April 28, 1952 the Collector of Internal Revenue filed a claim with the Trustee in Bankruptcy for withholding and insurance contributions taxes and interest thereon. An amended claim was filed August 22, 1952, claiming the sum of $2,192.64 in taxes and interest due. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u00d3f this amount the sum of $945.37 was asserted to be secured by liens on the property of Bradford Welch, Inc., by virtue of the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 3670 and 3671 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the reason that on this amount assessment lists had been received by the Collector and demand duly made' prior to the adjudication of bankruptcy. The Trustee objected. The Referee in Bankruptcy allowed the claim in its entirety as a priority claim, but disallowed any part thereof as a secured claim because \u201cthe United States never has filed any notice of the aforesaid claimed statutory lien as provided in \u00a7 3672 of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d Sec. 3672(a) reads in part: \u201c(a) Invalidity of lien without notice. Such lien shall not be valid as against any mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser, or judgment creditor until notice thereof has been filed by the collector * * *.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3672.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">On May 25, 1954 the District Court entered an order affirming the'order'of the referee. It is conceded that no notice was filed by the Collector under the provisions of \u00a7 3672(a) of the Revenue Act; hence, the lien of the United States was not valid against any <em>mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser </em>or <em>judgment creditor. </em>The trustee argues that he comes within the exception because he is a <em>judgment creditor, </em>constituted such by \u00a7 70, sub. c, of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 110, which reads in part, \u201c * * * The trustee * * * shall be deemed vested as of the date of bankruptcy with all the rights, remedies, and powers of a creditor then holding a lien thereon by legal or equitable proceedings * * It is conceded by the trustee that prior to the adjudication of bankruptcy the United States held a valid tax lien in the sum of $945.37 pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 3670 and 3671, Internal Revenue Code, on all the property and rights to property of the bankrupt, but he denies that it had a secured claim for the reason that it had failed to file notice. The contention of the trustee that the provisions of \u00a7 70, sub. c, of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 110, establishes him a <em>judgment creditor </em>within the meaning of that term as used in \u00a7 3672 of the Revenue Act, has been resolved against him. -</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">The Supreme Court in the case of United States v. Gilbert Associates, 345 U.S. 361, 364, 73 S.Ct. 701, 703, 97 L.Ed. 1071, has defined the term \u201cjudgment creditor\u201d as used in said section. In that case the Court said: \u201cCongress used the words \u2018judgment creditor\u2019 in \u00a7 3672 in the usual, conventional sense of a judgment of a court of record, since..all states, have such courts.\u201d The Supreme Court in the Gilbert Associates case, supra, cited the concurring opinion of Justice Jackson in United States v. Security Trust &amp; Sav. Bank, 340 U.S. 47, 51-53, 71 S.Ct. 111, 95 L.Ed. 53, wherein he considered the legislative history of \u00a7 3672 and reached the conclusion, at page 52 of 340 U.S., at page 114,of 71 S.Ct. that only a judgment creditor in the conventional sense is protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">In In the Matter of Green, D.C.N.D. Ala., 124 F.Supp. 481 the Court was concerned with the identical question. It concluded that a Trustee in Bankruptcy is not a \u201cjudgment creditor\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3672. See also United States v. Security Trust &amp; Sav. Bank, supra; United States v. City of New Britain, 347 U.S. 81, 74 S.Ct. 367, 98 L.Ed. 520 and In re Taylorcraft Aviation Corp., 6 Cir., 168 F.2d 808. Hence, the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\"judgment creditor\u201d as used in \u00a7 3672 having reference only to a creditor holding a judgment obtained by judicial proceedings, the trustee does not come within that definition and, consequently, a valid tax lien in favor of the United States arose pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 3670 and 3671, prior to the adjudication of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">The order of the referee and the order of the District Court confirming are reversed insofar as said orders reject the claim of the United States to valid liens for unpaid taxes and interest in the amount of $945.37 and to priority payment under \u00a7 67 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 107.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\">.
