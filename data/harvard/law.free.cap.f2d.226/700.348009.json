Webb\u2019s City spent thousands of dollars yearly in advertising its product, both over the radio and, at least three times weekly, in the newspapers. As a result of these promotional activities \u2014 the trial court found \u2014 the name \u201cDandy,\u201d in reference to bread sold in the plaintiff\u2019s store, acquired a distinctive, secondary meaning in the minds of the buying public of St. Petersburg.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">On October 18, 1953, the defendant for the first time offered \u201cDandee\u201d bread for sale in St. Petersburg, accompanying its introduction with advertising and other promotional measures. For several months prior to this time, the defendant had sold \u201cDandee\u201d bread in North Carolina, Michigan and Illinois. On October 26, 1953, Webb\u2019s City brought suit in Florida state court for an injunction, alleging unfair competition, in the selling of \u201cDandee\u201d bread in St. Peters-burg. Thereafter the defendant removed the case to the District Court for the Southern District of Florida, on the ground of diversity. The case was there heard without a jury, and the trial court made findings of fact and conclusions of law, the former being substantially accepted and the latter challenged on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">The trial court found that \u201cDandy\u201d bread is sold exclusively in the plaintiff\u2019s department store, while \u201cDandee\u201d bread is not offered for sale there. It also found that the wrappers are substantially different. \u201cDandee\u201d bread has thus far been packaged in a wrapper which has a yellow background, with the word \u201cDandee\u201d most prominent thereon, in red script, and \u201cEnriched Bread\u201d in brown letters underneath. There also appears on the wrapper the representation of a sliced loaf of bread, in natural brown and white colors. \u201cDandy\u201d bread has been sold in wrappers which apparently have always been similar in design, although different in color. The two wrappers which are attached to the record on appeal are respectively red, white and black, and orange, white and brown. In each the word \u201cDandy\u201d is written most prominently, in script, and the tail of the \u201cY\u201d in that word is continued underneath the word so as to underline it, with the word \u201cSliced\u201d superimposed in another color across this part of the letter. Beneath this appear the words \u201cWhite Enriched Bread\u201d on one wrapper, and \u201cWhite Bread\u201d on the other, on a circular colored background. The name of the manufacturer appears clearly on the wrappers of both \u201cDandee\u201d and \u201cDandy\u201d bread.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">The trial court found that \u201cDandy\u201d bread sells for about 11 cents to <em>12y2 </em>cents per 14-ounce loaf, while \u201cDandee\u201d' bread retails for approximately 18 cents per 15-ounce loaf. It also found that \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s bread is said to be of better quality than that of the plaintiff.\u201d The trial court further found that, the plaintiff\u2019s sales had actually increased since the introduction of \u201cDandee\u201d bread, compared with a like period of time before \u201cDandee\u201d bread appeared on the St. Petersburg market; that there was no showing of any actual damage, or any evidence of customer confusion between the two since \u201cDandee\u201d bread has-appeared in St. Petersburg; and that. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>\u25a0\u2018\u2018the - defendant introduced certain evidence ' that no confusion 'Would occur.\u201d It accordingly granted judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The plaintiff argues that it is not required to show any actual instances of customer confusion in order to establish a right to injunctive relief here. It contends that to prove a cause of action, it has only to establish that the name \u201cDandy\u201d has acquired a distinctive, secondary meaning in the minds of the buying public of St. Petersburg, and that there is a similarity between \u201cDandy\u201d and \u201cDandee.\u201d Under this theory, customer \u2022confusion is only an element of damage, and, for' the purposes of securing in-junctive relief in such a case, \u201cinjury will be presumed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\"> We cannot agree with this reasoning. Under the law of Florida, as under the common law of most states, customer confusion is the gist of the actionable wrong. The common law does not give anyone the exclusive use of a trade name, even where that name is distinctively associated by the public with his product. The prior user has a remedy in the Courts only where a competitor so disguises his product, by means of its name or package, or so promotes it, by any type or combination of advertising schemes, as to lead the casual, buyer to purchase the imitation because he believes it to be the original.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The appellant cites a number of cases where the element of customer confusion is little discussed. There is no conflict between those authorities and the Folding of the trial court below. The \u25a0cases generally fall into two classes. In \u25a0one, customer confusion is proved.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the other, the likelihood of confusion is so great that it is presumed, as a matter \u25a0of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here the fact and the likelihood \u2022of customer confusion were not only not proved by the plaintiff; they were disproved by the. defendant. What the plaintiff would have, us do here, therefore, is make a finding as a matter of law, contrary to what has already been found below, as a matter of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">The cases on which the plaintiff relies do not set forth anything to support such a view of the law. Thus, in Quality Courts United, Inc., v. Jones, .59 So.2d 20, the Supreme Court of Florida affirmed a final decree enjoining the defendants from using any descriptive words, with regard to their motor court, which would cause any substantial portion of the public to believe that it was associated with the plaintiff Quality Courts United, Inc. It reversed an explanatory decree, entered after the final decree, which allowed the defendants to use the phrase \u201cA Court with Quality,\u201d provided that \u201cquality\u201d was in no way emphasized. In reversing the explanatory decree, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-11\">\u201cIn this holding we do not mean to infer that plaintiff has acquired a copyright on the word \u2018quality\u2019 vesting it with the exclusive use of that term. * * * [But] * * * When a motor court has become known by a distinctive slogan or emblem, other operators should not be permitted to appropriate it or any semblance of it that will confuse the public.\u201d 59 So.2d 20, 23.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-13\">In Florida Ventilated Awning Co. v. Dickson, 67 So.2d 215, the Supreme Court of Florida affirmed a chancellor\u2019s decree enjoining the defendants from using the plaintiff\u2019s name or any other promotional feature that would convey the impression that there was any relationship between their product and the plaintiff\u2019s. The defendants there had not only appropriated the plaintiff\u2019s name, \u201cbut employed its catchwords, features, formats, checklists, phrases, and other indicia to advertise and place its product before the public.\u201d 67 So.2d 215, 217. Under those circumstances, it was clearly necessary to enjoin the defendants from using the plaintiff\u2019s name any longer, in order to disassociate the two products which had theretofore been confused in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>the public\u2019s mind, and thus correct the mischief that had already been done.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">In Sentco, Inc. v. McCulloh, Fla., 68 So.2d 577, there was deliberate imitation in the packaging of the defendant\u2019s product, and in its promotional campaign. The Supreme Court of Florida held that the chancellor, having found facts showing this, could not conclude that there had been no confusion, when the only difference shown was the difference between the plaintiff\u2019s trade name, VapO-Lite, and the defendant\u2019s trade name, Exterm-O-Lite.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">If plaintiff\u2019s contention here, that customer confusion is irrelevant, is to be accepted, we must hold that any persons appropriating plaintiff\u2019s name \u201cDandy\u201d for their products must be enjoined therefrom, as converters of its good will to their own use. This contention was rejected in Creamette Co. v. Conlin, 5 Cir., 191 F.2d 108, wherein was involved the plaintiff\u2019s macaroni \u201ccreamettes\u201d and the defendant\u2019s \u201cCreamette\u201d ice cream. This court affirmed a judgment for the defendant, saying that \u201c[i]t is not shown that there has been any confusion as to the source of the products in question, nor was any evidence introduced to support the view that there was likely to be any such confusion.\u201d 191 F. 2d 108, 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Although the products there were different and the products here are the same, the gravamen of the tort in all cases is customer confusion, and this having been affirmatively disproved, there was no actionable wrong shown. The trial court was therefore correct in declining to grant injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-7\">. See, e.g., Pure Foods v. Minute Maid Corp., 5 Cir., 214 F.2d 792.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b748-14\">. See, e.g., El Modelo Cigar Mfg. Co. v. Gato, 25 Fla. 886, 7 So. 23, 6 L.R.A. 823.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b749-26\">. In Chappell v. Goltsman, 5 Cir., 197 F. 2d 837, this Court affirmed a judgment for the defendants in a case where both used the trade name \u201cBama,\u201d but the trial court had found that no substantial confusion had resulted. We ruled, however, \u201cthat, in the interest of making assurance doubly sure that no confusion resulting in injury to plaintiffs will occur from the use of the name \u2018Bama\u2019, the judgment should be modified by adding a requirement that defendants strike from their labels, wherever it appears, and cease and desist from the use of, the word \u2018Brand\u2019.\u201d 197 F.2d 837, 839.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
