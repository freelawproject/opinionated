A trial was had in the court below in which the jury returned verdicts for $145,000 damages. The trial judge denied a motion by defendant for judgment non obstante veredicto and granted a motion by plaintiffs to set aside the verdicts on the ground of inadequacy and grant a new trial. From this order the defendant has brought an appeal, which plaintiffs move to dismiss on the ground that the order from which it is taken is not a final judgment. Defendant moves for leave to file a petition for a writ of certiorari to review the action of the trial judge in denying the motion for judgment non obstante veredicto and setting aside the verdicts and awarding a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-27\">It is perfectly clear that no final judgment has been entered by the court below and that consequently the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>appeal must be dismissed. We think it equally clear that the motion to be allowed to file application for writ of certi-orari must also be denied. Southern Railway Co. v. Madden, 4 Cir., 224 F.2d 320. As we said in the case cited, \u201cIt is clear that the order which we are asked to review is not a final order in the case and hence is not appealable. And we do not think that the statute which allows appeal only from final orders, except in a limited class of cases, can be evaded by the simple device of asking this court to issue one of its extraordinary writs, such as certiorari, or mandamus or prohibition.
