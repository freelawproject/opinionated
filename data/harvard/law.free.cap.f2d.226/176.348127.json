The only questions presented by the appeal relate to the sufficiency-of the evidence; but when this is considered in the light most favorable to-the plaintiff, as it must be for the purposes of the appeal, we think that it was unquestionably sufficient. The questions-involved are pure questions of fact; and. we cannot say that reasonable men could not have differed as to the conclusions, to be drawn from the evidence with regard thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
