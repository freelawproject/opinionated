Appellant was tried before a jury and was represented by counsel appointed by the court. A motion for a new trial on the ground of after discovered evidence was denied by the court, but no appeal was taken from the judgments and sentences entered. Some months later motion was made under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to set them aside. The grounds of the motion related to the arrest and holding of appellant, to the search of his room and to his being brought from one district to another for trial. In this court additional points are raised as to procedural and evidentia-ry matters which could be raised only by appeal and not by motion under 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2255. An examination of the record, however, shows that appellant has no ground for complaint of any action of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
