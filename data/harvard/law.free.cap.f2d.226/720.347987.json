Defendant, Ada Miller, and Everett Edward Hack, were all found guilty after a jury trial of violating Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 472 (procuring another to pass counterfeit currency with intent to defraud), and Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (conspiracy to pass counterfeit money).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-19\">Bocock\u2019s co-defendant, Everett Edward Hack, appealed to this Court but his conviction was sustained. United States v. Hack, 7 Cir., 205 F.2d 723, cer-tiorari denied 346 U.S. 875, 74 S.Ct. 127, 98 L.Ed. 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-20\">On February 27, 1955, plaintiff filed a motion in the District Court under said Section 2255 for \u201ccorrection of judgment.\u201d This motion was denied and Bo-cock appealed to this Court. The action of the District Court was affirmed by this Court in Bocock v. United States of America, 7 Cir., 216 F.2d 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-21\">Plaintiff seeks now to raise questions most of which have to do with the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction. Such questions as he now attempts to raise under Section 2255 must be raised by direct appeal from the judgment of conviction. Klein v. United States, 7 Cir., 204 F.2d 513. Section. 2255, Title 28, does not provide a method to try over again cases in which defendants have been adjudged guilty of crime. Whether the questions raised be as to the sufficiency of the evidence or involve alleged error of fact or law, they may be raised only by timely appeal. United) States v. Jonikas, 7 Cir., 197 F.2d 675. Plaintiff is entitled to no relief on his motion filed under Section 2255. This, his second motion under that statute, was correctly denied by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>As plaintiff is presently confined, defendant-appellee waived oral argument and the issues were considered by this Court upon the briefs filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
