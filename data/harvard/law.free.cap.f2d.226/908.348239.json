Johnson v. Zerbst, 1937, 304 U.S. 458, 467-468, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-19\">One of Osborne\u2019s administrative remedies is the right to seek a new trial within a year after the judgment of the court martial. Article 73 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 660. The statute provides, so far as pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-20\">\u201cAt any time <em>within one year </em>after approval by the convening authority of a court-martial sentence which extends to * * * confinement for one year or more, the accused may petition The Judge Advocate General for a new trial on grounds of newly discovered evidence or <em>fraud on the court. </em>* * <em>\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-21\">Obviously the participation of such a prejudiced officer is a \u201cfraud on the court\u201d. His sentence was for more than a year and the question is, whether Os<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>borne is in a position to urge it in a ha-beas corpus proceeding in a civil court.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Osborne admits he did not petition the Judge Advocate General for such a new trial. In effect his contention is that he can seek it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">We do not agree. The Supreme Court, in Gusik v. Schilder, 1950, 340 U.S. 128, 71 S.Ct. 149, 95 L.Ed. 146, a habeas corpus proceeding like the instant case, in which the military criminal procedure is likened to that procedure in the state courts, holds that a convicted soldier must apply for a new trial under Article 73 before he may apply to a federal court for habeas corpus. In its opinion the court states, 340 U.S. at page 131, 71 S. Ct. at page 151:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-7\">\u201cAn analogy is a petition for ha-beas corpus in the federal court challenging the jurisdiction of a state court. If the state procedure provides a remedy, which though available has not been exhausted, the federal courts will not interfere.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARbT\">Since the District Court lacked the power to entertain the application for the writ of habeas corpus, its decision denying it is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
