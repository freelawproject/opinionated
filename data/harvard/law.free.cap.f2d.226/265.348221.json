See Lew Wah Fook v. Brownell, 9 Cir., 218 F.2d 924, 925, where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-20\">\u201cThe trial court found contrary to the claim [of citizenship] and the only point on appeal is that the evidence not only does not support the judgment but requires just the opposite finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-21\">\u201cSo far as we have seen, this is the plainest of cases in which we are asked to retry the facts. Appellant asks us to apply the doctrine of the case of United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364-395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746, wherein it is held, \u2018Since judicial review of findings of trial courts does not have the statutory or constitutional limitations of findings by administrative agencies or by a jury, this Court (Supreme Court and this court too, of course) may reverse findings of fact by a trial court where \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d * * * A finding is \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire-evidence is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u2019. This simple statement does not convert the appellate tribunals into- fact finding de novo trial courts. The presumption of correctness of the trial court, the view of the witnesses and the live feel of the open forum are all ingredients of the compound which we may adjudge as valid or \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019. By this test in the instant case, the judgment is not clearly erroneous.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
