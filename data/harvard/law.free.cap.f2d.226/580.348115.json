'</p>\n<p id=\"b626-17\">\u25a0 Appellant was indicted on two counts for forgery and for uttering and publishing,\u2019 the claimed offense consisting \u00bff the endorsement by appellant and his cashing of a government check issued to another. On the trial of the case, appellant was represented by counsel who ably conducted his defense. Upon a reading of the entire transcript of the record including the testimony on the trial, it appears that the evidence fully sustains the verdict of guilt returned by the jury. There was no error on the part of the district court on the conduct of the trial, nor was there any misconduct, as alleged, on the part of the government attorney. _ Appellant\u2019s claims that the district court had no jurisdiction to impose sentence\u2019 and that such sentence was void and in violation of the Constitution are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-19\">The order of the district court denying appellant\u2019s motion is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
