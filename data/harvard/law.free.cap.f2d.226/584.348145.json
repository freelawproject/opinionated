Beggy, were gifts within the meaning of Section 22(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, 1939, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 22(b), or constituted compensation to Beggy and therefore were income within the meaning of Section 22(a). The Tax Court held that the payments were income. We have considered the issue and are convinced that no error was committed by the Tax Court and therefore its decision will be affirmed on the opinion of Judge Murdock, 23 T.C. 736.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
