Citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Sullivan asserts on appeal that his sentence is unconstitutional but does not challenge the validity of his convictions. We affirm Sullivan\u2019s convictions, vacate Sullivan\u2019s sentence, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">Sullivan contends that his sentence is unconstitutional in light of <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker. </em>Because Sullivan preserved this issue by objecting to the presentence report based upon <em>Blakely, </em>this court\u2019s review is de novo. <em>See United States v. Mackins, </em>315 F.3d 399, 405 (4th Cir.2003) (\u201cIf a defendant has made a timely and sufficient Apprendi<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentencing objection in the trial court, and so preserved his objection, we review <em>de novo.\u201d). </em>When a defendant preserves a Sixth Amendment error, this court \u201cmust reverse unless [it] find[s] this constitutional error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, with the Government bearing the burden of proving harmlessness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted); <em>see United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 223 (4th Cir.2005) (discussing difference in burden of proving that error affected substantial rights under harmless error standard in Fed. R.App. P. 52(a), and plain error standard in Fed. R.App. P. 52(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-15\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory manner in which the federal sentencing guidelines required courts to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence violated the Sixth Amendment. 125 S.Ct. at 746, 750 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). The Court remedied the constitutional violation by making the guidelines advisory through the removal of two statutory provisions that had rendered them mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 746 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court); <em>id. </em>at 756-67 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-16\">Here, the district court sentenced Sullivan under the mandatory federal sentencing guidelines and applied enhancements based on facts found by a preponderance of the evidence. Specifically, the court established a base offense level of six under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(2) and \u00a7 2Xl.l(a) (2003). The court also imposed a six-level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>enhancement because the loss attributed to Sullivan was more than $30,000 but less than $70,000, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(D); a two-level enhancement because \u201cthe offense otherwise involved sophisticated means,\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(8)(C); a two-level enhancement because \u201cthe offense involved ... the unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification unlawfully to ... obtain any other means of identification[,]\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C)(i); a two-level enhancement for Sullivan\u2019s role in the offense as a leader or organizer, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(c); and a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1. These findings yielded a total offense level of fifteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Our review of the record in this case convinces us that at least one Sixth Amendment violation occurred with respect to Sullivan\u2019s sentencing. Specifically, Sullivan did not admit facts at the plea hearing to support the two-level enhancement premised on the sophisticated nature of the offenses. As a result, the district court\u2019s imposition of this enhancement violated the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Sullivan\u2019s convictions, vacate Sullivan\u2019s sentence, and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-13\">. <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b640-6\">. Just as we noted in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 545 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005), \u201c[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Sullivan's sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b640-7\">. Although the guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] [guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court). On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), and then impose a sentence. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. If that sentence falls outside the guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005). <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The sentence must be \"within the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
