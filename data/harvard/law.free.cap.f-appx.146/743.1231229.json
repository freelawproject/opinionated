He bases federal jurisdiction on title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983,1985, and 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-15\">The district court dismissed the title VII, FMLA, and Rehabilitation Act claims for lack of jurisdiction for failure to exhaust available administrative remedies. The claims under the ADA and the civil rights statutes were dismissed for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted and as preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-16\">On appeal, both parties limit their briefing to the issues surrounding the title VII claims; therefore, our review is limited likewise. We review both a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b) and a summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Rolland initially complained to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) of his perceived workplace discrimination; he chose to appeal the EEOC\u2019s final decision to the Merit System Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d). After sending a letter to the MSPB, requesting dismissal of his appeal, he received an initial decision from the MSPB stating that his case had been dismissed. In this document he was informed that the decision would become final in 30 days and would become appealable at that point. He sued in federal court 27 days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The VA is a federal agency. Sovereign immunity protects the federal government and its agencies from being sued without consent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Sovereign immunity is waived by clear and unequivocal statutory language. <em>United States v. Dalm, </em>494 U.S. 596, 608, 110 S.Ct. 1361, 108 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990); <em>Shanbaum, </em>32 F.3d at 181. Title VII permits suit against the federal government in cases alleging discrimination in a government workplace if all administrative remedies are exhausted first.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-13\">In <em>Tolbert v. United States, </em>916 F.2d 245 (5th Cir.1990), we defined title VIPs exhaustion standard as requiring a plaintiff to file his lawsuit timely\u2014not before and not after the statutorily allotted time. \u201cIt seems obvious that [a complainant] who files too early, has, by definition, filed before [he] has exhausted [his] administrative remedies....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247-48. We reasoned that filing too early is not a defect that can be cured by the passage of time. <em>Id. </em>at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-14\">Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b) permits a judicial appeal of an MSPB final ruling. Rolland sued in federal court three days before the MSPB decision became final. He therefore did not exhaust the available administrative remedies. Consequently, jurisdiction has not vested in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-15\">Rolland attempts to invoke the doctrine of equitable tolling.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>court pointed out, however, this doctrine is applicable in only very limited circumstances.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A complainant\u2019s failure to follow administrative procedures, particularly where he is represented by counsel, is not one of the grounds for equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Rolland\u2019s employment discrimination claims under \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, and 1986 are precluded by our caselaw. \u201cTitle VII provides the exclusive remedy for employment discrimination claims raised by federal employees.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Widnall, </em>99 F.3d 710, 716 (5th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Brown, </em>425 U.S. at 835, 96 S.Ct. 1961). The district court properly dismissed those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b770-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-11\">. Rolland also names as defendants, in their various capacities, certain VA officials and employees. The district court found that these individuals were not properly before the court as defendants: \"[TJhere is no allegation that either Secretary Principi or Director Church committed any act or omission with regard to [Rolland's] complaints and certainly not in any capacity other than an official one.... Nowhere in Rolland's complaints has he alleged or described any conduct by Holiday in an individual capacity .... \u201d On appeal these parties remain nominally part of the suit, but Rolland does not appeal the district court\u2019s finding that these persons are not proper defendants. Therefore, we treat this matter as though Rolland had sued Principi in his professional capacity as Secretary and thereby the VA itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b770-18\">. In addition he alleged a state law claim, which was dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Rolland does not appeal this decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b770-19\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>12101 et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b770-20\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b770-21\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b770-22\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b770-23\">. <em>Hebert v.

This argument is intermingled, in Holland's brief, with the contention that federal courts acquired jurisdiction of the claim 180 days after he filed his first complaint with the EEOC. This argument is incorrect. After Rolland received a final decision from the EEOC, he was given a choice of pursuing an appeal in federal court or with the MSPB. He elected the MSPB and thereby committed himself to abide by these administrative procedures. <em>See Vinieratos v. United States Dep't of Air Force, </em>939 F.2d 762 (9th Cir.1991) (\"[Title VII] requires an aggrieved federal employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>to elect one exclusive remedy and to exhaust whatever remedy he chooses.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b772-9\">. As eloquently stated by the district court, \"[t]he doctrine of equitable tolling ... may be invoked when: (1) the claimant actively pursued his judicial remedies in the prescribed time period; (2) he was induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the deadline to pass; (3) the court leads a plaintiff to believe that he has done all that is required; (4) the plaintiff has received inadequate notice....\u201d <em>See Irwin v.
