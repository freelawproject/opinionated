We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">Bailey was convicted on two counts of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). We affirmed his conviction and sentence. <em>See United States v. Bailey, </em>No. 98-256, 1999 WL 4970591 (11th Cir. June 21, 1999). Bailey filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which the district court denied. Bailey then filed a motion to dismiss the indictment pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b), which the district court denied. On appeal, we deemed Bailey\u2019s 12(b) motion to be a habeas petition within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). We vacated the district court\u2019s order and remanded with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Bailey, </em>112 Fed.Appx. 1 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-18\">Bailey then filed this petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Bailey presents claims of actual or factual innocence which he contends were not argued in his \u00a7 2255 petition because \u201cthe law was not developed at the time the section 2255 motion was denied, and the evidence establishing his innocence was not obtained until after the section 2255 motion was denied.\u201d (R.l-1 at 3.) The magistrate judge recommended dismissing the petition. Bailey objected to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, contending that his claims of innocence must be addressed before the petition could be denied on procedural grounds. (R.l-7 at 1-2.) The district court, however, dismissed Bailey\u2019s petition for the reasons stated in the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation. Bailey appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-19\">We conclude that the district court properly dismissed Bailey\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. Collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence typically are brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 900, 124 S.Ct. 258, 157 L.Ed.2d 181 (2003). When a prisoner has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, he must apply for and receive this court\u2019s permission before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Bailey did not receive our permission to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Bailey is precluded from seeking relief under \u00a7 2241 because the \u00a7 2255 \u201csavings clause\u201d does not apply to these circumstances. The savings clause in \u00a7 2255 permits a prisoner to file a \u00a7 2241 petition if an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. A petitioner may not argue actual innocence until he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by demonstrating that the savings clause applies to his claim. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 n. 3 (11th Cir.1999). But in order to invoke the savings clause, Bailey must show that: (1) his claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision established that Bailey was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense;\u201d and (3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244. Because Bailey has not shown that he was convicted of or sentenced for a crime that has been rendered \u201cnonexistent,\u201d we find that he is unable to satisfy the second prong of the <em>Wofford </em>test. Bailey cites no case that would render the crime of cocaine possession nonexistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Bailey also contends that he was factually innocent of his sentence as a career offender because his sentence was enhanced by his prior convictions, which were not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, as he claims is required by <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). We have already held, however, that <em>Blakely </em>is irrelevant to sentencing enhancements based on prior convictions. <em>See United States v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249, 1257 n. 14 (11th Cir.2004). Thus there was no defect in sentencing that authorized the application of the savings clause in \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Because Bailey cannot satisfy the second prong of the <em>Wofford </em>test with regard to any of his claims, including his sentencing claim, we need not address the remaining prongs of the <em>Wofford </em>test. And, because all of his arguments for relief fail the <em>Wofford </em>test, we need not reach the issue of actual innocence. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Bailey\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for writ of habeas corpus is, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-13\">. The district court denied Bailey\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability. (R.l-10 at 13.) A federal prisoner who proceeds under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, however, does not need a certificate of appealability to appeal. <em>See Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1364 n. 3 (11th Cir.), <em>cert denied, </em>540 U.S. 900, 124 S.Ct. 258, 157 L.Ed.2d 181 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
