Because prior convictions are not a separate element of an offense that the government is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, the district court did not err by applying 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 to increase Williams\u2019s sentence based on his admitted previous drug convictions. Moreover, because Williams was sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence rather than under the federal Sentencing Guidelines, the district court did not err under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b389-19\">Williams was indicted for possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Count Two). He pled guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement. The government filed an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, indicating its intention to seek an enhancement to Williams\u2019s sentence based on his prior convictions for two counts of possession and sale of cocaine. <em>See </em>Admin. Papers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The information stated that the enhancement provided a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years of imprisonment. Williams filed no response to the information. During the plea colloquy, the magistrate judge informed Williams that, in accordance with paragraph two of the plea agreement, his sentence would be enhanced based upon his prior convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>for felony drug offenses. Williams conceded that he had received notice of the enhancement, and further stated that he understood and did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated Williams\u2019s total offense level as 26, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3), and his criminal history category as IV. The PSI noted that he previously was convicted for selling $20 worth of crack cocaine. Based on Williams\u2019s offense level and criminal history category, the guidelines range was 92 to 115 months of imprisonment. However, the PSI stated that, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b), the guideline range was 120 months of imprisonment based on the statutory minimum sentence. Williams objected to the denial of a three-level reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility. He also objected to the recommendation that he be sentenced as a \u201ccareer offender,\u201d arguing that it would violate his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The probation officer noted that the PSI did not recommend that Williams be sentenced as a career offender, but instead noted that the government had filed an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court granted Williams a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The district court then denied his request that he not receive the enhancement to his sentence based on his prior convictions due to the application of <em>Blakely. </em>The district court sentenced Williams to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">On appeal, Williams argues that the district court erred under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and Blakely<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by enhancing his sentence based on his prior convictions, which violated his constitutional rights. He contends that the facts of his prior conviction should have been charged in the indictment. He concedes that under <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), prior convictions are excepted from the rule set forth in <em>Apprendi. </em>However, he further contends that the case is no longer valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">We review preserved constitutional errors <em>de novo. United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). If a defendant has a prior drug conviction, the mandatory minimum sentence for possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base is 120 months of imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, a defendant denying the convictions alleged in the information filed by the government should file a written response. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(c)(1). In <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>we noted that the sentence for a firearm count was not at issue because Shelton was sentenced to the mandatory statutory minimum. 400 F.3d 1325, 1333 n. 10 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">As we stated in <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>the Supreme Court \u201cleft undisturbed its holding in <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>that recidivism is <em>not </em>a separate element of an offense that the government is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 405 F.3d 960, 962 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Cir.2005) (holding that a sentencing guidelines enhancement based on a prior conviction was properly applied and did not violate <em>Booker); see also United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, ---, slip op. at 16-17 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (rejecting plain-error <em>Booker </em>challenge to district court\u2019s application of a sentencing guidelines enhancement based solely on defendant\u2019s prior convictions, which <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>does not require to be charged and proved beyond a reasonable doubt). Moreover, we held that a district court did not err in applying sentencing enhancements based on facts admitted by the defendant. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The <em>Apprendi/Blakely/Booker </em>line of cases is not applicable to Williams\u2019s sentence because he received the statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months of imprisonment, rather than being sentenced under the Guidelines. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B); <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1333 n. 10. Moreover, even if <em>Apprendi/Blakely/Booker </em>were to apply, the district court did not err because (1) recidivism is not a separate element of an offense; and (2) Williams admitted to his prior convictions, through his statements at the plea hearing and by failing to challenge them in the information or in the PSI. <em>See Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d at 962; <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Because prior convictions are not a separate element of an offense that the government is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, the district court did not err by applying 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 to increase Williams\u2019s sentence, based on his admitted previous drug convictions. Moreover, because Williams was sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence rather than under the federal Guidelines, the district court did not err under <em>Booker. </em>Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-13\">. The government filed an unopposed motion to supplement the record with this document, explaining that it had not been properly docketed in the district court due to a typographical error. (See Admin. Papers, Motion dated 12 April 2005). The clerk granted this request. <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b390-6\">. Although the Supreme Court extended <em>Blakely </em>to the federal Sentencing Guidelines in <em>Booker, </em>Williams fails to mention <em>Booker </em>in his arguments on appeal, despite the fact that his brief was filed two months after the Court decided the case. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br.; <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
