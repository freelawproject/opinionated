Love appeals, claiming that the sentencing enhancement he received for being a career offender, <em>see U.S. States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2003) , violates the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) , and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-14\">Love\u2019s claim is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 519 (4th Cir.2005), in which we held that a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to trial by a jury is not violated by the district court\u2019s reliance on his prior convictions for purposes of sentencing as a career offender. <em>See also United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 350 (4th Cir.2005) (holding similarly in the context of the Armed Career Criminal Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-16\">Accordingly, we affirm Love\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
