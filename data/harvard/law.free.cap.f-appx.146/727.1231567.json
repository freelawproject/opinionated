Because he was convicted of transporting illegal aliens, an offense different from alien smuggling, Hernandez-Mesa concludes that the addition of 16 levels was unwarranted. He concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Solis-Campozano, </em>312 F.3d 164, 167-68 (5th Cir.2002). He nevertheless seeks to preserve the issue for possible Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">In <em>Solis-Campozano, </em>we concluded that all of the offenses listed in \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A), which include transporting and harboring illegal aliens, are \u201calien smuggling\u201d offenses for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii). 312 F.3d at 167-68. Hernandez-Mesa\u2019s argument is thus foreclosed. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-16\">For the first time, Hernandez-Mesa argues that the felony and aggravated felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional, both facially and as applied, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He correctly concedes that this argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but nevertheless he seeks to preserve the issue for possible Supreme Court review. <em>See United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 277-78 (5th Cir.2005) (noting that the Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres), cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 253, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -(2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-19\">Hernandez-Mesa argues for the first time in a supplemental letter brief that his sentence is illegal under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>- U.S. \u2014\u2014-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court sentenced him under the mistaken belief that the guidelines were mandatory. Review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -(2005). Nothing in the record indicates that the district court would have imposed a different sentence had the guidelines been advisory. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-24\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b754-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
