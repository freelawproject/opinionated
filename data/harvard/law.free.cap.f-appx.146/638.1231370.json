Mazique\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on March 21, 2005. In criminal cases, the defendant must file his notice of appeal within ten days of the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). With or without a motion, the court may grant an extension of time to file of up to thirty days upon a showing of excusable neglect. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). The time periods established by Rule 4 are \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)). We dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction because we find Mazique\u2019s notice of appeal to be untimely.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b664-17\"> We note also that Mazique previously appealed this same judgment of conviction, and this court affirmed his conviction and sentence by opinion decided April 11, 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
