On appeal, Whiddon argues that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress firearms and methamphetamine discovered at his residence during a search pursuant to a warrant. Whiddon argues the evidence should have been suppressed because (1) the information in the affidavit submitted in support of the search warrant was insufficient to establish probable cause, and (2) the officers who conducted the search of his house were required to obtain another warrant before they opened a sealed bag (containing methamphetamine) found in an automobile at his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">We review the district court\u2019s determination that an affidavit contains probable cause <em>de novo </em>and the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2000). We give due deference to the inferences the district court and law enforcement officers draw from the facts. <em>Id. </em>We review for clear error a district court\u2019s findings of fact on a motion to suppress, and review <em>de novo </em>the application of law to the facts. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>120 F.3d 1226, 1228 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">After thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The relevant facts are straightforward. On February 25, 2004, Whiddon was indicted for being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (Count 1), and possession of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844 (Count 2). The indictment stemmed from an investigation in Abbe-ville, Alabama, concerning several anonymous \u201cCrime Stopper\u201d tips, received by the Abbeville Police Department (\u201cAPD\u201d), about Wfiiiddon. The tips indicated there was a strong chemical smell coming from Whiddon\u2019s business (a mechanic shop) and a lot of traffic going in to and out of the business. As a result of the tips, and discussions with a confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d) who knew Whiddon and indicated he could \u201cget in with him and find out what his operation was,\u201d the APD and Hendry County Sheriff\u2019s Office (\u201cHCSO\u201d) conducted a successful controlled buy by the Cl at Whiddon\u2019s place of business. Thereafter, officers obtained a search warrant for Whiddon\u2019s home, at 511 County Road 79, and his business, Performance Auto. During the execution of the search warrant at the residence, the officers found eight firearms in the bedroom, and methamphetamine in a closed bag in Whidden\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Prior to trial, Whiddon filed a motion to suppress the evidence found during the execution of the search warrant for his house, arguing that probable cause did not exist to justify the warrant, and that the search warrant affidavit contained materially false statements. Whiddon further claimed that the warrant was vague and faded to provide facts as to the Cl\u2019s reliability. Finally, Whiddon maintained that the officers needed a separate warrant to search the vehicle and the sealed bag found therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">In support of his motion, Whiddon submitted the search warrant for his residence and the corresponding affidavit. The search warrant stated that the police had probable cause to believe that Whiddon and Jerry Michael Macon possessed crystal methamphetamine and other illegal contraband at \u2019Whiddon\u2019s residence. The search warrant gave the officers permission to search the residence and all buildings and vehicles located on the property for crystal methamphetamine and other illegal contraband. The warrant was issued based on the affidavit of Jason Hughes, an APD narcotics investigator who stated that he received Crime Stopper tips concerning both Whiddon\u2019s residence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>and his business. According to Investigator Hughes\u2019s affidavit, the tips stated that \u201cthere were suspicious activities at this location where there was a strong chemical smell coming from the business of Performance Auto.\u201d The tips further stated that there was heavy traffic in and out of the business, even after normal business hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Hughes stated that his corroboration of the tips included contact with \u201ca confidential and reliable informant having dealings with Reggie Whiddon and Jerry Macon, and personally seeing crystal methamphetamine at the business ... and [having seen] crystal methamphetamine and [having] knowledge that crystal methamphetamine is being manufactured in the residence ... within the past 72 hours which is contrary to law.\u201d Hughes went on to say that \u201cinformation obtained from confidential informant revealed\u201d that Whiddon and Macon manufactured crystal methamphetamine at the residence and stored the finished product at the business, the address of which Hughes verified through the Henry County Water Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The magistrate judge conducted an evidentiary hearing on Whiddon\u2019s suppression motion, at which APD Investigator Hughes and HCSO Investigator Troy Silva testified about the following: their investigation leading up to the search of Whiddon\u2019s residence; the November 18, 2003 controlled buy that was coordinated at Whiddon\u2019s place of business; and other infromation gathered from the Cl, who Investigator Silva had used in the past. The Cl indicated to Silva that Whiddon regularly cooked methamphetamine on Tuesdays or Thursdays; he had surveillance equipment, guns and possibly explosives in his residence; and he was transporting drugs from his house to his place of business \u201cafter hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation (\u201cR <em>&amp; </em>R\u201d), wherein she recommended that Whiddon\u2019s motion to suppress be denied. She found the following facts: (1) the Crime Stopper tips were detailed and specific and appeared to have been based on firsthand observation; (2) the investigating officers corroborated the tips with a rehable Cl, who had dealings with Whiddon, personally saw methamphetamine at the business and at the residence, and had knowledge that methamphetamine was being manufactured in the residence; (3) the Cl gave the officers the names of two of the individuals involved with the methamphetamine manufacturing as well as the location of the residence and the business, which the officers verified; and (4) the Cl\u2019s observations were made within the 72 hours prior to the filing of the affidavit such that the information was not stale. As for Whiddon\u2019s argument concerning the scope of the search warrant, the magistrate judge found that the warrant included a search of the vehicles at the residence, particularly since the affidavit stated the Cl informed the officers that the methamphetamine was being transported by car from Whiddon\u2019s residence to his business \u201cafter hours.\u201d The magistrate judge concluded that there was sufficient probable cause to sustain the search warrant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>The district court adopted the R &amp; R and denied Whiddon\u2019s motion to suppress. Whiddon then entered a conditional guilty plea, wherein he agreed to plead guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and the government agreed to dismiss the remaining count charging him with possession of methamphetamine. In entering his plea, Whiddon reserved his right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. The district court subsequently sentenced Whiddon to a 37-month term of imprisonment followed by a 3-year term of supervised release. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">First, Whiddon argues the district court erred by finding that the information in the search warrant\u2019s affidavit was sufficient to establish probable cause. The Fourth Amendment proscribes unreasonable searches and seizures and requires a search warrant to be supported by probable cause. <em>See </em>U.S. Const., Amend. IV. To establish probable cause, the search warrant affidavit must \u201cstate facts sufficient to justify a conclusion that evidence or contraband will probably be found at the premises to be searched.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>297 F.3d 1308, 1314 (11th Cir.2002) (citation omitted). More specifically, the affidavit should establish \u201ca connection between the defendant and the residence to be searched and a link between the residence and any criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1314. We look to the face of a particular affidavit to evaluate whether the affidavit was \u201cso lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1313 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Here, the facts alleged within the four corners of the search warrant affidavit were sufficient to establish a connection between Whiddon, the places to be searched, and criminal activity. Specifically, in the search warrant affidavit, Officer Hughes averred, among other things, that: (1) he had received tips that suspicious activity was going on at, and a strong chemical smell emanating from, Whiddon\u2019s business; (2) a Cl had drug dealings with Whiddon at the business and had firsthand knowledge that Whiddon was manufacturing methamphetamine at his home and selling the drugs at his business; and (3) the drug dealings with the Cl had transpired within 72 hours of the swearing of the affidavit. On this record, we cannot say that the information in the search warrant was \u201cso lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the district court did not err by rejecting Whiddon\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the affidavit and denying his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">We are likewise unpersuaded by Whiddon\u2019s second argument, that the officers were required to obtain another search warrant before they searched the sealed bag found in the automobile at his residence. The search warrant gave the officers permission to search for methamphetamine in the vehicles at Whiddon\u2019s house. \u201c[A] warrant to search a specific area for a certain class of things authorizes government agents to break open locked containers which may contain the objects of the search.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>120 F.3d at 1228-29; <em>see also United States v. Morris, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>647 F.2d 568 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981) (holding that search warrant for defendant\u2019s residence authorized officers to open locked jewelry box; rejecting argument that separate warrant was required).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Where a warrant has been issued, \u201ca lawful search of fixed premises generally extends to the entire area in which the object of the search may be found and is not limited by the possibility that separate acts of entry or opening may be required to complete the search.\u201d <em>United States v. Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 820-21, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 2170-71, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982) (footnote omitted). Simply put, the officers did not exceed the scope of the warrant when they opened the bags found inside a vehicle parked at Whiddon\u2019s residence. Therefore, the district court did not err when it denied Whiddon\u2019s motion to suppress on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-6\">. The magistrate judge further concluded that, even if probable cause did not exist, the good-faith exception, articulated in <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 908, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 3413, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984), applies. This exception provides that \"courts generally should not render inadmissible evidence obtained by police officers acting in reasonable reliance upon a search warrant that is ultimately found to be unsupported by probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>297 F.3d 1308, 1313 (11th Cir.2002). The magistrate judge found the exception applicable based on the following circumstances: the officers knew the Cl for one and one-half months prior to getting the Cl\u2019s assistance with Whid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>don; the Cl had previously \"made\u201d two cases for the officers involving marijuana; the officers were aware that the Cl had purchased methamphetamine from Whiddon\u2019s business the day before the search; and the officers knew that the Cl was only acting as a \"good citizen\u201d in assisting them and did not receive assistance with any charges against him for doing so. Because we agree with the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that the search warrant affidavit was sufficient to support probably cause, we need not, and do not, reach the applicability of the <em>Leon </em>good-faith exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b382-16\">.
