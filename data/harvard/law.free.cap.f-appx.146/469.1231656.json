Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We previously affirmed Alexis\u2019 conviction and sentence. <em>See United States v. Alexis, </em>125 Fed.Appx. 980 (11th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated our prior decision and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-27\">In his initial brief on direct appeal, Alexis did not assert error based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or any other case extending or applying the <em>Apprendi </em>principle. However, Alexis sought permission to file a supplemental brief to present additional arguments concerning <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). We granted Alexis\u2019 motion, but the Government asked for reconsideration. We granted reconsideration on September 8, 2004, and decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>to consider the case on the briefs previously filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">In <em>United States v. Sears, </em>411 F.3d 1240, 1241 (11th Cir.2005), a case with a procedural history similar to this one, we held that <em>Booker </em>did not require us to alter our prior decision because Sears did not raise a <em>Booker </em>issue in his initial brief, was denied leave to file a supplemental brief raising <em>Booker, </em>and nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order demanded a different conclusion. The same reasoning holds in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Because Alexis did not assert error based on <em>Apprendi </em>(or its progeny) in his initial brief on appeal, we reinstate our previous opinion in this case and affirm Alexis\u2019 conviction and sentence after our reconsideration in light of <em>Booker, </em>pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">OPINION REINSTATED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b496-7\">TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ALO\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">The court declines to consider appellant\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim on the merits because appellant failed to present the claim in his initial brief on appeal. Binding precedent requires us to disregard the claim for that reason. <em>See United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, <em>reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>273 F.3d 991 (11th Cir.2001), and its progeny, e.g., <em>United States v. Sears, </em>411 F.3d 1240 (11th Cir.2005). I therefore concur in the court\u2019s judgment. Were we writing on a clean slate, I would, for the reasons I have previously expressed, entertain appellant\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim on the merits. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>418 F.3d 1136, 1142 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
