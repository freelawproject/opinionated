The district court dismissed Ramirez\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as time-barred because it was filed more than one year after her judgment of conviction became final. Ramirez requested a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d), which the district court granted only as to the issue of whether her \u00a7 2255 motion was timely. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 104-132,110 Stat. 1214 (1996), governs this appeal because Ramirez\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was filed in 2004, after the AEDPA\u2019s enactment. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a \u00a7 2255 motion was time-barred. <em>See Jones v. United States, </em>304 F.3d 1035, 1037 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">On appeal, Ramirez argues that her judgment of conviction did not become final until the time period for seeking a writ of certiorari expired, which was 90 days after entry of final judgment. Ramirez asserts that, because she filed her \u00a7 2255 motion within 1 year and 90 days of the entry of her written judgment of conviction, her motion was timely, and the district court erred by dismissing it as time-barred. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The AEDPA established a one-year statute of limitations applicable to \u00a7 2255 motions, which begins to run from, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In most cases, a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time for filing a direct appeal expires. <em>Akins v. United States, </em>204 F.3d 1086, 1089 n. 1 (11th Cir.2000). There are two recognized exceptions to this general rule, which apply when a federal prisoner seeks direct appellate review of her conviction or sentence. First, if, following the disposition of her direct appeal, a federal prisoner files a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court, the conviction becomes final when the Supreme Court either denies certiorari or issues a decision on the merits. <em>See Washington v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 1299, 1300 (11th Cir.2001). Second, if the federal prisoner does not file a timely certiorari petition after disposition of her direct appeal, the conviction becomes final on the date on which the prisoner\u2019s time for filing such a petition expires, which is 90 days after the entry of judgment on direct appeal. <em>See Clay v. United States, </em>537 U.S. 522, 532, 123 S.Ct. 1072, 1079, 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003). Here, neither exception applies because Ramirez did not file a direct appeal of her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">For federal prisoners, the time for filing a direct appeal expires ten days after the written judgment of conviction is entered on the criminal docket. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A)\u00ae, (6). Neither of the recognized exceptions to the general rule that, for \u00a7 2255 statute of limitations purposes, a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time for filing a direct appeal expires, applies here. Ramirez\u2019s conviction became final on May 12, 2003, and, therefore, her \u00a7 2255 motion, which was filed on July 28, 2004, was untimely. Accordingly, the district court did not err by dismissing Ramirez\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
