Hicks was issued a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following issues: (1) whether <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), or <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), are retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review, and (2) if so, whether Hicks was permitted to challenge his sentences pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 6(3). For the reasons stated more fully below, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Hicks\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-25\">Hicks, a federal prisoner serving a 262-month sentence for conspiracy to distribute cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to vacate, correct, or set aside his federal sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The record reflects that Hicks pled guilty to the drug charge and judgment was entered on December 20, 2001. No direct appeal was ever filed, and Hicks\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was not signed until July 29, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-26\">In his supporting memorandum, Hicks argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that he had been sentenced in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights because his sentence was enhanced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>on the basis of prior convictions and drug quantity, as found by a judge, in violation of <em>Blakely v. Washington. </em>Hicks asserted that <em>Blakely </em>applied retroactively to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">A magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation, finding that Hicks\u2019s motion was untimely under \u00a7 2255\u2019s one-year limitation period for filing, which started running from the date that Hicks\u2019s conviction became final, January 2, 2002, when the time to file a direct appeal expired. Thus, the report addressed whether a later commencement date should apply or whether Hicks qualified for equitable tolling. The report recommended that Hicks\u2019s motion be denied because the new right on which Hicks relied in <em>Blakely, </em>assuming it had any applicability to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, was not retroactively applicable on collateral review. Alternatively, the magistrate found that <em>Blakely </em>did not apply retroactively for the purposes of commencing anew the one-year limitation period under \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 6(8), and, in any event, Hicks\u2019s claim was procedurally barred because he had failed to raise the issue on direct appeal and could not establish cause and prejudice for his default.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Hicks filed objections, conceding that his \u00a7 2255 motion was untimely based on the date his conviction became final, but argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that (1) <em>Blakely </em>announced a newly recognized right under <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989); (2) the new right was a substantive rule of constitutional law affecting fundamental rights under the Sixth Amendment; (3) <em>Blakely </em>required an entirely different burden of proof, meaning it was not merely procedural; (4) the accuracy of the proceedings was seriously impaired; and (5) the rule in <em>Blakely </em>should be applied retroactively on collateral review, which would render his \u00a7 2255 motion timely under \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 6(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The district court found that the report and recommendation was correct and supported by this Court\u2019s earlier decision in <em>United States v. Reese, </em>382 F.3d 1308 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that <em>Blakely </em>did not apply to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines), <em>vacated by </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1089, 160 L.Ed.2d 1058 (2005). The court further found that, even if <em>Blakely </em>were held applicable to the federal guidelines, Hicks would not be helped because he had previously failed to raise the issue. Hicks appealed the district court\u2019s decision. In a January 28, 2005, order, we granted a COA on the aforementioned issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">On appeal, Hicks argues first that <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>are not new rules of law, but actually an application of the existing rules that had been in existence since <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), making retroactivity a \u201cforegone conclusion.\u201d He next argues that, assuming <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>are new rules of law, they are retroactively applicable under <em>Teague </em>because the new rule announced is a substantive rule, and not merely procedural. Should we find the rule to be procedural, Hicks argues that the rule is still retroactively applicable under <em>Teague </em>because the procedure implicates fundamental fairness of judicial proceedings and the accuracy of the outcome. He argues that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Blakely </em>are distinguishable from <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. <em>2428, 158 </em>L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), because in <em>Ring, </em>regardless of whether a judge or jury made factual findings, the burden of proof was beyond a reasonable doubt, as opposed to by a preponderance of the evidence. Finally, Hicks argues that error under <em>Booker </em>is structural error requiring automatic rever<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>sal because it alters the government\u2019s burden of proof regarding facts at sentencing, and is not subject to Teague\u2019s non-retroactivity analysis. Hicks concludes that, because <em>Booker </em>is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review, his \u00a7 2255 motion is timely under \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 6(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">As a preliminary matter, in <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory nature of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of a right to a jury trial. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at -, 125 S.Ct. at 749-51. Our review is limited to the issues specified in the COA. <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998). When reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review questions of law <em>de novo </em>and findings of fact for clear error. <em>Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 867 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>whether a <em>Booker </em>claim is barred by the non-retroactivity doctrine of <em>Teague. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">After Hicks\u2019s motion for a COA had been granted, this Court held that the new rule in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>did not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review under <em>Teague </em>and concluded that <em>\u201cBooker\u2019 </em>s constitutional rule falls squarely under the category of new rules of criminal procedure that do not apply retroactively to \u00a7 2255 cases on collateral review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 867-68. Thus, Hicks\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion invoking <em>Blakely </em>was properly dismissed as time-barred because the new rule in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review and, therefore, cannot trigger a later starting date for the statute of limitations under \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 6(3). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 6(3) (providing that the statute of limitations shall run from, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review\u201d). We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-8\">.
