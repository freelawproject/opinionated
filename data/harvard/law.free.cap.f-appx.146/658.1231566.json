We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>Nos. CR-02-133-DWS; CA-03-3964-22-3 (D.S.C. May 16, 2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We deny Miller\u2019s pending motions for a certificate of appealability as unnecessary and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-26\">. Miller titled the motion as a \u201cMotion to Recall Mandate.\u201d (R. 16).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b685-16\">. We also note that Miller did in fact file a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court, which was denied June 28, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
