Castenada-Rojas was sentenced in February 2005, after the decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court sentenced Castenada-Rojas to seventy four months\u2019 imprisonment. He appeals, claiming his sentence is unreasonable. He alleges the district court relied exclusively on the sentencing range provided for by <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>Ch. 5, Pt. A (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">After <em>Booker, </em>a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). However, in determining a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the guideline range prescribed thereby as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. A <em>post-Booker </em>sentence will be affirmed if it is both reasonable and within the statutorily prescribed range. <em>Id. </em>at 546-47. Further, \u201cwhile we believe that the appropriate circumstances for imposing a sentence outside the guideline range will depend on the facts of individual cases, we have no reason to doubt that most sentences will continue to fall within the applicable range.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 219 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Here, the sentencing transcript clearly indicates the district court imposed a sentence that was both reasonable and within the statutorily-prescribed range.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> It stated that the sentenced imposed was pursuant to Booker\u2019s directions and remarked that it \u201cwould have imposed a larger sentence but for [defense counsel\u2019s] comments,\u201d making clear that it did not deem a sentence below the guidelines range to be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">Finding no error, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b708-9\"> Illegal reentry after deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2) (2000), carries an imprisonment term of not more than twenty years. Possession of a firearm by an illegal alien, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(5), 924 (2000), carries an imprisonment term of not more than ten years.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
