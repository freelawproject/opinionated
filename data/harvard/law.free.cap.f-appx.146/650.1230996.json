We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-25\">When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v.

We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b677-16\"> Little\u2019s notice of appeal was post-marked May 23, 2005, and she did not make a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746 (2000) or by a notarized statement setting forth the date of any earlier deposit with prison authorities. <em>See </em>Fed.
