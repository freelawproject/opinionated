Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court granted Jones\u2019s petition, vacated his sentence, and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Booker. </em>We requested and received supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker. </em>Having reconsidered our decision pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions, we reinstate our judgment affirming the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-21\">Jones was indicted for being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). Jones waived his right to a jury trial and was tried before the court on stipulated facts. The district court found Jones guilty and sentenced him to 80 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-22\">In his supplemental brief, Jones advances two arguments. First, Jones contends that his \u201cconstitutional rights were violated when he was sentenced under a Guidelines range based on enhancements that were not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt and not admitted by him but were determined by the district court (presumably) only on a preponderance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>the evidence.\u201d Second, Jones complains that \u201cthere was error under <em>Booker </em>because [he] was sentenced under the assumption of a mandatory Guidelines system that was held unconstitutional in Booker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Jones concedes that review is for plain error because he raised no <em>Booker </em>objection in the district court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cAn appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is \u2018(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If all three conditions are met, then we may exercise our discretion to notice the error only if it also \u201c \u2018seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">\u201cIt is clear after <em>Booker </em>that application of the Guidelines in their mandatory form constitutes error that is plain.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consequently, the first two requirements of the plain error test are met. The third prong of the test, however, is not satisfied in this case. To demonstrate that his substantial rights were affected, Jones must show that the district court\u2019s error affected the outcome of the proceedings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To meet that burden, Jones must show \u201cwith a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome, that if the judge had sentenced him under an advisory sentencing regime rather than a mandatory one, he would have received a lesser sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That is, Jones must point to some \u201cindication in the record from the sentencing judge\u2019s remarks or otherwise\u201d that the sentencing judge \u201cwould have reached a different conclusion\u201d under an advisory sentencing scheme.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-16\">Jones concedes that nothing in the record indicates that the district judge would have imposed a different sentence under an advisory scheme, but argues for the first time on remand that due process and ex post facto concerns require us to vacate and remand to the district court for resentencing. Jones recognizes that this argument is foreclosed by the court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Scroggins,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but makes this argument to preserve it for Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-17\">Jones also contends that plain error review should not apply because error applying the mandatory Guidelines scheme was structural in nature and affected the entire framework of the sentencing in his case. Jones maintains that the court should presume prejudice and reverse his sentence. He recognizes, however, that this characterization is contrary to the court\u2019s deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>mination in <em>Mares </em>and raises the argument to preserve it for Supreme Court review.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Because nothing in the record indicates that the district judge would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory sentencing scheme, Jones has not shown that his rights were substantially affected and has failed to demonstrate plain error. Accordingly, we conclude that nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>decision requires us to change our prior affirmance in this case. We therefore reinstate our judgment affirming the defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b751-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-13\">. <em>See United States v.
