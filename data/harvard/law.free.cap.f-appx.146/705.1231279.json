During a shakedown at the Jail on or about October 7, 2001, two correctional officers, Bilinsky and Teel, confiscated the bandage from his cell while he was showering. They took the bandage to Nurse Phelps-Sanders, who told them to discard it because its owner was not using it. Nickleberry had removed the bandage for his shower because the Jail had provided him nothing to protect it from water. He allegedly sent a \u201ckite\u201d to the Jail\u2019s medical department complaining about this incident, but Phelps-Sanders did not respond until sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>eral weeks later, when an X-ray was scheduled in early November 2001. Nickleberry asserted that these actions by Phelps-Sanders resulted in his wrist being refraetured and amounted to deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The district court denied Phelps-Sanders\u2019s summary judgment motion that was based on qualified immunity, concluding that \u201cthere are ... many disputed facts\u201d and that \u201cdisputes over material fact exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Although an appellate court ordinarily does not have jurisdiction to review a denial of summary judgment, <em>see Palmer v. Johnson, </em>193 F.3d 346, 350-51 (5th Cir.1999), we retain jurisdiction to determine as a matter of law whether a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity, after accepting all of the plaintiffs factual allegations as true, by determining whether these facts show that the defendant\u2019s conduct was objectively reasonable under clearly established law. <em>Behrens v. Pelletier, </em>516 U.S. 299, 313, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996); <em>Colston v. Barnhart, </em>130 F.3d 96, 98-99 (5th Cir.1997), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>146 F.3d 282 (5th Cir.1998). Although the district court concluded that \u201cmaterial\u201d factual issues remained and denied Johnson\u2019s qualified-immunity assertion on this basis, we may review the record in order \u201c \u2018to determine what facts the district court, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, likely assumed.\u2019\u201d <em>Kinney v. Weaver, </em>367 F.3d 337, 346 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 102, 160 L.Ed.2d 121 (2004) (citing <em>Johnson v. Jones, </em>515 U.S. 304, 319, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995)); <em>see Behrens, </em>516 U.S. at 313, 116 S.Ct. 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">This court reviews <em>de novo </em>the grant of a motion for summary judgment predicated on qualified immunity. <em>Cousin v. Small, </em>325 F.3d 627, 637 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 826, 124 S.Ct. 181, 157 L.Ed.2d 48 (2003). Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with any affidavits filed in support of the motion, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.CivP. 56(c). Government officials performing discretionary functions are protected from civil liability under the doctrine of qualified immunity if their conduct violates no \u201cclearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">Federal courts review claims of qualified immunity under a two-step analysis. <em>See Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). First, a court asks whether, \u201c[tjaken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officers\u2019 conduct violated a constitutional right?\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf the allegations do not establish the violation of a constitutional right, the officer is entitled to qualified immunity.... If the allegations make out a constitutional violation, we must ask whether the right was clearly established\u2014that is, whether \u2018it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> <em>Price v. Roark, </em>256 F.3d 364, 369 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151); <em>Wilson v. Layne, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>526 U.S. 603, 614, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999) (\u201cwhether an official protected by qualified immunity may be held personally liable for an allegedly unlawful official action generally turns on the \u2018objective legal reasonableness\u2019 of the action, assessed in light of the legal rules that were \u2018clearly established\u2019 at the time it was taken\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Nickleberry\u2019s dehberate-indifference claim against Nurse Phelps-Sanders essentially consisted of two components: (1) her allegedly having directed correctional officials Bilinsky and Teel to discard his bandage; and (2) her alleged failure to rectify this matter and respond to his subsequent request for treatment. With respect to the first component, Nickleberry\u2019s allegations, even if accepted as true, were insufficient to show that it was \u201cclear\u201d to Phelps-Sanders that her \u201cconduct was unlawful in the situation [s]he confronted.\u201d <em>Price, </em>256 F.3d at 369 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Nickleberry has not made specific allegations or submitted specific summary-judgment evidence to support a showing that Phelps-Sanders was even aware of Nickleberry\u2019s specific medical condition or that she should have been aware of a \u201csubstantial risk of serious harm\u201d relating to the discarding of the bandage. <em>See Wagner v. Bay City, Tex., </em>227 F.3d 316, 324 (5th Cir.2000). As Phelps-Sanders has argued, nothing in the record suggests that Nickle-berry was prevented from immediately asking the medical staff for another bandage.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">With respect to the alleged delay in medical care, Nickleberry has insisted that the confiscation incident occurred on October 7, 2001, and that he received no medical relief until early November 2001. Nickleberry\u2019s own evidentiary submissions, however, including a copy of his own grievance regarding the alleged confiscation, firmly establish that the incident occurred on October 24, 2001. Nickleberry\u2019s evidentiary submissions reflect that he filed the grievance one day after the incident and that an X-ray was scheduled within two days after the medical staff learned of the incident. Moreover, those evidentiary submissions do <em>not </em>support Nickleberry\u2019s insistence that he sent a \u201ckite\u201d to the medical department regarding this matter on October 7, 2001. In summary, Nickleberry\u2019s factual allegations are not supported by the documents he submitted in support of his own summary-judgment response. That evidence offers no support for the notion that Phelps-Sanders had \u201csubjective knowledge of the risk of harm\u201d faced by Nickleberry when Bilinsky and Teel took the bandage or that Nickleberry suffered injuries relating to this incident. <em>See Mace v. City of Palestine, </em>333 F.3d 621, 625-26 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Wagner, </em>227 F.3d at 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Because Nickleberry\u2019s speculative and conclusory factual assertions and his own summary-judgment evidence do not show that Phelps-Sanders violated \u201cclearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known,\u201d <em>Harlow, </em>457 U.S. at 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, we conclude that the district court erred in rejecting Phelps-Sanders\u2019s qualified-immunity claim. The judgment is REVERSED, and we REMAND with instructions that judgment be entered in favor of Phelps-Sanders.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Nickleberry\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">REVERSED AND REMANDED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b732-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
