The sole issue on appeal is whether the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support Hunter\u2019s convictions. We conclude the evidence was sufficient and affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-16\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b446-17\">Hunter failed to move for a judgment of acquittal after all the evidence was presented, thus we will \u201creverse the conviction only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>See United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002). Under this standard, the evidence on a key element of the offense must be \u201cso tenuous that a conviction would be shocking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We may not review determinations made by the jury as to the credibility of witness testimony unless such testimony is \u201cincredible as a matter of law.\u201d <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1351 (11th Cir.1999). Testimony is incredible as a matter of law only when it is \u201cunbelievable on its face\u201d and relates to \u201cfacts that the witness physically could not have possibly observed or events that could not have occurred under the laws of nature.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number><em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1325 (11th Cir.1997) (internal quotations and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">A. <em>Distribution of Cocaine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">In order to convict a defendant of distribution of cocaine, the government must prove the defendant knowingly or intentionally distributed or dispensed a controlled substance. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Sergeant Walton and Investigator Beaty testified they set up a controlled buy between William Pennywell and Hunter. Both officers testified they personally did not have Pennywell in sight during the entire buy, but they each followed Pennywell from their locations and communicated with the other officers about his whereabouts at all times. Investigator Beaty further testified he conducted searches of Pennywell at all integral parts of the controlled buy and Pennywell did not have any cocaine in his possession until after he left Hunter\u2019s house for the last time. Moreover, Pennywell testified he participated in the controlled buy and he received the cocaine from Hunter. Because the jury found the testimony of Sergeant Walton, Investigator Beaty, and Pennywell credible, and their testimony was not \u201cunbelievable on its face,\u201d their credibility may not be reviewed by this Court. <em>See Calderon, </em>127 F.3d at 1325. Therefore, the Government\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish each element of the distribution charge, specifically that Hunter knowingly or intentionally distributed a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">B. <em>Firearms Offenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">In order to convict a defendant of possession of a firearm by a felon, the government must prove: (1) the defendant has been convicted, in any court, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, and (2) the defendant shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, or possessed in or affecting commerce, (3) any firearm or ammunition. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). In <em>United States v. Gunn, </em>369 F.3d 1229, 1235 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 324, 160 L.Ed.2d 244 (2004), we determined that, in order to convict a defendant of possession of a firearm by a felon, the government must prove the defendant had actual or constructive possession of the firearm. We stated: \u201c[a] defendant has constructive possession if he exercises ownership, dominion, or control over the firearm\u201d or if he \u201chas the power and intention to exercise dominion or control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Analyzing the sufficiency of the evidence required to support a conviction for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-related crime, we determined: \u201cthere must be a showing of some nexus between the firearm and the drug selling operation.\u201d <em>United States v. Timmons, </em>283 F.3d 1246, 1253 (11th Cir.2002) (internal quotations and citations omitted). We further stated the nexus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayb\">can be established by the type of drug activity that is being conducted, accessibility of the firearm, the type of the weapon, whether the weapon is stolen, the status of the possession (legitimate or illegal), whether the gun is loaded, proximity to the drugs or drug profits, and the time and circumstances under which the gun is found.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-12\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">Sergeant Walton testified that, during a search of Hunter\u2019s home, he discovered marijuana in a room believed to be Hunter\u2019s. Sergeant Walton also testified the marijuana and a firearm found in the closet both were easily accessible from where Hunter was standing. Officer Luther corroborated Sergeant Walton\u2019s assertion the room was Hunter\u2019s, stating he found numerous pictures of Hunter and documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>bearing Hunter\u2019s name located in the same room as where the marijuana and firearm were found. Further, Officer Pennington testified she found a loaded firearm in a suitcase bearing Hunter\u2019s name located in that same room. Witness Omeca Langston also confirmed she had purchased marijuana from Hunter minutes before the police arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">In light of this evidence, the Government sufficiently established Hunter had constructive possession of the firearm found in the closet. From Hunter\u2019s location in the room and the evidence the room belonged to him, the Government established Hunter had \u201cownership, dominion, or control over the firearm,\u201d or he had \u201cthe power and intention to exercise dominion or control.\u201d <em>See Gunn, </em>369 F.3d at 1235. Furthermore, under the factors set out in <em>Timmons, </em>the Government sufficiently established a nexus between Hunter\u2019s possession of the firearm and his possession of marijuana by showing the firearm and marijuana were both within Hunter\u2019s reach, the firearm was loaded, and Hunter was actively involved in selling marijuana, as evidenced by Langston\u2019s testimony. <em>See Timmons, </em>283 F.3d at 1253. Thus, the Government established Hunter, having been previously convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year imprisonment, knowingly possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Hunter has not demonstrated the evidence relating to a key element of any of the charged offenses was so tenuous his conviction would be considered shocking. Accordingly, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
