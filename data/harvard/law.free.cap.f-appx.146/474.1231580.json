R.Crim.P. 12(b). On March 7, 2005, Llewlyn, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a \u201cNunc Pro Tunc Motion to Dismiss Indictment Pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(f) <em>&amp; </em>12(b), et. seq.,\u201d asserting various defects in his indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">In the instant case, Llewlyn is using Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b) to attack his conviction and sentence after this court affirmed this conviction and sentence on direct appeal, and his \u00a7 2255 motion was unsuccessful. Because Llewlyn\u2019s motion was the functional equivalent of a successive motion to vacate, within the meaning of \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), and because he never obtained leave to file a successive motion, it was subject to dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Felker v. Turpin, </em>101 F.3d 657, 660-61 (11th Cir.1996); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(requiring the dismissal of successive petitions for which no leave is obtained). As such, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
