INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). Moreover, it is well established that the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen is a final order of removal. <em>See Rose v. Woolwine, </em>344 F.2d 993, 994-95 (4th Cir.1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">Anga\u2019s petition was filed thirty-three days after the Board\u2019s affirmance of the immigration judge\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen; thus, her petition was untimely. Absent jurisdiction to review the merits of this claim, we dismiss Anga\u2019s petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
