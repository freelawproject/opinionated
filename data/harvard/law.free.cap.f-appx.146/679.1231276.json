On appeal, Lloyd contends the district court erred by denying to suppress the gun found on his person. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">We review factual findings underlying a district court\u2019s suppression determination for clear error and the district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). When a suppression motion has been denied, this court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">\u201cAn officer may, consistent with the Fourth Amendment, conduct a brief, investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 123, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000); <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). To conduct a <em>Terry </em>stop, there must be \u201cat least a minimal level of objective justification for making the stop.\u201d <em>Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. at 123, 120 S.Ct. 673. Reasonable suspicion requires more than a hunch but less than probable cause and may be based on the collective knowledge of officers involved in an investigation. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Hensley, </em>469 U.S. 221, 232, 105 S.Ct. 675, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Officers conducting a lawful <em>Terry </em>stop may take steps reasonably necessary to protect their personal safety, check for identification, and maintain the status quo. <em>Hensley, </em>469 U.S. at 229, 235, 105 S.Ct. 675; <em>see also United States v. Moore, </em>817 F.2d 1105, 1108 (4th Cir.1987) (brief but complete restriction of liberty is valid under <em>Terry).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Once a stop is conducted, \u201cif the officer believes that the person being stopped \u2018may be armed and presently dangerous,\u2019 the officer may frisk the person by patting his outer clothing \u2018in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to assault [the officer].\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Mayo, </em>361 F.3d 802, 805 (4th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">We find the district court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous. We further find law enforcement authorities had reasonable suspicion to stop the car in which Lloyd was a passenger and to search Lloyd for a firearm after he refused to follow instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
