No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-25\">Johnson raises a single issue on appeal: whether the sentencing court committed reversible constitutional error under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Johnson argues that the sentencing judge impermissibly added two levels to his base offense level for possession of a dangerous weapon pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) based on a judicial finding of fact that the firearm\u2014whose possession Johnson admitted\u2014was connected to the drug offense. At sentencing, Johnson objected to the firearm enhancement based on his contention that the weapon was unconnected to the drugs; but Johnson raised no constitutional challenge to the enhancement at sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because this Blakely\u2014now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number><em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)\u2014 issue is raised for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>See Booker, </em>124 S.Ct. at 769, <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (U2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">On plain error review, a defendant must show \u201cerror\u201d that is \u201cplain\u201d and that \u201caffect[s] substantial rights\u201d. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). It is only after these conditions have been satisfied that an appellate court has discretion to notice a forfeited error. An appellate court may remedy error that is plain and affects substantial rights only if \u201cthe error \u2018seriously affects[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 1549, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997), quoting <em>Olano, </em>113 S.Ct. at 1776.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Section \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) imposes a two level increase in the base offense level of offenses involving drugs if a dangerous weapon is possessed. Under the commentary, the enhancement \u201cshould be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, n. 3. Johnson admitted at sentencing that the loaded gun found in a closet in the room used as a methamphetamine lab was his gun; Johnson argued that the firearm was unconnected to the drugs. The district court stated that Johnson failed to show that it was clearly improbable that the firearm was connected to the drug offense. Instead, the district court stated that it could not \u201cimagine all the coincidents [sic] and circumstances\u201d that would have to apply to show the \u201cgun just happened to be in a room where a meth lab was located.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">In <em>Rodriguez, </em>we recognized that an enhancement imposed under a mandatory guidelines system based on facts found by the judge that went beyond those admitted by the defendant or found by the jury constituted <em>Booker </em>error. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298-99. And, because of <em>Booker, </em>we concluded that such error is now plain. To the extent that Johnson challenges judicial fact finding<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that went beyond his admissions, the first two requirements for plain error relief would be satisfied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-14\">Johnson fails, however, to satisfy the third requirement: that the error \u201caffected substantial rights.\u201d As we explained in <em>Rodriguez, </em>the <em>Booker </em>error is not the use of extra-verdict enhancements; it is \u201cthe use of extra-verdict enhancements to reach a guidelines result that is binding on the sentencing judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301. To show the prejudice required for plain error relief, a claimant must show a \u201creasonable probability of a different result if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>guidelines had been applied in an advisory instead of binding fashion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Johnson has not met his burden of showing that a <em>Booker </em>error in his case affected the outcome of his sentencing. <em>See id. </em>at 1801, 1806. Johnson proffers nothing to show that a reasonable probability exists that the sentencing judge would have imposed a more lenient sentence had the guidelines been applied in an advisory and non-binding fashion. <em>See id. </em>at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-16\">. Johnson pleaded guilty to one count of a five count indictment pursuant to a written plea agreement that contained a sentence appeal waiver. Because the government failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>to raise the appeal waiver as a bar to Johnson\u2019s sentence enhancement challenge, we will not address the applicability of the appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 830 (11th Cir.2000) (\"Parties must submit all issues on appeal in their initial briefs.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b350-10\">. Johnson challenges only the district court\u2019s conclusion that the firearm was connected to the drug offense. While we will accept that this determination is a factual finding that can constitute <em>Booker </em>error, arguably at issue only is the application of the guidelines to the admitted fact of possession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b350-16\">. In <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1331 (11th Cir.2005), it was also concluded that <em>\"Booker </em>error exists when the district court misapplies the Guidelines by considering them as binding as opposed to advisory.\u201d And such statutory <em>Booker </em>error exists \"even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\" <em>Id. </em>at 1330-31.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
