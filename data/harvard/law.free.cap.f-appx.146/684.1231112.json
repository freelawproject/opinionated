INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotations omitted). Credibility findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. A trier of fact who rejects an applicant\u2019s testimony on credibility grounds must offer specific, cogent reasons for doing so. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). The immigration judge did so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">We have reviewed the evidence of record and find that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Sumarlin failed to establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Accordingly, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of asylum relief, as affirmed by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-15\">As Sumarlin failed to sustain his burden on the asylum claim, he cannot establish his entitlement to withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum\u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same\u2014an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Therefore, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-16\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b711-12\"> Sumarlin does not challenge the immigration judge\u2019s denial of protection under the Convention Against Torture. Therefore, this claim is waived. <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
