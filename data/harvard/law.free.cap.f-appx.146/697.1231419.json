We review the denial of a motion <em>to </em>modify a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>59 F.3d 481, 483 (4th Cir.1995). \u201cA court ... abuses its discretion if it makes a mistake of law.\u201d <em>Randall v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>302 F.3d 188, 211 (4th Cir.2002); <em>James v. Jacobson, </em>6 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.1993). We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s order and conclude that the district court mistakenly believed it did not have jurisdiction to consider Watkins\u2019 motion on the merits. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 1B1.10 (2000) (stating that Amendment 591 applies retroactively). Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s orders and remand for further proceedings. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-22\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
