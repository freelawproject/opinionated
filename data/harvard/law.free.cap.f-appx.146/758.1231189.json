She argues that she was sentenced in contravention to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), when her sentence was enhanced pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(5) (2003) and by virtue of the fact that she was sentenced pursuant to the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines regime.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>The district court, however, opined that if the Guidelines were held unconstitutional, it would impose the same sentence. Therefore, the Government has carried its burden of establishing that the sentencing errors suffered by Ruano were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 464 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 376 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b784-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
