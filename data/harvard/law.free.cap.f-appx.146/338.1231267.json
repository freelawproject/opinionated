Martinez did not file a direct appeal of his convictions. Martinez alleged that he filed a Fla.R.Crim.P. (\u201cRule\u201d) 3.800(c) motion in May 2002, which was denied sometime thereafter. In September 2003, Martinez filed a Rule 3.850 motion, which was denied in January 2004. Martinez appealed the denial, and the state court of appeals affirmed. Martinez then filed the instant \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The district court sua sponte determined that the \u00a7 2254 petition was time-barred because the Rule 3.800(c) motion did not toll the AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations, and the Rule 3.850 motion was itself untimely. Martinez requested a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d), which the district court denied. This court then granted a COA on the following issues: \u201cWhether the district court properly found that appellant\u2019s Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.800(c) motion did not toll the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\u2019s statute of limitations pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2)? If not, whether appellant\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was time-barred?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief under \u00a7 2254 de novo. <em>Maharaj v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>304 F.3d 1345, 1348 (11th Cir.2002). A district court\u2019s determination that a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition is time-barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) also is reviewed de novo. <em>Bridges v. Johnson, </em>284 F.3d 1201, 1202 (11th Cir.2002). Pro se pleadings are entitled to liberal construction. <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 596, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">Here, the limited record on appeal does not include a copy of Martinez\u2019s post-conviction motion(s). Martinez originally asserted that he filed his post-conviction motion pursuant to Rule 3.800(c), but he now alleges that he brought the motion under subsection (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the district court sua sponte dismissed the petition as time-barred, the record has not been developed sufficiently to determine whether the confusion over the type of motion Martinez filed is the result of a mere scrivener\u2019s error on Martinez\u2019s part or whether Martinez actually filed a Rule 3.800(c) motion. As we cannot ascertain from the record what subsection of Rule 3.800 Martinez relied on or what claims he raised in his post-conviction motion(s), we cannot determine whether the district court properly applied the AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations. Moreover, the scope of the COA is limited to the issue of whether a Rule 3.800(c) motion would toll the statute of limitations, and, therefore, we cannot reach the issue of timeliness based on Martinez\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion(s).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we VACATE and REMAND for the district court to develop the record and address these issues.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-18\">. Martinez filed his petition after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 104-32, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), and, therefore, the provisions of that act govern this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\">. The state concedes that Martinez filed at least one Rule 3.800(a) motion, and that a properly filed Rule 3.800 motion would toll the statute of limitations. In contrast, according to the state, a Rule 3.800(c) motion is not a tolling motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b365-9\">. <em>Nelson v. Schofeld, </em>371 F.3d 768, 770 n. 4 (11th Cir.2004) (limiting appellate review to those issues specified in the COA); <em>Murray v.
