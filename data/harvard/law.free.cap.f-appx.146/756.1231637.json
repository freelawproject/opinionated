The district court determined that Garza was an armed career criminal and sentenced him to the statutory minimum of 180 months in prison pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-21\">Garza argues that the district court erred in determining that his Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation was a qualifying violent felony conviction for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Garza contends that this court\u2019s holding to the contrary in <em>United States v. Silva, </em>957 F.2d 157, 162 (5th Cir.1992), was undercut by <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). <em>Shepard </em>did not undercut <em>Silva; Shepard </em>extended the holding of <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), to cases in the guilty-plea context and clarified which documents could be considered when determining whether a prior conviction is for a generic burglary that can be used to enhance a sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act. <em>See Shepard, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1263. Alternatively, Garza concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Silva, </em>but he nevertheless raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-24\">Garza argues that his sentence was improperly enhanced under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) because the indictment did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>contain any information regarding his pri- or convictions and because the fact of those convictions were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. He concedes that his argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Stone, </em>306 F.3d 241, 243 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Affleck, </em>861 F.2d 97, 99 (5th Cir.1988). He further concedes that is argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Garza is raising the issue to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Garza also argues that the statute of conviction, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), is unconstitutional because it does not require a substantial effect on interstate commerce and is thus an improper exercise of Congress\u2019s power under the Commerce Clause. This argument is unavailing. \u201cThis court has repeatedly emphasized that the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1) is not open to question.\u201d <em>United States v. De Leon, </em>170 F.3d 494, 499 (5th Cir.1999). Garza concedes that his argument is foreclosed and raises it to preserve it for further possible review.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b782-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
