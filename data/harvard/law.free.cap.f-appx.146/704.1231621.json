Reviewing de novo, we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">1. Our appellate jurisdiction in this case is limited initially to determining whether the district court had jurisdiction under the Little Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(2); <em>Smith v. Orr, </em>855 F.2d 1544, 1547-52 (Fed.Cir.1988).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">2. We conclude that the Union lacked representational standing because McCrary\u2019s individual involvement in the case is necessary. <em>Friends of the Earth v. Laidla Envtl. Servs., </em>528 U.S. 167, 181, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000) (stating that representational standing requires that neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members of the organization); <em>Zuspann v. Brown, </em>60 F.3d 1156, 1160 (5th Cir.1995) (\u2018We are free to uphold the district court\u2019s judgment on any basis that is supported by the record[.]\u201d). We affirm the dismissal of the Union from the suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-7\">3. The determination of whether a contract existed between McCrary and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requiring payment of the salary specified in the offer letter is determinative of both the district court\u2019s jurisdiction under the Little Tucker Act and the merits of McCrary\u2019s breach of contract claim. The district court was therefore required to assume jurisdiction and decide the claim on the merits. <em>Williamson v. Tucker, </em>645 F.2d 404, 415-16 (5th Cir.1981). Because the district court did not so here, we vacate its dismissal of the breach of contract claim for want of jurisdiction and remand for a determination on the merits. Review of that court\u2019s judgment on the merits will be available only in the Federal Circuit. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-9\">4. The district court lacked jurisdiction over McCrary\u2019s due process claim. The Little Tucker Act provides a waiver of sovereign immunity and a grant of federal jurisdiction over constitutional claims for money damages only where the constitutional provision in question mandates payment of money damages. <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 400-02, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976). The Due Process Clause is not such a provision. <em>LeBlanc v. United States, </em>50 F.3d 1025, 1028 (Fed.Cir.1995); <em>Duarte v. United States, </em>532 F.2d 850, 852 (2d Cir.1976). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of McCrary\u2019s due process claim for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Zuspann, </em>60 F.3d at 1160.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b730-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
