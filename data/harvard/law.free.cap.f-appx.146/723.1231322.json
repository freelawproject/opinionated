For the reasons that follow, Colatos\u2019s sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Colatos argues that the district court erred by characterizing his state conviction for possession of a controlled substance as an aggravated felony. He contends that a prior conviction must qualify as a felony under federal law in order to be an aggravated felony under the guidelines. Colatos\u2019s argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Avalos, </em>251 F.3d 505, 510 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Colatos contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), had been undermined by subsequent Supreme Court decisions and should be overruled. Colatos concedes that his argument is foreclosed, but he raises the issue to preserve it for further review. Colatos\u2019s argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Colatos contends that his sentence is unconstitutional because it was imposed pursuant to the formerly mandatory Sentencing Guidelines. He contends that his sentencing under the formerly mandatory Sentencing Guidelines was plainly erroneous and reversible pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); that the <em>Booker </em>error was structural in nature, thus excusing him from showing prejudice; that the <em>Booker </em>error was prejudicial because his presentation at sentencing might have been different had he known the guidelines were not binding, and because the district court might have imposed a different sentence after hearing a different sentencing presentation; and that, even if the <em>Booker </em>error was not structural, it should be presumed prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">Colatos\u2019s contention is reviewed under the plain error standard. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -(2005). Colatos cannot demonstrate that the plain error he has identified \u201caffected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 733 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court rejected Colatos\u2019s arguments for a downward departure based on his criminal history score overrepresenting the seriousness of his criminal history, his childhood disease, his mother leaving him at an early age, and his cultural assimilation. The district court assigned reasons for rejecting those arguments, and none of the district court\u2019s reasons indicated that it might have considered a lower sentence but for the mandatory sentencing scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b749-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
