SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b775-16\">In this appeal, we address whether the district court abused its discretion when it granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on a determination that plaintiffs\u2019 claims are barred by the statute of limitations. Because to toll limitations for fraudulent concealment under Mississippi law, there must be evidence of an affirmative act of concealment after the initial fraud, the district court appropriately dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims for fraud in the sale of insurance. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-18\">The plaintiffs sued to recover damages for alleged fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions by the defendants in the sale of consumer credit insurance that accompanied defendants\u2019 issuance of consumer loans.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The most recent of the transactions at issue transpired in May 1998; plaintiffs sued in February 2002, more than three years later. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that defendants misrepresented and concealed numerous material facts, including \u201cthe costs and benefits ... of purchasing insurance.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs concede that defendants did not engage in any acts of concealment after the sales transactions took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-19\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-20\">On appeal, the standard of review for the entry of summary judgment is <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Summary judgment is proper only where, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">All parties agree that Miss.Code \u00a7 15-1-49 is the applicable statute of limitations for plaintiffs\u2019 claims, establishing a three-year limitations period for fraud claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under Mississippi law, each of plaintiffs\u2019 claims accrued on the completion date of the loan transactions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, it is evident that plaintiffs have failed to bring their claims within the three-year statutorily defined period.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Plaintiffs contend, however, that defendants\u2019 fraudulent concealment tolls the running of the limitations period. Section 15-1-67 of the Mississippi Code states that \u201c[i]f a person liable to any personal action shall fraudulently conceal the cause of action from the knowledge of the person entitled thereto, the cause of action shall be deemed to have first accrued at, and not before, the time at which such fraud shall be, or with reasonable diligence might have been, first known or discovered.\u201d Consequently, to establish fraudulent concealment, plaintiffs must demonstrate (1) that defendants acted affirmatively to conceal the fraud; and (2) that plaintiffs could not have discovered the alleged fraud with the exercise of due diligence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-14\">Although plaintiffs concede that they bear the burden of demonstrating defendants\u2019 affirmative acts of concealment, they contend that such affirmative acts need not occur after the time of the alleged fraud. Rather, plaintiffs assert that the defendants\u2019 \u201cpattern of conduct\u201d at the time of the insurance sale was \u201cself-concealing.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The statute, speaking only of concealment, is seemingly ambiguous as to whether the affirmative acts need occur after the initial fraud or whether, to the contrary, acts of concealment at the time of the sale, like those alleged by plaintiffs, can also toll the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-15\">The plaintiffs argue that because the fraud here is of a \u201cself-concealing\u201d nature, they need only show evidence of the fraud itself to establish the first element of fraudulent concealment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, plaintiffs\u2019 assertions of affirmative acts at the time of the sale would be sufficient to establish this first required element. Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on Texas precedent is at best only persuasive, however, and not binding on our explication of Mississippi law.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-16\">Plaintiffs correctly note that at least one court has recognized that the affirmative-act question remains unresolved in Missis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>sippi.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Though plaintiffs cite another district court case for support of a lesser point,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that opinion does acknowledge that in 2002, the question on the timing of affirmative acts remained unresolved under Mississippi authority,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the opinion plaintiffs cite was vacated a few months later by the same district judge.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Therefore, the plaintiffs\u2019 entire argument must stand on this assumption that the timing of the affirmative-act requirement is still undecided in Mississippi and that, therefore, persuasive precedent from Texas should control here. We reject plaintiffs\u2019 invitation to apply Texas law, because in <em>Ross v. Citifinancial, Inc., </em>344 F.3d 458, 464 (5th Cir.2003), we held that Mississippi law is in fact well settled with respect to this issue, stating that \u201cMississippi law is unambiguous: Plaintiffs must prove a subsequent affirmative act of fraudulent concealment to toll the limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-14\">We adhere to the rule of <em>stare decisis </em>in interpreting state law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Absent a Mississippi Supreme Court decision or statutory amendment, the caselaw of this court interpreting \u00a7 15-1-67 binds this panel.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because neither the Mississippi legislature nor the Mississippi Supreme Court has spoken on this issue, we are bound by <em>Ross.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-15\">In <em>Ross, </em>we faced a case similar to that presented here. Plaintiffs alleged fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions in the sale of supplemental credit insurance products during plaintiffs\u2019 loan application processes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Applying Mississippi law, we held that \u201c[pjursuant to \u00a7 15-1-67, [plaintiffs were required to prove an affirmative act of fraudulent concealment post-completion of the insurance sales in order to toll the statute of limitations.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ast\">In spite of the district court\u2019s proper reliance on <em>Ross </em>for deciding this question, plaintiffs remain convinced that <em>Allan Construction </em>should control.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> That asser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>tion is further undermined by the fact that <em>Ross </em>is not unique in holding that \u00a7 15-1-67 requires subsequent affirmative acts of concealment. In <em>Rainwater v. Lamar Life Ins. Co., </em>391 F.3d 636, 637 (5th Cir.2004) (per curiam), which is the appeal in a district court proceeding the plaintiffs cite in support of their position,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we remarked that \u201c[o]ur decision in <em>Ross </em>resolved any remaining doubts that the district court may have had about a substantial ground for a difference of opinion on the doctrine of fraudulent concealment.\u201d More importantly, the Mississippi Supreme Court recently indicated its agreement by holding that \u201cthere must be some subsequent affirmative act by the defendant which was designed to prevent and which did prevent discovery of the claim.\u201d <em>Andrus v. Ellis, </em>887 So.2d 175, 181 (Miss.2004) (citing <em>Stephens, </em>850 So.2d at 83-84).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Plaintiffs, in relying on Texas precedent, have not alleged any subsequent acts of concealment against any defendant. Therefore, pursuant to \u00a7 15-1-67 and <em>Ross </em>and <em>Andrus, </em>they have failed to establish fraudulent concealment. Consequently, the three-year limitations period set forth in \u00a7 15-1-49 is not tolled. Because plaintiffs\u2019 claims are untimely, the district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-12\">.
