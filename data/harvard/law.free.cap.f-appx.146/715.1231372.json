Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), for failure to state a claim. Dufrene\u2019s claim was based on the alleged premature destruction of evidence of his crime, which prevents Dufrene from availing himself of the opportunity for DNA testing provided by Texas law. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal de novo, applying the same standard used for Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) dismissals. <em>See Hart v. Hairston, </em>343 F.3d 762, 763-64 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-18\">Dufrene argues that the district court misconstrued his complaint as an attack on the validity of his conviction. Notwithstanding Dufrene\u2019s contentions, were the district court to award Dufrene damages on his claim regarding the destruction of evidence and the loss of the opportunity for DNA testing, the validity of his conviction would be implicitly questioned. Under <em>Heck, </em>Dufrene\u2019s claim is not actionable because he has not shown that his conviction has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, invalidated by other state means, or called into question by the issuance of a federal habeas writ. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486, 114 S.Ct. 2364.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-19\">Dufrene also argues that the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>(\u201cAEDPA\u201d) is unconstitutional in various respects. The AEDPA\u2019s time-bar and successive-petition provisions do not preclude Dufrene from achieving a favorable termination, as required by <em>Heck. See id. </em>The AEDPA\u2019s provisions do not restrict Dufrene\u2019s ability to file necessary legal documents, and thus do not deny Dufrene his right of access to the courts. <em>See Brewer v. Wilkinson, </em>3 F.3d 816, 820-21 (5th Cir.1993). Nor do the AEDPA\u2019s provisions violate the principle of separation of powers, <em>see Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., </em>514 U.S. 211, 218-19, 115 S.Ct. 1447, 131 L.Ed.2d 328 (1995), or violate the Suspension Clause. <em>See Felker v. Turpin, </em>518 U.S. 651, 664, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Dufrene\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Both the district court\u2019s dismissal and this court\u2019s dismissal of the instant appeal count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Dufrene is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b742-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
