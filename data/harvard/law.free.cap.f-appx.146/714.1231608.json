The district court denied Nurnberg\u2019s motion to appeal IFP and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">By moving to proceed IFP, N\u00fcrnberg is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Because the merits of Nurnberg\u2019s appeal are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal was not taken in good faith, we determine both issues, denying IFP and dismissing the appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">By Nurnberg\u2019s own admission, she was aware of both her alleged injury and its causal connection to the defendants in January 2002. Accordingly, Nurnberg\u2019s lawsuit, filed in late February 2004, was time-barred. <em>Rodriguez v. Holmes, </em>963 F.2d 799, 803 (5th Cir.1992). N\u00fcrnberg fails to present any valid basis for tolling of the limitations period. Under these circumstances, the district court did not err in dismissing Nurnberg\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Nurnberg\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Nurnberg\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim, and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous, both count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). N\u00fcrnberg is CAUTIONED that if she accumulates three strikes, she will no longer be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while she is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless she is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b740-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
