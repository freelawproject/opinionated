Morales argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(b)(1) &amp; (b)(2) are unconstitutional and that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), should be overruled. He also contends, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), that the district court erred in sentencing him because the court believed that the federal sentencing guidelines were mandatory, rather than advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">Because Morales did not raise the relevant objections in the district court, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005). Although the decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has been called into question, <em>see Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1264, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (Thomas, J., concurring), the Supreme Court has not overruled it. Accordingly, this argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>265 F.3d 310, 312 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-20\">With respect to the district court\u2019s mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines, Morales concedes that he cannot demonstrate that the district court would have imposed a different sentence had it considered the guidelines to be advisory. Accordingly, he has not established plain error with respect to his sentence. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b757-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
