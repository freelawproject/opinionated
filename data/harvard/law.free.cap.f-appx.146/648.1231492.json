A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Spotts has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Additionally, we construe Spotts\u2019 notice of appeal and informal brief on appeal as an application to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Winestock, </em>340 F.3d at 208. In order to obtain authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a prisoner must assert claims based on either: (1) a new rule of constitutional law, previously unavailable, made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review; or (2) newly discovered evidence sufficient to establish that no reasonable fact finder would have found the movant guilty. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C); \u00a7 2255 (2000). Spotts\u2019 claims do not satisfy either of these conditions. Therefore, we decline to grant Spotts authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. We also deny Spotts\u2019 motion to remand. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-26\">. Spotts is referring to the Findings and Recommendation issued by a Magistrate Judge on June 9, 2003, in which the magistrate recommended denying Spotts' \u00a7 2255 motion. That recommendation was adopted by the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b675-7\">. We note that the district court recognized that Spotts\u2019 motion could be construed as a successive habeas motion. We find such a construction appropriate because the motion directly attacked Spotts\u2019 sentence. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 206-07 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 995, 124 S.Ct. 496, 157 L.Ed.2d 395 (2003). Nonetheless, Spotts fails to establish the criteria for issuance of a certificate of appealability. <em>See Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 368-69 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
