Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). In criminal cases, the defendant must file her notice of appeal within ten days of the entry of judgment. Fed. RApp. P. 4(b)(1)(A). The time periods established by Rule 4 are \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). Insofar as Johnson appeals the March 4, 1999, criminal judgment, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-15\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-13\">. Insofar as Johnson is appealing the February 14, 2005, order denying her motion to expedite review of a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion, this court does not have jurisdiction because the May 25, 2005, notice of appeal is untimely as to that order. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b683-28\">. To the extent Johnson may be seeking authorization to file a second or successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 (2000), citing <em>Booker </em>and <em>Blakely, </em>we deny authorization because the Supreme Court did not announce a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive to cases on collateral review with respect to either case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
