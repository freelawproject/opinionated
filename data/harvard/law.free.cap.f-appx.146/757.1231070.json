The district court found Wiley had not established exhaustion because the Steps 1 and 2 grievances he provided in support of his grievance had been returned to him for failure to comply with prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>procedures. Wiley contends for the first time on appeal that he exhausted because he resubmitted his Step 1 grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Generally, evidentiary contentions of this type not presented in district court will not be considered for the first time on appeal. <em>Stokes v. Emerson Elec. Co., </em>217 F.3d 353, 358 n. 19 (5th Cir.2000). In any event, Wiley has not established the district court erred in dismissing his complaint for failure to exhaust; he has not shown he exhausted his administrative remedies by filing a Step 1 <em>and </em>Step 2 grievance. <em>See Johnson v. Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 515 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Powe v. Ennis, </em>177 F.3d 393, 394 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED, but it is MODIFIED to reflect the dismissal of these claims WITH PREJUDICE for purposes of proceeding in an <em>informa pauperis </em>proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d). Therefore, if Wiley exhausts his administrative remedies, he can present his \u00a7 1983 claims again, but he may not proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>to do so. <em>See Underwood v. Wilson, </em>151 F.3d 292, 296 (5th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>526 U.S. 1133, 119 S.Ct. 1809, 143 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b783-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
