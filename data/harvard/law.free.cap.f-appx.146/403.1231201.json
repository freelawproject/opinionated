Livesay, former chief information officer and assistant controller of Health-South Corporation, upon Livesay\u2019s plea of guilty to a three-count information charging conspiracy to commit wire and securities fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and falsification of financial information filed with the Securities Exchange Commission, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78m(b)(2)(A), 78m(b)(5), 78ff, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. The information also included a forfeiture count, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461(c). The government contends that the district court erred when, after the government moved under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 for a downward departure based on Livesay\u2019s substantial assistance, the district court granted a 18-level downward departure. We vacate Livesay\u2019s sentence in its entirety and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>mand this case to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Livesay pleaded guilty to ah three counts under a plea agreement in which the government agreed to recommend that Livesay be given a three-level reduction to his offense level for his acceptance of responsibility and also represented it would file a motion for a downward departure, pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), if the government determined that Livesay\u2019s cooperation and substantial assistance warranted such a motion. Live-say and the government stipulated to an adjusted offense level of 28; Livesay\u2019s criminal history category was I, and the resulting sentencing range was <em>78 </em>to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment. The government made a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for a downward departure in which the government noted, among other things, that Livesay had \u201ctruthfully and completely confessed his misdeeds;\u201d \u201cbeen available on a continuous and regular basis;\u201d \u201cprovided invaluable assistance\u201d in helping the government to understand the way the massive fraud was conducted; \u201cprovided the government with a roadmap\u201d of the accounting manipulations; and \u201cfacilitated both the securing of guilty pleas from other co-conspirators and the prosecution of other individuals yet to be convicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">At sentencing, the government again chronicled Livesay\u2019s cooperation. When queried by the district court about whether Livesay could have assisted the government more, the government acknowledged that Livesay had done all that had been asked of him. The government called the district court\u2019s attention to the fact that Livesay was already receiving the benefit of a 3-level departure for acceptance of responsibility and recommended a downward departure of another three levels for a sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. The government stressed at sentencing its position that a substantial term of imprisonment was appropriate punishment for a massive fraud. Questioning of the government by the district court seems to suggest that the government was not rewarding Livesay sufficiently; the government, in turn, noted that a lot of other witnesses in the case had provided similar information. The sentencing court departed downward 18 levels to a level 10 which, when combined with Livesay\u2019s criminal history category of I, yielded a guideline imprisonment range of six to twelve months. The government objected to the reasonableness of the departure and asked that Livesay be sentenced to the maximum of the departure sentencing range of 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. The sentence imposed by the court eliminated all imprisonment; it included a $10,000 fine, a $200 special assessment, and a probationary term of 60 months with a special condition of 6 months\u2019 home detention on each of Counts One and Two, to run concurrently. Livesay was also ordered to forfeit $750,000, which was to be made available to the victims of the fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">After the district court departed downward 18 levels, in explication of the sentence imposed, the district court said only that it was \u201cbased on the very substantial nature of the defendant\u2019s cooperation and assistance.\u201d Other than this comment, the record reveals no explanation for the considerable downward departure in the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">In this appeal, the government concedes that a departure was warranted under \u00a7 5K1.1. The government contends, however, that the extent of the departure was unreasonable under the facts of this case, unjustified by the court and constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Blas, </em>360 F.3d 1268, 1274 (11th Cir.2004) (the extent of departure is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Section 5K1.1 allows the sentencing court, upon motion of the government, to depart downward based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance \u201cfor reasons stated.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Kl.l(a). Those reasons may include, among others, consideration of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">(1) the court\u2019s evaluation of the significance and usefulness of the defendant\u2019s assistance, taking into consideration the government\u2019s evaluation of the assistance rendered;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">(2) the truthfulness, completeness, and reliability of any information or testimony provided by the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">(3) the nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s assistance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">(4) any injury suffered, or any danger or risk of injury to the defendant or his family resulting from his assistance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">(5) the timeliness of the defendant\u2019s assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Kl.l(a). While much latitude is to be afforded the sentencing judge in assessing the nature, extent and significance of an individual defendant\u2019s substantial assistance, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 <em>5K1.1 </em>comment. (backg\u2019d), \u201c[t]he sentencing judge must ... state the reasons for reducing a sentence under this section.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)). And 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) provides that when a sentencing judge imposes a sentence outside the guidelines range, the specific reason for such sentence must be stated with specificity in the written order of judgment and conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">We review a downward departure from the guidelines range for \u201creasonableness.\u201d <em>See United States v. </em>Blas, 360 F.3d at 1274. As we explained in <em>Blas, </em>\u201c[wjhen a sentencing court departs from the Guidelines, a reviewing court determines the reasonableness of the departure in light of the factors to be considered in imposing the sentence, and the reasons the district court provided for departing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And, in assessing the \u00a7 5K1.1 factors, the sentencing court is required to afford \u201csubstantial weight ... to the government\u2019s evaluation of the extent of defendant\u2019s assistance ____\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, comment, n. 3. Although the departure in this case\u2014 from a level 28 to a level 10\u2014was dramatic, the record provides us with scant basis to assess reasonableness: the sentencing court noted the \u201cvery substantial nature\u201d of Livesay\u2019s cooperation but failed entirely to address specifically the \u00a7 5K1.1 factors or otherwise to state reasons supporting the extent of its departure. While we may sense from the sentencing transcript that the district court deemed the government\u2019s recommended sentence insufficient payback for Livesay\u2019s plea and cooperation, we can only speculate about the district court\u2019s reasoning. We do not say that every \u00a7 5K1.1 factor must be separately addressed in the order of judgment and conviction; we say only that this record fails to provide the minimum indicia required to alow us to review for reasonableness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-16\">Accordingly, we vacate Livesay\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-17\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-12\">. Livesay argues that the government made no objection to the sentencing court\u2019s failure to articulate its consideration of the relevant sentencing factors and, consequently, has waived objection to the absence of explanation. But the government did object to the reasonableness of the departure; we have no means to determine the reasonableness of the sentencing court\u2019s sentence without knowing the reasons for the departure. The record must be susceptible to meaningful appellate review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b431-20\">. Livesay's sentencing occurred before the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Booker, </em>and no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number><em>Booker </em>issue was raised in this appeal. Nonetheless, <em>Booker </em>will apply at resentencing: the sentencing court will not be bound by the guidelines, but the guideline sentence\u2014including application of any permitted departures\u2014will need first to be determined and then sentence imposed after consideration of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2005). If a sentence is imposed outside the guidelines range, the sentencing court must state the reasons for the imposition of that sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
