T. Herring and did then and there cut and wound J. T. Herring with a knife and did then and there, thereby and therewith inflict serious bodily injury upon said J. T. Herring.\u201d Appellant\u2019s punishment was assessed at a fin\u00e9 of $100 and six months imprisonment in the county jail. The motion for new trial for want of proper transfer from District to County Court came too late. This must be done <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">Dr. Johnson dressed the wound and describes it as being about one and one-half inches long and three-quarters to one inch deep. He dressed the wound only once. The wound was what he calls an incisive wound, made with some sharp instrument or knife. The prosecutor testified that it inconvenienced him for a few days, and also described the wound practically as did the physician who dressed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">It is urged that this evidence is not sufficient to sustain the allegation that it was a serious wound. \" Under the authorities we are of opinion that this contention is correct. We deem it unnecessary to cite the authorities. The question has been frequently before the court, and the courts and legal profession are familiar with these decisions. We would suggest upon another trial, if.the evidence should develop as in this case, that a charge on self-defense he given. The State\u2019s evidence shows an assault by appellant upon Herring with a knife. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Appellant\u2019s testimony is that prosecutor struck him with an unopened knife, and after doing so, was trying to open it at the time that he, appellant, used his knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Because we are of opinion the evidence is not sufficient to show the injury inflicted was of a serious character as required by the law of aggravated assault, the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b271-7\">RAMSEY, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ajc\">(dissenting).\u2014I think the case should be affirmed. The rule laid down by this court recently in the case of Housley v. State, 55 Texas Crim. Rep., 372, in which the opinion was written by Judge Brooks, is the correct one. We there say: \u201cIn passing upon a similar question to that here raised in the case of Bruce v. State, 41 Texas Crim. Rep., 27; 51 S. W. Rep., 954, we used the following language: \u2018Does serious bodily injury mean necessarily contemplation of death, or any injury That will eventuate in death or might probably cause death ? We do not think so. We think the word \u2018serious\u2019 in said statute means what the word imports, that is, grave; not trivial, not slight.\u2019\u201d In this case the party injured carried his arm in a sling for many days. The wound was made by a deadly knife and the injury such as would never be thought of as trivial or slight, except by one reading some of the earlier decisions of this court which, in my. opinion, carry the rule far beyond its proper bounds.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
