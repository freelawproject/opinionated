Respondents were duly nominated as candidates of the Republican Party for the office of village trustee. Nominating petitions were also filed naming respondents as candidates for the same office by a group designating itself as the <em>\u201c </em>Independent Party \u201d. These petitions designating respondents as candidates of the <em>\u201c </em>Independent Party \u201d are not challenged. However, the last day to file an acceptance of the independent nomination was March 9, 1956, and through inadvertence the acceptance was not presented for filing until March 12, 1956, and was rejected. It does not appear that anyone will be harmed or prejudiced in the election by the inclusion on the ballot of respondents\u2019 names as candidates of the \u201c Independent Party \u201d, We think the Special Term did not abuse its discretion in making the order appealed from. <em>(Matter of Kagan </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>275 App. Div. 1065.) Order unanimously affirmed, without costs. Present \u2014 Foster, P. J., Bergan, Coon, Halpern and Zeller, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
