There was conflicting evidence as to whether or not negligence of the defendant brought about this loss of vision. There was a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The judge instructed the jury in various forms of words that the plaintiff had the burden of proving that this impairment of his vision \u201cwas the result of the doctor\u2019s neglect alone, and of nothing else.\u201d The plaintiff excepted \u201cto that part of the charge in which . . . [the judge instructed] the jury that the doctor\u2019s negligence must be the sole cause of the injury.\u201d This is the only exception before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">Ordinarily in an action based on negligence such an instruction would be both inadequate and incorrect. Liability is founded upon proximate cause, which is not necessarily the sole cause. <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Snelling, </em>14 Allen, 290. <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Atlantic Works, </em>111 Mass. 136. <em>Leahy </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. of New York, </em>224 Mass. 352. <em>Milbury </em>v. <em>Turner Centre System, </em>274 Mass. 358. The same principles of causation are applicable to actions for malpractice as apply to other actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">But a careful examination of the record in this particular case leads to the conclusion that the instructions here given could not have been misapplied by the jury and were not error. The evidence suggested three possible causes for the unfortunate condition in which the plaintiff found himself at the time of the trial: (1) It may have been wholly or partly the natural development and outgrowth of the condition of the plaintiff\u2019s eyes at the time when he first con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>suited the defendant, whatever the cause of that condition had been. (2) It may have been due wholly or partly to contributory negligence of the plaintiff after he consulted the defendant. (3) It may have been due wholly or partly to negligence of the defendant after he was consulted by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Of course the plaintiff was not entitled to recover for any of the unavoidable consequences of his original ailment, but was entitled to recover only for such additional suffering and impairment of vision as came about from a breach of duty by the defendant. In this aspect of the case, the question was the same as that often presented to juries where a person already suffering from some physical defect or disease is further injured by negligence of the defendant. <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>212 Mass. 262, 267. This phase of the case was covered by correct instructions, and the causal effect of the plaintiff\u2019s original condition was dealt with fully in other parts of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">When, therefore, the judge referred to the necessity that the defendant\u2019s negligence must be the sole cause of the injury, the jury could not have understood him to mean that there could be no recovery if the plaintiff\u2019s original disease still contributed to his present condition. They must have understood that in using this language the judge had in mind the only remaining possible cause other than negligence of the defendant, i.e. contributory negligence of the plaintiff. It was correct to instruct the jury that as between negligence of the defendant and contributory negligence of the plaintiff there could be no recovery unless negligence of the defendant was the sole cause. The case is closely parallel to <em>Hibbard </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>109 Mass. 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">The exception taken raises no question as to the correctness of the instruction given on the burden of proof in so far as it related to contributory negligence. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 85. We do not pass on that.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
