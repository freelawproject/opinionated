One Bingham, who was employed by the defendant as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>claim agent, investigated the case in behalf of the defendant. As the result of an interview at which the plaintiff and the plaintiff\u2019s wife and Bingham were present, Bingham gave the plaintiff the defendant\u2019s draft for $200, and the plaintiff executed a sealed instrument which stated that in consideration of $200 in hand paid, the plaintiff released and forever discharged the defendant \u201cfrom any and all actions, causes of action, claims and demands, for, upon, or by reason of any damage, loss, injury, or cost which heretofore has been, or which hereafter may be sustained by me . . .\u201d on account of the accident. This paper also contained the following paragraphs: \u201cThis settlement is intended to terminate all disputes as to liability by reason of said accident, whatever its cause and whatever my injury or damage may prove to be\u201d and \u201cThis is not a final settlement of this case. This amount paid on account.\u201d Bingham made out this paper by filling in a prepared form. The paragraph last quoted above was inserted in his handwriting at the time the paper was signed, because as he testified, \u201cit was understood that two hundred dollars was not a settlement of the case.\u201d Later the defendant offered the plaintiff $500 additional as a final payment, but the plaintiff refused it.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\">There was conflicting testimony as to what was said at the interview when this paper was signed. It is not necessary to state all of it here. The plaintiff testified that he said, \u201cI am not going to sign that paper in full \u2014 I will sign that off for no two hundred dollars,\u201d and that Bingham replied, \u201cNo, no, this is only on account\u201d; that the plaintiff refused to sign until Bingham should say \u201cthis is not a full settlement,\u201d and Bingham said \u201cThis is not a full settlement, this is on account\u201d; that Bingham said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We always take care of our men and we use them right and fair.\u201d The plaintiff's wife testified on direct examination that before her husband signed the paper Bingham said \u201cthat they would take care of them, see that they were dealt by right and do the right thing by them, that when Ferris was able to go in to the office of the Boston and Maine they would see what else they would do for them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>(the Ferrises) besides the two hundred dollars that he had brought.\u201d On cross-examination she testified that before the paper was signed Bingham said \u201che would see what those higher up would do by way of paying something more and that they always treated their employees right and they would do the right thing by them (the Ferrises) and use them square, use them right. Bingham said he would see what the people higher up would do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\">We think on this evidence the jury could have found that Bingham promised that the defendant would pay more than $200 for the release and would pay in addition thereto such sum as should amount in all to fair compensation for the injuries sustained, and that they could also have found that this agreement was a part of the consideration for the release. <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Employers Liability Assurance Corp. Ltd. </em>213 Mass. 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Of course this is not the only possible conclusion, even if the jury believed all of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, and if the issue depended upon, the testimony as to the oral conversation alone, it would-be doubtful whether it could be found to go beyond an assurance of fair intention on the part of the defendant with a willingness to examine into the case further and to do what it might decide to be \u201cright.\u201d But the plaintiff's case is strengthened by the insertion in the release itself of words which would be inconsistent with the rest of the instrument and could only have the effect of destroying it as a release of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action in tort -unless their presence is to be exp\u00edame^ on the theory that there was an agreement for a payment in excess of the $200 mentioned. Such an agreement would not be in conflict with the terms of the written instrument <em>(Galvin </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>180 Mass. 587) or too vague or indefinite to be enforced. <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Employers Liability Assurance Corp. Ltd. </em>213 Mass. <em>365. Silver </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>210 Mass. 26. <em>Henderson Bridge Co. </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>134 U. S. 260, 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">There was evidence that Bingham had authority to bind the defendant. He testified that his occupation was \u2018Claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>agent for the defendant and that his duties were to investigate and settle claims. He had ostensible authority to make settlements, and the plaintiff was not affected by limitations of which the plaintiff had no knowledge as to the amount which Bingham was authorized to pay. <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>197 Mass. 376, 379. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Chapin, </em>263 Mass. 168. This is true even though Bingham did mention \u201cthose higher up.\u201d An agreement to pay fair compensation is not in itself so extraordinary or extravagant as to fall outside the apparent authority of such an agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\">The fact that before bringing this action the plaintiff brought actions of tort for his injuries and later discontinued them does not show an election of remedies which bars him from prosecuting this action. If he establishes in this action the contract which he now contends was made, then the release which he signed ended his original cause of action in tort, and he had no right of election. He is not barred merely because he attempted to pursue a remedy which was not open to him. <em>Loomis </em>v. <em>Pease, </em>234 Mass. 101, 106. <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Willard, </em>249 Mass. 313, 317. <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Draper, </em>268 Mass. 555, 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">There was,- however, no evidence which in our opinion would justify a finding that the defendant agreed to \u201ctake care of\u201d the plaintiff in any other sense than by paying a fair sum for his injuries or to assume toward the plaintiff any continuing obligation dependent upon the plaintiff\u2019s ability to \u201creturn to work.\u201d The declaration seems to us to go beyond this and to allege some promise of support and maintenance during disability. There was therefore a variance between the agreement declared upon and any agreement which the jury could find to have been proved. For this reason the action of the judge in directing a verdict for the defendant was not error, even though there is no express statement in the record that the ruling was made with the pleadings in mind. <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>208 Mass. 16. <em>Granara </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>212 Mass. 271. <em>Brasslavsky </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>250 Mass. 403. <em>R. J. Todd Co. </em>v. <em>Bradstreet Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>253 Mass. 138, 143. Compare <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>D. A. Schulte, Inc. </em>275 Mass. 379, 385, and <em>Maksymiuk </em>v. <em>Puceta, </em>279 Mass. 346, 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\">Although these exceptions must be overruled, it will still be open to the plaintiff to move in the Superior Court before judgment (see Rule 79 of the Superior Court [1932]) to amend his declaration so as to present a case in conformity with the evidence, and if such amendment shall be allowed, the case will be retried on the issues thus raised. <em>Noyes, </em>v. <em>Noyes, </em>224 Mass. 125. <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Steadman, </em>269 Mass. 250, 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
