The finding was for the plaintiff. A request for a report to the Appellate Division was seasonably filed by the defendant in these words: \u201cThe defendant in the above entitled action being aggrieved by the refusal of the Justice to give the rulings of law requested by him requests that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the matter be reported to the Appellate Division.\u201d The plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the request for report on the ground that it was not in accordance with the rules of the District Court and that the defendant was not therefore entitled to the report. It appears that the defendant filed six requests for rulings, of which three were allowed and three denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\">Rule 27 of the Rules of the District Courts (1932) is in part in these words: \u201cThe request shall contain a clear and concise statement of the rulings upon which a re-hearing is requested sufficiently full and accurate for identification.\u201d It is plain that on authority the request for report did not conform to this rule. It contained no statement of the rulings upon which the rehearing was desired. Merely to refer to prayers for rulings without identifying them in some specific way is not enough.\u2019 The case at bar is governed by <em>Stafford </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Co. </em>263 Mass. 240, 242, and <em>Rollins </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>284 Mass. 488. It is clearly distinguishable from <em>Zani </em>v. <em>Phandor Co. </em>281 Mass. 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
