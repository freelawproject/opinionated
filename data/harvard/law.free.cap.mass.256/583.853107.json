The truth of the report is to be determined only in this way. The case is governed by <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Berkowitz, </em>215 Mass. 68, where it was said, at page 71, that the truth or falsity of a report can be determined in the Municipal Court only. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 108. Rule 50 of the Rules of the Municipal Court (1922). There is nothing before us on the defendants\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">\n<em>Order denying petition to establish truth of the Draft Report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
