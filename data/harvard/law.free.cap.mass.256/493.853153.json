South of Milk Street there were at the time two sets of street railway tracks on Washington Street, the north bound rails being on the easterly side of the street. This north bound track turned into Milk Street, the south bound continuing north on Washington Street. The night was clear and there was no traffic except the fire apparatus (going south in the south bound car track) and the street car involved in the accident. A witness for the plaintiff testified \"that the right side of the street was blocked a little because of construction work on a new building which was going up there.\u201d As the street car turned to go into Milk Street the plaintiff was struck by it and thrown to the ground. The jury could have found that no part of the fire apparatus was hit by the street car. A verdict for the defendant was ordered, and the case was reported to this court on the stipulation of the parties that if there was no evidence of negligence the verdict was to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">The hose wagon \"from the outer edge of one step to the outer edge of the other step was between seven and eight feet.\u201d The width of the street car was seven feet and ten inches, and the overhang on a straight rail was eighteen inches. The plaintiff testified that when the hose wagon was on the south bound rails and the car on the north bound rails, the two vehicles being side by side, \"the distance between them was about two feet\u201d; that \"there would be between one and two feet of clearance .between the track and the street car he passed at its nearest point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>TaMng the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff <em>(Dillon </em>v. <em>Plimpton, </em>239 Mass. 588), we are unable to find any evidence of. negligence on the part of the defendant\u2019s motorman. The car came to a stop as soon as the collision took place. In turning the corner there was no danger of a collision with the fire apparatus, and it cannot be said to be negligent for the street car to proceed as it did, merely because the plaintiff was in an exposed position. In this respect the case is governed by <em>Widmer </em>v. <em>West End Street Railway, </em>158 Mass. 49. This case was followed in <em>Brightman </em>v. <em>Union Street Railway, </em>216 Mass. 152. <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Bay State Street Railway, </em>222 Mass. 427. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Public Service Corp. of New Jersey, </em>86 N. J. L. 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">The plaintiff offered rules 32 and 101 of the rules of the defendant for conductors and motormen. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>184 Mass. 476. Rule 32 had reference to the right of way for fire apparatus \u201cas provided by law.\u201d Rule 101 related to the control of street cars in passing cross streets and vehicles. The fire apparatus was returning from the fire when the plaintiff was injured. By G. L. c. 89, \u00a7 7, members and apparatus of a fire department have the right of way in a street when \u201cgoing to a fire or responding to an alarm.\u201d The rule was not material. It did not tend to show that the motorman was negligent, even if the street between the tracks and the sidewalk were obstructed, and it was necessary for the fire apparatus to continue on the car tracks. See <em>Towne </em>v. <em>Waltham Watch Co. </em>247 Mass. 390, 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">It follows that the ruling was correct and judgment for the defendant is to be entered on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>At the Supreme Judicial Court holden at Boston in and for said Commonwealth on the twenty-eighth day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and r twenty-six:</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Present:</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Hon.
