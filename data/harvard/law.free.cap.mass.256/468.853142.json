She contends that her injury resulted from a defect in the way for which the town is responsible under G. L. c. 84, \u00a715.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-13\">The jury could have found from the evidence that the sidewalk had been in place without repair for, at least, five years, and possibly for seven years. It extended from Highland Road for a considerable distance along High Street on the side opposite to the house in which the plaintiff lived. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>It was made by placing five planks, from eight to eleven inches wide, side by side, lengthwise. At the place of the accident one plank was \u201crough and splintery,\u201d the wood \u201cbrown and decayed,\u201d and \u201cthere were little pieces sticking up about a half inch or more in a section of about two feet of the plank.\u201d The planks were somewhat worn at the edges along the spaces between them. The jury took a view of the place. Photographs taken shortly after the accident showed a walk with, plainly to be seen, a few thin flakes of wood projecting upward from the surface of the planks where the grain had been worn by use and by the action of sun and rain. The splinter which injured the plaintiff, punctured the thin sole of her shoe and went into her foot for an inch and a half. This shows the meaning to be given \u201crotten\u201d as used by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses in describing the wood. Decayed and crumbling wood, really rotted, would not be strong enough so to pierce shoe and foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The characterizations of the place by the witnesses for the plaintiff as \u201cin bad condition right along,\u201d \u201cin poor condition,\u201d \u201cdefective condition,\u201d \u201ckind of bad looking spot there,\u201d and by the superintendent of streets, called by the defendant, as \u201cin fair condition, not A No. 1, but in fair condition,\u201d are, technically, not admissible in evidence, see <em>Rice </em>v. <em>James, </em>193 Mass. 458, 462, and do not enable us to bring before our eyes the actual appearance of the sidewalk. We disregard them.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">This evidence fails to make out the existence of a defect for which the town is hable.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">It is well established that a town or city is not bound to . keep its ways perfect.. The burden would be too heavy. It is enough that they are reasonably safe and convenient for travel. <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>6 Cush. 524. A brick projecting an inch or two above others in a brick sidewalk is not a defect for which a municipality is hable. <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>174 Mass. 181, 187. <em>Isaacson </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>195 Mass. 114. The presence of loose stones in a gravel or dirt walk is not such a defect. See <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Lowell, supra, </em>page 534. <em>Rust </em>v. <em>Essex, </em>182 Mass. 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">We are unable to see how the presence of splinters upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>surface of sound planks is anything other than a necessary incident of the use of wood for a sidewalk. They will appear suddenly and be worn away quickly in ordinary use of the walk. In view of the well known and widely extended use of wood for that purpose, we cannot declare such use unsafe or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\">Doubtless conditions may arise from splintering of worn or decayed boards which will amount to defects in the way creating a liability; but no such condition is shown here.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">The situation is very different from that disclosed in <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>177 Mass. 82, and <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>225 Mass. 270, (where there were definite obstructions not due to lack of repair) and in <em>Hamlet </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>248 Mass. 473, and <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>253 Mass. 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">No question of procedure is raised. The defendant is entitled to judgment. The exception is overruled and judgment is to enter for the defendant. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 120,122.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
