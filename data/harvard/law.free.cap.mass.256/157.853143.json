The negligence on which the liability is founded is keeping such an animal with knowledge of its propensities.\u201d The defendant does not contest this; but he insists that where, as at the trial, the only evidence of vicious propensities in a horse and of knowledge of such vice is furnished by alleged admissions of the defendant, which he denies that he ever made, there is not sufficient evidence of liability to justify the submission of the case to a jury. The contention is not well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The plaintiff and his employer testified that the defendant said to them, \u201cI am sorry, boy. I told them to put that horse downstairs before. You are the second man he kicked this morning,\u201d and \u201cI told that fellow to put that horse downstairs, he was a kicking horse.\u201d Such an admission is evidence of knowledge of a propensity to kick, and, though less convincingly, of the existence of the habit in the horse. Its probative value is for the jury to determine. <em>Linnehan </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>126 Mass. 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">None of the cases cited by the defendant sustains his' proposition that, where such an admission is uncorroborated by other evidence and is denied by the witnesses of the party charged with the admission, there is nothing on which a jury can base a finding against such party. <em>Linnehan </em>v. <em>Sampson, supra. Bowditch Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Buffum, </em>2 Gray, 550. <em>Conant </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>202 Mass. 34. It well may be that an admission standing alone does not contain enough to sustain a verdict; but that is because the facts stated in the admission, or justly to be inferred from it, are not sufficient to make out a case; and not because they are put before the jury in the form of an admission. <em>Webber </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>254 Mass. 387, illustrates such a case. <em>Zandan </em>v. <em>Radner, </em>242 Mass. 503. <em>Barnett </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>243 Mass. 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The admission is to be weighed with other evidence. The party is not bound by it, especially if there is other evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>which controls or discredits it. <em>Bowditch Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Buffum, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In this case it was for the jury by its verdict, and not for the judge in his ruling on the motion for a directed verdict, to determine whether the defendant spoke the words attributed to him, and, if he did, whether they proved that he knew the horse was vicious and so was liable. <em>Maggi </em>v. <em>Cutts, </em>123 Mass. 535, 539, 540. No other point was argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
