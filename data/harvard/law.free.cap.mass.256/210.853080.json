Verdicts were returned for the plaintiffs, and it is argued by the defendant on his exceptions that neither plaintiff made out a case for the jury on the question of liability. But under Rule 44 of the Superior Court (1923), \u201cThe question whether the court should order a verdict must be raised by a motion. Such question shall not be raised by a request for instructions to the jury.\u201d The judge could not abrogate the rule, and the defendant being bound by it, no error appears in the denial of the request. <em>Carp </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>251 Mass. 225. <em>DeMarco </em>v. <em>Pease, </em>253 Mass. 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
