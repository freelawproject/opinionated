The verdict was for the plaintiff, and the defendant's exceptions relate solely to the admission in evidence of a certificate of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, and a copy of the charter of the Franco-American Union of New England, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\">While there was evidence that the Franco-American Union of New York did business in Massachusetts, it was not conducted under its true name, but in the name of the Franco-American Union of New England, without filing a business certificate as provided in G. L. c. 110, \u00a7 5. It was material therefore for the plaintiff to show that at the date of the contract the Franco-American Union of New England had no legal existence as a corporation. If this appeared, the defendant on the record could be held as principal. <em>Brigham </em>v. <em>Herrick, </em>173 Mass. 460, 466. The certificate of the Secretary of the Commonwealth and copy of the charter showing that the Franco-American Union of New England was not incorporated until May 2, 1921, accordingly were competent. See G. L. c. 9; \u00a7 11, c. 156, \u00a7 4; c. 233, \u00a7 74. <em>American Steel &amp; Wire Co. </em>v. <em>Bearse, </em>194 Mass. 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
