B. Zuckernik, </em>for the defendant, submitted a brief.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b180-8\"><em>R. B.

The debt of the plaintiff to the defendant in each action was a provable claim against the estate of the plaintiff, was scheduled by the bankrupt, and the defendant was duly notified of the bankruptcy of the plaintiff in accordance with the practice of the District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The character of the liability of the plaintiff to the defendant was not lost by being reduced to judgment. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Tarplin, </em>194 Mass. 47. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Hannagan, </em>210 Mass. 246. <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>121 U. S. 457, 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">In each action the cause of action was founded upon a claim from which a discharge in bankruptcy would be a release. These actions upon the filing of an answer setting up the adjudication and praying a continuance to await the termination of the proceedings in the bankruptcy court, in the discretion of the judge of the Municipal Court could have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>stayed, but the judge was not bound so to order, and had jurisdiction to proceed to judgment. Bankruptcy Act, July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 U. S. Sts. at Large, 549, 562, \u00a7\u00a7 11a, 63a, cl. 5. <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Ball, supra. Berry Clothing Co. </em>v. <em>Shopnick, </em>249 Mass. 459, 463. But the defendant in those actions was under no duty to make an appropriate application to the court, before judgment in that court, to have the proceedings there stayed to await the determination of the court in bankruptcy on the question of his discharge. As said in <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Ball, supra, </em>\u201cHe may be willing that the suit shall proceed in the State court for many reasons; first, because he is not sure that he will ever obtain his discharge from the court in bankruptcy, in which case it would do him no good to delay the proceedings at his expense in the State court; in the second place, he may have a defence in the State court which he is quite willing to rely upon there, and to have the issue tried; and in the third place, he may be very willing to have the amount in dispute liquidated in that proceeding, in which case it becomes a debt to be paid pro rata with his other debts by the assignee in bankruptcy. If for any of these reasons, or for others, he permits the case to proceed to judgment in the State court, by failing to procure a stay of proceedings under the provisions of . . . the bankruptcy law, or the assignee in bankruptcy does not intervene as he may do, <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Harding, </em>107 U. S. 631, he does not thereby forfeit his right to plead his final discharge in bankruptcy, if he shall obtain it, at any appropriate stage of the proceedings against him in the State court. And if, as in the present case, his final discharge is not obtained until after judgment has been rendered against him in the State court, he may produce that discharge to the State court and obtain the stay of execution which he asks for now.\u201d <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>166 Mass. 92, 94. <em>Cavanaugh </em>v. <em>Fenley, </em>94 Minn. 505. <em>Locheimer </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>91 Tenn. 385. The cases of <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Holcomb, </em>182 Mass. 360, 361, and <em>Herschman </em>v. <em>Justices of the Municipal Court, </em>220 Mass. 137, 141, are not authorities for a denial of the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">We are unable to find any statute of this Commonwealth which gives authority to the Municipal Court of the City of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Boston to stay temporarily or perpetually the executions which issued on its judgments. The plaintiff has a defence at law to any actions which may be brought upon the judgments but has no adequate defence unless it be the writ of <em>audita querela </em>to stay the enforcement of the execution issued upon the judgments which were annulled by the discharge in bankruptcy. In these circumstances we are of opinion the enforcement of the judgments can properly be enjoined in equity. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Rowling, </em>3 N. Y. 216; 53 Am. Dec. 290. <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Ingraham, </em>30 Miss. 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The entry must be,</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\"><em>Demurrer </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
