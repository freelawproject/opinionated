The record of the judgments which are duly authenticated is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of jurisdiction and every presumption is to be made in favor of the regularity of the proceedings. <em>Gleason </em>v. <em>Dodd, </em>4 Met. 333, 337. <em>Van Norman </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>172 Mass. 576. <em>Willock </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>178 Mass. 68, 74. G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 69. While they show that the parties appeared, no copy of the writ with a return of service appears. The record, however, \u201cneed not state all the proceedings in detail; it is enough that it shows the subject matter of the suit, jurisdiction over the parties, and the final judgment of the court.\u201d ' <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Abell, </em>10 Allen, 485, 488. The record states that the defendant appeared, pleaded, and issue was joined, and, it having offered no evidence to control these recitals, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>presumption of regularity stands. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Columbian National Life Ins. Co. </em>232 Mass. 224, 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\">The writs in the present actions run against \u201cH. V. Greene Company, Inc.\u201d while in the record of the judgments the defendant is designated as \u201cH. V. Greene Co. Inc.\u201d But there is no material variance, even if the caption, made by the clerk of the judgments, states that the action is against \u201cII. V. Greene Co. Inc.\u201d The name of the defendant, which follows the name of the plaintiff in the first paragraph of each record, reads \u201cH. V. Greene Company, Inc.\u201d The answers were a general denial, and the context of the records show complete identity of names, which also was evidence of the identity of the defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>13 Allen, 571, 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">It follows that the records were not incomplete, nor was there a material variance as the defendant contends, and the trial judge not only properly admitted the evidence, but rightly denied all the defendant\u2019s requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The order of the Appellate Division dismissing the report is,</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
