The Fund for Reopened Cases was not liable for this obligation under section 25-a of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. <em>(Matter of Murin </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>295 N.

Their appeal poses two questions: whether a case referred by the board to its \u201c abeyance file \u201d has been closed so that a further request for compensation is an application to reopen within the scope of section 25-a; and whether the employer\u2019s duty to furnish replacements for orthopedic shoes is the sort of liability which may be shifted to the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The disability, caused by chronic osteomyelitis of the left leg, is the result of an accident which occurred in 1924. Since that time claimant, who received an initial award based upon 100% loss of use of the leg, has been furnished medical treatment and the special shoes which he requires at infrequent intervals by the employer or carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">During the period 1930-1935, the case was open and continued in the files of the board pending further necessary medical treatment. In May, 1935, the case was closed on the previous award, and claimant was directed to seek any necessary medical treatment from his employer. In 1939, the case was reopened and, after a number of hearings which disclosed that no issues remained undecided, the matter was referred to an abeyance file until claimant requested additional medical treatment. In 1943, appellants voluntarily provided a new pair of shoes for claimant. More than three years later he requested another pair, which appellants have been directed to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Insofar as pertinent, section 25-a provides: <em>\u201c </em>when an application for compensation is made by an employee * * * after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>a lapse of seven ye\u00e1rs from the date of the injury or death and also a lapse of three years from the date of the last payment of compensation * * * testimony may be taken * * * and if an award is made it shall be against the special fund provided by this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Liability of the Fund for \u00a1Reopened Cases is to be conditioned upon the lapse of time as provided by the statute. It may be imposed only in a case which has been closed and is reopened by fresh application (cf. <em>Matter of Kiriloff </em>v. <em>A. G. W. Wet Wash Laundry, </em>293 N. Y. 222). The fund is maintained by assessments upon employers and carriers (Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 25-a, subd. 3) and its purpose is patent: that the risk of claims recurring beyond the statutory periods shall be borne by all.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">When this case was closed in 1935, both board and employer were aware of the claimant\u2019s condition and of the employer\u2019s statutory duty to furnish any medical treatment or equipment necessary to the treatment of his injured leg (Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 13). The closing of the case in 1935, and the transfer to the abeyance file in 1939, were ordered because no further proceedings then were contemplated. The only substantial basis for distinction between a closed case and one in abeyance is said to be that the latter may be restored to the active calendar by request of the parties, while an application to reopen the former is addressed to the discretion of the board. Neither that distinction nor the labels upon the files of the board can be determinative (cf. <em>Matter of Fallon </em>v. <em>New York Color &amp; Chemical Co., </em>275 N. Y. 573). For the purpose of section 25-a, a case is closed when it has been referred to the abeyance file because no further proceedings were foreseen. Such a case is to be distinguished from one held in abeyance pending the completion of a defective application for compensation, when hearings are to be held <em>(Matter of Ludgen </em>v. <em>Jamestown Asphalt Paving Materials Corp., </em>257 App. Div. 881; <em>Matter of Buddenborg </em>v. <em>Gilman Constr. Co., </em>255 App. Div. 903).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Section 13 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law establishes the duty of an employer to furnish medical treatment and any equipment required for a compensable disability \u00a3\u00a3 for such period as the nature of the injury or the process of recovery may require.\u201d The employer must provide replacements or repairs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>for any necessary equipment; and \u25a0 neith\u00e9r replacement nor medical treatment shall \u201c constitute the payment of compensation under section twenty-five-a \u2019 \u2019. Manifestly the last provision' was not intended to limit the nature of the liability which may be shifted to the fund. It serves only to define the words \u201c payment of compensation \u2019 \u2019 as they appear in section 25-a, and thus to provide that such expenditures shall not toll the three-year limitation under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The duty to furnish any necessary medical treatment, as well as the duty to replace orthopedic shoes, is derived from section 13. To hold that satisfaction of those duties cannot be imposed upon the fund would reduce its function to negligible importance. There is nothing in either statute to indicate that the potential liability of the fund is to depend upon the relative probability of the claimant\u2019s future need <em>(Matter of Becker </em>v. <em>Marcy State Hosp., </em>264 App. Div. 643). The sole criterion under section 25-a is the passage of time. In this case seven years had elapsed since claimant\u2019s accident and three years bad elapsed since the last payment of compensation. The award should have been against the Fund for Reopened Cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, and the award of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board annulled, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division, and the matter remitted to the board for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b412-7\">Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQG\">(dissenting). Section 25-a of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law provides, in part, that, when \u201c <em>an application for compensation </em>\u201d is made by an employee seven years after the injury and three years after the last payment of compensation, \u201can award\u201d, if any, \u201cshall be against the special fund \u201d. All agree that the section was designed to immunize the-employer and the carrier from old and stale claims and to shift the burden of such charges to the Special Fund for Reopened Cases. 1 do not believe that it was any part of that purpose to relieve the employer of the burden of periodically replacing worn out prosthetic devices or appliances necessitated by a compensable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The decisions leave\u2019 no doubt that the only claims which are truly \u201c stale \u201d and deserving of being shifted from employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>to special fund by the lapse of time are those which the employer could not have expected to recur after the passage of seven years from the date of injury and three years from the last payment of compensation. (See, e.g., <em>Matter of Ryan </em>v. <em>American Bridge Co., </em>243 App. Div. 496, 498, aifd. 268 N. Y. 502.) In the <em>Ryan </em>case <em>{supra), </em>the court correctly stated that \u201c The statute in question [\u00a7 25-a] deals only with <em>\u2018 </em>stale \u2019 claims of injured employees, that is, those where after extended periods, there, has been a recurrence of malady, a progress in disease not anticipated, or a pathological development not previously prognosticated, arising out of the injury. \u2019 \u2019 (243 App. Div., at p. 498.) Applications for the replacement or repair of orthopedic shoes are obviously not unforeseeable. On the contrary, in a case of total disablement of a leg, the need for their replacement or repair is not only foreseeable but inevitable, and, in view of the design of section 25-a, such matters are not the responsibility of the special fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Moreover, what reason and the design of section 25-a so strongly suggest, the statute elsewhere confirms. By section 13 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, the employer\u2019s obligation to repair or replace prosthetic devices, no matter how long a .time may intervene between the award and the repair or replacement of such articles, is unalterably and unequivocally fixed. That section, in so many words, renders the employer liable to furnish, \u201c for such period as the nature of the injury * * * may require \u201d, not only \u201c artificial members of the body or other devices or appliances necessary in the first instance to replace, support or relieve a portion or part of the body resulting from and necessitated by the injury of an employee \u201d, but also <em>\u201c </em>replacements or repairs of such artificial members of the body or such other devices or appliances necessitated by ordinary wear.\u201d And, most significantly, the statute continues, <em>\u201c </em>such a replacement or repair * * * shall not constitute the payment of compensation under section twentv-five-a \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">That, it seems to me, ends the matter, for, since section 25-a applies only to a long-delayed <em>\u201c application for compensation \u201d </em>and since the replacement or repair of devices such as orthopedic shoes is \u2014 by legislative definition \u2014 <em>not \u201c compensation </em>\u201d, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>necessarily follows that section 25-a may not here be properly invoked by employer or carrier to shift liability to the special fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">That being so, it is unnecessary to consider whether the board\u2019s action in placing this claim in \u201c abeyance \u201d in its <em>\u201c </em>pending file \u201d effectively <em>\u201c </em>closed \u201d the case for present purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">I would affirm the determination of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Loughran, Oh. J., Conway and Dye, JJ., concur with Bromley, J.; Fuld, J., dissents in opinion in which Lewis and Desmond, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
