The Trial Justice was logically and pre-eminently the one to decide that question. His recollection and finding that the dismissal at the trial was, in fact, without prejudice, and his failure to so specify at the time, an inadvertency, are conclusive. <em>(Morlock </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>226 App. Div. 222; <em>Cabang </em>v. <em>United States Shipping Bd.

The judgment of dismissal thereafter entered did not contain a recital that it was made \u201c without prejudice \u201d the effect of which was to make it a final determination on the merits and to bar the commencement of another action. (Civ. Prac. Act, \u00a7 482.) Later a motion made by plaintiff to amend and correct the judgment <em>nunc pro tunc </em>by inserting the words \u201c without prejudice, and not on the merits \u201d was granted at Special Term by the Justice who had presided at the trial. Upon appeal the Appellate Division reversed on the law and the facts and denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion. The plaintiff appeals to this court by permission of the Appellate Division and upon two certified questions inquiring whether the Special Term had the power to so amend and correct its order and secondly, whether its exercise constituted an abuse of discretion. In any event, whether the Appellate Division order be treated as a new final judgment or as a new final order, it nevertheless is a final determination appealable as of right. (Civ. Prac. Act, \u00a7 588; <em>S. J. E. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number><em>Bldg. Corp. </em>v. <em>Matt O. M. Constr. Co., </em>265 N. Y. 282.) Moreover, the Appellate Division must \"be taken to have denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion in the exercise of discretion and not as a matter of law, with the result that no question is presented which we can reach. <em>(Schenectady Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Emmons, </em>290 N. Y. 225.)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs, and the questions certified not answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Loughran, Ch.
