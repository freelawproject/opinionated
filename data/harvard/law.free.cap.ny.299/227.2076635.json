The annulment of the commissioner\u2019s order of revocation, made by the Appellate Division, is erroneous since that court attempted to review the evidence on the basis of its weight and preponderance and did not, as required by section 1296 of the Civil Practice Act, review the evidence on the question whether there was substantial evidence to support the commissioner\u2019s determination. <em>(Matter of Humphrey </em>v. <em>State Ins.

Assuming that the, statement in the Appellate Division order that its annulment of the order of the commisioner \u201c on the law and on the facts \u201d is erroneous, nevertheless the Appellate Division examined the record to ascertain if there is <em>\u201c </em>substantial evidence \u201d to justify the determination. <em>(Matter of Humphrey </em>v. <em>State Ins. Fund, </em>298 N. Y. 327; <em>Matter of Weinstein </em>v. <em>Board of Regents, </em>292 N. Y. 682; <em>Matter of Miller </em>v. <em>Kling, </em>291 N. Y. 65.) II. The determination of appellant in revoking petitioner\u2019s motor vehicle operator\u2019s license on the ground of reckless driving is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Matter of Sheridan </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>270 App. Div. 29; <em>People </em>v. <em>Grogan, </em>260 N.

(Vehicle and Traffic Law, \u00a7 71, subd. 1). Such revocation is \u201c an administrative act reviewable by the supreme court \u201d. (Vehicle and Traffic Law, \u00a7 71, subd. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">In the present proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act we review a nonunanimous order of the Appellate Division which annulled upon the law and facts a determination.made \u2014 after a hearing \u2014 by the appellant, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, revoking the petitioner-respondent\u2019s motor vehicle operator\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">In those circumstances the scope of our review is limited to the inquiry whether there was substantial evidence to justify the administrative determination made by the commissioner. <em>(Matter of Humphrey </em>v. <em>State Ins. Fund, </em>298 N. Y. 327, 331-332; <em>Matter of Friedel </em>v. <em>Board of Regents, </em>296 N. Y. 347, 352; <em>Matter of Miller </em>v. <em>Kling, </em>291 N. Y. 65, 69.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>The stated basis of the revocation was <em>\u201c </em>reckless driving on 11/7/47 in Binghamton, N. Y.\u201d in violation of section 58 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law. That statute provides in part: <em>\u201c </em>\u00a7 58. <em>Reckless driving. </em>Beckless driving shall mean driving or using any motor vehicle or motor cycle or any appliance or accessory thereof in a manner which unreasonably interferes with the free and proper use of the public highway, or unreasonably endangers users of the public highway. Beckless driving is prohibited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">From evidence taken at a formal hearing before a referee, whose authority is not questioned, the following facts were adduced: Hawley Street in the city of Binghamton is an east-west paved thoroughfare which intersects Carroll Street at right angles. At about midnight on November 7,1947, when the traffic control signal at that intersection was not operating, two automobiles approached that intersection. From the east, moving westerly along Hawley Street, was a car driven by the petitioner-respondent Donahue with whom two passengers were riding on the front seat. From the north, moving southerly along Carroll Street, was a car in which its driver \u2014 the witness Bartholomew \u2014 was its only occupant. Those two cars collided at a point within the intersection causing death to the two passengers in the Donahue car, property damage to both cars and the subsequent revocation of each driver\u2019s operator\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Limiting our examination of the record to the question \u201c whether there is <em>1 </em>substantial evidence \u2019 to justify the administrative determination \u201d by which the license of the respondent Donahue was revoked <em>(Matter of Humphrey </em>v. <em>State Ins. Fund, supra, </em>p. 332) \u2014 we find evidence that as the respondent Donahue drove westerly along Hawley Street and approached the intersection mentioned above, he failed to conform with the statutory mandate which requires that <em>\u201c </em>Every driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection shall grant the right of way at such intersection to any vehicle approaching from his right, except where otherwise directed by a peace officer or as otherwise provided by this chapter with respect to intersections where traffic is controlled by traffic control signals. \u2019 \u2019 (Vehicle and Traffic Law, \u00a7 82, subd. 4.)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>It also appears from respondent\u2019s own testimony that when he had reached a point on Hawley Street two car lengths from the intersection he looked to his left and then to his right from which point he had a view northerly along Carroll Street for a distance of <em>\u201c </em>four or five houses \u201d. However, without applying the brakes of his car he entered the intersection where, upon his first sight of the Bartholomew car \u2014 approaching three car lengths to the north and moving southerly along Carroll Street \u2014 he \u201c attempted to accelerate \u201d his own car but failed to avoid collision with the Bartholomew car coming from the right. According to the respondent\u2019s testimony the collision occurred when his car was <em>\u201c </em>Over the center, probably nearly out of the intersection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">When the respondent was questioned as to why, at that midnight hour, he did not see the approach of the car from his right, his testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. Was there anything to prevent your seeing Mr. Bartholomew\u2019s car before you reached the center of the intersection? A. No, I could see him before he reached the center if 1 had seen him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">\u201c Q. But you didn\u2019t look, is that it? A. I looked, yes, I looked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">\u201c Q. How is it you didn\u2019t see him then? A. Well, the lights were rather poor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">\u201c Q. What? A. His lights were poor on his car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">As to the condition of lights on the Bartholomew car its driver testified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-11\">\u201c Q. Were your lights on? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-12\">\u201c Q. Dim or bright? A. Bright lights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-13\"><em>\u201c </em>Q. Upper or lower beam? A. I think lower but I wouldn\u2019t be sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-14\"><em>11 </em>Q. Was that because of approaching traffic? A. Well, city driving, always drive with the lights on the lower beam.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-15\"><em>\u201c </em>Q. Could you see a substantial object ahead three hundred fifty feet? A. I think so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-16\">True it is, as claimed by the respondent Donahue that near the west curb of Carroll Street about twenty-five feet north of the intersection there was a \u201c stop \u201d sign facing southbound traffic. There is undisputed evidence, however, that as the Bartholomew car moved southerly along Carroll Street an automobile was parked at the curb in front of the \u201c stop \u201d sign in such a position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>as to interfere with a view of the sign by southbound traffic. In this case we are not called upon to determine the duty which was impressed upon Bartholomew by the \u201c stop \u201d sign which \u2014 under conditions there existing \u2014 was invisible to him as he moved southerly on Carroll Street and approached the intersection of Hawley Street. Whatever that duty may have been in the circumstances it did not relieve the respondent Donahue from obeying the statutory rule prescribed by subdivision 4 of section 82 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, \u00a1quoted <em>(supra). </em>(Cf. <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Judson, </em>283 N. Y. 393, 398.)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The record in this proceeding discloses evidence of reckless driving by the respondent Donahue which we regard as substantial in character and sufficient in law to justify the administrative determination by which the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles revoked the respondent\u2019s motor vehicle operator\u2019s license. <em>(Matter of Humphrey </em>v. <em>State Ins. Fund, supra, </em>pp. 331-332.)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the determination of the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles confirmed, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Loughran, Ch. J., Conway, Desmond, Dye, Ftjld and Bromley. JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"ABrQ\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b256-7\"> For definition of the nse of the phrase <em>\u201c </em>Traffic control signals \u201d see Vehicle and Traffic Law, \u00a7 2, subd. 24.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
