Section 965 of the Penal Law violates section 16 of article III of the State Constitution, prohibiting incorporation by reference. <em>(Darweger </em>v. <em>Staats, </em>267 N. Y. 290.) III. Section 965 of the Penal Law involves an unlawful delegation of legislative powers, in violation of section 1 of article III of the State Constitution. <em>(Darweger </em>v. <em>Staats, </em>267 N.

Section 965 of the Penal Law contravenes section 10 of article I of the Federal Constitution in that it impairs the obligations of contracts, and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution in that it constitutes an unlawful interference with the natural and constitutional right to contract. It cannot be justified under the so-called <em>\u201c </em>Police Power \u201d of this State. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nebbia, </em>262 N.

Section 965 of the Penal Law directly and illegally conflicts with the controlling Federal Housing and Kent Acts of 1947 and 1948. <em>(Woods </em>v. <em>Miller Co., </em>333 U.

The People failed to prove that the charges made by defendant were unlawful; since defendant was a licensed real estate broker, he could charge whatever sum he wished, big or little. VII. The People failed to prove that the payment of money would procure for complainants advantages over others in entering into agreements for the leasing of real property. VIII.

Section 965 of the Penal Law, in failing to provide guides, standards or criteria as to \u201c lawful charges \u201d, is unconstitutional, since the provisions thereof are too vague, indefinite and uncertain to meet the requirements of due process of law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Grogan, </em>260 N.

Since section 965 is to be read in conjunction with other State or Federal legislation, and the alleged crime defined and interpreted by reference thereto, the law is unconstitutional as violative of the provisions of section 16 of article III of the State Constitution. <em>(Darweger </em>v. <em>Staats, </em>267 N. Y. 290.) III. Section 965 of the Penal Law is invalid because it violates the constitutional requirement prohibiting a delegation of legislative powers. <em>(Panama Refining Co. </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>293 U. S. 388; <em>Schechter Poultry Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>295 U. S. 495; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rock Royal Co-operative, </em>307 U.

Section 965 of the Penal Law violates section 10 of article I, as well as the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, as to freedom of contract and deprivation of property. V. The conviction of defendant was erroneous since it was based upon the uncorroborated testimony of witnesses who were his accomplices in the commission of the alleged crime. VI. The first count of the information should have been dismissed since the People did not adduce evidence of the commission of any crime in New York County. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>152 N.

Section 965 of the Penal Law, under which defendant was convicted, is vague, indefinite and uncertain, and fails to provide an ascertainable standard for determining guilt. Therefore it fails to comply with the \u201c due process \u201d clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the .United States Constitution and of section 6 of article I of the State Constitution. <em>(Campbell </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>244 N.

Y. 284; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mancuso, </em>255 N. Y. 463.) II. Section 965 of the Penal Law violates both section 16 of article III of the State Constitution, which prohibits incorporation by reference, and section 1 of article III of the State Constitution, in that it involves an unlawful delegation of legislative powers. <em>(Darweger </em>v. <em>Staats, </em>267 N. Y. 290; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mailman, </em>293 N. Y. 887.) III. Congress has evinced a clear intent that no criminal penalties should attach to violations of the Federal Housing and Bent Acts of 1947 and 1948. Section 965 of the Penal Law is therefore unconstitutional and invalid. <em>(Woods </em>v. <em>Miller Co., </em>333 U. S. 138; <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Mohawk Wrecking &amp; Lumber Co., </em>331 U.

Convicted of violating section 965 of the Penal Law, entitled <em>\u201c </em>Excessive charges in connection with rental agreements \u2019 \u2019, defendants challenge their convictions upon constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Section 965 makes it a misdemeanor for anyone either (1) to request, collect or accept from another \u2018 * any donation, gratuity, bonus, emolument, gift, payment or thing of value, in addition to lawful charges,\u201d upon the representation or understanding that \u2018 \u2018 compliance * * * will facilitate, influence or procure an advantage over others in entering into an agreement \u201d for rental of real property or (2) to refuse to enter into any such agreement \u201c unless he receives * * * any such donation, gratuity, bonus * * * gift, payment or thing of value \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The provision is \u2014 contrary to defendants\u2019 contention \u2014 not a rent control statute and does not purport, singly or in conjunction with other statutes or regulations, to prescribe or limit the amount of rent that may be charged. That is the province of other legislation, federal, state and local. (See, e.g., Emergency Commercial Bent Control Law, L. 1945, ch. 3; McKinney\u2019s Unconsol.

In our view, section 965 meets the constitutional tests by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>giving reasonable notice of <em>1 \u2018 </em>what must be done and what must be avoided \u201d and of how the charge may be defended.

S. 19, 26; <em>Cline </em>v. <em>Frink Dairy Co., </em>274 U. S. 445, 459-460; <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>General Constr. Co., </em>269 U. S. 385, 391-392; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cohen Grocery Co., </em>255 U. S. 81, 92; <em>International Harvester Co. </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>234 U. S. 216, 223.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Designed to prevent the exploitation of those in desperate need of rental accommodations, the statute prohibits and condemns the acceptance of donations, gratuities, bonuses or gifts in connection with arranging leases. The phrase, \u201c in addition to lawful charges,\u201d defines no essential element of the crime, simply serving to limit the immediately preceding words <em>\u201c </em>payment or thing of value, \u2019 \u2019 and to assimilate their meaning to that of the operative and controlling words \u2014 donation, gratuity, bonus or gift. In short, no extra premiums are tolerated, however ingeniously cloaked or disguised as payments; the fees collected must represent the charges for actual services.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In that respect, several defendants, being licensed real estate brokers or salesmen, make the separate contention that, since there is no limit to the amount of brokerage commissions which they may lawfully charge, they are immune from prosecution under section 965. We find their argument unpersuasive. The Real Property Law, in permitting a broker to collect commissions for legitimate services (Real Property Law, \u00a7\u00a7 442-d, 440 <em>et seq.), </em>gives him no general license to exact tribute from a prospective tenant on the strength of a representation that such a payment will yield to the latter an advantage over others in securing a lease. The question presented upon the trial of a broker defendant is not different in any essential from that involved in the case of an unlicensed person. In each, the issue is, was the payment <em>in fact </em>exacted as a special premium of the type condemned, or was it received in payment of some legitimate service? As to two of the defendants here involved that question was answered in the affirmative by reason of their formal admissions \u2014 in one instance, by a plea of guilty, in the other, by a refusal to plead following disallowance of a demurrer (Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7 330). As to the remaining defendants, the affirmative answer implicit in the trial court\u2019s finding of guilt is supported by overwhelming proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>While the fact issue raised may in the abstract seem difficult, it is of a type with which the criminal courts are entirely familiar, of a sort with which they are constantly called upon to deal. A similar issue is met in the prosecution of a labor racketeer for extortion, when the defendant concedes receipt of the alleged extortionate payment but claims that it wa\u00a7 accepted in return for some legitimate service to labor or management. (Cf., e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Parkinson, </em>297 N. Y. 749; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>296 N. Y. 510.) In the present prosecutions, the People more than met the burden of establishing, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendants, licensed or not, exacted large sums, not in return for legitimate services, but in manifest violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Defendants\u2019 remaining points we consider to be lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In each case, the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Loughran, Oh. J., Lewis, Conway, Desmond, Dye and Bromley, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Judgments affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
