This information is disseminated to subscribers in part by mail through the medium of two publications, issued at regular periods, under the titles \u201c Babson\u2019s Washington Service \u201d and \u201c Babson\u2019s Business Service \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">The comptroller of the City of New York has determined that respondent\u2019s receipts from subscriptions to these publications are receipts from sales of \u201c tangible personal property \u201d. The comptroller has further determined that these publications are not excluded from coverage under the sales tax as newspapers or periodicals. Accordingly, since respondent did not charge or collect any sales tax from its subscribers, the comptroller concluded that respondent is liable for the payment of such taxes based on sales in the city of New York from 1935 to 1944. A <em>\u201c </em>Final Determination \u201d assessing a deficiency of $2,606.54 against respondent was then issued. Respondent procured an order referring the matter to the Appellate Division for a review of the comptroller\u2019s determination in accordance with article 78 of the Civil Practice Act. That court, with two Justices dissenting, annulled the determination of the comptroller on the law and ordered the repayment of certain sums previously deposited with the comptroller.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The facts are undisputed. Respondent is a foreign corporation with its principal place of business in Massachusetts where it maintains its offices and prints the two publications above mentioned. Subscribers in New York City receive them by mail. \u201c Babson\u2019s Washington Service \u201d, also called \u20181 Babson\u2019s Washington\u2019s Reports \u201d, contains a subtitle reading \u201c Confidential Forecasts of Coming Developments \u201d. It is published weekly and consists of four pages of printed matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Babson\u2019s Business Service \u201d, also called \u201c Babson\u2019s Reports \u201d, consists of three parts, the contents of which are indicated by their titles (1) \u201cBusiness Management \u2014 Sales and Wage Forecast \u201d, (2) \u201c Business Inventory \u2014 Commodity Price Forecast \u201d, and (3) <em>\u201c </em>Confidential Barometer Letter \u201d, also called \u201c Timesaver for Corporation Presidents \u201d. The first two parts of the \u201c Business Service \u201d are issued monthly and each contains ten pages. The third part is issued weekly and consists of four pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Subscribers to the \u201c Washington Service \u201d and the \u201c Business Service \u201d may avail themselves at any time of advisory or consultation privileges, i.e., they may obtain from respondent additional and specialized information concerning their particular problems and individual needs. These advisory privileges do not exceed 5% of the total editorial work of respondent\u2019s staff in the case of either publication. All of respondent\u2019s subscription blanks and publicity booklets for the \u201c Washington Service \u201d and the \u201c Business Service \u201d, as well as the publications themselves, contain, in various forms, recitals to the effect that the material contained in the publications is to be treated \u201c as confidential \u201d or \u201c in strict confidence for the use only by subscribers and by those who secure this material thru authorized sources \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">For reasons presently to be stated, we think the order of the Appellate Division annulling the determination of the comptroller must be affirmed on the ground that respondent\u2019s publications are \u201c periodicals \u201d within the meaning of schedule \u201c A \u201d and are thus outside the coverage of the local sales tax law. The two dissenting Justices in the Appellate Division, who voted to confirm the comptroller\u2019s determination, cited and relied upon our decision in <em>Matter of Moody\u2019s Investors Service </em>v. <em>McGoldrick </em>(280 N. Y. 581). That case, however, is not applicable here. There, the publisher, Moody\u2019s, collected and compiled statistical information concerning corporate securities and printed the results in a series of publications, each devoted to a different class of security. The publications took the form of (a) pamphlets issued in most cases twice a week which contained current information concerning dividends, financial reports and other matters of interest to subscribers; and (b) a bound reference book or manual, issued at the end of the year, which integrated the information contained in the pamphlets published during the year. Subscribers contracted to receive the desired pamphlets during the year and Moody\u2019s agreed to give each subscriber at the end of the year a copy of the appropriate integrating manual \u201c free \u201d, The publications were copyrighted in the United States Copyright Office as <em>\u201c </em>books \u201d. No personal services were offered or given by Moody\u2019s in connection with the sale of the publications. We there held that the pamphlets issued by Moody\u2019s should be regarded as publi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>cations at regular intervals of parts of the reference book or manual furnished to subscribers at the end of the year. Thus, in effect, the transaction was one for the sale of such manuals, and the single subscription price was subject to the city sales tax as a receipt from the sale of tangible personal property. The reference books or manuals were clearly finished products, freely transferrable and having an independent market value in the hands of the purchaser disassociated from any personal and individual services rendered by the seller. These books or manuals were held taxable even though they were the <em>product </em>of services, i.e., specialized and extensive investigation, evaluation and research prior to publication, for the subscriber purchased the finished book and not the services which went into its publication. Moreover, as indicated, the weekly pamphlets in the <em>Moody </em>case <em>(supra) </em>did not come within the category of \u201c periodicals \u201d, not subject to the tax, because they were merely publications at regular intervals of component parts of the reference book or manual issued at the end of the year. In short, the <em>Moody </em>case simply sanctioned the taxability of receipts from the sale of such reference books or manuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">An entirely different situation is presented in the instant case. The publications here involved can not in any sense be regarded as books or parts thereof. They impress us rather as \u2018 \u2018 periodicals \u201d within the meaning and intent of that word as used in schedule \u201c A \u201d of subdivision a of section N41-2.0 of the Administrative Code. The word \u201c periodical \u201d is not defined in the local law here under consideration and we find no such definition in the statutory or decisional law of this State. In that situation, we adopt the test of common understanding. \u201c A tax law should be interpreted as the ordinary person reading it would interpret it.\u201d <em>(Howitt </em>v. <em>Street &amp; Smith Publications, </em>276 N. Y. 345, 351.)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Newspapers, magazines and periodicals are all vehicles for the transmission of news, opinions, ideas, information and literature. They have the common elements of periodicity, general availability to the public, and continuity as to title and general nature of content from issue to issue. They do not usually possess a substantial and permanent binding and the writings contained therein are customarily the product of an editorial staff rather than a single author. Exact definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>is difficult, but we entertain no doubt that respondent\u2019s publications would commonly be classified, in popular speech, as \u00a3&lt; periodicals \u201d, and that when the phrase \u00a3\u00a3 newspapers and periodicals \u201d was used in schedule \u00a3&lt; A \u201d, it was used with the common and popular understanding of the words.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">We are referred to certain technical distinctions between newspapers and periodicals on the one hand, and books on the other, which have been found necessary in the administration of our Federal copyright and postal systems, and the attempts at definition which have been made with respect to those fields by statute, regulation and judicial opinion. These expressions, of course, were written in the light of the special problems and needs of those fields, and are not conclusive on the question of what constitutes a periodical within the meaning of the local sales tax law here involved. To some degree, however, these expressions have entered our speech and thought and have influenced the common understanding of the word \u00a3\u00a3 periodical \u201d. Accordingly, they shed some light on our present problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Respondent\u2019s \u00a3\u00a3 Washington Service \u201d and \u00a3\u00a3 Business Service \u201d were actually classified in the United States Copyright Office, under subdivision (b) of section 5 of title 17 of the United States Code, as <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>periodicals \u2019 \u2019. This action was taken despite the fact that the Copyright Office regulations provide that \u00a3\u00a3 Serial publications which are not clearly \u00a3 periodicals \u2019 should be registered as books \u201d. (See Code of Fed. Reg., tit. 37, \u00a7 201.4, subd. [b], par. [2].) In this connection, the case of <em>Houghton </em>v. <em>Payne </em>(194 U. S. 88) assumes importance in the instant case because the comptroller of the City of New York has adopted a quotation therefrom in his regulations as the definition of a periodical for sales tax purposes. In the <em>Houghton </em>case <em>(supra) </em>the Supreme Court held that the publication of certain novels and collections of short stories in a form which technically complied with the requirements of sections 10 and 14 of the Postal Law (U. S. Code, tit. 39, \u00a7\u00a7 224, 226) was nevertheless a patent device by the publishers to secure postal privileges at the periodical rate instead of the book rate, and that the publications were in truth books and not periodicals. In the course of its opinion, the court said (p. 97): \u00a3&lt; A periodical, as ordinarily understood, is a publication appearing at stated intervals, each number of which contains a variety of original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>articles by different authors, devoted either to general literature of some special branch of learning or to a special class of subjects. Ordinarily each number is incomplete in itself, and indicates a relation with prior or subsequent numbers of the same series. It implies a continuity of literary character, a connection between the different numbers of the series in the nature of the articles appearing in them, whether they be successive chapters of the same story or novel or essays upon subjects pertaining to general literature. * # * \u201d This quotation is now embodied in article 44 of the comptroller\u2019s rules and regulations for the city sales tax. Under-the tests suggested in the quotation, the respondent\u2019s publications are clearly \u201c periodicals \u201d especially when it is recalled that the word \u201c literature \u201d in this context means \u201c no more than productions which convey ideas by words, pictures, or drawings.\u201d <em>(Hannegan </em>v. <em>Esquire, Inc., </em>327 U. S. 146, 153.) Respondent\u2019s publications appear at stated intervals; they contain a variety of original articles by different, though unnamed, authors; they are devoted to a special class of subjects; they are incomplete in themselves and indicate a relation to prior and subsequent issues and they have a continuity of literary character.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">The city\u2019s only serious contention in this court upon this point is that respondent\u2019s statement to subscribers that the material contained in its publications should be treated <em>\u201c </em>in strict confidence \u201d or <em>\u201c </em>as confidential \u201d deprives such publications of the character of \u201c periodicals \u201d within the meaning of the local sales tax law. Respondent\u2019s publications, of course, were actually intended for general circulation in the sense that any member of the public with the inclination and available funds could subscribe to them. It may be conceded, however, that the word <em>\u201c </em>periodical \u201d commonly implies that the publication so characterized is not only generally available to the public but also contains information of a public character. But we do not think that respondent\u2019s admonition that the information contained in its publications was \u201c confidential \u201d was literally effective to forbid the normal use and public expression of such information by individual subscribers. The restriction, in practical effect, seems merely to be a prohibition against competing and contemporaneous publication of the information contained in the reports, i.e., a prohibition against pirating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>contents of the reports. It appears to he a precautionary notice to supplement respondent\u2019s copyright protection, and probably was intended to have certain incidental promotional and advertising value in stimulating sales of subscriptions. At any rate, we do not feel that the quoted statement that the material contained in the publications is \u201c confidential \u201d deprives them of the character of periodicals within the intent and meaning of the local sales tax law.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Furthermore, it should be noted that if we were to accord to the restriction the literal effectiveness argued for by the city, then cogent argument could be advanced that subscriptions to the publications are not sales of \u201c tangible personal property \u201d, for in that event, the publications would have no independent market value in the hands of the subscriber and he would not be able to transfer them nor divulge their contents. Instead of being the subject of a sale of tangible personal property, the actual printed publications would really be an incidental part of a transaction involving the private communication of specialized knowledge to individual clients, accompanied by the rendition of personal and direct services on the part of respondent. In that view, the case would be akin to <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet </em>v. <em>City of New York </em>(276 N. Y. 198) and <em>Stampers Arrival of Buyers </em>v. <em>City of New York </em>(296 N. Y. 574) cases in which transactions essentially calling for the rendition \u2014 in exchange for a stipulated consideration \u2014 of personal services were not considered to be sales of tangible personal property merely by reason of the fact that as a necessary incident thereto the subscriber received and retained printed matter of no independent or market value. There is no need to pursue these observations further, however, for, as indicated, we hold that the statement that the published material was \u201c confidential \u201d is not sufficient to destroy the character of the publications as <em>\u201c </em>periodicals \u201d within the meaning of schedule \u201c A \u201d and accordingly that receipts from their sale are not subject to the city sales tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">It is also proper to note that we do not believe that the serious constitutional difficulties, mentioned in the opinion of the Appellate Division and strenuously argued by respondent here, are actually present in the case. If we were to construe the local sales tax law as vesting in the comptroller the power to make a determination as to whether a disputed publication was or was not a periodical based upon his conception of the cultural or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>social value of the contents or purposes of such publications, that might in effect be granting to the comptroller a limited right of censorship and might pose a problem of constitutional law. (Cf. <em>Hannegan </em>v. <em>Esquire, Inc., supra.) </em>Of course, we have not and do not now so construe the local law, and, as the opinion below concedes, the comptroller did not base his determination in the instant case on any such theory. Apart from that possibility, we see no constitutional question here present. Like other businessmen and their products, publishers and their publications may constitutionally be subject to a general tax or regulatory statute which does not purport to censor or to discriminate against them. The case of <em>Grosjean </em>v. <em>American Press Co. </em>(297 U. S. 233) cited by respondent and the court below, involved a tax clearly different from the one at bar. There, as stated in <em>Mabee </em>v. <em>White Plains Pub. Co. </em>(327 U. S. 178, 184) \u201c * * * the press was singled out for special taxation and the tax was graduated in accordance with volume of circulation.\u201d See, to the same effect, <em>Oklahoma Press Pub. Co. </em>v. <em>Walling </em>(327 U. S. 186, 192-194.) Compare also the express reservation in the <em>Grosjean </em>case <em>(supra, </em>at p. 250), with <em>Giragiy. Moore </em>(49 Ariz. 74, appeal dismissed 301 U. S. 670), and <em>Arizona Pub. Co. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil </em>(22 F. Supp. 117, affd. 304 U. S. 543).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The other points argued in the briefs do not warrant extended discussion. In view of our decision that the comptroller\u2019s determination and deficiency assessment were properly annulled, respondent\u2019s contention that a portion of such assessment was barred by a special statute of limitations is of no moment. We also agree with the holding of the Appellate Division that respondent is entitled to the repayment of the sum of $403.96, as against the city\u2019s contention that said sum was paid by respondent voluntarily and without protest. That amount was paid by a check dated January 18,1943, and drawn, at the city\u2019s request, in place of a previous check in the same amount which had been sent by respondent but never cashed by the city. We think that the protest which had accompanied the previous check was sufficient to cover the subsequent check sent in its stead.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The order should be affirmed, with costs,</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Loughran, Oh.
