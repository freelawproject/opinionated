When the time arrived for her departure it was raining heavily and defendant\u2019s wife asked him to take the girl home. At this point the several accounts of the afternoon diverge sharply.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Sworn as a witness, complainant testified that the defendant had proposed that they drive <em>\u201c 1 </em>on to Pleasantdale \u2019 \u201d, had kissed her and placed his hand \u201c on my chest and on my knee \u201d, and that she had left the car within a block of her home. Her mother testified that the girl arrived home from the party emotionally upset, and complained that, defendant had \u201c \u2018 kissed me and put his hands on my breasts and put his hand under my dress.\u2019 \u201d Defendant squarely denied the accusation, and introduced evidence to show that he had been absent from his home no more than five minutes, and that his reputation was good.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Assuming that the People\u2019s case has been established beyond a reasonable doubt, the conviction nevertheless cannot stand unless defendant can be said to have carnally abused the body of the girl. The precise scope of the clause has never been determined in a reported decision in this State. In other jurisdictions the term \u201c carnal abuse \u201d has been considered to signify physical violation of the sexual organs short of intercourse <em>(State </em>v. <em>Mac Lean, </em>135 N. J. L. 491; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hummer, </em>73 N. J. L. 714; and see <em>State </em>v. <em>Sebastian, </em>81 Conn. 1, 8). Such a connotation would accord with the following most pertinent definitions of the words: carnal, <em>\u20181 </em>of or pertaining to the body as the seat of appetites * * * sexual \u201d; abuse,1 \u2018 violation; rape; ravishment\u201d (Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">The import of the statute must be considered also in light of its context \u2014 those provisions of the Penal Law relating to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>similar sexual offenses. Prior to 1927, the statutory law concerning acts such as those of which defendant is accused was found in two provisions: section 244 of the Penal Law, under which any indecent familiarities would constitute assault in the third degree (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>232 N. Y. 458); and section 483, whereby one who willfully causes the morals of a child under sixteen to become depraved, or willfully places a child in such a situation that its morals are likely to be impaired, is guilty of a misdemeanor <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gibson, supra, </em>at p. 462). Practical difficulties in establishing the material elements of the latter offense (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>208 App. Div. 438, and 1937 Report of N. Y. Law Revision Commission, p. 486) led to the enactment of section 483-b (L. 1929, ch. 684) and its companion provision that the crime shall be a felony if the child is under ten years of age (L. 1927, ch. 383). The customary significance of the terms \u201c carnal abuse \u201d, and the second clause of sections 483-a and 483-b, indicate clearly that the new provisions were to have a far narrower scope than the earlier statutes. It is unnecessary here to determine their precise range, for we agree that defendant\u2019s acts, if proved, would not amount to an offense under section 483-b.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The People urge that this appeal must be dismissed because on the appeal to the County Court defendant employed the notice provided for appeals from courts of general criminal jurisdiction (Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7\u00a7 522, 523) rather than the affidavit required in this case by section 751 of the Code. The contention was not made below, and the appeal therefore was considered on the merits (191 Misc. 519, 522). Section 751 does not relate to defendant\u2019s right to appeal (see Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7 520), and manifestly is intended only to provide a method of appeal which will insure adequate notice to a district attorney who may not have participated in the trial (see Seventh Annual Report of N. Y. Judicial Council, 1941, p. 254). By failing to raise the point below, the District Attorney has waived his right to an affidavit of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The judgments should be reversed and the information dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Loughran, Ch. J., Lewis, Conway, Desmond, Dye and Fuld, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Judgments reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
