Towne, deceased. The company defended on the ground that deceased had misrepresented and concealed material facts in his application for a policy. Plaintiff appeals from the judgment ordering that the insurance contract be cancelled and rescinded and that plaintiff recover only the sum of $841.73 representing premiums paid. -</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\">In August of 1952 deceased applied to respondent for a policy of life insurance in the sum of $50,000. As part of his examination by respondent\u2019s medical examiner he was asked the following questions, among others, and gave in writing the answers set forth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-4\">\u201c4.

(If so, give full particulars, date, duration, severity, etc., of each. Use reverse side if necessary.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">\u201cFracture Eight Ankle. 1905.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The deceased further stated that he had had the X-ray referred to in the answer to question 6(b) in 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">At the bottom of this questionnaire the following statements were printed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">\u201cI represent that the statements and answers in this Part II are written as made by me to the medical examiner, are full, complete and true and agree that they shall be a part of the contract of insurance if issued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">\u201cI waive (to the extent permitted by law) on behalf of myself and any person who shall have or claim any interest in any policy issued hereunder all provisions of law forbidding any physician or other person who has attended me, from disclosing any knowledge or information thereby acquired, and I hereby authorize such physicians or other persons to make such disclosure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">This questionnaire form was signed by respondent\u2019s medical examiner as a witness and by deceased as the proposed insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">Dr. Jacks, respondent\u2019s medical examiner, testified that he asked deceased the questions set forth on respondent\u2019s medical history form and wrote down the answers given by deceased. He then asked deceased to read over the questions and answers before signing the document, which deceased did. Dr. Jacks then gave deceased a physical examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">On October 6, 1952, respondent issued the life insurance policy on deceased\u2019s life. On November 28, 1952, the insured died. The cause of his death was acute heart failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-15\">The deposition of Dr. J. Lawrence Brown, the insured\u2019s physician, was received into evidence. It appears from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>reading of this document that the insured did not enjoy the \u201cgood health\u201d he claimed on his application for insurance. He either visited or was visited by Dr. Brown for professional treatment forty-seven times between December 29, 1948 and July 28, 1952. Most of these visits were in the years 1950, 1951, and 1952. Deceased received his last treatment on July 28, 1952. At that time his complaint was that he felt that he was fatigued and needed a hormone injection. On the application form he claimed to have last consulted a doctor in June of 1952 for a routine physical examination. Dr. Brown was constantly advising the insured to slow up and take it easy. On June 18, 1948, the insured had X-rays taken of his chest and stomach on the advice of Dr. Brown. On December 29, 1949, the insured was \u201cshort of breath and nervous.\u201d On January 3, 1950, he was \u201cstill somewhat short of breath.\u201d The same complaint was registered on January 13, 1950. At this time the insured was advised to have an X-ray and an electrocardiogram to check on his lungs and heart. March 10, 1950, the insured was \u201ca little nervous but better.\u201d On January 23, 1951, the insured complained of having \u201cblacked out\u201d on two occasions. On January 30, 1951, he reported that he had coughed up some blood. October 8, 1951, Dr. Brown noted \u201csome heart change\u201d and advised the insured to slow up because of this heart change. On October 15, 1951, the doctor found the insured\u2019s heart tone to be better and advised him of this. The deposition also contains a record of many other complaints of the insured to his doctor of fatigue, nervousness, and too many colds.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\">Dr. Stewart Lindsay, the physician who performed an autopsy on the deceased, testified that his examination revealed a disease process in deceased\u2019s heart of many months\u2019 or years\u2019 duration. He further testified that in his opinion the heart condition that he found could account for or cause the symptoms and complaints of the deceased during his lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">It appears that deceased had previously, in 1949 taken out a $15,000 life insurance policy with respondent company. In connection with the issuance of this policy respondent had contacted the insured\u2019s physician, Dr. J. Lawrence Brown, and had obtained from him a report as to his medical condition. (Dr. Brown was not contacted by respondent in regard to the 1952 policy prior to its issuance.) Respondent\u2019s medical director testified that he had this report before him when he was reviewing the insured\u2019s application in 1952 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>was aware from this report that in fact he had had an X-ray in 1948 rather than in 1945 as stated in the application. The medical director further testified that had he known of deceased\u2019s true medical history as revealed in the deposition of Dr. Brown that respondent would not have issued the policy in 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">At the conclusion of all the evidence the trial court, sitting without a jury, made and entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law. Finding 9 recites:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">\u201c(9) The court finds that under and hy virtue of said written application for life insurance the said Charlie F. Towne, for the purpose of inducing the said defendant company to issue a policy and contract of life insurance on the life of said Charlie F. Towne, made false, fraudulent misrepresentations and concealments of material facts respecting his medical and health history in that he falsely and fraudulently misrepresented and concealed that he had never had spitting of blood nor had ever had shortness of breath and that the only health or physical examinations had by him was one in June, 1952, whereas, in truth, he had had spitting of blood, shortness of breath and had had many physical examinations, including one in December of 1949 or January, 1950, for shortness of breath, and one in January, 1951, for a blackout, and as set forth in the Court\u2019s Memorandum of Opinion herein, hereby referred to and made a part hereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Finding 12 is to the effect in part that respondent company had no information or reason to believe at the time of the issuing or the delivery of the policy that any of the statements in the application were untrue. It is appellant\u2019s first contention that there is no evidence to support either of these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Appellant relies on those cases which hold that where an applicant for insurance is asked generally whether he has had or been treated for any disease or ailment, the failure to refer to temporary or minor indispositions is not material to the risk and will not avoid the policy. <em>(Ransom </em>v. <em>Penn Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>43 Cal.2d 420, 427 [274 P.2d 633]; <em>Pierre </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>22 Cal.App.2d 346 [70 P.2d 985]; <em>Wills </em>v. <em>Policy Solders Life Ins. Co., </em>12 Cal.App.2d 659 [55 P.2d 920]; <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Byers, </em>123 Cal.App. 473 [11 P.2d 444].) However, this rule does not apply when the applicant is asked specific questions as to his medical history. <em>(California-Western States etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Feinsten,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>15 Cal.2d 413, 423 [101 P.2d 696, 131 A.L.R. 608]; <em>Iverson </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>151 Cal. 746, 749 [91 P. 609, 13 L.R.A.N.S. 866] ; <em>Pierre </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., supra, </em>22 Cal.App.2d 346, 349.) The distinction is clearly-pointed out in the Pierre case where the applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the following questions: 1. \u201cHave you ever had paralysis . . .?\u201d and 2. \u201cHave you consulted a physician for any ailment or disease not included in your above answers?\u201d The insured in that ease had been treated for an abscessed throat and had for a few days a \u201cfunctional rather than an organic paralysis.\u201d The court said (22 Cal.App.2d 349):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-3\">\u201cThe wording of the question may be important in determining the falsity of the answer. The first question inquired as to a specified disease, while the others were asked concerning any ailment or disease. An answer to a question as to whether an applicant had ever had a specified disease is material and, if false, avoids the policy. (Citation.) Since the words \u2018ailment or disease,\u2019 as used in an application, are understood to mean something more than a minor or temporary indisposition, which is easily forgotten, and to refer to substantial or appreciable disorders, which affect his general health, an answer, relative thereto, which fails to disclose a minor or temporary ailment is not considered to be false. (Citations.) \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The court then proceeded to hold that the failure to disclose the illness involving the abscess of the throat in answer to the general question about other \u201cailment or disease\u201d was not material on the ground that it was minor and temporary. Turning to paralysis as to which a specific question had been asked the court ruled (p. 350) : \u201cAlthough Dr. Thurlow who cared for this paralysis expressed the opinion that the ailment was minor, yet the insured\u2019s denial of having had paralysis was a material representation, since the insurer\u2019s question showed it considered it material and the insured\u2019s answer thereto evidenced his assent to the insurer\u2019s view. (Citation.) The insured\u2019s answer that he had never had paralysis was a false representation of a material fact, which avoided the policy. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The insured was asked the specific questions: \u201c. . . have you ever had or been treated for . . . (b) . . . spitting of blood ... (d) ... shortness of breath . . .?\u201d He had reported to his own physician spitting of blood and shortness of breath. His negative answers to these specific questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>were under the above rule material and the trial court properly so held.  If false representation as to material matters have been made the existence of a fraudulent intent to deceive is not essential. <em>(California-Western States etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Feinsten, supra, </em>15 Cal.2d 413, 423.) In the face of these representations others also found by the court are not necessary to support the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">It is idle for appellant to argue that there is no evidence to support the finding that the insured knew these facts since the evidence is clear that it was he who reported them to his physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">There was no duty cast on the insurer to investigate the facts or to consult the insured\u2019s physician. \u201cIt was not incumbent upon respondents to investigate Mr. Robinson\u2019s statements made to the examiner. It was his duty to divulge fully all he knew. No authority is cited and none will be found holding that an insured or his beneficiaries may escape the consequences of his deception by placing upon the insurer the burden of investigating his verified statements.\u201d <em>(Robinson </em>v. <em>Occidental Life Ins. Co., </em>131 Cal.App.2d 581, 585 [281 P.2d 39].)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The insurer, with the insured\u2019s doctor\u2019s report of 1949 before him, knew that the insured had had an X-ray of the lungs in 1948, instead of in 1945 as stated in his answer to that question. Appellant asserts that respondent knowing that one of the assured\u2019s answers was incorrect and having discovered one error was bound to investigate the truth of all other statements. It may be conceded that if the insurer had actual notice of a material misrepresentation it could not rescind on the ground of that misrepresentation. <em>(DiPasqua </em>v. <em>California etc. Life Ins. Co., </em>106 Cal.App.2d 281 [235 P.2d 64].)  But the insurer with knowledge that one of the applicant\u2019s answers is erroneous may, if it chooses, waive that fact and is not thereby estopped from raising other misrepresentations. <em>(Maggini </em>v. <em>West Coast Life Ins. Co., </em>136 Cal.App. 472 [29 P.2d 263].) The applicant had disclosed the fact of the X-ray having been taken (the important fact) and the insurer may well have regarded the mistake in date as an unintentional fault of memory and regarded it as unimportant. It cannot be held to have put the insurer on notice that the insured was deliberately concealing other material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Appellant charges that respondent attempted to suppress certain evidence vital to this action and that it was guilty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>unclean hands. It appears that appellant\u2019s counsel and a representative of respondent called on Dr. Brown, deceased\u2019s physician, some time prior to the trial. It was agreed that respondent\u2019s representative would take the doctor\u2019s file on the insured and have photostatie copies made of records contained in that file. The file was subsequently returned to the doctor. At the time the doctor\u2019s deposition was taken, on July 8, 1954, appellant\u2019s counsel discovered in questioning the doctor that a portion of the file was missing. Respondent\u2019s attorney stated he would check with respondent\u2019s representative to see what it was that appellant\u2019s attorney was inquiring about. On the first day of the trial of this matter, September 13,1954, appellant\u2019s counsel stated that he would like to have the papers taken from Dr. Brown\u2019s file. Respondent\u2019s attorney replied he would bring what was requested in the morning. He did so and the papers were received into evidence as appellant\u2019s exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\">The papers were supplied and were used as appellant\u2019s exhibits and no authority is cited that respondent should be deprived of the judgment to which it is otherwise entitled by this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Appellant\u2019s next contention is that the court\u2019s memorandum opinion is inconsistent with some of the findings, is contrary to law, and is unsupported by the evidence. For the most part appellant repeats his previous arguments in making this contention. Appellant seems to argue that the court was under the erroneous impression tha,t any false answer of the insured to a question material to the risk would vitiate the policy, whether the false answer was intentional or unintentional on the insured\u2019s part. However, a fair reading of the court\u2019s opinion as a whole shows that it was aware that the insured must himself know the truth about the situation before a false answer given by him to a material question can be used to avoid the contract. Here it found on the evidence presented that the insured did have such knowledge. Thus nothing contained in <em>Brubaker </em>v. <em>Beneficial etc. Life Ins. Co., </em>130 Cal.App.2d 340 [278 P.2d 966], would seem to compel a result different from the one here obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Appellant\u2019s last contention is that the trial court erred in striking certain testimony of Dr. Brown, the insured\u2019s physician. Dr. Brown was asked by appellant\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">\u201cQ. From your knowledge of the patient up to August 18, 1952, Doctor, would you say that you felt at that time he was an insurable risk?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>He answered: \u201cA. Well, I never actually gave that any consideration but I thought\u2014I imagine that I would have from my records here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">No error was committed in striking this question and answer on respondent\u2019s request. The issue presented was whether if respondent had known the true facts about the insured\u2019s health it would have issued the policy. Thus it would seem to be immaterial whether or not the insured\u2019s physician considered him to be an insurable risk. Further, it cannot be used to show the insured\u2019s good faith in giving his statement to the medical examiner, as appellant urges it might, in view of the fact that he knowingly answered specific questions falsely. This is not a situation where the insured was asked his opinion as to his general health or as to whether or not he considered himself to be an insurable risk. It might be admitted that if such were the case then his own physician\u2019s opinion on these matters would be relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Nourse, P. J., and Kaufman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
