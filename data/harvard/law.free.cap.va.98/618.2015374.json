Constitutional Law\u2014Appeals <em>from Corporation or Hustings Courts to Circuit </em>Courts\u2014Prohibition.\u2014Corporation and hustings courts are of co-ordinate dignity with circuit courts, by virtue of Article VT., section 14, of the Constitution of this State, and no right of appeal from the former to the latter can be conferred by the Legislature. Section 5 of the act, approved March 6, 1890 (Acts 1889-\u201990, p. 197), as amended by an act passed March 7, 1900 (Acts 1899-1900, p. 1204), attempting to confer such.right of appeal is therefore unconstitutional, and this court will by writ of prohibition prevent the circuit courts from entertaining such appeals.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-11\">Upon petition for a writ of prohibition restraining the Hon.

It is therefore adjudged and ordered that a writ of prohibition be awarded according to the prayer of said petition, commanding the defendants to proceed no further in the Circuit Court of the city of Newport News, upon the appeal granted in the Corporation Court of the city of Newport News to said Circuit Court, in the matter of the application of Charles Delaney for a license to sell wine, ardent spirits, malt liquors or any mixture thereof; and it is further adjudged and ordered that the service of an office copy of this order upon the said defendants shall have the same force and effect as the execution upon them of a writ of prohibition issued in pursuance hereof. And it is further adjudged and ordered that the plaintiff recover against the defendant, except the said J. W. G. Blackstone, Judge as aforesaid, their costs by them expended in the prosecution of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Which is ordered to be certified to the said Circuit Court of the city of Newport News.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">\n<em>Writ awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
