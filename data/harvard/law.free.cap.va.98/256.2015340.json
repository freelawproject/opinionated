Appeal and <em>Error\u2014Final </em>Decree.\u2014An order sustaining a demurrer to a bill, and giving the plaintiff leave to amend in a specified time, does not settle the principles of the cause, nor is it a final order until the expiration of the time specified.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-9\">Appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of Buckingham county, rendered July 31, 1899, in a suit in chancery, wherein the appellant was the complainant, and the appellees were the defendants.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b292-10\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-11\">The opinion states the case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-12\"><em>D.

We are of opinion that an order sustaining a demurrer to a hill, and giving the plaintiff leave to amend in a specified time, cannot be regarded as a final order, or as settling the principles of the cause, until after the time limited therein for the plaintiff to amend his bill has expired. This question was settled by this court in the case of <em>Commercial Bank of Lynchburg </em>v. <em>Rucker, </em>24 S. E. R., p. 388. In that case, Judge Keith, spealdng for the whole court, dismissed the appeal as improvidently awarded, upon the ground that this court had no jurisdiction to review a decree sustaining a demurrer and granting the plaintiff leave to file an amended bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The only distinction between the case cited of <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Rucker </em>and that under consideration is that, in the former, the decree sustained the demurrer, and continued the cause with leave to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>file an amended, bill, while in the latter, the decree sustains the demurrer and gives leave to file an amended hill in sixty days. This difference is not material. The question is not affected by the length of time the plaintiff has in which to file an amended bill, but by the fact that the right exists. As long as the privilege of filing an amended bill can be exercised, the decree is not final, and the rights of the parties have not been settled. In the case at bar, as already stated, until there has been a final decree, or one settling the principles of the cause, this court cannot take jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">For these reasons, the appeal must be dismissed as improvidently awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
