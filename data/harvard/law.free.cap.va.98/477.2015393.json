The judgment was against J. E. McGrath. At the date of the judgment he owned no real estate, but subsequently the legal 'title to the land in controversy was conveyed to him, under such circumstances, as claimed by the appellant, that it vested no beneficial interest or estate in him. The appellant claimed that the land was not liable to the lien of the judgment at all, and that, therefore, the real contro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>versy was over the title to the land sought to be subjected; that <em>is, </em>whether McGrath ever had title to the land, and whether appellant now had such title as exempted the land from the lien of the judgment mentioned in the bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-6\"><em>William Eubank </em>and G. <em>W.

Whatever may be the merits of this contention as an original proposition, it is unnecessary to consider, as this court has held by repeated decisions that the pecuniary demand asserted is, in such a case, the matter in controversy, and not the \u201ctitle or boundary of land,\u201d and where the defendant is appellant, as in this case, the test of jurisdiction is the sum decree against him, or declared to be a lien upon the land. <em>Fink </em>v. <em>Denny, </em>75 Va. 663; <em>Hawkins </em>v. <em>Gresham, </em>85 Va. 34; <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Bondurant, </em>85 Va. 47; <em>Smith and Wife </em>v. <em>Rosenheim, </em>79 Va. 540; <em>Pattison </em>v. <em>McKinney, </em>88 Va. 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">It follows from what has been said that the appeal must be dismissed as improvidently awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">\n<em>Appecd dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
