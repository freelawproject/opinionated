Certain issues were tried before a jury, and thereafter the cause was placed upon the Special Term calendar, part 3, for trial. At the trial the defendant did not appear, and .thereupon the plaintiff\u2019s counsel moved, upon the summons, complaint, notice of appearance, and answer of the defendant, the order directing the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>by jury of the issues, the verdict of the jury, and the minutes of the clerk of the part where the jury trial had taken place, for an interlocutory judgment. The motion was granted, notwithstanding the fact that no notice of such application had been given (section 1225, Code Civ. Proc.), and that plaintiff, under rule 76 of the general rules of practice, was not entitled to a judgment by reason of defendant\u2019s default. The defendant\u2019s attorney thereafter obtained an order to show cause why the interlocutory judgment should not be vacated upon the ground, among others, that notice of the application for judgment was not served upon him. Upon the return of the order to show cause, the application to vacate was denied, and the defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\">We think this order should be reversed. Under the facts set out in the moving papers, none of which are denied, the defendant\u2019s attorney was entitled to notice of the application for judgment, and, such notice not having been given, the judgment should have been vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">It does not appear that any decision was ever made, and, if this be true, that is also fatal to the judgment. Reynolds v. \u00c6tna Life Ins. Co., 6 App. Div. 254, 39 N. Y. Supp. 885; Hall as Ex\u2019r v. Beston, 13 App. Div. 116, 43 N. Y. Supp. 304; McManus v. Palmer, 13 App. Div. 443, 43 N. Y. Supp. 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The order appealed from, therefore, must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
