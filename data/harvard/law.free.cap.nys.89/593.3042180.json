Proc. \u00a7 3307, subd. 11, provides that a sheriff shall receive for posting and publishing notice of sale, selling, and conveying real estate in pursuance of a judgment the same fees as for the same services on a sale of real property by virtue of an execution; but where real property is sold under a judgment in an action to foreclose a mortgage the sheriff\u2019s entire compensation cannot exceed $50. Subdivision 6 provides that for receiving an execution against property entered in his books, searching for property, and postage on the return when made through the post office, the sheriff shall receive 50 cents. <em>Held, </em>that a referee appointed to sell real estate was entitled only to the fees specified by subdivision 11, which impliedly excludes a fee of 50 cents for receiving a judgment under subdivision 6.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b621-11\">2.

Subdivision 11 of this section specifies services for which a fee may be charged, the same as for similar services upon the sale of real property by virtue of an execution; but it does not include,' and therefore impliedly excludes, a fee for receiving the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The referee was not entitled to more than $10 for commissions allowed by section 3297 of the Code of Civil Procedure, inasmuch as it appears that such commissions are based upon a sum bid by a party and applied upon that party\u2019s demand as fixed by the judgment without being paid to the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">The order is thus modified, and, as modified, is affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
