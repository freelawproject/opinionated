In conducting its hospital, therefore, it was not liable for negligence in operating upon a patient who paid only for board and attendance, and not for the surgeon\u2019s services, in the absence of proof that it had failed to exercise reasonable care and diligence in the selection and employment of the surgeon. Collins v. N. Y. Post Graduate Medical School, 59 App. Div. 63, 69 N. Y. Supp. 106. The plaintiff, however, sought to bring his case within the doctrine of Ward v. Saint Vincent\u2019s Hospital, 39 App. Div. 624, 57 N. Y. Supp. 784; Id., 65 App. Div. 64, 72 N. Y. Supp. 587; Id., 78 App. Div. 317, 79 N. Y. Supp. 1004\u2014in which it was held on the first appeal that a charitable hospital might be liable for the breach of an express contract to furnish a patient a skilled, competent, and trained nurse, where the evidence sufficed to establish the existence of such a contract. In that case it appeared that the contract was made by a person who was characterized by Mr. Justice Barrett in that opinion as undoubtedly the authorized agent' of the corporation. The contract was declared to be entirely reasonable, and clearly witliin the scope of the authority of the sister who made it; the real question being relative to the alleged breach. In the present case the plaintiff\u2019s wife paid to the defendant $5 for the removal of the patient to the hospital by the ambulance and $20 a w\u00e9ek for his room and board. There was an attempt to prove that this payment was also intended to include compensation for the surgical attendance and treatment which the plaintiff received. The agreement was wholly oral, and appears to have been made between the plaintiff\u2019s wife and the superintendent of the hospital. In her statement of the conversation given upon her direct examination she said nothing about surgical treatment. Upon being recalled the next day, she testified that the person with whom she had the conversation told her that surgical treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>ment was included in the expense of room and board. The superintendent denied having made any such statement. Nevertheless, there might have been a question for the jury on this branch of the case, if it had not been made clearly to appear that the superintendent had no authority whatever to make any contract in behalf of the hospital to receive compensation for the services of the surgeons or physicians in its employ. There was an utter absence, therefore, of the evidence which existed in the case of Ward v. Saint Vincent\u2019s Hospital, supra, to the effect that the person alleged to have made the contract was \u201cits undoubtedly authorized agent.\u201d Apart from the foregoing consideration it is to be observed that no exception was taken to the granting of the motion to dismiss the complaint, or to the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion to go to the jury upon the questions involved, nor was any motion made for a new trial. Under these circumstances, the effective appeal being from the judgment only, the record really presents nothing which would, in any event, justify a reversal. See Collier v. Collins, 172 N. Y. 99, 64 N. E. 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">I advise an affirmance of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
