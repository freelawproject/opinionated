The defendant\u2019s affidavit alleges that at the time of the occurrence from which the action arose, viz., September 15, 1903, the plaintiff was a resident of Chicago, in the state of Illinois. . The action was commenced on January <em>20, </em>1904. The plaintiff, in opposition to the motion, submitted her affidavit, verified February 13, 1904, stating that she resides at No. 336 Gates avenue, in the borough of Brooklyn. There was no evidence offered tending\" to show that she resided in the county of Kings at the time of the commencement of the action, and her affidavit must be deemed insufficient for the purpose of establishing that fact. Radney v. Hutchinson, 50 N. Y. St. Rep. 420, 21 N. Y. Supp. 642. The affidavit of the defendant, however, is equally and similarly defective. It is verified February 19, 1904, and merely alleges that at that time he was a resident of the city of New York. There being no evidence before the court that either of the parties resided in the state at the time of the commencement of the action, the plaintiff might be regarded as entitled to designate any county for the purpose of the trial, under the section of the Code cited, and the order should therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
