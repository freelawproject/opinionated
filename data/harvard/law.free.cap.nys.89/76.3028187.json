In a hypothetical question, which assumed as true certain facts claimed to have been proven by the plaintiff, he was asked: \u201cWhat would you say produced the condition in which you found this woman upon your examination ?\u201d To this he answered: \u201cAn injury could produce that condition.\u201d Thereupon the witness was asked by plaintiff\u2019s attorney: \u201cWould an injury such as she received upon that day be likely to produce the condition which I have related to you?\u201d \u25a0 This was objected to by defendant\u2019s counsel as speculative, incompetent, inadmissible, and not based upon a reasonable certainty, or upon the facts proven. The objection was overruled, the defendant excepted, and the witness answered: \u201cI say, yes; it would.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">In Strohm v. N. Y., L. E. &amp; W. R. R. Co., 96 N. Y. 305, Rapallo, J., in writing for the cotirt, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">\u201cConsequences which are contingent, speculative, or merely possible are not proper to be considered in ascertaining the damages. It is not enough that the injuries received may develop into more serious conditions than those which are visible at the time of the injury, nor even that they are likely to so develop. To entitle a plaintiff to recover present damages for apprehended future consequences, there must be such a degree of probability of their occurring as amounts to a reasonable certainty that they will result from the original injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">In Bellemare v. Third Avenue Railroad Company, 46 App. Div. 557, 61 N. Y. Supp. 981, the headnote reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-10\">\u201cIn an action to recover damages for personal injuries, it is improper to permit a physician, who examined the plaintiff some three years and eight months after the accident, and found that certain ribs on his left side were fractured, to testify, in answer to the question as to whether the injuries would be permanent, that \u2018there is likely to be a certain loss of strength of the affected side, but the principal danger lies in the complications that may result from chronic pleurisy, which exists in this man\u2019s case,\u2019 and that such complication \u2018is liable to occur; it may and may not,\u2019 as such testimony is conjectural and speculative; there being no reasonable certainty that the anticipated consequences will result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">In that case the Strohm Case was referred to and relied upon, the court holding that it is not proper to testify as to consequences which \u201care likely to develop.\u201d While the term \u201clikely\u201d has in it to a certain extent an element of probability, it thus seems to have been held that it is not strong enough to make proper evidence facts which are likely to occur. The holding seems to be that there should be a stronger indication of a probability to a reasonable degree of certainty before a jury could be authorized to award damages therefor. For this error the judgment must be reversed. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>is unnecessary, therefore, to examine the other errors charged to have been made upon the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Judgment.and order reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur, except PARKER, P. J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
