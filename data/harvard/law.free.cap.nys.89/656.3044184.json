It appears from the petition that one Berthold A. Reiss, now deceased, was appointed receiver of the John Good Cordage &amp; Machine Company on the 15th day of July, 1897, and that he retained as his attorneys the appellants in this proceeding. On the 9th day of January, 1897, the said cordage company had made, executed, and delivered to the Kings County Trust Company of Brooklyn, as trustee, a mortgage or deed of trust for the sum of $300,000, covering its-properties in Kings and Queens counties, and bonds aggregating $106,-000 had been issued and disposed of to Frank &amp; J. G. Jenkins, a corporation, under the provisions of this trust deed. The latter corporation, upon the refusal of the Kings County Trust Company to act, brought an action for the foreclosure of the mortgage; and Mr. Reiss, as receiver, under advice of his attorneys, defended the action, alleging the fraudulent character of the mortgage, and the litigation resulted in the court holding that the same was fraudulent and void as against the receiver and judgment creditors. Jenkins v. John Good Cordage &amp; Machine Co., 56 App. Div. 573, 68 N. Y. Supp. 239; Id., 168 N. Y. 679, 61 N. E. 1130. In the foreclosure action, James J. Phelan and David H. McAlpin, as judgment creditors, whose rights in the cordage company\u2019s property had become vested, were made parties, and appeared by their attorneys throughout the litigation, and, so far as appears from the record, were as instrumental in bringing about the results as the attorneys for the receiver. Messrs. Wallach and Cook, attorneys for the receiver, now move for an allowance of $15,000 for services\u2014this sum to be paid out of the property of the cordage company ahead of the judgment creditors\u2014upon the theory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>that they have rescued this property and made it available for the payment of these claims. That is, parties who have appeared in a litigation by their own attorneys, and who have advised and consulted with the attorneys for the receiver\u2014as much to his advantage as their own, in all probability\u2014are to be deprived of their property, to' the extent of thousands of dollars, to compensate the attorneys for the receiver, upon the theory that it was by reason of the receiver\u2019s defense, through his attorneys, that the property was saved from the lien of the $300,-000 mortgage. No precedent appears in the books, so far as we are able to discover, for such an allowance. The judgment creditors, on being made parties to the foreclosure action, had a vested right in the property of the cordage company. They had rights prior to those of the receiver, who took only the property of the cordage company subject to the existing liens upon it. The trust mortgage being fraudulent, that defense was open to the judgment creditors equally with the receiver. There is no presumption that the attorneys for the judgment creditors were incapable of asserting this defense, or that they would not have been able to maintain the litigation if the receiver had not appeared at all. It is rather extraordinary that.the receiver\u2019s counsel should feel that they were entitled to compensation for rescuing this property, when both of the judgment creditors were represented in the litigation, and presumptively discharged all of the duties of attorneys in such cases. The judgment creditor\u2019s attorneys might with equal propriety claim a right to compensation for saving a portion of the property to the receiver, for it does not appear that the receiver did not have the benefit of the counsel of the judgment creditors quite as much as the latter had the benefit of the counsel of the receiver. The truth is that the defense was equally available to the receiver and the judgment creditors, and they equally availed themselves of the defense, and, their interests being the same, they acted together. They both succeeded, and the rights of the judgment creditors cannot be taken from them by a proceeding in the nature of that now before us. The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
