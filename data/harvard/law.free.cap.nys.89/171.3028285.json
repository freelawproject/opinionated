The order should be modified by requiring the defendant to state between what dates he suffered loss of profits by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s acts, and the aggregate amount thereof; \"and, as sq modified, the order should be affirmed, without costs to either party in this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
