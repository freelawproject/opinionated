There is no provision in the agreement, other than those set forth, that has any bearing upon the subject, and hence the determination of the question depends upon a decision whether such coal is within the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>pression \u201clabor and tools,\u201d which the plaintiff is to furnish, or within \u25a0\u201cproper and suitable material,\u201d which the defendants are to provide. As between the two, I am clear that the engine falls within the purview of labor and tools. The plaintiff was to do the work, but the instrumentalities thereof are not specified. The engine belongs to him, and is used by him in the work, which is labor. Power must be supplied to it, that it may do the work, and coal supplies this power. If the plaintiff furnished the man who dug with the spade, he would furnish labor. The principle is the same if he furnishes the power that works the engine. A tool is a mechanical implement\u2014any implement used by a craftsman or laborer at his work. Cent. Diet. It is not required to give to the word a strict technical meaning in this instance. Coal is certainly not a material, within the meaning of the phrase in this agreement. Of course, it is material as distinguished of matter. It is physical, not spiritual. The material referred to in the agreement is that of which the \u201csheeting, bracing, bridging, foundation planking,\u201d and the like may be made. As between the two clauses, I have no hesitation in assigning coal to \u201clabor and tools,\u201d rather than to the material.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The learned counsel for the appellant insists that he was entitled to offer parol evidence. The plaintiff was not permitted to state whether, in figuring on the price or in naming the price, he took expense of coal intoi consideration. But there is no reason why he should have testified to his mental processes. He was permitted to testify that\" he asked one of the defendants, \u201cWhat do you want me to figure on?\u201d and that Mr. Holmes replied, \u201cI only want you to figure on supplying the labor and tools, and we will supply all the materials along the job.\u201d It seems to me that the appellant obtained all that he was entitled to. When we examine this testimony, it is nothing more than a reiteration of the terms of the contract itself, and throws no light whatever upon the written words. It is not a question of what the plaintiff, apart, thought, or, apart, took or did not take into consideration, but what the parties agreed upon when their minds met in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">There seems to have been a practical construction of the contract. The plaintiff testifies that subsequent <em>to the </em>signing of the contract he had no conversation in reference to the defendants paying for coal; that he did not bring up the question whether Mr. Holmes should pay him for the coal, but that, after the lapse of some months, he said to the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">\u201c \u2018Mr. Holmes, under this contract, I do not see why I should pay for coal.\u2019 And Mr. Holmes replied: \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know. I should think you ought to.\u2019 I said: \u2018I don\u2019t know, you see, how I am getting out of the contract, and therefore I think I ought not to pay for coal.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">The plaintiff had bought and paid for the coal without question or demur for some months, and it would seem that his protest was due to the discovery that the contract was not as profitable as he had expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">I think that the judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
