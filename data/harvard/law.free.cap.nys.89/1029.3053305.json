When the action is ex delicto, the plaintiff may waive the tort and sue in assumpsit (Slade v. Montgomery, 53 App. Div. 343, 345, 65 N. Y. Supp. 709, citing Rothschild v. Mack, 115 N. Y. 1, 21 N. E. 726); but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>the plaintiff who has elected to sue in tort cannot recover in assumpsit. \u201cThe principle still remains that the judgment to be rendered by any court must be secundum allegata et probata.\u201d Neudecker v. Kohl-berg, 81 N. Y. 296, 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">The plaintiff clearly elected to sue in tort, but the recovery was upon the ground of an implied contract. His counsel says: \u201cThe court, exercising its discretion, evidently considering a quantum meruit, allowed a total damage of ($100) one hundred dollars.\u201d Counsel for defendant pointed out the error in his motion to dismiss the complaint at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, and again at the close of the entire case, and duly excepted to the denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-6\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-7\">Judgment of the Municipal Court reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to abide the event.\" All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
