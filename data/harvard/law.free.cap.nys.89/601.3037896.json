Orazio Gegliardi was a resident of the city of Yonkers. Stromberg brought an action against Gegliardi before a justice of the peace in the city of Mt., Vernon. The justice rendered judgment against Gegliardi and issued an execution against his person, upon which Gegliardi was committed to the county jail of Westchester county. The county judge, upon a writ of habeas corpus, has discharged Gegliardi from imprisonment under this execution; and Stromberg, the plaintiff in the execution, has appealed. The sheriff of Westchester county and the warden of the county jail have joined in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">Section 53 of the' charter of the city of Mt. Vernon provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-10\">\u201cThe justices of the peace elected under the provisions of this act shall have all the powers and jurisdiction, discharge the duties of and be entitled to the fees and compensation of justices of the peace of the several towns in this state.\u201d Laws 1892, c. 182.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">Section 230 of the same chapter contains the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-12\">\u201cThe city, except as is otherwise in this act provided, is hereby created and declared to be one of the towns of Westchester county, and all provisions of law not inconsistent with this act, applicable to towns in the county of Westchester, shall apply to said city.\u201d Laws 1892, c. 182.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-13\">The effect of these two provisions is to leave the city of Mt. Vernon still a town, so far as the jurisdiction of its justices of the peace is concerned, so that that jurisdiction remained subject to regulation by any general legislation which might be enacted regarding the jurisdiction of justices of th\u00e9 peace in towns.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-14\">Section 2869 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which relates tb localities in which actions in justices\u2019 courts are cognizable, provides that such action must be brought before a justice of a town or city wherein one of the parties resides, or a justice of an adjoining town or city in the same county, with certain exceptions, which are specified in five succeeding subdivisions. Subdivision 5 of this section, in the form in which it was in force on July 20, 1903, when this habeas corpus proceeding was decided, provided that in any town adjoining an incorporated city\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-15\">\u201cNo justice of such town shall have jurisdiction of any action brought by or against a resident of such adjoining city, unless at least one of the parties to the action is a resident of such town.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>For the purposes of the case at bar, as has already been pointed out, the city of Mt. Vernon was to be regarded as a town adjoining the incorporated city of New York. The suit in the justice\u2019s court was brought by Stromberg, a resident of such adjoining city. To give the justice jurisdiction under the subdivision quoted, it was essential, therefore, that the defendant should be a resident of Mt. Vernon. He was in fact, however, a resident of Yonkers. This deprived the justice of the peace in Mt. Vernon of any power to entertain jurisdiction of Stromberg\u2019s suit against him. The body execution was therefore issued without authority, and the county judge committed no error in discharging the prisoner held under it. See Dodd v. Ecker, 24 App. Div. 613, 48 N. Y. Supp. 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
