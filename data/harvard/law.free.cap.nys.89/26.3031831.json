Certain issues of fact raised by the pleadings were tried before a jury, where a verdict was rendered in favor of the plaintiff and the respondent Van Winkle. Subsequently the case came on for trial at Special Term, where a judgment was rendered sustaining the claim of the plaintiff and the respondent Van Winkle, and adjudging that the appellants do not own and'have no interest in said tract. The appeal is from that judgment, and involves also a review of the trial had before the jury, and an order denying a motion for a new trial.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Argued before HATCH, McLAUGHLIN, PATTERSON, O\u2019BRIEN, and LAUGHLIN, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-5\">James A.

In 1785, Apthorpe mortgaged all of his land lying east of the Bloomingdale Road to the Marine Society of the City of New York for $2,500, which at the time of his death (May, 1797) remained unpaid. He died intestate, leaving him surviving nine children (among whom were two daughters, Ann and Charlotte, the latter having married John C. Vandenheuvel), and two grandchildren, the issue of a deceased daughter, who had married Hugh Williamson. Subsequent to the death of Apthorpe, the Marine Society commenced an action to foreclose its mortgage, to which the administrator of Apthorpe\u2019s estate, and Hugh Williamson, as guardian of the two grandchildren, were made parties. The action resulted in a sale of the l\u00e1nd covered by the mortgage by the sheriff of the county of New York, at which Williamson became the purchaser, paying therefor $51,000. After deducting the amount due upon the mortgage, together with the costs and expenses of the sale, the balance was paid to the administrator, and by him distributed among those entitled thereto. In pursuance of the sale, the sheriff, on the 23d of April, 1799, delivered to Williamson a deed, absolute in form, of the entire tract sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">It is contended by the appellants that the record title to the land in question became vested in Williamson under this deed, but they assert he purchased it as trustee or agent of the Apthorpe heirs, and, in subsequently dealing with it, acted in the same capacity. Upon this issue and another raised by the pleadings a jury trial was had, at the conclusion of which the court directed a verdict that Williamson, in making the purchase, did not act as the agent or trustee of the Apthorpe heirs, nor did he, in subsequently disposing of the land purchased, or any part of it, do so for their benefit. An exception was taken to the ruling, and this is one of the questions sought to be reviewed on the appeal. The conclusion at which we have arrived renders it unnecessary to determine whether the exception was well taken, because if it be assumed that it were, and that Williamson did in fact-take title as the representative of or agent for the Apthorpe heirs, it does not aid the apoellants, and therefore they could not have been injured by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>This brings us to the consideration of the real question in the case, and that is whether the plaintiff and the respondent Van Winkle have, as the trial court held, acquired by mesne conveyances the title to the parcel in question. The fact is not disputed that in May, 1801, a map was made b'y Benjamin Taylor, similar to the one set out in the statement preceding this opinion, of the lands of which Charles Ward Apthorpe died seised, and that conveyances thereafter made of said land, either by Williamson or the Apthorpe heirs, were with reference thereto. Nor do we think it can be seriously disputed that the plaintiff and the respondent Van Winkle have acquired in the parcel in question whatever interest Charlotte Vandenheuvel had as the owner of lot 6, Ann Aptliorpe as the owner of lot 8, and the Jaunceys as owners of the lot sold to them. Each of said lots is designated on the Taylor map referred to; If, therefore, Charlotte Vandenheuvel, Ann Apthorpe, and the Jaunceys acquired title to the parcel in question by virtue of the conveyance to them of their respective lots, the plaintiff and the respondent Van Winkle now have such title, because the subsequent conveyances were sufficient to place in them whatever title the original parties had.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The first conveyance in point of time is the one to the Jaunceys. It bears date the 1st of August, 1799. The grantors therein named are Hugh Williamson and all of the heirs of Charles W. Apthorpe, except one, whose interest had apparently been acquired by one of the others. The land conveyed is described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">\u201cBeginning at the corner of a field at the junction of Bloomingdale <em>Road </em>with a cross road that leads to Harlem; thence running along the Bloomingdale Road south- * * *; then east; * * * then north * * *; then east; * * *; then north ss * *; then west to the beginning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">In this conveyance a covenant is inserted to the effect-that* each grantor is the owner of an undivided one tenth part, except one, who is the owner of two undivided tenth parts, having apparently acquired one tenth from one of the other Apthorpe heirs; and a further covenant\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">\u201cThat they, the said parties of the first part, are respectively seized in the parts or \"proportions hereinabove particularly specified of a sure, absolute and. indefeasible estate of inheritance in fee simple of, in and to the said tract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">This covenant unquestionably estopped all of the grantors, and all persons claiming under them, from thereafter claiming that their respective interests were not as therein \"stated. The general rule is that a recital in a deed of a material fact is binding and conclusive upon the- parties, and those claiming under them as privies in blood, in estate, or in law. Demeyer v. Legg, 18 Barb. 14; Jackson v. Parkhurst, 9 Wend. 209; 24 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. of Law (2d Ed.) 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">The other two conveyances, one to Charlotte Vandenheuvel and the other to Ann Apthorpe, bear date the 30th of November, 1802. In the former, the land conveyed is lot 6 on the Taylor map, and described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-11\">\u201cBeginning at a stake by the fence on the Cross Road leading to Harlem, * * *; thence * * * north * * * to lot number five; thence, along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>the southern boundary of lot number five * * * to the eastern boundary of lot number four ; thence by lot number four south * * * to the public road; then * * * east along the road * * * to the place of beginning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">The grantors were Williamson and all the Apthorpe heirs, except Charlotte, and one other who had apparently died without issue. In the latter the land conveyed is lot 8 on said map, and described as follows;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">\u201cBeginning at a stake by the fence on the public Cross Road, the corner of Mr. Jauncey\u2019s land; thence running south * * *; thence * *\u25a0 * west; thence south * * * along Mr. Jauncey\u2019s land; then * * * east * * * to a stake * * * the corner of lot number seven; thence north * * * to the public road; then * * * west along the public road * * * to the place of beginning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">The grantors are the same as in the conveyance to Charlotte, with the exception of Ann, who took Charlotte\u2019s place.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">It will be observed that in none of the descriptions is the starting point or boundary of the land conveyed \u201con the side\u201d of the lane, and, therefore, even an inference that the grantors intended to exclude the fee therein is not justified. When land is described as running to and thence along a highway, the boundary of the land conveyed\u2014the grantor owning the fee of the roadbed\u2014is the center. This is the general rule. Matter of Ladue, 118 N. Y. 213, 23 N. E. 465; Matter of the Mayor, 20 App. Div. 404, 46 N. Y. Supp. 832, affirmed in 155 N. Y. 638, 49 N. E. 1100. There is a legal presumption against a grantor who owns the fee of a highway on which the land conveyed abuts intending to reserve such fee to himself (Holloway v. Southmayd, 139 N. Y. 400, 34 N. E. 1047, 1052), and such presumption is only overcome by express words which show an intent to exclude the highway from the subject-matter of the grant (Potter v. Boyce, 73 App. Div. 383, 77 N. Y. Supp. 24, affirmed in 176 N. Y. 551, 68 N. E. 1123). There are no words in any of the conveyances sufficient to overcome the presumption referred to. Not only this, but there are recitals in the conveyances to Charlotte and Ann which, as it seems to us, conclusively establish an intent on the part of the grantors in each of the deeds to convey to the center of the lane. The recitals are;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-10\">\u201cWhereas the said parties * *- * are the proprietors as tenants in common of ail the real estate whereof Charles Ward Apthorpe * 15 * died seized * * * And Whereas the said parties * * * as proprietors of the said real estate did, in virtue of a written agreement bearing date the ninth day of May in the year one thousand eight hundred and one, proceed to make partition of the said real estate amongst themselves, And Whereas, upon such partition, the lot of land hereinafter particularly described fell to the share of the party of the second part:\u2014Now, Therefore, this Indenture Witnesseth, that in order to carry the said partition into effect, * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">This recital not only strengthens the presumption above alluded to, but, we think, establishes an intent to convey to the center of the lane. All of the land had been divided; the part included in the lane was not reserved; hence it must follow that it was intended to be included in the respective conveyances of lots abutting thereon. The conclusion thus reached renders it unnecessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>take into consideration the deed from Williamson to Charlotte Vandenheuvel dated November 16, 1802.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Other errors are alleged, but after an examination they do not seem to be of sufficient importance to be here considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur, except O\u2019BRIEN, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b58-6\">O\u2019BRIEN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac4\">I dissent, and think that under the authorities the deeds in question cannot be said to convey to the center of the lane; that the descriptions of the deeds expressly limit the boundary to the side of the road; and that the surrounding circumstances show that in the partition the parties purposed to reserve to themselves the fee of the cross-road or lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The prevailing opinion concedes the rule of law that, where a deed states that the starting point or boundary of the land conveyed is \u201con the side\u201d of a road, the inference that the grantors intended to exclude the fee thereof is justified. Thus in Kings County Fire Ins. Co. v. Stevens, 87 N. Y. 287, 41 Am. Rep. 361, it was said (page 292, 87 N. Y., 41 Am. Rep. 361) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">\u201cIn the case before us the starting point of the description is on the southerly side of the Wallabout Bridge Bead, and the exact point of beginning is fixed by the reference to the lands of Skillman. The other lines are described by courses and distances, and the third course gives the length of that line in feet to the road, which we think fairly imports that the measurement is to'the side of the'road; and the fourth course is along the road, etc., to the place of beginning. We think the roadbed was excluded by the terms of the description, within the cases of Jackson v. Hathaway, 15 Johns. 447 [8 Am. Dec. 263]; English v. Brennan, 60 N. Y. 609; White\u2019s Bank of Buffalo v. Nichols, 64 N. Y. 65. In Jackson v. Hathaway the description was, \u2018Beginning at a certain stake by the side of the road * . * *.\u2019 In English v. Brennan the description was, \u2018Beginning at the southwesterly corner of Flushing and Clermont avenues * * *.\u2019 In White\u2019s Bank, etc., v. Nichols, * * * the grant * * * describes the granted premises as commencing at \u2018the intersection of the exterior lines of two streets * * In the Nichols Case the court said: \u2018The point thus established is as controlling as any monument would have been, and must control the other parts of the description ; all the lines of the granted premises must conform to the starting point thus designated.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">When we examine the descriptions in the deeds under consideration, we find that each refers to a definite point which is by the side of the road. Thus in the conveyance to Charlotte Vandenheuvel, the words are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-11\">\u201cBeginning at a stake by the fence on the cross road leading to Harlem fifty links from the southeast corner of the fence, thence running north * * * parallel to the boundary fence to lot No. 5; thence * * * to the eastern boundary of lot No. 4; thence * * * south ten chains sixty links to the public road; then * * * along the road * * * to the place of beginning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-13\">This description is almost identical with that stated in the Stevens Case, supra, for, although there the words used are, \u201cbeginning at a point on the southerly side of the Wallabout Bridge Road,\u201d'and thus the side of the road is mentioned, here the point is \u201cby the fence on the cross road,\u201d which fixes it none the less definitely on the side of the road. Here, as there, the third course is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>a measured distance \u201cto the public road,\u201d and the fourth \u201calong the road * * * to the place of beginning.\u201d It follows that the deed did not in terms convey to' the center of the lane, but that the north half of the roadway was, by the description of the deed, expressly excluded, and hence the fee thereto did not pass to Charlotte Vandenheuvel. The plaintiff, therefore, acquired no title to the northern half of the property here in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The descriptions in the two deeds conveying land on the south side of the road are equally explicit in excluding the roadbed. The land conveyed to Ann Apthorpe is described as \u201cbeginning at a stake by the fence on the public cross road, the corner of Mr. Jauncey\u2019s land, thence running south,\u201d and, finally, \u201cto the public road, then * * * west along the public road * * * to the place of beginning.\u201d This deed not only shows the starting point of this land to have been on the side of the road, but it fixes \u201cthe corner of Mr. Jauncey\u2019s land\u201d also at the stake by the side of the road, so that the following description in the Jauncey deed is made clear and certain :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">\u201cBeginning at the corner of a field at the junction of the Bioomingdaie Road with a cross road * * * thence running along the Bioomingdaie Road south ,s * * then east * * * then north * * * then east * * * then north eight chains ninety-two links, then * * * to the beginning.\u2019.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Evidently the \u201ceight chains ninety-two links\u201d terminated at the \u201cstake by the fence on the public cross road\u201d mentioned in the Ann Apthorpe deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">In Holloway v. Delano, 139 N. Y. 413, 34 N. E. 1052, this Jauncey deed was under consideration with respect to rights acquired in the Bioomingdaie Road thereunder, and Judge Gray, writing the' opinion, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-11\">\u201cWe are inclined to the view that the descriptive monuments or starting points for the boundary line cannot be fixed in the center of the Bloomingdale Road without straining too much the language used.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">The case was decided, however, upon other grounds. The court was divided four to three, and one of those who concurred was of the opinion that title to the center of Bioomingdaie Road passed under the deed. In that case, however, the Jauncey deed with respect to the Bioomingdaie Road-was not as clear in its meaning as it is with respect to the cross-road or lane, when examined in the light of the Ann Apthorpe deed. As said in Potter v. Boyce, 73 App. Div. 383, 77 N. Y. Supp. 24, affirmed in 176 N. Y. 551, 68 N. E. 1123:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-13\">\u201cWhether or not the fee of an adjacent street passes by a conveyance of abutting property is a question of intention, and the courts are justified in looking at the situation of the property and' the cotemporaneous acts of the parties, including the conveyances they have made of adjoining property, as well as the description contained in the conveyance in question, to determine the intention of the parties making the conveyance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-14\">With respect to the general situation as showing intention, the map in the statement which precedes the prevailing opinion is suggestive in showing that the parties to the partition purposed to reserve to themselves the fee of the cross-road or lane. Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>r\u00e9citals in the conveyances state the intention to distribute all the estate, the location of the lots was such that there was an object jn retaining .the fee of the roadbed,'and evidently the intention was to distribute all save that included therein. It will be seen from the map that, in addition to the lots of land herein directly involved which were conveyed in the partition to the Jaunceys, to Ann Apthorpe (No. 8), and to Charlotte Vandenheuvel (No. 6), there were other lots, numbered 2, 3, 4, and 5, conveyed respectively to Charles, James, Rebecca, and Eliza Apthorpe, and that lots 2, 3, and 4 abut on the cross-road or lane, whereas lot No. 5, belonging to Eliza Apthorpe, is north of lot No. 6, belonging to Charlotte Vandenheuvel. The map shows a road leading from Eliza Apthorpe\u2019s lot past the Vandenheuvel lot to the cross-road or lane, and this road or way, forming a means of access to the lane, was provided for in the deed to Charlotte Vandenheuvel.; It was essential to Eliza' Apthorpe that this right of way should be preserved, and to the other lot owners also it was important that the cross-road should remain always unobstructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">In view, therefore, of the general situation and the location of the lots, the map in evidence, and the descriptions in each of the deeds, which refer to the side and not to the center of the road, I think that the fee of the lane did not pass under the conveyances, and hence that the plaintiff has no title to the property in dispute. From this conclusion, however, it does not follow that the defendants have title to the land. That question would turn upon whether the heirs-of Williamson or the heirs of Apthorpe were the owners. This depends upon whether Williamson,-when he gave the deeds, held title in his own name or as trustee. The trial court directed the jury to find that he was not the agent or trustee of the heirs of Apthorpe; but in view of all the evidence presented on the other side, there .was, I think, in any event, a question of fact which the jury should decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">For the reasons stated, I dissent, and am in favor of reversal of the judgment and a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
