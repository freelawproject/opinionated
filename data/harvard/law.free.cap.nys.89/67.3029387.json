He recovered a small verdict. The only error assigned against his judgment and argued upon this appeal is that his action, was not maintainable in the absence of actual notice to the city of Rochester or its officials of the existence of the alleged defects. It is not claimed that any actual notice thereof was given before the accident, and it is conceded that originally defendant\u2019s charter, (section 218, c. 14, p. 76, Laws 1880) required such notice. The learned trial justice, however, held, and upon this appeal it is argued by respondent, that the White charter for cities of the second class (section 461, c. 182, p. 438, Laws 1898, as amended by chapter 581, p. 1290, Laws 1899) dispensed with the necessity for this, actual notice, and allowed such an action as this to be maintained where the defect complained of had existed for such a length of time that the same should have been discovered and remedied in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"ATB\">Argued before McLENNAN, P.

By the provision under discussion it intended' to make a uniform regulation as to notice of defective conditions. It, by the saving clause, used the words \u201cother requirement or statute of limitations,\u201d and it may be well said that by that was meant other requirement than notice as to conditions or statute of limitations. Reading in this light, it would seem that the old provision of the charter, which required actual notice, was abrogated by.the statute; and this would seem to be a reasonable construction of the statute. Having in mind the idea of uniformity in regulations with reference to municipalities, it is not unreasonable, I think, to say that the Legislature intended to have uniformity of notice as to defects in sidewalks, but did not intend to do away with other features' of the law which did not affect the notice, either actual or constructive, as to defective conditions. This does not conflict with that provision which requires that the provisions of the charter shall be an-additional requirement to those already furnished. To say that .either actual or constructive notice was in addition to the requirement of a statute which required that actual notice must be given before a liability can be incurred, would render that provision of no effect; whereas to say that wherever there was ah.additional requirement beyond the notice, which was still left in force, so far as the notice of defective conditions is concerned, the provisions of the White charter are not inconsistent. To reiterate: If there were only conditions in previous legislation as to defective conditions, that legislation was merged and repealed by the enactment of the White charter. If, in addition to defective conditions, there was some other special requisite of the charter that was still left unrepealed, leaving the provisions of .the White charter applicable to all municipalities, and in addition thereto any such municipalities as had special legislation which was not legislated upon, such special legislation was not affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.
