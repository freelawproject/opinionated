Notices of trial are no part of the judgment roll, and whenever included therein, and complaint is made, they should be stricken out. Dexter v. Dustin, 70 Hun, 515, 24 N. Y. Supp. 129. Section 1237 of the Code provides what papers shall constitute the judgment roll, and the notices of trial are not among the papers specified. If the respondents deem it of importance that the notices of trial should be printed in the case on appeal, then, unless the appellant includes them in his proposed case, the respondents can ask, by way of a proposed amendment thereto, that they be included therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-16\">The order appealed from, therefore, must be reversed, with $10 costs . and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
