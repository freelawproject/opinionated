This, under the provisions of section 18 of the labor law (chapter 415, p. 467, Laws 1897), makes a prima facie case of negligence on the part of the defendants, and we think the granting of a motion to dismiss was error. The duty of the master, under the provisions of the labor law, is to use reasonable care to fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>nish safe appliances. It is a duty which the master cannot delegate, and, when a ladder, scaffold, or other appliance mentioned in the statute breaks while in use for the purposes for which it was designed, it raises a presumption of negligence, which, unexplained, justifies a recovery. Stewart v. Ferguson, 52 App. Div. 317, 318, 65 N. Y. Supp. 149, and authorities there cited; s. c., 164 N. Y. 553, 58 N. E. 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The judgment appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
