Accordingly, we have directed the Clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties of this fact in writing. <em>See </em>Huth v. Southern Pacific Co., 5 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 526; Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804; 5 Cir.R. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-23\">Douglas Onick pleaded guilty to charges of possessing and selling heroin and marihuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4705(a) and 4744(a). He was sentenced on November 16, 1961, to three terms of twenty years and one term of ten years, all to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-24\">In this motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, he contends that his guilty pleas were not voluntarily and understandingly made because the trial court failed to inform him that his sentence would not be subject to parole. The district court denied relief on the authority of Trujillo v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 377 F.2d 266, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 899, 88 S.Ct. 224, 19 L.Ed.2d 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number> In <em>Trujillo, </em>we held that Fed. R.Crim.P. Rule 11 does not require that the defendant be informed of his ineligibility for parole before a guilty plea can be accepted. We reaffirmed that holding in Sanchez v. United States, 5 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 494. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
