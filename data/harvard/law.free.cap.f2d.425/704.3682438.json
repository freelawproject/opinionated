His nephew, O\u2019Neill, while riding as a passenger on a motorcycle being operated by Bolen\u2019s son, was injured when the motorcycle collided with an uninsured automobile. Insurance Company brought an action for declaratory judgment seeking a determination of its liability to O\u2019Neill. In a non-jury trial, the District Court found that there was no coverage because, although O\u2019Neill was a relation, he was not a resident in the same household of Bolen. We agree and affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The facts were stipulated. The only dispute concerns the correct interpretation of the Uninsured Motorists Coverage provisions. In pertinent part they provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-7\">The definitions under Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability Coverage, except the definition of \u201cInsured\u201d apply to Uninsured Motorists Coverage, and under Uninsured Motorists Coverage:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">\u201cinsured\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-9\">(a) the named insured and any relative;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability Coverage defines relative as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-11\">\u2018relative\u2019 means a relative of the named <em>insured who is a resident of the same household; </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9W\">We agree with and adopt the District Court\u2019s conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-12\">[T]o accept the defendant\u2019s construction of the terms of the policy would require the Court to construe the controlling provisions in a manner lending itself to strained and absurd results. Paddock v. Bay Concrete Industries, Inc., 154 So.2d 313 (Fla.App. 1963); See Also, Motor Vehicle Casualty Co. v. Atlantic National Insurance Co., 374 F.2d 601 (5 Cir. 1967).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-13\">The term \u2018relative\u2019 as used in the \u2018Uninsured Motorists\u2019 section of the policy is, under the plain language of the policy, limited to relatives of the insured who are members of the same household. Only the definition of an \u2018insured\u2019 under the policy and no other definition is redefined specially for uninsured motorist coverage. The definition of the term \u2018relative\u2019 must be taken from the \u2018Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability Coverage\u2019 section. (District Court\u2019s paragraph numbering deleted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-15\">Any other construction of the policy would indeed lead to an absurd result \u201c[a]nd a Court ought always, we suppose, to hesitate a little bit at least before making a pronouncement that the parties <em>intended </em>a senseless result.\u201d Motor Vehicle Casualty Co. v. Atlantic National Insurance Co., supra, at 605.</p>\n<p id=\"A7Xq\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b767-23\">. Pursuant to our Rule 18 this case is decided without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
