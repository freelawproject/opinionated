Nall appeals from a directed verdict for Choctaw and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1359-11\"> The sole issue on appeal is the propriety of the directed verdict. Appellant\u2019s main contention is that the district court applied an incorrect standard in appraising the evidence pursuant to appellee\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While the district court misstated the standard in explaining to the jury what he had done, we think he correctly articulated the test and evaluated the evidence when ruling on the motion. The court repeatedly remarked that appellant presented no evidence \u2014 \u201cabsolutely none\u201d \u2014 of either negligence or unseaworthiness. On the basis of this evaluation of the evidence, the district court correctly entered a directed verdict for appellee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have carefully examined the record and find the rulings of the district court proper in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1359-12\">. Pursuant to Rule 18 of the Rules of this Court, we have concluded on the merits that this case is of such character as not to justify oral argument and have directed the clerk to place the ease on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties in writing. See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5th Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I; and Huth v. Southern Pacific Company, 5th Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 526, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1359-25\">. Appellant also contends that, \u201cThe court below erred when it held a dangerous condition and a defective appliance to be seaworthy simply because they were customary.\u201d The district court correctly found that there was no evidence of an emergency or dangerous condition, and no evidence of defective equipment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1359-26\">.
