The sole ground alleged was that he was \u201cfrightened and confused\u201d when the guilty plea was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-17\">The defendant correctly states that the prerequisite of \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d imposed by Rule 32(d) Fed.R.Cr. P. applies only to withdrawing a plea after sentence. But, as defendant acknowledges, withdrawal of a plea before sentencing is in the discretion of the trial court. Nothing that occurred in this case even remotely approached an abuse of discretion. Before accepting the plea the trial judge ascertained with the most meticulous and painstaking care that it was voluntarily entered and that defendant was fully aware of what he was doing. The District Judge complied fully with Rule 11, Fed.R.Cr.P. No contention is made that the plea was invalid, only that in the circumstances of its entry the court was guilty of abuse by not letting the valid plea be later withdrawn. We are unable to find any such abuse in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-26\">. Pursuant to our local Rule 18 we decide this case on the briefs and record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
