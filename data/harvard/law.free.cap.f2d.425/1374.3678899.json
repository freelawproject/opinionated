See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I; and Huth v. Southern Pacific Company, 5 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 526, Part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-21\">The sole question on this appeal is whether or not the trial court abused its discretion in denying motion for new trial on the ground that the right to new trial was waived by the appellant\u2019s failure to request a mistrial at the time it first learned of improper behavior at the trial by its opponent\u2019s executive officer, who was apparently flirting with a female member of the jury during the trial proceedings. The trial court ordered a recess and called the matter to the attention of all counsel. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel let the matter pass. This occurred near the end of the first day of trial. Similar offending behavior took place the following morning when the court again stopped the trial and brought the matter to the attention of all counsel. In addition the Deputy Marshal in charge of the trial noted and reported to counsel his observation of one of the male jurors winking at the defendant\u2019s officer late on the second day of the trial. At the completion of the trial the jury returned a verdict for the defendant-appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-22\">The trial court\u2019s well-articulated reasons for refusing to grant a new trial are set forth in its opinion reported at 48 F.R.D. 136. We agree therewith and affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
