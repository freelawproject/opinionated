The appellant, driving the machine, was apprehended in Mobile nineteen days later. The automobile obviously had been wrecked. A screw driver was in use as a key to the ignition. The tag was improper. Seales had no bill of sale. He explained that he had purchased the machine three or four months previously from a place in Atmore, Alabama. This place was later found to be non-existent.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-17\">At the trial, Seales testified that he had not been out of Alabama during the period July 14-August 18. Helen Hottle, alias Helen Seales, testified to like effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-18\">It is argued here that the evidence did not support the conviction and that the trial court erred in the denial of certain jury instructions requested by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-19\">No exceptions were taken at the conclusion of the charge, Rule 30, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-20\">Under an enormous swarm of prior decisions of this Court, the evidence was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-21\">The judgment of conviction, therefore, is</p>\n<p id=\"b331-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
