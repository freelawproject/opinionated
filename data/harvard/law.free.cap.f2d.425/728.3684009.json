The evidence fully supports the judge\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-28\">Lengthy portions of the prosecutor\u2019s oral argument are said to give rise to reversible error. Only one statement was objected to, and the objection to that was sustained. The remaining portions of the argument were only in the, most remote and strained sense expressions by the prosecutor of a personal opinion that appellant was guilty, and no objection was made thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-29\">We find no error, and the conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
