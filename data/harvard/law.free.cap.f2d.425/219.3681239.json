Holmes County Board of Education, 1969, 396 U.S. 19, 90 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed.2d 19; United States v. Hinds County School Board, 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 852; and Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School System (and consolidated cases en banc), 5 Cir., 1969, 419 F.2d 1211. We also called attention to the pendency of Carter v. West Feliciana Parish School Board, and the possibility of the Supreme Court requiring complete student desegregation by February 1, 1970. <em>Carter </em>has now been decided, 1970, 396 U.S. 290, 90 S.Ct. 608, 24 L.Ed.2d 477, and required complete student desegregation by February 1, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">The District Court has again considered the matter and has entered an order approving a freedom of choice plan in which only 44 black students are attending formerly all-white schools and 85 white students attend the formerly all-black T. J. Elder High School for Vocational Training though regularly enrolled in Washington County High; they attend T. J. Elder for only a half day every day. The Washington County \u00abSchool System has 5,270 pupils of which approximately two-thirds are black.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-15\">It is apparent that the plan approved by the District Court does not comply with Green v. County School Bd. of New Kent Co., Va., 1968, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716, and numerous decisions of this Court. <em>See, e. g., </em>Hall v. St. Helena Parish School Board, 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 801; United States v. Hinds County School Board, 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 852.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-17\">It is necessary, therefore, that we again reverse and remand this case \u201cwith directions that the District Court proceed promptly to consider the issues before it and to decide the case consistently with Alexander v. Holmes County Board.\u201d <em>See </em>Northcross v. Board of Education of the Memphis, Tennessee City Schools, 1970, 397 U.S. 232, 90 S.Ct. 891, 25 L.Ed. 246. <em>See also </em>Bivins v. Bibb County Board of Education and Thomie v. Houston County Board of Education, 5 Cir., 1970, 424 F.2d 97. It is pertinent to note that the School Board had proposed a new plan of desegregation, pursuant to our former decision, which plan was withdrawn, however, by the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>when the District Court approved the Bibb County and Houston County plans. The action we take here disposes of appellants\u2019 pending motion for summary reversal. Appellants\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
