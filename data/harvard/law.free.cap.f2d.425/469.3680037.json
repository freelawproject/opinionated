Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968). In a petition for rehearing, appellant contends that the doctrine of <em>Pickering </em>is applicable to the circumstances in this case and that it requires that our previous decision, upholding the legality of one of the grounds of discharge, be reversed. Although petitioner will not be given the relief he seeks, his petition for rehearing is granted and relief granted to the extent of ordering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>that the proceedings to be conducted on remand of his case be enlarged so that the issue of the implication of <em>Pickering </em>for appellant\u2019s case will be considered by the District Court and the Civil Service Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">We think it appropriate to state the reasons why we do not forthwith grant the relief requested by appellant'and why we think the implication of <em>Pickering </em>for appellant\u2019s case is a subject not free from difficulty and warrants further consideration on remand. We begin with the proposition, set forth in our <em>Meehan </em>opinion, that in view of the interests of the sovereign as employer, a Government employee does not necessarily have the same freedom of speech, without fear of discipline, that under the doctrine of <em>New York Times </em>belongs to a private person without fear of a defamation action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Pickermg </em>does not require repudiation of this statement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\"><em>Pickering </em>sets forth \u201cgeneral lines\u201d for \u201canalysis of the controlling interests.\u201d It holds that in the circumstances presented, involving a teacher\u2019s off-duty utterances on how a school system should allocate its resources, the employee is free of the fear of retaliatory dismissal for exercise of his right to speak at least to the extent that his remarks come within the zone of immunity created by the doctrine of New York Times v. Sullivan.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AqE5\">The Court\u2019s analysis of controlling interests brought out, however, certain aspects of Pickering\u2019s case which may distinguish it from Meehan\u2019s. The Court relied on the rule that public officials may comment on public matters even though their criticisms are directed at \u201cnominal superiors.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court noted, however, that some positions of public employment might involve special interests of confidentiality, loyalty, or maintenance of harmonious working relationships. Thus the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-10\">\u201cIt is possible to conceive of some positions in public employment in which the need for confidentiality is so great that even completely correct public statements might furnish a permissible ground for dismissal. Likewise, positions in public employment in which the relationship between superior and subordinate is of such a personal and intimate nature that certain forms of public criticism of the superior by the subordinate would seriously undermine the effectiveness of the working relationship between them can also be imagined. We intimate no views as to how we would resolve any specific instances of such situations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>but merely note that significantly different considerations would be involved in such cases.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Considerations very like the interests put to one side as inapplicable to <em>Pickering\u2019s </em>facts <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> were the core of the analysis of our <em>Meehan </em>opinion of April 18, affirming the legality of one of the grounds of discharge. Our opinion also recognized that there was a public interest in access to the views' of policeman Meehan,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a point that was a keystone in the <em>Pickering </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">We were confronted with a set of special circumstances, both a place, the Canal Zone, and a time, that were tense, and with a situation fraught with significant diplomatic overtones \u2014 circumstances which led the Governor to arrange a special conference and request confidential treatment for the plan he disclosed in advance. This was a context that established a special relationship between Meehan and the Governor. It is, indeed, worthy of note that Meehan\u2019s contention, that only American nationals should be eligible to serve as policemen, rested on the special considerations of security and need for loyalty applicable to employees in the police force of the Zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">It was in this context that we said, concerning what we noted was a defamatory lampoon of the Governor and his policies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">\u201cThis invective by a policeman, charged under the circumstances with special responsibility and requirements of discipline, against the official rank-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-12\">\u201cThe statements are in no way directed towards any person with whom appellant would normally be in contact in the course of his daily work as a teacher. Thus no question of maintaining either discipline by immediate superiors or harmony among coworkers is presented here. Appellant\u2019s employment relationships with the Board and, to a somewhat lesser extent, with the superintendent are not the kind of close working relationships for which it can persuasively be claimed that personal loyalty and confidence are necessary to their proper functioning.\u201d ing as chief of the force, is such a flouting of elemental loyalty to his employer and their common enterprise as to provide cause for discharge, except as the employee\u2019s acts may be necessary to preserve his own protected rights.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-16\">It is fair to say, then, that our opinion rests essentially on considerations put to one side in <em>Pickering. </em>It is likewise fair to say, however, that we did not set forth a basic point of departure, to cover the general case of government employees, in terms of the standard later enunciated in <em>Pickering. </em>Thus we referred to the <em>New York Times </em>doctrine as having full application to government employees making criticisms of superiors through channels.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We did not state that it also had application, in general, for government employees making appeals to the public. We said nothing to the contrary, it is true, yet we cannot blink at the significance of a difference in articulated approach. Often the disposition of a matter turns essentially on which aspect of a complex doctrine is considered to be the rule, and which the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-17\">A question arises as to the appropriate course. Our April 18 decision left open primarily a matter of agency discretion \u2014whether the penalty of discharge was appropriate where only one of the three alleged reasons for discharge could be sustained. We think it in the interest of justice to continue the order of remand, though with a change in the nature of remand to reflect the change in posture due to <em>Pickering. </em>To the extent that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>controversy remains, we think it appropriate for the Civil Service Commission, as the key agency concerned with evolution of standards for employees of the federal government, to give consideration in the first instance to the principles announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Pickering </em>and by this court and their sound application to a ease like Meehan\u2019s. Remand to the Civil Service Commission would permit introduction of additional evidence and argument on points that have a significance under <em>Pickering </em>that was previously only dimly discerned. Remand to the Commission would also permit an administrative disposition to settle this case, in effect, with the Commission making such arrangements as may be appropriate for further consideration and action by the Canal Zone Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion, including the framing of an order retaining jurisdiction of the complaint and staying proceedings pending further consideration by the Civil Service Commission.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">So qrdered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-13\">.

Meehan is now a resident of the District of Columbia and raises the point that he would face hardship if required to return to the Canal Zone for further proceedings. This is a legitimate concern that must be taken into account in the interest of justice. This court\u2019s order of remand contemplates further proceedings that are in the interest of justice \u2014 both in the District Court and at the administrative level. The nature of further proceedings at the administrative level must stay within the ambit of what is permitted by the District Court, which will retain jurisdiction over the complaint and merely stay court proceedings pending further administrative consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b534-6\">TAMM, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A8j\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">My position remains as I stated it as part of the original opinion issued by the court on April 18, 1968.
