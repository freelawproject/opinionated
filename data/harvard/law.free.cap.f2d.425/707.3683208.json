Tudela and Daniel Edmund Silvers were jointly convicted of conspiracy to import marijuana into the United States contrary to law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Silvers, individually, was convicted of violating the same statute. Tudela, individually, was convicted of transporting or concealing untaxpaid marijuana in violation of federal law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the decision in Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969), the joint conviction of Silvers and Tudela under the conspiracy count (Count III), and the individual conviction of Silvers for unlawful importation of marijuana (Count I) must be reversed and remanded and the conviction of Tudela for the unlawful transportation or concealment of marijuana (Count II) must be reversed and rendered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">After instructing the jury and excusing them to take exceptions from counsel, the court below recalled the jury and gave them one further instruction which consisted solely of a reading of the words of the \u00a7 176a statutory presumption which <em>Leary </em>expressly condemned. Thus the condemned presumption was not only used, but used under circumstances calculated to heighten its impact in the jury\u2019s mind. However, <em>Leary </em>condemned only the use of the invalid presumption in the trial process. It did not hold that \u00a7 176a was invalid per se. Counts I and III validly charge activity proscribed by law. This cause must be remanded as to both defendants for a retrial on these counts without the interjection of this presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-16\">Prior to trial, Tudela moved to dismiss the individual count (Count II) charging unlawful transportation or concealment of marijuana, on the grounds that rendering him liable for the transfer tax necessary to legitimize this action would violate his rights under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. This motion was denied. He clearly did not waive his protection against self-incrimination. The subsequent decision in <em>Leary </em>therefore invalidates his conviction and requires the dismissal of this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-17\">Silvers filed a formal motion for a severance which he first withdrew, then renewed on the day before the trial. The same was overruled. He now makes the point in this court that the failure to grant this last minute severance was error under Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). We disagree. Tudela took the stand in this case and was fully subject to cross-examination regarding any testimony which might implicate Silvers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>The defendants were represented by separate counsel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If on retrial, severance is again suggested, that motion will be committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Reversed and remanded as to Counts I and III; reversed and rendered as to Count II.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-12\">. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 176a (1961)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b770-13\">. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4744(a) (2) &amp; \u00a7 4741(a) (1967)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b770-14\">.
