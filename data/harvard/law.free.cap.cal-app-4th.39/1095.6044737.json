On remand, the trial court awarded the bulk of the original items, not as ordinary costs but as \u201clitigation expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">We hold the prevailing party in this case is not entitled to litigation expenses which represent high-powered computer support akin to paralegal services or document retrieval. We have also determined the issue is properly resolved by writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) filed suit against the State of California Department of General Services Office of Procurement (State) for terminating a contract with SAIC to develop a computer-aided dispatch system for the California Highway Patrol (CHP). The State in turn cross-complained. The jury found SAIC breached the contract and awarded over $1 million in damages to the State on its cross-complaint. The trial court gave the State another $150,052 in ordinary court costs,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> $1.2 million in attorney fees and $727,833 for a number of items referred to as \u201clitigation expenses\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> after trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">We affirmed the judgment on appeal but only in part. That is, we reversed the attorney fee award, rejecting the trial court\u2019s interpretation that paragraph 21 of the contract covered attorney fees incurred in defending a contract action between the State and its primary contractor. We further remanded the litigation expenses to the trial court to reconsider whether they were awarded under the authority of paragraph 21 (in which case they would be disallowed) or as costs otherwise allowable under Code of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> section 1033.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">On remand, the trial court assessed $464,908 in litigation expenses including all the items originally awarded except expert fees ($328,000).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The order explained that the use of video graphics (i.e., graphics communication system, technician and editing of videotaped depositions) reduced the trial time and was reasonable and necessary. The court added that graphic exhibit boards and laser disks are \u201cthe modem equivalent to models and blow-ups,\u201d the cost was reasonable and necessary, and using the materials saved trial time. Finally, the order stated: (1) $200,000 of the $402,462 requested for document control and database was reasonable and necessary; (2) the CHP video explained aspects of the dispatch system, expedited the trial and was used by SAIC; and (3) technician fees were an integral and necessary component of the graphics.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">SAIC filed a petition for writ of mandate requesting that we direct the trial court to vacate the award by writ. We issued an order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">As a preliminary matter, we address the propriety of writ review notwithstanding the existence of a clear remedy by appeal. It is well known that writ relief is deemed \u201cextraordinary.\u201d We deny the vast majority of petitions we see and we rarely explain why. In reality, perhaps the most fundamental reason for denying writ relief is the case is still with the trial court and there is a good likelihood purported error will be either mooted or cured by the time of judgment. As one court has summarized it: \u201c[I]f it were granted at the drop of a hat, [writ review] would interfere with an orderly administration of justice at the trial and appellate levels. . . . [&lt;]0 \u2018If the rule were otherwise, in every ordinary action a defendant whenever he chose could halt the proceeding in the trial court by applying for a writ... to stop the ordinary progress of that action toward a judgment until a reviewing tribunal passed upon an intermediate question that had arisen. If such were the rule, reviewing courts would in innumerable cases be converted from appellate courts to nisi prius tribunals []\u2019 . . . [and] []D would be trapped in an appellate gridlock. . . .\u201d <em>(Omaha Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 1266, 1272-1273 [258 Cal.Rptr. 66].)</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">None of those considerations applies here. We are not putting a halt to the \u201cordinary progress of the action\u201d toward judgment. The parties have had their day in court, obtained an appellate decision affirming the judgment except for attorney fees and litigation expenses, and received a final ruling from the trial court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">A rather complete list of the criteria relied upon for accepting writ review is set forth in <em>Omaha Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.3d at pages 1273-1274. The various reasons for granting extraordinary relief may be said, generally, to fall into two categories. The first category relies upon the public or jurisprudential significance of the issue presented. Writ relief is granted when the issue is of widespread interest; when conflicting trial court interpretations need resolution; when a novel or constitutional question is presented. The second category looks to the prejudice imposed upon the petitioning litigant, granting review because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>lower court\u2019s determination imposes unusually harsh and unfair results for which ordinary appellate review is inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Generally, the mere fact that appellate review will take much longer to resolve than writ review is not considered a basis for granting writ relief. It was once thought that orders pertaining to enforcement or other relief relating to an existing judgment should be entitled to writ review, to avoid unreasonable delay in effectuating an otherwise decided case. (See 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Extraordinary Writs, \u00a7 114, pp. 749-750.) This concept was rejected in <em>Phelan </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 363 [217 P.2d 951]. Of note, however, in the <em>Phelan </em>rationale, is that the court determined that the remedy by way of ordinary appeal was \u201calmost as speedy as a writ proceeding, under present practice.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 370.)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The court\u2019s observation in <em>Phelan </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>35 Cal.2d 363 is obviously a reflection of the status of jurisprudential administration as it existed in 1950, rather than a legal determination warranting stare decisis treatment. We need look no further than our present case to note the changing times. The trial in this case took place in 1992. Posttrial motions followed and a notice of appeal was filed, resulting in briefing which was not completed until August 1994. Our opinion resolving the appeal was filed in January 1995. The remand to the superior court resulted in a revised judgment awarding costs in June of this year. An appeal from this judgment, if promptly briefed, would find itself on our \u201cready\u201d list somewhere near the end of this year. Our present backlog of some 700 cases would then delay our work on the appeal until roughly mid-1997, with a final resolution, if fortunate and blocked by no untoward delays, near the end of the year 1997. On the other hand, our disposition of this seeming error by the trial court by writ review will be achieved, even with oral argument and supplemental briefing, in some four and a half months from the date of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">We presume to update the Supreme Court\u2019s factual observation about the time consequence of appellate versus writ review: appellate review these days, in consideration of our overly crowded dockets and generally understaffed Courts of Appeal, is unduly delayed, and cannot be compared to writ review in terms of time effectiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">This fact alone, of course, cannot be the basis for wholesale granting of writ review. As noted in <em>Omaha Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.3d at page 1273, the granting of priority to one case inevitably pushes back other cases waiting turn for disposition. Accordingly, we expect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>that our typical summary denial of writ review for orders as to which appellate review is (eventually) available, will continue to be standard policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">We perceive, however, that this case presents special reasons for granting accelerated review. The parties have \u201cstood in line\u201d in the appellate process through one complete turn. The case originally presented multiple and difficult issues; the remaining disputes are narrow. Further, they have already been briefed once and, to some extent, considered by us once. The present status of the case is that the trial judge and we disagree as to one posttrial issue. Should we in this state of affairs require that the parties engage in yet another multiyear process of appeal? We think that such a requirement would be inappropriate. When a piece of litigation has once journeyed the full and tiresome path of appellate review, gaining apparent resolution excepting only one postappellate trial court ruling, and that ruling is made erroneously, we believe the court of appeal should resolve the dangling issue promptly, using (as the only readily available measure) writ review to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Generally speaking, in our system of justice each party pays his own way. There are, however, exceptions. Among them is section 1032, subdivision (b), the statute which entitles the prevailing party to recover \u201ccosts\u201d in an action \u201cas a matter of right\u201d except as otherwise expressly provided. (\u00a7 1032, subd. (b).) Section 1033.5 specifies those items that qualify as recoverable \u201ccosts\u201d and identifies those that do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">Section 1033.5, subdivision (a) contains a long list of expenses which are allowable as costs. These include, among numerous other items, filing fees (\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (a)(1)); deposition transcripts (\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (a)(3)); and models, blowups of exhibits and copies of exhibits if reasonably helpful to the trier of fact (\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (a)(12)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">Section 1033.5, subdivision (b) identifies nonrecoverable expenses. There are only five in number:</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>\u2014fees of experts not ordered by the court (\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (b)(1));</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u2014transcripts of court proceedings not ordered by the court (\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (b)(5));</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\u2014investigation expenses in preparing for trial (\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (b)(2));</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\u2014postage, telephone, and copying charges except for exhibits (\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (b)(3)); and</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">\u2014costs for investigating jurors and preparing for voir dire (\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (b)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">The last part of the statute, subdivision (c), contains the rules which apply to all cost awards. Section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(2) states: \u201cAllowable costs shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.\u201d Section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(4) provides: \u201cItems not mentioned in this section and items assessed upon application may be allowed or denied in the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d Reading the two subparts of subdivision (c) together with the rest of the cost statute, we conclude, if an expense is neither expressly allowable under subdivision (a) nor expressly prohibited under subdivision (b), it may nevertheless be recovered if, in the court\u2019s discretion, it is \u201creasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.\u201d (\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (c)(2); see also <em>Ladas </em>v. <em>California State Auto. Assn. </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 810]; <em>Ripley </em>v. <em>Pappadopoulos </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1616, 1622, 1623 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 878]; <em>Winston Square Homeowner\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>Centex West, Inc. </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 282, 293 [261 Cal.Rptr. 605].)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">Thus, SAIC\u2019s primary complaint\u2014that the items represent costs of trial preparation and are not recoverable\u2014is beside the point. The statutory scheme clearly establishes two mutually exclusive sets of trial preparation expenses\u2014one set which is allowable as a matter of right (\u00a7\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (a) , 1032, subd. (b)) and one which is not (\u00a7\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (b), 1032, subd. (b) ). Expenses which do not fit into either of these two categories fall into a special statutory safety net: they may be recovered but only at the discretion of the court (\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">The expenses before us are not on the allowable list under section 1033.5, subdivision (a) or the excluded list under subdivision (b). There is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>$57,969 charge for graphic exhibit boards and another for $101,908 for a video to help the jury appreciate the difference between the manual and computer-assisted dispatch system for the CHP. There is a $200,000 expense for document control and database for internal case management provided by Logan Pearsall, Inc., during discovery and trial. Finally, there are three other items: (1) $47,481 for the production of laser disks \u201ccontaining\u201d trial exhibits; (2) a graphics communication system that cost $9,916 for the equipment rental and $11,983 for an on-site technician to facilitate the presentation of materials to the jury; and (3) $35,652 to have videotape depositions edited for effective presentation of the testimony to the jury. These expenses are the kind the Legislature probably never contemplated if for no other reason than the technology did not exist until recently.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">We cannot say on the record before us the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the recovery for the graphic exhibit boards\u2014board-sized trial exhibits which went to the jury for consideration in reaching a verdict. We take the same approach with the CHP video. Both these items appear to be a computerized form of blowup or model which was apparently, in the opinion of the trial court, reasonably helpful to the trier of fact and possibly fitting within the category of \u201cmodels and blowups.\u201d (\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (a)(12).) Although we endorse the CHP video with less enthusiasm than the exhibit boards because of associated costs of writing, directing and filming the video, we cannot rule it out on this basis alone because the same kind of \u201ccreative\u201d design and production expenses go into the final cost of professional charts and exhibits used in trial every day.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The balance of the items are, however, another matter. The document control and database charge, for example, represents the State\u2019s expenditure for an outside firm to keep track of the voluminous records in the case\u2014that is, to \u201cBates-stamp\u201d the documents, input them for retrieval, maintain a document library, create databases to search for records by date, author or subject, etc. The expense is the cost of hiring assistants to help counsel organize documents and access them in discovery and at trial\u2014in other words, the cost of a \u201chigh tech\u201d paralegal. Because we have concluded attorney fees are not compensable, we cannot condone payment of paralegal fees. The item is not recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">We take a similar approach with the laser disks and graphics communication system (equipment rental and technician). That is, as we understand it, although the State maintains the laser disks \u201ccontained\u201d trial exhibits, the word \u201ccontained\u201d more accurately refers to storage: documents and videos were stored on laser disks like hard copy is stored in a filing cabinet. As far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>as the graphics communication system is concerned, the equipment was rented and an on-site technician was on hand to present documentary evidence and graphic exhibits to the jury \u201cwithout interruption due to technical difficulties.\u201d Both items appear to be a method of accessing information\u2014a high-powered way of retrieving documents\u2014more than anything else. They are not recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Finally, the State spent over $35,652 to have the videotaped depositions edited for effective presentation of the testimony to the jury. If, however, the State had selected portions of the depositions to admit into evidence and presented them to the jury, as is normally done, with one lawyer reading the questions and another the answers into the record, the charge would not be recoverable. The fact that the State took a state-of-the-art approach to the testimony does not make it allowable. To the contrary, the existence of the alternative but mundane method of reading aloud strongly suggests the editing \u201cwas not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation,\u201d however \u201cconvenient or beneficial\u201d it may have been. (\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (c)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">In the final analysis, this case presents an unusual issue: how the court should deal with technological advances as costs. Considering the speed of technological evolution, it would be futile for the Legislature to try to keep pace in the compilation of statutory lists. Providing the trial court with discretion under section 1033.5, subdivision (c) in terms of allowance of new categories of costs is a way of opening a door that would otherwise more often than not be closed. However, the trial court must be mindful that costs have grown from the relatively modest amounts we see in early case law to staggering proportions today. If costs are routinely awarded for high-powered technology, most parties will be unable to litigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">A conclusory observation is appropriate. We are troubled by review of a case in which a party incurred over $2 million in expenses to engage in high-tech litigation resulting in recovery of only $1 million in damages. Perhaps it can be argued that a case such as this, involving high stakes on each side, requires advanced and costly litigation techniques and that the winner should \u201ctake all\u201d in terms of cost reimbursement. We simply do not subscribe to this philosophy. If a party litigant chooses unwisely to expend monies in trial presentation in excess of the value of the case, utilizing advanced methods of information storage, retrieval and display, when more conventional if less impressive methods are available, the party must stand his own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Let a writ of mandate issue directing the superior court to vacate its ruling of June 23, 1995, and enter an order consistent with this opinion. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>opinion is made final immediately as to this court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 24(d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Work, Acting P.
