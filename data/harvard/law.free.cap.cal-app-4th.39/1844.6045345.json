Havlicek, directors of respondent Coast-to-Coast Analytical Services, Inc. (CCAS), sought an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1849\">*1849</page-number>order from the superior court allowing them to inspect the books and records of CCAS. In addition, appellants unsuccessfully sought to enjoin a pending merger by CCAS until they had completed their inspection. Appellants contend they have an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to review all CCAS documents and are not required to explain or justify their inspection demands. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 1602.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">CCAS objected to the inspection on the theory that Delaware law applied because CCAS is a Delaware corporation. Pursuant to the Delaware statute, a director may review corporate documents only for \u201ca purpose reasonably related to his position as a directory\u201d and the Delaware Court of Chancery has exclusive jurisdiction to enforce inspection rights. (Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, \u00a7 220, subd. (d) (1995).) The trial court agreed with CCAS and denied appellants\u2019 request, stating that it lacked \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to order an inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">We conclude that the trial court erred in applying Delaware law and in refusing to grant appellants, at the very least, an \u201cinspection with just and proper conditions.\u201d (\u00a7 1603, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">CCAS is a Delaware corporation. When appellants filed their request in the superior court, CCAS maintained its principal executive office in Camarillo, California. Appellants are two of the five directors of CCAS and control 40 percent of its stock. They reside in California. The three remaining directors of CCAS are employees of respondent ISS International Service System, Inc. (ISS), which owns 60 percent of CCAS stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">Appellants allege that, on April 24, 1994, they were constructively terminated from their positions as officers and employees of CCAS. In early May, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1850\">*1850</page-number>CCAS announced plans to merge its assets with those of two other corporations to form Pace Incorporated. Appellants opposed the merger and demanded broad access to CCAS documents. Although CCAS allowed appellants to review certain documents, other documents were withheld because CCAS became suspicious that appellants would use them to establish a competing business.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">A majority of the CCAS directors approved the merger on June 6, 1994. Appellants voted against it and continued, unsuccessfully, to demand access to company documents. They filed this action on July 27, 1994, five days before the merger was scheduled to close. At the hearing on July 28, the trial court denied relief. On August 1, 1994, we also denied appellants\u2019 petition for writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">On August 3, 1994, CCAS merged with Pace. CCAS no longer maintains an office in California. Although it continues to exist as a corporation, its only assets are shares of stock in Pace. Pace, located in New York, now owns the documents appellants wish to inspect but CCAS has represented that they continue to exist and can be made available for inspection. The controversy is not over. Litigation between the parties is extant.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">\n<em>The Relocation of CCAS\u2019s Principal Office and Removal of the Documents From California Does Not Render This Action Moot.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">CCAS argues this appeal is moot because CCAS has transferred its documents and assets to Pace and no longer maintains an executive office in California. An action becomes moot when \u201c \u2018pending an appeal from the judgment of a lower court, and without any fault of the defendant, an event occurs which renders it impossible for this court, if it should decide the case in favor of plaintiff, to grant him any effectual relief whatever . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Finnie </em>v. <em>Town of Tiburon </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1, 10 [244 Cal.Rptr. 581].)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">The fact that CCAS has relocated and removed the documents from California is insufficient to render the action moot. Changed circumstances render a matter moot only when they occur \u201c \u2018without any fault of the defendant. . . .\u2019 \u201d (199 Cal.App.3d at p. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">CCAS is, of course, responsible for closing the California office and its moving of the documents out of state. We need not decide whether section 1603, subdivision (a) limits the right of a director to inspect \u201c. . . books and records kept in this state . . .\u201d or whether the \u201cin the state\u201d aspect of the statute applies only to court-appointed inspectors or accountants. Where, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1851\">*1851</page-number>here, the books and records are moved, section 1603 cannot be used as a shield to defeat inspection. This rule is but a variation of the equitable maxim, \u201c[n]o one can take advantage of his own wrong.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3517.) Moreover, an \u201c. . . appeal reviews the correctness of the judgment or order as of the time of its rendition . . . .\u201d <em>(Karrin </em>v. <em>Ocean-Air Mobile Home Estates </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 1066, 1070 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 581]; see also <em>In re Elise K. </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 138, 149 [187 Cal.Rptr. 483, 654 P.2d 253].)</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">\n<em>Choice of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">Appellants insist that California law governs the inspection issue. CCAS argues that Delaware law applies because CCAS is a Delaware corporation.  To determine the correct choice of law, we apply a three-step analysis. First, we determine whether the two concerned states have different laws. Second, we consider whether each state has an interest in having its law applied to this case. Finally, if the laws are different and each state has an interest in having its own law applied, we apply the law of the state whose \u201cinterests would be more impaired if its policy were subordinated to the policy of the other state.\u201d <em>(North American Asbestos Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 [225 Cal.Rptr. 877]. See also <em>Bernhard </em>v. <em>Harrah\u2019s Club </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 313, 320 [128 Cal.Rptr. 215, 546 P.2d 719].)</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">The California statute provides: \u201cEvery director [has] the absolute right at any reasonable time to inspect and copy all books, records and documents of every kind . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1602.) Under the analogous Delaware statute, a director has \u201cthe right to examine the corporation\u2019s . . . books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his position as a director.\u201d (Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, \u00a7 220, subd. (d) (1995).) In addition, the Delaware statute grants its Court of Chancery exclusive jurisdiction to resolve disputes concerning inspections by corporate directors. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">If Delaware law applies, the Delaware Court of Chancery has exclusive jurisdiction and appellants must prove that they have a proper purpose for their request. The California statutory scheme does not impose a \u201cproper purpose\u201d requirement <em>(Valtz </em>v. <em>Penta Investment Corp. </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 803, 810 [188 Cal.Rptr. 922]), and appellants have never articulated the purpose for their inspection demand. Thus, while the California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1852\">*1852</page-number>statutory scheme would grant appellants an inspection, the same would not necessarily be true under the more restrictive Delaware statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">The directors of a corporation owe a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. <em>(Hartman </em>v. <em>Hollingsworth </em>(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 579, 581-582 [63 Cal.Rptr. 563].) Section 1602 represents a legislative judgment that directors are better able to discharge those duties if they have free access to information concerning the corporation. Thus, California has a public policy favoring broad inspection rights for the directors. The Legislature has also declared that it is the public policy of California to apply the same standards to foreign corporations whose principal executive offices are located in California. We may not ignore that declaration of public policy. <em>(California Casualty Indemnity Exchange </em>v. <em>Pettis </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1597, 1605 [239 Cal.Rptr. 205].)</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">Delaware also has important interests at stake. Because CCAS is a creation of Delaware law, Delaware has an interest in prescribing the powers of CCAS, imposing uniform regulations on its internal affairs, and controlling its rights and liabilities. <em>(Riley </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald </em>(1986) 178 Cal. App.3d 871, 877 [223 Cal.Rptr. 889].) The Delaware statute expresses a public policy which attempts to protect corporations against unreasonable or burdensome inspections by directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">We must decide which state\u2019s interests would be more impaired if its policy were subordinated to the policy of the other state. <em>(Offshore Rental Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Oil Co. </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 157, 166 [148 Cal.Rptr. 867, 583 P.2d 721].) Delaware\u2019s interest in regulating the activities of its domestic corporations is less substantial where, as here, its only contact with the corporation is in issuing a certificate of incorporation. CCAS has no Delaware shareholders or directors. It does not have an office or store its documents in Delaware. The record does not reflect whether CCAS ever conducted business in Delaware. By contrast, California has strong contacts with CCAS. CCAS maintained its principal office and most of the documents at issue in this state until the merger occurred. CCAS also conducted business in California and employed California residents. Forty percent of its stock and two of the five seats on its board of directors are controlled by California residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1853\">*1853</page-number>California\u2019s interests would be impaired by the application of Delaware law because Delaware cannot at the same time honor a director\u2019s \u201cabsolute\u201d inspection right and limit inspections to a \u201cpurpose reasonably related to his position as a director.\u201d However, as we shall explain, the trial court can protect Delaware\u2019s interest in avoiding a burdensome inspection by imposing reasonable conditions. We conclude, therefore, that California\u2019s interest would be more impaired by the application of Delaware law than Delaware\u2019s interest would be impaired by the opposite result. California law applies to the inspection issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">\n<em>Section 2115 Does Not Render Section 1602 Inapplicable.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">CCAS argues that it need not comply with section 1602 because it does not meet the test provided in section 2115 for the application of California law to a foreign corporation. Section 2115 provides that portions of the Corporations Code, including section 1602, apply to a foreign corporation if, among other things, \u201cmore than one-half of its outstanding voting securities are held of record by persons having addresses in this state.\u201d (\u00a7 2115, subd. (a).) ISS owns 60 percent of the CCAS voting securities and does not have an address in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">CCAS fails the test under section 2115, but that does not settle the question because section 1602 contains a separate and distinct test; i.e., a \u201clong arm\u201d provision. The statute provides that it \u201capplies to a director of any foreign corporation having its principal executive office in this state . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1602.) CCAS meets this test but argues that section 1602 applies only where the corporation also meets the test established in section 2115.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">Section 1602 was amended to apply to foreign corporations after section 2115 was enacted. We assume that the Legislature was aware of section 2115 when it amended section 1602 and that it intended to maintain a consistent body of statutes. <em>(Schmidt </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 23, 27 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 340].) We must also avoid an interpretation of section 2115 which requires that section 1602 be ignored unless \u201c \u2018the two acts are so inconsistent that there is no possibility of concurrent operation . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Hays </em>v. <em>Wood </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 772, 784 [160 Cal.Rptr. 102, 603 P.2d 19].)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1854\">*1854</page-number>Here, although the two sections contain different tests, they are capable of concurrent operation. Each section may be given effect because each establishes a separate and distinct test for determining whether a foreign corporation must comply with section 1602. CCAS met one such test and is therefore required to comply with section 1602, regardless of whether it also meets the other available test.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">\n<em>The Internal Affairs Doctrine Does Not Require Application of Delaware Law.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">CCAS argues that Delaware law must be applied because the appellants\u2019 claim involves the internal affairs of a Delaware corporation, a matter traditionally controlled by the state of incorporation. <em>(Valtz </em>v. <em>Penta Investment Corp., supra, </em>139 Cal.App.3d at p. 807.) \u201cThe internal affairs doctrine is a conflict of laws principle which recognizes that only one State should have the authority to regulate a corporation\u2019s internal affairs . . . because otherwise a corporation could be faced with conflicting demands.\" <em>(Edgar </em>v. <em>MITE Corp. </em>(1988) 457 U.S. 624, 645 [73 L.Ed.2d 269, 285, 102 S.Ct. 2629].) Here, complying with California law will not require CCAS to violate Delaware law. The Delaware statute allows, but does not require, that a corporation restrict the inspection rights of its directors. CCAS will not violate Delaware law by granting appellants greater access to its documents. The internal affairs doctrine does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">\n<em>Section 1602 Does Not Violate the Commerce Clause.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">__CCAS also argues that application of California law in this case would violate the commerce clause of the United States Constitution. (U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3.) We disagree. The commerce clause prohibits states from discriminating against interstate commerce. <em>(Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. </em>v. <em>Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources </em>(1992) 504 U.S. 353 [119 L.Ed.2d 139, 147, 112 S.Ct. 2019].) It also \u201cprecludes the application of a state statute to commerce that takes place wholly outside of the State\u2019s borders . . . <em>(Edgar </em>v. <em>MITE Corp., supra, </em>457 U.S. at pp. 642-643 [73 L.Ed.2d at p. 283]) and invalidates regulations that \u201cadversely . . . affect interstate commerce by subjecting activities to inconsistent regulations.\u201d <em>(CTS Corp. </em>v. <em>Dynamics Corp. of America </em>(1987) 481 U.S. 69, 88 [95 L.Ed.2d 67, 84, 107 S.Ct. 1637].)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-11\">Section 1602 does not suffer from these defects. It does not discriminate against foreign corporations because it imposes on those corporations the same burdens imposed upon domestic corporations. It does not apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1855\">*1855</page-number>activities occurring wholly outside the borders of California because, until the merger, most CCAS documents were located in California. The same would probably be true for any foreign corporation maintaining its principal office in this state. Finally, section 1602 does not subject CCAS to conflicting regulatory demands. Application of section 1602 to CCAS does not, therefore, violate the commerce clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">\n<em>Section 1602 Does Not Violate the Full Faith and Credit Clause.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">Similarly, section 1602 does not violate the full faith and credit clause. (U.S. Const., art. IV, \u00a7 1 [\u201cFull Faith and Credit ... be given in each State to the public Acts, Records and Judicial Proceedings of every other State . . . .\u201d].) A state\u2019s choice of law decision does not violate the full faith and credit clause if the state has significant contacts with the dispute \u201c \u2018such that choice of its law is neither arbitrary nor fundamentally unfair.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Wilson </em>v. <em>Louisiana-Pacific Resources, Inc. </em>(1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 216, 222-223 [187 Cal.Rptr. 852].) For purposes of the full faith and credit clause, the location of a corporation\u2019s principal executive office within a state is a \u201csignificant contact.\u201d <em>(Valtz </em>v. <em>Penta Investment Corp., supra, </em>139 Cal.App.3d at p. 807.)</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">CCAS located its principal executive office in this state and has more substantial contacts with California than it does with Delaware. Accordingly, the choice of California law as opposed to Delaware law is neither arbitrary nor fundamentally unfair. Application of section 1602 does not violate the full faith and credit clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">\n<em>The Trial Court May Impose Limitations on Appellants\u2019 Inspection Rights Under Sections 1602 and 1603.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">The trial court must apply California law but is not obligated to grant appellants unfettered access to every document ever created by CCAS. Instead, the trial court may impose \u201cjust and proper conditions\u201d upon appellant\u2019s otherwise \u201cabsolute\u201d inspection rights. We admit that the Legislature\u2019s choice of the word, \u201cabsolute,\u201d in section 1602 does give us pause. But one hypothetical illustrates that \u201cabsolute\u201d cannot mean \u201cabsolute.\u201d A disgruntled director unambiguously announces his or her intention to violate his or her fiduciary duties to the corporation and the shareholders by using inspection rights to learn trade secrets, gain access to confidential customer lists, and compete with the corporation. In this situation, does the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1856\">*1856</page-number>want the judiciary to come to the aid of the disgruntled director, enforce the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to inspect and help the director commit a tort against the corporation? No.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe literal meaning of the words of a statute may be disregarded to avoid absurd results ....\u201d\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Unzueta </em>v. <em>Ocean View School Dist. </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1689, 1698 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 614].)</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">The \u201cabsolute right\u201d to inspect documents is the general rule in California. However, section 1602 must be read in pari materia with section 1603. <em>(Unzueta </em>v. <em>Ocean View School Dist., supra, </em>6 Cal.App.4th at p. 1695.) The language of section 1603, subdivision (a) is expansive. It is not expressly limited to an inspection request by a shareholder. Being a remedial statute, it must be liberally construed. <em>(Ford Dealers Assn. </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 347, 356 [185 Cal.Rptr. 453, 650 P.2d 328].) Where the corporation determines that an unfettered inspection will result in a tort against the corporation, it may decline the request for inspection. In this situation, \u201c. . . directors can enforce their inspection rights by court action. . . . [\u00a7 1603].\u201d (Friedman, Cal. Practice Guide: Corporations 2 (The Rutter Group 1995) *][6:502, pp. 6-98; see also 15 Cal.Jur.3d, Corporations, \u00a7 263, p. 367 )</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">Upon a director\u2019s request for inspection pursuant to section 1603 in the superior court, the corporation must demonstrate, by evidentiary showing, that a protective order is necessary to prevent a tort against the corporation. Whether there are other situations where a director\u2019s inspection rights may be curtailed is not before us and we offer no opinion thereon. The superior court may then exercise its broad discretion under section 1603, subdivision (a) to fashion a protective order imposing just and proper conditions on the inspection. Precisely what \u201cjust and proper conditions\u201d are necessary in this case, if any, is a question we leave to the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">The trial court erred in applying Delaware law and denying appellants any inspection rights. We reverse and remand the matter to allow the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1857\">*1857</page-number>to enter an order granting appellants an appropriate inspection. Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Stone (S. J.), P.

Such inspection by a director may be made in person or by agent or attorney and the right of inspection includes the right to copy and make extracts. This section applies to a director of any foreign corporation having its principal executive office in this state or customarily holding meetings of its board in this state.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b969-12\"> Section 1603, subdivision (a) provides: \u201cUpon refusal of a lawful demand for inspection, the superior court of the proper county, may enforce the right of inspection with just and proper conditions or may, for good case shown, appoint one or more competent inspectors or accountants to audit the books and records kept in this state and investigate the property, funds and affairs of any domestic corporation or any foreign corporation keeping records in this state and of any subsidiary corporation thereof, domestic or foreign, keeping records in this state and to report thereon in such manner as the court may direct.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b972-8\"> Appellants place great reliance on <em>Valtz </em>v. <em>Penta Investment Corp., supra, </em>139 Cal.App.3d 803.

The corporation refused, alleging that the information would be used in a competing business. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 806.) The opinion does observe that the \u201cunclean hands\u201d defense was tantamount to the \u201cproper purpose\u201d rule and therefore inapplicable. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 810.)
