(See Cal. Rules of Court, rules 33(e), 891, 892, 980.3.) As rules of court are only valid to the extent that they comply with the constitutional charge to be \u201cnot inconsistent with statute,\u201d we conclude that these rules were promulgated in excess of Judicial Council authority. (See Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">In our case, appellants California Court Reporters Association, Inc. (CCRA) and others<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> petitioned for a writ of mandate to prevent respondents Judicial Council of California and others<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from allowing electronic recording of superior court proceedings. The trial court denied the petition and CCRA appeals'. CCRA contends, inter alia, that the California Rules of Court authorizing and funding electronic recording in superior courts are invalid because they are inconsistent with statutory law. We agree and thus reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The facts of this case are undisputed. For more than a century, state law has provided that the official record of superior court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> proceedings be taken down in shorthand. (Code Civ. Proc.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u00a7 269; see Stats. 1866, ch. 235, \u00a7 1, pp. 232-233; Stats. 1872, ch. 296, \u00a7 1, pp. 400-401; Cal. Code Amends. 1873-1874, ch. 383, \u00a7 269, p. 15; Cal. Code Amends. 1880, ch. 35, \u00a7 269, pp. 21, 53].) In 1986, the Legislature authorized a demonstration project in selected counties\u2014including Alameda County\u2014to assess the feasibility of using electronic means of producing a verbatim record of these proceedings. (\u00a7 270, subd. (a).) By January 1992, the Judicial Council was to report to the Legislature on the feasibility of electronic recording of official superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>court proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>(\u00a7 270, subd. (g).) In 1992, the Judicial Council sponsored a bill that would have allowed electronic recording to be used after January 1, 1994. The Assembly Judiciary Committee rejected the bill and it was never reported from committee to the full Assembly. (See Assem. Bill No. 2937 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7\u00a7 1-3; see also <em>Los Angeles County Court Reporters Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 403, 408-409 &amp; fn. 6 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 341].)</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">Under the terms of the statute, the demonstration project was to end on January 1, 1994.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (\u00a7 270, subd. (a).) In November 1993, the Judicial Council adopted rules of court allowing official electronic recording of superior court proceedings after January 1, 1994.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Cal. Rules of Court, rules 33(e), 891, 892, 980.3.) The Alameda County Superior Court also adopted local rules governing the electronic recording of its proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">In December 1993, appellants CCRA, Alameda County Official Court Reporters Association and five individuals petitioned the Alameda County Superior Court for a writ of mandate to preclude the Judicial Council and Alameda County officials from implementing the electronic recording rules. CCRA also sought an alternative writ and a stay order. In January 1994, the parties stipulated that the rules would not be implemented until a final decision was reached on the petition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Judicial Council demurred to the petition for writ of mandate. The parties agreed that the trial court<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> hear the merits of the petition, posing only questions of law. In March 1994, the trial court issued a statement of intended decision, upholding the challenged rules as \u201cnot inconsistent with statute.\u201d Judgment denying<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the petition for writ of mandate was entered in May 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>II. Validity of Rules of Court</p>\n<p id=\"A9\">A. <em>\u201cNot Inconsistent with Statute\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">First, CCRA contends that rules of court authorizing and funding<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> electronic recording of superior court proceedings are invalid because they are inconsistent with statute. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rules 33(e), 891, 892, 980.3.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It asserts that, by these rules, the Judicial Council seeks to authorize the use of electronic recording to make the official superior court record.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>CCRA argues that these rules are contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intent that the official superior court record be made by official reporters and official reporters pro tempore.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">The Judicial Council is empowered to \u201cadopt rules for court administration, practice and procedure, <em>not inconsistent with statute </em>. . . .\u201d (Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Const., art. VI, \u00a7 6, italics added; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 950, 960, 963 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 883 P.2d 974]; <em>In re Jermaine B. </em>(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1280, 1284 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 612]; <em>Iverson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 544, 547-548 [213 Cal.Rptr. 399].) These rules have the force of law. <em>(Alicia T. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 869, 884 [271 Cal.Rptr. 513]; see <em>In re Richard S. </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 857, 863 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 2, 819 P.2d 843]; <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Union Trust etc. Co. </em>(1905) 146 Cal. 134, 138 [79 P. 843]; <em>Albermont Petroleum, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Cunningham </em>(1960) 186 Cal.App.2d 84, 89 [9 Cal.Rptr. 405].) However, the Judicial Council may not adopt rules that are inconsistent with governing statutes. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>at p. 960; <em>In re Robin M. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 337, 346 [146 Cal.Rptr. 352, 579 P.2d 1].) The Judicial Council purported to adopt rules 33(e), 891, 892 and 980.3 of the California Rules of Court pursuant to its constitutional authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">The trial court concluded that the challenged rules were \u201cnot inconsistent with statute\u201d and thus, passed constitutional muster. In doing so, it interpreted the phrase \u201cnot inconsistent with statute\u201d to mean more than merely inharmonious, but connoting an impossibility of concurrent operative effect.  On appeal, we are not bound by the trial court\u2019s ruling. The interpretation of statutes is a question of law for us to determine anew. (See <em>California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, 699 [170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856]; <em>City of Lafayette </em>v. <em>East Bay Mun. Utility Dist. </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1005, 1013 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 658].)</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Preliminarily, we must determine the relative value to be assigned to the Judicial Council\u2019s rules and the Legislature\u2019s enactment of statutes before we turn to the merits of our inquiry. The Judicial Council argues that as it and the Legislature both derive their powers from the state Constitution, the two institutions are coequals. We find this argument to be specious. The Constitution reserves to the Legislature and the people of this state the higher right to provide rules of procedure. The Judicial Council\u2019s right is secondary\u2014a right to adopt rules only when the higher authority of the Legislature and the people has not been exercised. <em>(Stockton Theatres, Inc. </em>v. <em>Palermo </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 469, 476-477 [304 P.2d 7]; <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1930) 104 Cal.App. 340, 344 [285 P. 860].) Its rulemaking power is limited by existing law as enacted by the Legislature, thus making the legislative branch an inherently higher authority than the Judicial Council itself. (See <em>Stockton Theatres, Inc. </em>v. <em>Palermo, supra, </em>at p. 476; <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 344.) The challenged rules must be measured for consistency against the legislative enactments.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Our next task is to determine what constitutes a rule of court that is \u201cnot inconsistent with statute.\u201d (See Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 6.) CCRA argues that a rule of court is inconsistent with a statute if it contravenes the intent of the Legislature that passed that statute. The Judicial Council contends that the trial court properly defined the term \u201cinconsistent\u201d to mean more than merely inharmonious or unsymmetrical, but to connote an impossibility of concurrent operative effect. It urges us to find that a rule of court is inconsistent with a statute only if the rule expressly prohibits or permits that which the statute permits or prohibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">Construing the relevant constitutional language, the trial court defined the term \u201cnot inconsistent\u201d as \u201cnot. . . merely inharmonious or unsymmetrical, but connot[ing] impossibility of concurrent operative effect, or contradictory in the sense that the provisions cannot co-exist . . . . [T \u201c \u2018Inconsistent\u2019 means mutually repugnant or contradictory; contrary, the one to the other, so that both cannot stand. The acceptance or establishment of the one implies the abrogation or abandonment of the other ....[*][] [In the context of local and state court rules], \u2018inconsistent\u2019 means court rules so antithetical that it is impossible as a matter of law that they can both be effective.\u201d Based on this definition, the trial court found that the rules permitting electronic recording were consistent with state law and thus, valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The trial court relied on out-of-state cases to determine whether the rules were \u201cinconsistent with statute.\u201d These cases do not interpret section 6 of article VI of the California Constitution, but consider the meaning of the term \u201cinconsistent\u201d in other contexts. (See <em>In re Brown </em>(S.D. Iowa 1971) 329 F.Supp. 422, 426 [positive repugnancy between new and old law required to repeal by implication]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Chavez </em>(1988) 111 Wn.2d 548 [761 P.2d 607, 612] [local and state court rules found consistent]; <em>Heaney </em>v. <em>Seattle Mun. Court </em>(1983) 35 Wn.App. 150 [665 P.2d 918, 921] [local and state court rules found consistent]; <em>State </em>ex rel. <em>Dade County </em>v. <em>Brautigam </em>(Fla. 1969) 224 So.2d 688, 691-692 [liberal construction of home rule mandate in Florida Constitution; powers reserved to counties]; <em>Berry </em>v. <em>City of Fort Worth </em>(Tex.Civ.App. 1937) 110 S.W.2d 95, 103 [under home rule provision, powers are reserved to cities].<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>) When determining the validity of California Rules of Court in the context of a California constitutional grant of authority to a state rulemaking body, we think it more appropriate to look first to California court decisions to interpret key constitutional terms. (See, e.g., <em>Shay </em>v. <em>Roth </em>(1923) 64 Cal.App. 314, 318 [221 P. 967] [interpreting \u201cconsistent\u201d as meaning \u201cin agreement\u201d or \u201charmonious\"].)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>In the past, California courts have found rules of court inconsistent with statute and thus, held them invalid. (See, e.g., <em>Sadler </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 245, 247 [230 Cal.Rptr. 561]; <em>Iverson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>167 Cal.App.3d at pp. 546-548; see also <em>In re Robin M., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 346.) These courts did not test the validity of the rule of court by determining whether it was impossible as a matter of law for both the statute and the rule to have concurrent operative effect, as the trial court did in our case. Instead, the courts measured the challenged rule against the statutory scheme to determine whether the rule was consistent with the intent expressed in the legislative enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">For example, when a statute allowed five days for filing opposition and a rule of court allowed five <em>court </em>days for filing, an appellate court found that the rule was inconsistent with the legislative intent that opposition be filed within five <em>calendar </em>days. Although the language of the statute and the court rule could have been harmonized to be made consistent, the court looked behind the express language of the statute to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent. (See <em>Iverson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>167 Cal.App.3d at p. 548.) In this case, the application of the impossibility of concurrent operative effect test used by the trial court in our case would have resulted in enforcement of a rule that clarified an ambiguous statutory term.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">In another case, after reviewing legislative enactments intended to limit prehearing detention of minors to <em>15 days, </em>the California Supreme Court rejected a rule of court permitting a <em>longer </em>period of prehearing detention by means of dismissing the original petition and refiling a new one. Although the court rule did not expressly contradict the statute, its effect would have violated the legislative intent behind that statute. Thus, the rule was disapproved because it was inconsistent with that intent. (See <em>In re Robin M., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 346.)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In another appellate decision, when a statute was silent on any notice of motion requirement but case law had recognized the absence of this requirement as significant, a rule of court requiring notice of motion was held invalid as inconsistent with that statute. <em>(Sadler </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>186 Cal.App.3d at pp. 249-250; see <em>Cortez </em>v. <em>Bootsma </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 935, 938 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 20] [discussing <em>Sadler],) </em>If our trial court\u2019s approach of impossibility of concurrent operative effect had been employed, the notice of motion rule would have been upheld, as it could have been interpreted as having supplied a procedural requirement that had been omitted from the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">In like manner, courts determine whether local rules conflict with state law and are therefore invalid. (See, e.g., <em>Cortez </em>v. <em>Bootsma, supra, </em>27 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Cal.App.4th at pp. 938-939.) For example, when a state law required a trial court to award reasonable attorney fees, a local rule limiting the amount of a fee awarded to plaintiff\u2019s counsel to an amount agreed to be paid by the plaintiff was invalidated as inconsistent with state law vesting discretion to determine the reasonableness of fees in the trial court. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 937-938.) In another case, a local rule requiring a written notice of motion was construed to be inapplicable to suppression motions made during preliminary hearings which, by statute, may be made orally. One reason for this interpretation was to avoid any \u201cunlawful [] conflict with the statutory authorization for oral motions\u201d contained in the governing statute. <em>(Cox </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1046, 1050-1051 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 751].)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Recently, the California Supreme Court tested the validity of a statewide rule of court by determining the legislative intent of the governing statutory law and measuring the rule against that intent. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 950.) The determinate sentencing law permitted a sentencing judge to consider a myriad of aggravating circumstances\u2014including those relating to the defendant such as his or her parole status\u2014when determining whether to impose an upper term. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>at pp. 960-961.) The challenged rule provided that an aggravating circumstance would only support imposition of the upper term for an enhancement if that circumstance directly related to the fact giving rise to the enhancement. (Cal. Rules of Court, former rule 428(b); <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>at pp. 952-953.) A unanimous court invalidated the rule as an improper attempt to narrow a trial court\u2019s sentencing discretion, contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>at p. 961.)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">For purposes of our case, it is important to note that the Supreme Court focused its inquiry on whether the rule was consistent with the legislative intent behind the statutory law. The case is replete with references to legislative intent. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 953, 956, 958, 961-963.) The rule of court was found to conflict with the statutory scheme despite the fact that the Legislature did not specifically preclude the Judicial Council from adopting a different approach to the matters that were the subject of the challenged rule than the approach that the Legislature had adopted on related matters. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 962.) \u201c[T]he rule is inconsistent with the statutory scheme it was intended to implement and, for that reason, is invalid.\u201d (See <em>id. </em>at p. 953.)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Having reviewed the pertinent California cases, we conclude that when evaluating whether a rule of court is \u201cnot inconsistent with statute\u201d within the meaning of the California Constitution, a court must determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Legislature\u2019s intent behind the statutory scheme that the rule was intended to implement and measure the rule\u2019s consistency with that intent. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 953.) Thus, the trial court erred by finding a rule of court inconsistent with statute only if it was impossible to give both concurrent effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">B. <em>Legislative Intent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">In the trial court, CCRA conceded that no legislative act is expressly inconsistent with the challenged rules. We agree that there is no statute expressly prohibiting a superior court from making an official record by electronic means, rather than by using certified shorthand reporters or expressly mandating that the official superior court record be made by shorthand reporters. (See <em>Los Angeles County Court Reporters Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 409 [sections 269 and 270 do not proscribe use of electronic recording when no request for an official shorthand reporter is made].) However, this is not determinative of the question before us. We must determine whether the statutory scheme addresses the making of the official record in such a manner as to suggest that the Legislature implicitly intended that this record be made by certified shorthand reporters rather than by electronic recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Several statutes comprise the statutory scheme of making an official record. Subdivision (a) of section 269 sets out the basic provisions for requesting an official superior court record. \u201cThe official reporter of a superior court, or any of them, where there are two or more, shall, at the request of either party, or of the court in a civil action or proceeding, and on the order of the court, the district attorney, or the attorney for the defendant in a criminal action or proceeding, take down in shorthand all testimony, objections made, rulings of the court, exceptions taken, all arraignments, pleas, and sentences of defendants in criminal cases, arguments of the prosecuting attorney to the jury, and all statements and remarks made and oral instructions given by the judge. If directed by the court, or requested by either party, the official reporter shall, within such reasonable time after the trial of the case as the court may designate, write the transcripts out, or the specific portions thereof as may be requested, in plain and legible longhand, or by typewriter, or other printing machine, and certify that the transcripts were correctly reported and transcribed, and when directed by the court, file the transcripts with the clerk of the court.\u201d (\u00a7 269, subd. (a).) This statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>also provides for the preparation of an appellate record and the request for a transcript. (\u00a7 269, subds. (b)-(c).)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">One court has held that section 269 does not require that the official reporter make the record of superior court proceedings, unless requested by a party or the judge. <em>(Los Angeles County Court Reporters Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.) This conclusion is consistent with the opinion of the Legislative Counsel holding that section 269 <em>requires </em>that superior court proceedings be taken down by an official shorthand reporter if a request is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">In section 270, the Legislature authorized certain counties to conduct a demonstration project assessing the feasibility of electronic recording of superior court proceedings. (\u00a7 270, subd. (a).) The effect of section 270 was to override section 269 in the electronic recording demonstration project courtrooms when the project was being conducted between 1986 and 1993. <em>(Los Angeles County Court Reporters Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 409.) The statute ceased to have any effect when it expired on January 1, 1994. (See \u00a7 270, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Section 273 states that \u201c[t]he report of the official reporter, or official reporter pro tempore, of any court, duly appointed and sworn, when transcribed and certified as being a correct transcript of the testimony and proceedings in the case, is prima facie evidence of such testimony and proceedings.\u201d (\u00a7 273.) This statute creates an evidentiary presumption that does not apply if a certified shorthand reporter\u2019s official report was not requested. <em>(Los Angeles County Court Reporters Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at pp. 409-410 [consistent with section 269].)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>The Government Code also addresses matters pertaining to official reporting of superior court proceedings. The fees and costs of an official reporter are set forth.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68086.) The appointment of official reporters is authorized.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Gov. Code, \u00a7 69941; see <em>Los Angeles County Court Reporters Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 412 [consistent with section 269].) The court is prohibited from authorizing payment for \u201cany matter or material except that reported by the [official] reporter pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>section 269 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (Gov. Code, \u00a7 69952, subd. (b); see <em>Los Angeles County Court Reporters Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 414 [statute inapplicable if official reporter\u2019s record is not requested].) Official reporters are paid according to legislatively determined schedules. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 69948, 70044.5-70064.)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">By contrast, the Government Code specifically provides for electronic recording of municipal and justice court proceedings. If an official reporter is unavailable, electronic recording is permitted. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 72194.5.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Section 72194.5 of the Government Code specifically authorizes an exception to section 274c\u2014the municipal and justice courts equivalent of section 269\u2014requiring an official record to be made by an official reporter on request of a party or judge. <em>(Los Angeles County Court Reporters Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 411 [rejecting CCRA argument that this provision evidences legislative intent to restrict electronic recording to municipal and justice courts].)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">A review of these statutes satisfies us that the Legislature intended to authorize electronic recording to create an official record in certain circumstances, but not in superior courts at the present time. As the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>noted, in those circumstances in which the Legislature has authorized electronic recording as a permissible substitute for an official reporter\u2019s record, it has done so by statute. The Legislature has specifically authorized electronic recording of the official record in municipal and justice courts and in those superior courts that were part of the now-expired demonstration project. (See \u00a7 270, subd. (a); Gov. Code, \u00a7 72194.5.) There is no comparable authorization for superior courts at the present time. Instead, section 269 requires that the official reporter make the record of superior court proceedings, if requested by a party or by the court. (\u00a7 269, subd. (a); <em>Los Angeles County Court Reporters Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior </em>Court, supra, 31 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.) When authorizing the demonstration project in superior courts, the Legislature acknowledged that electronic recording could be used to create an official record \u201cNotwithstanding Section 269,\u201d requiring an official reporter to create this record on request. (See \u00a7 270, subd. (a) [expired Jan. 1, 1994].) Indeed, whenever the Legislature has intended that electronic recording be permitted, it has expressed that intent by specific statutory authorization. (See, e.g., \u00a7 2025, subd. (/) [depositions may be recorded by audiotape or videotape].) This legislative pattern suggests that while electronic recording is sometimes proper, the normal practice is that a shorthand reporter is to create the official record unless statutory law provides otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The various statutes consistently treat those courts in which electronic recording is permitted and those in which an official reporter\u2019s record is to be made differently. For example, the contrasting language of two subdivisions of section 68086 of the Government Code is noteworthy. Costs for the services of an \u201cofficial reporter\u201d in \u201call superior court departments not selected to participate in the demonstration project established under [now-ineffective] Section 270 of the Code of Civil Procedure\u201d are set forth in one subdivision, while costs for \u201cofficial reporting services\u201d in \u201call superior court departments selected to participate in the demonstration project established under [now-ineffective] Section 270 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and in all municipal and justice courts\u201d are set forth in another. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 68086, subds. (a)-(b).) Again, of the courts listed in subdivision (b), all were or are specifically authorized by statute to use electronic recording, while there is no authorizing statute permitting the use of electronic recording in those courts listed in subdivision (a). (See \u00a7 270, subd. (a); Gov. Code, \u00a7 72194.5.) This distinction suggests that the Legislature intended to allow electronic recording to create the official record in some courts, but not others.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The Judicial Council\u2019s own reports support this conclusion. By statute, the official record of municipal and justice court proceedings may be electronically recorded under certain circumstances. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 72194.5.) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Judicial Council sponsored this legislation, described in its annual report as providing \u201cthe necessary statutory authorization for municipal and justice courts to use electronic recording . . . .\u201d (Judicial Council of Cal., Ann. Rep. (1976) p. 55.) If the Judicial Council needed statutory authorization to establish electronic recording in municipal and justice courts, it is hard to understand why such legislative approval is not needed to create an official superior court record using electronic recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">The Legislature itself has also spoken on this matter, in a manner consistent with our conclusion. When the Legislature authorized the electronic recording demonstration project in superior courts, the Judicial Council selected certain counties to participate in the project. (\u00a7 270, subd. (a).) In response to an inquiry about the scope of the demonstration project, the Legislative Counsel opined that unselected counties were <em>not </em>authorized to use electronic recording in superior courts. It was the opinion of the Legislative Counsel that subdivision (a) of section 269 <em>requires </em>that superior court proceedings be taken down by an official shorthand reporter. As the trial court recognized, \u201c[o]ther than for this limited demonstration project, the Legislature has not authorized the use of electronic recording in the superior courts to make the official record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The fact that the Legislature has by statute authorized electronic recording in some contexts suggests strongly that\u2014unless the existing statutory scheme providing for the official record to be taken down in shorthand is amended\u2014the Legislature does not intend that electronic recording of superior court proceedings be the method of creating an official record. Although the statutes do not expressly prohibit electronic recording of superior court proceedings, they nevertheless lead to one conclusion\u2014that the Legislature intended that such proceedings be stenographically recorded by official shorthand reporters. (See <em>Edmiston </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 699, 703 [150 Cal.Rptr. 276, 586 P.2d 590] [videotaping of medical examination not intended by Legislature]; <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 970, 974 [140 Cal.Rptr. 669, 568 P.2d 394] [videotaping of depositions not intended by Legislature].)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>C. <em>Rejection of Proposed Legislation Authorizing Electronic Recording</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">When assessing the Legislature\u2019s intent behind the statutes, we look to the Legislature\u2019s purpose at the time that the statutory scheme was enacted. <em>(In re Pedro T. </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 1041, 1048 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 74, 884 P.2d 1022] [legislative inactivity on sunset law not informative].)  However, CCRA also urges us to consider\u2014as further evidence of an intent not to permit electronic recording\u2014the Legislature\u2019s subsequent failure to pass legislation proposed by the Judicial Council specifically authorizing electronic recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The California Supreme Court has been inconsistent in its treatment of the effect to be given to the Legislature\u2019s failure to act in the determination of legislative intent. (See <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 571, 580 [116 Cal.Rptr. 183] [meaning of statute].) When determining the meaning of statutory language, our high court recently held that very limited guidance can generally be drawn from the fact that the Legislature has not enacted a particular proposed amendment to an existing statutory scheme. The unpassed bills of later legislative sessions evoke conflicting inferences \u2014supporting them to replace an existing prohibition or to clarify an existing permission; opposing them to preserve an existing prohibition or because there was no need to clarify an existing permission. As evidence of legislative intent, unadopted proposals have been held to have little value. <em>(Grupe Development Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 911, 922-923 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 226, 844 P.2d 545] [meaning of statute]; see <em>Pitney-Bowes, Inc. </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 307, 319 [166 Cal.Rptr. 489].)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">However, when determining whether an administratively promulgated rule is consistent with controlling legislation, legislative rejection of an authorizing statute\u2014for whatever reason\u2014may prove more persuasive. In a case challenging an administrative regulation, the California Supreme Court noted that at the time the legislation was enacted, a provision identical to the regulation was proposed by the agency but rejected by the Legislature. <em>(Cooper </em>v. <em>Swoap </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 856, 859, 864-865 [115 Cal.Rptr. 1, 524 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>P.2d 97], cert. den. 419 U.S. 1022 [42 L.Ed.2d 296, 95 S.Ct. 498].) The court held that \u201c. . . the legislative history provides perhaps the clearest indication that the present regulation is inconsistent with legislative intent.\u201d <em>(Cooper </em>v. <em>Swoap, supra, </em>at p. 859.) As with Judicial Council rules, administrative regulations are only valid if they are consistent with statute. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 864.) In our case, the Judicial Council\u2019s attempt to obtain legislative amendment of the existing statutory scheme suggests that its present interpretation of that scheme as consistent with the rules it promulgated after rejection of the amendments is shaky, at best. (See, e.g., <em>Pitney-Bowes, Inc. </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.3d at p. 319.) By its conduct, the Judicial Council impliedly admitted that legislative authorization is needed before electronic recording of superior court proceedings may be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">In light of the difficulties of determining the meaning of legislative rejection of proposed amendments to existing statute, we think it wiser to arrive at our conclusion independent of the Legislature\u2019s rejection of the proposed amendments. However, we cannot ignore the fact that the Legislature\u2019s rejection of the Judicial Council\u2019s proposed amendments is in accord with our interpretation of the existing statutory scheme. (See, e.g., <em>Pitney-Bowes, Inc. </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.3d at p. 319.)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">D. <em>Rules are Invalid</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">After having reviewed the statutory scheme, we find that the Legislature intended the official record of superior court proceedings to be prepared only in the manner authorized by statute. (See <em>Edmiston </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 704 [videotaping of medical examination not intended by Legislature].) Until the Legislature amends section 269 to permit electronic recording to create an official record, the normal practice in California superior courts is for an official shorthand reporter to create the official record.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The challenged rules permit an official record of superior court proceedings to be made by electronic recording and impose fees for recording services. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rules 33(e), 891, 892, 980.3.) They are \u201cinconsistent with statute\u201d because they cannot be squared with the existing legislative scheme requiring official shorthand reporting of superior court proceedings. (See Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 6.) The Judicial Council exceeded its constitutional authority by promulgating these inconsistent rules which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>are, thus, invalid.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 953.)

(See <em>Los Angeles County Court Reporters Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.) It evaluated many of the statutes that CCRA now urges us to find comprise a statutory scheme\u2014sections 269, 270 and 273; Government Code sections 68086, 69941, 69942, 69952, 69953 and 72194.5\u2014but did not find these provisions established that the use of electronic recording was prohibited in superior courts if the parties or the judge did not request a certified shorthand reporter to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>make a record. (31 Cal.App.4th at pp. 407-414.) Instead, it found these provisions to be consistent with section 269. (31 Cal.App.4th at pp. 413-414.) The court characterized its holding as \u201cvery narrow\u201d\u2014\u201cthe court is not prohibited, by any explicit or implicit legislative command contained in those specific statutes cited by [the local association of certified shorthand reporters], from choosing to maintain a record of general civil proceedings by means of electronic recording devices where neither the court nor any party requests that a verbatim record be taken by an official shorthand reporter pursuant to the provisions of section 269.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 415, fn. omitted.) The Fifth District specifically declined to address certain other issues that CCRA, in an amicus curiae brief, urged it to decide. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 415-416.) Some of those issues are presented in our case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b58-8\"> CCRA also argues that the Judicial Council lacks any inherent power to nullify relevant statutes. In light of our finding that the challenged rules are inconsistent with the statute and thus exceed the constitutional authority granted to the Judicial Council, we need not address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b58-9\"> Retired Associate Justice of the Court of Appeal, First District, sitting under assignment by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
