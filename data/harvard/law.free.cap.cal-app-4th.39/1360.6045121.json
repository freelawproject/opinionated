J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_-\">Handlery Hotels, Inc. (Handlery) appeals from the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Franchise Tax Board (the Board). (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c.) In its complaint, Handlery sought a refund of taxes, contending that it had overpaid its 1991 franchise tax. The only issue before this court is a purely legal one\u2014whether Handlery\u2019s 1991 franchise tax should be calculated using the California \u201cC corporation\u201d franchise tax rate of 9.3 percent set forth in California Revenue and Taxation Code section 23151, subdivision (d) or by using the California \u201cS corporation\u201d franchise tax rate of 2.5 percent set forth in former Revenue and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>Taxation Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 23802, subdivision (b)(1). The trial court held Handlery is foreclosed from obtaining a refund because its 1991 franchise tax was properly computed using the 9.3 percent \u201cC corporation\u201d rate. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">I. Facts and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The facts in this case have been stipulated\u2014it is the court\u2019s legal conclusion which is the subject of controversy. Prior to January 1, 1991, Handlery was a \u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201cC corporation.\u201d Effective January 1, 1991, Handlery qualified as, and properly elected to be treated as, an \u201cS corporation\u201d for purposes of taxation under California and federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">On or about October 4, 1991, Handlery timely filed its California corporation franchise tax return covering the income year January 1, 1990, through December 31, 1990. In its return, Handlery calculated its 1991 franchise tax liability using the ordinary franchise tax rate of 9.3 percent. Handlery paid, in a timely fashion, all of the tax liability shown on the return.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">The franchise tax is imposed on every nonfinancial corporation organized in California and foreign corporation doing business in California. (\u00a7 23151.1) It taxes that corporation\u2019s privilege of doing business in a given year (the taxable year), measured by a percentage of its net income in the immediately preceding year (the income year). <em>(Willamette Industries </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>(1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 528, 533 [154 Cal.Rptr. 183].) Generally, the franchise tax for the taxable year (1991) if over $800 is, and was here, prepaid in quarterly installments during the fourth, sixth, ninth, and twelfth months of the income year (1990). (\u00a7\u00a7 19023, 19025, &amp; 23153.)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">After Handlery filed its 1991 franchise tax return, it contended that it had overpaid its 1991 franchise tax. As a result of Handlery\u2019s 1991 \u201cS corporation\u201d election, it claims it should have computed its 1991 franchise tax based upon its 1990 net income, using the California \u201cS corporation\u201d franchise tax rate of 2.5 percent instead of the ordinary franchise tax rate of 9.3 percent. Accordingly in November 1992, Handlery filed with the Board an amended corporate franchise tax return for income year 1990 in which it claimed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>refund for the difference between the 9.3 percent franchise tax it paid and the 2.5 percent franchise tax it claimed it actually owed as a duly qualified California \u201cS corporation.\u201d Handlery\u2019s refund request was effectively denied by the Board\u2019s inaction, resulting in the current litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">To fully grasp the nature of the dispute, it is necessary to understand the tax structure governing California \u201cS corporations.\u201d A \u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201cC corporation\u201d pays tax on its income. If the corporate earnings are distributed to the shareholders in the form of dividends, the shareholders also pay a tax. This is the concept of \u201cdouble taxation\u201d of corporate income. The United States Congress enacted subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code to ameliorate the harsh \u201cdouble taxation\u201d consequences of operating a small business as a corporation. (Int.Rev. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1361-1379.)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Generally speaking, federal subchapter S election allows a qualifying \u201csmall business corporation\u201d to avoid paying income tax at the corporate level. (See Int.Rev. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1361(b) &amp; 1363(a).) Instead, each item of corporate income and expense is passed through the \u201cS corporation\u201d unchanged and reported on a pro rata basis on the tax returns of the individual shareholders of the \u201cS corporation.\u201d (See Int.Rev. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1363(a) &amp; 1366(b); <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1730, 1733, 1736-1737 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 88] <em>(Heller).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">For many years, California law provided no equivalent to \u201cS corporation\u201d status. However, effective in 1987, California first recognized \u201cS corporation\u201d status, amending the Code to generally conform to federal tax treatment of \u201cS corporations.\u201d (See \u00a7 23800 et seq.) One notable difference between California and federal law is that California continues to impose franchise taxes on \u201cS corporations,\u201d although at a rate substantially lower than that imposed on \u201cC corporations.\" (Cf. Int.Rev. Code, \u00a7 1363(a) and \u00a723802, subd. (b)(1).) Handlery conceded at oral argument that its 1990 corporate net income was not passed through and taxed to its shareholders as though it were an \u201cS corporation\u201d in that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">The parties stipulated to the relevant facts and filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Handlery argued that because it elected to become an \u201cS corporation\u201d in 1991, it was entitled in the 1991 taxable year to recalculate its franchise taxes, prepaid during the income year of 1990, by applying the \u201cS corporation\u201d rate of 2.5 percent rather than the \u201cC corporation\u201d rate of 9.3 percent to its 1990 net income. The Board countered that while Handlery\u2019s argument had \u201csuperficial appeal,\u201d the pertinent Code sections decreed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>once a corporation elected to be treated as an \u201cS corporation,\u201d the more favorable franchise tax rate applied to the first income year after \u201cS corporation\u201d status, in Handlery\u2019s case the 1991 income year.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">The trial court concluded that the pertinent provisions of the Code supported the Board\u2019s interpretation and could lead only to one conclusion\u2014 that a \u201c[C] Corporation such as . . . [Handlery] which elects to be an \u2018S Corporation\u2019 effective January 1, 1991 under the [Code] will apply the \u2018S corporation\u2019 rate to its 1991 income year and pay these taxes during the 1992 taxable year. During the 1991 taxable year the Corporation must pay the \u2018C corporation\u2019 rate for the 1990 income year because it was not yet a valid \u2018S corporation\u2019 under federal law during 1990.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The issue for decision is whether a taxpayer which validly elects to be an \u201cS corporation\u201d in 1991 is entitled to apply the reduced \u201cS corporation\u201d franchise tax rate to its 1990 income year in computing its 1991 franchise tax, as Handlery claims; or whether that reduced rate first applies to its 1991 income year which is used as a \u201cmeasuring rod\u201d for its 1992 franchise tax, as the Board claims. <em>(Title Ins. etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>(1956) 145 Cal.App.2d 60, 64 [302 P.2d 79] <em>(Title Ins.).) </em>We review this question de novo. <em>(Heller, supra, </em>21 Cal.App.4th at p. 1735.)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">It is obvious that we first turn to the Code to determine the merits of Handlery\u2019s refund claim. As already noted, California first recognized \u201cS corporation\u201d status (with a concomitant reduction of the franchise tax rate) in 1987. We find it instructive, as did the trial court, to review how the Legislature handled the bridge year, calendar year 1987, when many corporations doing business in California changed their status from \u201cC corporation\u201d to \u201cS corporation.\u201d By legislative terms then in effect, the favorable tax treatment inherent in \u201cS corporation\u201d status first applied \u201cFor any <em>income year </em>beginning on or after January 1, 1987 . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 23800, italics added.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The 1987 \u201cincome year\u201d language is repeated throughout section 23801 for the purpose of identifying when \u201cS corporation\u201d provisions go into effect. For example, under section 23801, subdivision (a)(2)(A), if a corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>already had a valid federal \u201cS corporation\" election in effect \u201cfor the <em>income year </em>beginning in 1987 . . \u201e the corporation was deemed to have made such an election for California purposes. (Italics added; see also \u00a7 23801, subd. (a)(2), (3), &amp; (4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">These statutes do not appear to be ambiguous. They uniformly point to one conclusion\u2014that once the \u201cS corporation\u201d election was first made in 1987, the application of the favorable franchise tax rate commenced in the 1987 <em>income year, </em>with 1988 being the first <em>taxable </em>year in which the reduced \u201cS corporation\u201d franchise tax rate would apply. There is no provision in the code which allows a corporation electing \u201cS corporation\u201d status in 1987 to apply the reduced franchise tax rate to the 1986 income year.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">According to Handlery, these sections are inapplicable since they were promulgated many years ago to address a unique problem\u2014transitioning ongoing businesses after adoption of \u201cS corporation\u201d legislation. As Handlery argues \u201cNeither \u00a7 23800, nor any other statute to which the [Board] can point, provides that \u00a7 23800\u2019s use of \u2018income year[,\u2019] whatever the intent as to 1987, was also intended to preclude 1991 or any other particular year after 1987 from being both an S corporation \u2018income\u2019 year and a \u2018taxable\u2019 year.\u201d (Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">We do not, however, so narrowly interpret the legislative framework as set out in section 23800 and related statutes. The obvious purpose for section 23801 was to outline a plan for computing the tax liability of continuing enterprises which, because of the availability of \u201cS corporation\u201d status, were suddenly permitted to take advantage of a more favorable franchise tax rate. This statute establishes that the \u201cS corporation\u201d rate should be initiated in the first income year <em>after </em>valid \u201cS corporation\u201d election. This is the precise issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">In any event, the use of the \u201cincome year\u201d as the benchmark for favorable \u201cS corporation\u201d tax treatment appears not only in the enacting legislation but is carried through to the present statutory scheme. In 1990, legislation was enacted amending section 23801. (Stats. 1990, ch. 1348, \u00a7 33, pp. 5849-5853.) One of the amended provisions governed notice of the filing or revocation of \u201cS corporation\u201d status. In relevant part, that legislation provided, \u201cFor <em>income years </em>beginning on or after January 1, 1990, if a corporation, which has in effect a valid \u2018S\u2019 election under ... the Internal Revenue Code, fails to make a \u2018C corporation\u2019 election . . . , the corporation shall be treated as an \u2018S corporation\u2019 pursuant to [the Code].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>5853, italics added; \u00a7 23801, subd. (g).) Once again, the Legislature consistently used the 1990 income year to implement 1990 amendments to section 23801. (See, e.g., \u00a723801, subds. (a)(4)(A), (a)(4)(C)(i), (a)(4)(D)(ii), (g); see generally, \u00a7 23058.)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">These provisions notwithstanding, Handlery argues that the controlling provision can be found in language referenced by the historical and statutory notes accompanying the 1987 \u201cS corporation\u201d legislation. That language appears at section 241 of Statutes 1987, chapter 1139, pages 4037-4038. It refers to the entire 1987 act of which the \u201cS corporation\u201d legislation was only a part, and states: \u201cThis act provides for a tax levy within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. However, <em>unless otherwise specifically provided, </em>the provisions of this act shall be applied in the computation of taxes for <em>taxable or income years </em>beginning on or after January 1, 1987.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">We cannot subscribe to Handlery\u2019s assertion that this oblique reference to \u201ctaxable or income years\u201d is consistent with a silent legislative intention to amend other statutes expressly establishing the first income year following \u201cS corporation\u201d election as the year in which that reduced franchise tax rate is applied to prepay the franchise tax for the succeeding taxable year. That section is neither expressly concerned with nor refers to \u201cS corporations\u201d or the franchise tax rate. Instead, it applies generally to the 1987 act, which includes provisions applying to taxes, other than franchise taxes, which have no \u201cincome year\u201d as an accounting period. (See, e.g., Stats. 1987, ch. 1139, \u00a7 3, p. 3963 [personal income tax of \u201cS corporation\u201d shareholders]; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 18, p. 3968 [tax on limited partnerships].) Consequently, we find the reference to \u201ctaxable or income years\u201d merely reflects that the object of the 1987 legislation involves taxes other than franchise taxes; and this court refuses to add to or alter the \u201cS corporation\u201d legislation to accomplish a purported legislative purpose that does not appear on the face of the \u201cS corporation\u201d legislation. Such a leap in statutory construction must be much more firmly grounded in a clearly articulated legislative purpose than can be discerned here.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Handlery also urges us to consider a number of published decisions which assertedly stand for the proposition that California courts have long recognized \u201cthat the franchise tax rate applicable to the calculation of the tax is the rate in effect in the corporation\u2019s \u2018taxable year\u2019 rather than its \u2018income year\u2019 . . . .\u201d (See, e.g., <em>Fullerton Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1934) 2 Cal.2d 162, 176-177 [39 P.2d 796]; <em>Title Ins., supra, </em>145 Cal.App.2d at p. 64.) None of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>the cases cited by Handlery specifically addresses the statutory provisions pertinent to this case. Instead, they supposedly advance persuasive common sense arguments in favor of Handlery\u2019s position in this matter. If strict enforcement of the express words of the Code was overridden on the basis of such authority, neither taxpayers nor tax officials could rely on the written word of the Code for guidance; and the already difficult task of interpreting the detailed rules prescribed for the assessment and collection of taxes would become impossible. Thus, the Legislature\u2019s repeated use of the next \u201cincome year\u201d to initiate application of the \u201cS corporation\u201d provisions must prevail over any general theory which would include the \u201ctaxable year\u201d in the measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">In any event, we perceive the Legislature had a sound practical basis for selecting the first income year after the year in which \u201cS corporation\u201d election is made for favorable tax treatment. If Handlery\u2019s construction were adopted and it were allowed to apply the lower franchise tax rate to its 1990 income year, the resulting computation could well result in a tax windfall to Handlery and its shareholders. As explained by the Attorney General and conceded at oral argument by Handlery, the 1990 corporate income at issue in this case was not \u201cpassed through\u201d to Handlery\u2019s shareholders to be reported on their personal tax returns precisely because in 1990 Handlery had not yet invoked its election to become a valid \u201cS corporation.\u201d Consequently, Handlery is attempting to apply the more favorable \u201cS corporation\u201d franchise tax rate to 1990 corporate income that was never taxed at the shareholder level.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">At oral argument, Handlery countered with the assertion that no windfall would result because, by seeking a refund of a portion of the 1991 franchise tax it prepaid in 1990, this tax savings would ultimately be passed through to its stockholders in the form of additional corporate income during the 1991 income year; and that if such refund is not paid, it gets no financial benefit from its 1991 \u201cS corporation\u201d election until taxable year 1992. First, whether a windfall would, thus, be averted is speculative. The record does not reflect that the officers and directors of Handlery have abandoned the right to exercise their discretion, by using all or a portion of such refund for corporate purposes other than a refund to stockholders. Second, adherence to this logic would improperly confer a double benefit on a taxpayer from its subchapter S election. First, Handlery would have the immediate financial benefit of its 1991 \u201cS corporation\u201d status in reducing its franchise tax payments for 1992 (prepaid in 1991) from the \u201cC corporation\u201d to the \u201cS corporation\u201d rate, thereby substantially reducing its cash outflow in 1991. In addition, Handlery would recover, as a further financial benefit, a substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>portion of its 1991 franchise tax paid in 1990 before \u201cS corporation\u201d status was achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">We detect no legislative intent to permit the refund Handlery seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">III. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"Aof\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">King, J., and Haning, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-9\"> Unless otherwise indicated, all subsequent statutory references are to the Revenue and Taxation Code (the Code). Unless otherwise noted, language cited from the Code has remained unchanged since 1991, the year at issue in this case. The \u201cS corporation\u201d rate was reduced to 1.5 percent as of January 1, 1994. (\u00a7 23802, subd.
