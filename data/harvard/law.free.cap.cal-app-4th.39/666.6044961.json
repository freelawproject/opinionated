After noticing that respondent was not wearing a seat belt, Officer Short made a traffic stop. Officer Short asked for respondent\u2019s driver\u2019s license. Respondent admitted that she didn\u2019t have her license with her. She verbally identified herself. Officer Short noted that respondent was under 21 years of age.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Officer Short detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the car. He also noticed that respondent\u2019s eyes were bloodshot. Respondent admitted that she had been drinking alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Officer Short conducted field sobriety tests and determined that respondent was not under the influence. He advised her of the \u201czero tolerance\u201d law. She agreed to take a PAS test. The first sample, given at 12:55 a.m., showed respondent\u2019s blood-alcohol level to be .056. The second sample, given at 12:56 a.m., showed her blood-alcohol level to be .055. Officer Short issued a temporary license endorsement which notified respondent that her driving privilege would be suspended in 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">Respondent requested an administrative hearing with the DMV. The hearing was held on April 14, 1994. At the hearing, respondent admitted that she had been drinking beer on the night she was stopped. Officer Short <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>testified about the PAS device used to test respondent but did not identify the brand or model of the device used. Officer Short testified that the device was issued to him in November or December of 1993. He said the device was brand new at that time. He received approximately two hours of training covering the operating procedures and the manual of the PAS device. Officer Short testified that the device has an internal calibration mechanism that advises the user if the device is not operable. The device requires calibration service about once a year. Officer Short testified that the manufacturer\u2019s representative found his particular device to be in calibration at the police chief\u2019s conference held in February of 1994. Officer Short stated that the PAS results are extremely close and consistent with the legal blood, urine or breath test results that are obtained in driving-under-the-influence arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The DMV upheld the suspension. Respondent petitioned for a writ of mandate. The trial court granted the petition, finding that the PAS test did not comply with title 17 of the California Code of Regulations and that the DMV failed to show the reliability of the test. The DMV filed a timely appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u201cUpon the driver\u2019s timely request, the Department must hold an administrative hearing at which the evidence is not limited to that presented at the prior administrative review.

In reaching our decision, we will make all legitimate and reasonable inferences in favor of the trial court\u2019s conclusion. <em>(Yakov </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 72; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 309.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The trial court decided that a PAS device used to enforce the zero tolerance law must comply with title 17 of the California Code of Regulations. For reasons we shall explain, we conclude that title 17 does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">A. <em>Zero Tolerance Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">We begin by reviewing the relevant statutory scheme. The zero tolerance law makes driving a vehicle unlawful for a person under the age of 21 years with a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.01 percent or greater. (\u00a723136, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under the zero tolerance law, the 0.01 percent blood-alcohol concentration is \u201cmeasured by a preliminary alcohol screening [PAS] test.\u201d (\u00a723136, subd. (a).) Specifically, section 23136 provides, \u201c(a) Notwithstanding Sections 23152 and 23153, it is unlawful for a person under the age of 21 years who has a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.01 or greater, as measured by a preliminary alcohol screening test, to drive a vehicle. . . . [U (b) A person shall be found to be in violation of subdivision (a) if the person was, at the time of driving, under the age of 21 years, and the trier of fact finds that the person had consumed an alcoholic beverage and was driving a vehicle with a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.01 percent or greater, as measured by a preliminary alcohol screening test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Under section 23136, subdivision (c)(1), \u201cAny person under the age of 21 years who drives a motor vehicle is deemed to have given his or her consent to a preliminary alcohol screening test for the purpose of determining the presence of alcohol in the person . . . .\u201d \u201cFor the purposes of this section, a preliminary alcohol screening test device is an instrument designed and used to measure the presence of alcohol in a person based on a breath sample.\u201d (\u00a7 23137, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">Violating the zero tolerance law is neither an infraction nor a public offense, as defined under Penal Code section 15. A zero tolerance law violation is subject only to civil penalties, to be administered by the DMV through specified civil administrative procedures. (\u00a7 23138.) Once a licensee is cited for violating the zero tolerance law, the DMV must then review the officer\u2019s sworn report and make a determination of the facts requiring suspension. This ruling is final unless the licensee timely requests a hearing pursuant to section 13558. (\u00a7 13557.) Upon the licensee\u2019s timely request, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>DMV must hold an administrative hearing at which the evidence is not limited to that presented at the prior administrative review. (\u00a7 13558, subd. (b).) Within 30 days of the issuance of the final notice of the DMV\u2019s determination sustaining the order of suspension of the licensee\u2019s driving privilege, the licensee may petition for judicial review. The court may only consider the evidence presented in the section 13558 hearing. (\u00a7 13559.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">B. <em>Interpretation of Zero Tolerance Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">To decide whether the trial court was correct in this case, we must interpret the zero tolerance law.  \u201cIn interpreting the language of a statute, we first turn to the words themselves.\u2019\u2019 <em>(Gikas </em>v. <em>Zolin </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 841, 854 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 500, 863 P.2d 745].) In construing a statute, \u201c[A] court should ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the law\u2019s purpose, and in determining intent the court first turns to the words used. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Overstreet </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 891, 895 [231 Cal.Rptr. 213, 726 P.2d 1288].) If \u201cstatutory language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for construction and courts should not indulge in it. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">In this case, section 23136\u2019s plain language demonstrates that the PAS test is the device the Legislature has chosen to enforce the zero tolerance law. Section 23136, subdivision (a) specifically states that the 0.01 blood-alcohol concentration is to be \u201cmeasured by a preliminary alcohol screening [PAS] test.\u201d (\u00a7 23136, subd. (a).) Section 23136, subdivision (b) provides that the trier of fact must consider whether the licensee was driving a vehicle with a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.01 percent \u201cas measured by a preliminary alcohol screening test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Further, section 23137\u2019s plain language shows that the PAS test is to be used to measure the <em>presence </em>of alcohol, rather than the particular blood-alcohol concentration. Under section 23137, subdivision (c), \u201ca preliminary alcohol screening test device <em>is an instrument designed and used to measure the presence of </em>alcohol in a person based on a breath sample.\" (\u00a7 23137, subd. (c), italics added.) Similarly, section 23136, subdivision (c)(1) provides that a person under age 21 who drives a motor vehicle is deemed to have consented to a PAS test \u201cfor the purpose of determining the <em>presence </em>of alcohol in the person . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">The legislative history of the zero tolerance law validates the plain language of the statutory scheme. The zero tolerance law was enacted to close the \u201cloophole\u201d which allowed persons under 18 years of age to drive a motor vehicle with a blood-alcohol content of less than 0.05 percent, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>allowed persons between 18 and 21 years of age to drive a motor vehicle with a blood-alcohol content of less than 0.08 percent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In acting to close this loophole, the Legislature decided <em>not </em>to require a test other than the PAS test as a method of enforcement. Senate Bill No. 689 initially required an officer who had reasonable cause to believe that a person under 21 years of age had consumed alcohol to offer that person the opportunity to take a chemical test of his or her blood, breath or urine. (Sen. Bill No. 689 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) May 4, 1993.) If a chemical test was requested, the officer would then transport the person to the nearest authorized testing facility. <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, the California State Sheriff\u2019s Association opposed this version of the bill, \u201cbecause the procedure proposed is \u2018lengthy, costly and time consuming.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The bill was subsequently amended to require only that the officer \u201crequest that the person take a preliminary alcohol screening test to determine the presence of alcohol in the person . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 23137, subd. (a).) Thus, the officer was no longer required to offer a chemical test or transport the person to an authorized testing facility. In this way, the process was streamlined, and officers could simply cite and release the zero tolerance law violators.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">When first amendments to Senate Bill No. 689 were offered, the Legislature considered arguments regarding the reliability of the PAS test. \u201cAre prosecuting attorneys able to establish sufficient foundation for admissibility of PAS devices? Are PAS devices so scientifically reliable that results are generally admissible in a criminal proceeding? Even though this bill relates to administrative proceedings as opposed to a criminal proceeding, should people lose a privilege based on evidence that may not generally be admissible, whose scientific reliability has not been demonstrated and which may not preserve an independent sample for testing? If the PAS [test] result is positive, but the person is not impaired enough to be arrested for driving under the influence, should the person be offered a chemical test for later use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>at the administrative hearing?\u201d (Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 689 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) July 13, 1993.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Thus, the legislative history reveals a recognition of possible foundational problems associated with the PAS test. Despite this recognition, the Legislature did not impose any foundation requirements within the law, but left it as it was, specifically directing that the 0.01 percent threshold be gauged by a PAS test. In addition, prior to the 1994 amendments, section 23137, subdivision (a)(2) provided that \u201cIf a preliminary alcohol screening test device is not immediately available, this section shall not apply to a person between 18 and 21 years of age with a blood alcohol concentration of less than 0.08 percent, by weight, nor to a person under 18 years of age with a blood-alcohol concentration of less than 0.05 percent, by weight.\u201d The 1994 amendments deleted this provision, recognizing that it was duplicative, but still included the provision requiring that the licensee take a PAS test, if one \u201cis immediately available.\u201d (\u00a723137, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The Senate Judiciary Committee considered and rejected certain amendments to the zero tolerance law. The committee comments, dated May 4, 1993, noted: \u201cAmendments not to consider\u201d \u201c1. Raise to .02\u2014cite and release wouldn\u2019t work. Officer would <em>have </em>to administer chemical test. . . .\u201d (Italics in original.) By designating the PAS test as the proper testing device, and by keeping .01 as the threshold blood-alcohol level, the Legislature made clear that the zero tolerance law meant just that\u2014zero tolerance. To this end, the Legislature directed that the PAS test be used to detect the presence of alcohol, rather than a particular quantification.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">A PAS test reading of 0.01 is the functional equivalent of zero tolerance. A 0.01 reading represents the threshold level for the presence of alcohol in the blood. Under title 17 of California Code of Regulations section 1221.5, \u201cResults of breath alcohol analysis shall be expressed as set forth in Section 1220.4.\u201d Section 1220.4, subdivision (b) states, \u201cAnalytical results shall be reported to the second decimal place, deleting the digit in the third decimal place when it is present.\u201d Section 1220.4, subdivision (c) provides that \u201cBlood alcohol concentrations less than 0.01% in living subjects may be reported as negative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Accordingly, it is a legal impossibility to express a blood-alcohol concentration below 0.01 percent. To do so would require reporting to the third decimal place. The provision that blood-alcohol concentration less than 0.01 percent shall be reported as negative is tantamount to recognizing that 0.01 percent is the threshold level for reporting the presence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>From this history, it is clear the Legislature specifically mandated that the PAS test be used to enforce the zero tolerance law. The Legislature directed police officers to use the PAS test to detect the presence of alcohol in the blood. This Legislative direction shows the Legislature\u2019s approval of the reliability of the PAS test as a device for measuring the presence of alcohol in the blood. Given the Legislature\u2019s repeated reference to the PAS test within the zero tolerance law, and its repeated direction that the device be used to measure the presence of alcohol in the blood, rather than a particular blood-alcohol concentration, we conclude that the Legislature has found the PAS test to be a reliable method for enforcing the zero tolerance law.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">C. <em>Foundational Requirements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Even though the Legislature has authorized the use of the PAS test, when a PAS test is used to subject the licensee to administrative penalties, it seems clear that there must be some basis for believing in the accuracy of the particular PAS device used to screen that licensee\u2019s blood for the presence of alcohol.  According to the trial court, the PAS device was required to comply with sections 1215 through 1222.2 of title 17 of the California Code of Regulations. Those sections set forth standards for forensic alcohol analysis and breath-alcohol analysis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Article 7 of the rules sets forth the requirements for breath-alcohol analysis, including standards for procedures (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, \u00a7\u00a7 1221.1, 1221.4) instrument performance standards (\u00a7 1221.2), and approved instruments (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, \u00a7 1221.3). (Cf. <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 133, 142 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 818].) \u201cCompliance with the regulations establishes both a foundation for admission of test results into evidence in any proceeding and a basis for finding such results to be legally sufficient evidence to support the requisite findings in such proceeding.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Under California Code of Regulations, title 17, section 1221.2, it is provided that instruments for breath-alcohol analysis <em>\u201cshall </em>meet the following standard: [H (1) The instrument and any related accessories <em>shall </em>be capable of conforming to the \u2018Model Specifications For <em>Evidential Breath Testing Devices' </em>of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA] of the U.S. Department of Transportation, which were published in the Federal Register, Vol. 49, No. 242, Pages 48854-48872, December 14, 1984, and are hereby adopted and incorporated.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, \u00a7 1221.2, subd. (a)(1), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">It is well established that the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in a statute or regulation is ordinarily construed as mandatory. <em>(Common Cause </em>v. <em>Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number><em>Supervisors </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 432, 443 [261 Cal.Rptr. 574, <em>777 </em>P.2d 610]; <em>Long Beach Police Officers Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 736, 743 [250 Cal.Rptr. 869, 759 P.2d 504].) Thus, under California Code of Regulations, title 17, section 1221.2, the breath-analysis instruments shall be capable of conforming to federal specifications for evidential breath testing devices (EBT\u2019s). Under 49 Federal Register 48854 (Dec. 14, 1984), EBT\u2019s are \u201cinstruments which measure the alcohol content of deep lung breath samples with sufficient accuracy for evidential purposes.\u201d In 1984, the NHTSA established specifications for the performance and testing of EBT\u2019s. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Under California Code of Regulations, title 17, section 1221.3, only instruments and related accessories named in the \u201cConforming Products List\u201d published in the Federal Register by the NHTSA \u201cshall be used for breath alcohol analysis in this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Is a PAS device an EBT? Was the type of PAS device used in this case on the NHTSA conforming products list? The record does not reveal the model of the PAS device used to test respondent. Moreover, we note that the NHTSA has recently published <em>separate </em>model specifications for the performance and testing of <em>alcohol-screening </em>devices, as opposed to EBT\u2019s. (59 Fed.Reg. 39382 (Aug. 2, 1994).) These specifications were established, in part to \u201csupport State laws that target youthful offenders (i.e., \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 laws). . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The NHTSA noted that the model specifications for alcohol-screening devices differed from the specifications for EBTs, and that the new specifications are designed to \u201ctest whether devices are suitable for screening, not evidential, purposes. . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The NHTSA specifications provide that such screening devices \u201cuse bodily fluids to detect the presence <em>of 0.020 </em>or more BAG with sufficient accuracy for screening purposes.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Under the specifications, \u201cbodily fluid\u201d includes, but is not limited to, \u201cblood, exhaled deep lung breath and saliva.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>With respect to the temperature range for testing, the screening device specifications are actually more severe than those imposed for EBT\u2019s. This is because tests performed with EBT\u2019s are usually performed indoors, while tests using screening devices may be performed \u201coutside in widely varying temperature conditions.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, even if the device used in this case matched the EBT conforming list, that fact would not establish that the model or brand used would perform properly when used outside in widely varying temperature conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>As is evident, the NHTSA has distinguished between EBT\u2019s and alcohol-screening devices. Under the NHTSA specifications, the screening devices \u201cscreen\u201d for the <em>presence </em>of alcohol. Further, the NHTSA specifications were developed, in part, to support state zero tolerance laws. Thus, these alcohol-screening device specifications seem more consistent with California\u2019s zero tolerance law, since our law expressly refers to PAS devices, and expressly emphasizes that the PAS devices are to be used to detect the presence of alcohol, rather than a particular blood-alcohol concentration. On the other hand, under the zero tolerance law, the PAS test results are to be used for evidential purposes, since the PAS test is the method the Legislature has chosen to enforce the zero tolerance law.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">After careful consideration, we do not believe title 17 of the California Code of Regulations applies to PAS devices. The title 17 regulations generally define \u201cbreath alcohol analysis\u201d as an analysis of a breath sample, using a breath testing instrument, \u201cin order to determine the <em>concentration </em>of ethyl alcohol in the person\u2019s blood.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, \u00a7 1215.1, subd. (c), italics added.) As noted, the Legislature has mandated that the PAS device be used to detect the <em>presence </em>of alcohol, rather than a particular blood-alcohol concentration. Similarly, \u201cinstruments\u201d or \u201cdevices\u201d referred to within title 17 mean \u201cany item or combination of items of equipment used to make a <em>measurement of alcohol concentration </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1215.1, subd. (j), italics added.) Thus, the title 17 regulations appear focused upon a particular blood-alcohol concentration. The PAS device, on the other hand, is aimed at detecting the <em>\u201cpresence of alcohol </em>in the person . . . .\u201d(\u00a723136, subd. (c)(1), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Moreover, Health and Safety Code section 436.52 provides that \u201cThe testing of breath samples by or for law enforcement agencies <em>for purposes of determining the concentration of ethyl alcohol in the blood </em>of persons involved in traffic accidents or in traffic violations shall be performed in accordance with regulations adopted by the State Department of Health Services. The rules and regulations shall establish the procedures to be used by law enforcement agencies in administering breath tests for the <em>purposes of determining the concentration of ethyl alcohol in a person\u2019s blood. </em>. . .\u201d (Italics added.) Thus, section 436.52, which imposed a duty upon the State Department of Public Health to adopt the regulations set forth in title 17 of the California Code of Regulations specified that the regulations adopted would apply to breath tests used to determine the concentration of alcohol in a person\u2019s blood. Given that the PAS device is to be used to detect alcohol presence, rather than concentration, section 436.52 also supports our conclusion that title 17 does not apply to PAS devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>California Code of Regulations title 17\u2019s reference to the conforming products list also supports our conclusion. As noted above, under California Code of Regulations, title 17, section 1221.3, only instruments and related accessories \u201cnamed in the \u2018Conforming Products List\u2019 \u201d \u201cshall be used for breath alcohol analysis in this State.\u201d The reference to \u201cconforming products list\u201d refers to the list for EBT\u2019s, initially published in 1984, well before California\u2019s zero tolerance law was enacted, and therefore well before the Legislature had decided to use PAS devices as a method of proving a violation of the law. Given this fact, it is unlikely that the title 17 regulations were meant to apply to PAS devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The fact that the PAS device is not used as evidence of section 23140, 23152, or 23153 violations also indicates that PAS devices are not covered by California Code of Regulations title 17. Under section 23157, a PAS device may be used \u201cas a further investigative tool\u201d and to assist the officer in determining whether there is probable cause to arrest a person for violating section 23140, 23152, or 23153. (\u00a723157, subd. (h)(1) and (2).)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under section 23157, subdivision (h)(2), the Legislature has specifically provided that a person\u2019s obligation to take a blood, breath, or urine test is not satisfied by the fact that the person took a PAS test. Accordingly, if title 17 was meant to apply to PAS devices, then these limits upon their use would be unnecessary since the PAS devices would be subject to the same title 17 evidentiary regulations as devices used to conduct blood, urine, or breath tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In 1989, the Attorney General\u2019s Office concluded that California Code of Regulations title 17 did not apply to PAS devices: \u201cThe plain wording of Health and Safety Code section 436.52 requires . . . breath testing by law enforcement agencies to conform to the [title 17] regulations. The only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>exception to the equipment and procedure requirements of the regulations for law enforcement use of breath tests are tests which do not determine the concentration of ethyl alcohol in the blood. A [preliminary breath test] device which only indicates the presence of ethyl alcohol without giving any indication of the concentration of alcohol in the sample would not be subject to the statute or regulations.\u201d (72 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 226, 230 (1989).) The Attorney General\u2019s Office also concluded, \u201cIt is apparent that the [title 17] regulations were designed to regulate the gathering of evidence of the concentration of alcohol in the defendant\u2019s blood for use at his or her trial on drunk driving charges and did not contemplate the use of breath testing for such preliminary purposes as providing a peace officer with probable cause to believe a driver was under the influence of an alcoholic beverage which would justify the driver\u2019s arrest for drunk driving. . . . The regulations could authorize the use of different equipment and procedures on breath testing for preliminary purposes. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 231-232.)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">From the foregoing, we conclude that California Code of Regulations title 17 does not apply to PAS devices. The emphasis upon blood-alcohol concentration as opposed to the presence of alcohol in the blood, the fact that PAS devices have a limited evidentiary value in prosecuting driving under the influence violations, the reference to the NETS A specifications for EBT\u2019s, and the reference to the companion conforming products list, which was established before the zero tolerance law was enacted, all indicate that the title 17 regulations were not meant to cover PAS devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Having decided that the California Code of Regulations title 17 regulations do not apply to the PAS test, we must determine how the reliability of the PAS device is to be tested. Since the Legislature has directed the police to use the PAS device to determine the presence of alcohol in the blood, we believe that the legislative mandate provides an unambiguous basis for believing that the PAS test is, in general, a reliable way to enforce the zero tolerance law. However, the reliability of the particular PAS device used in a particular case must still be proved.  An officer\u2019s sworn statement that, when tested, a licensee\u2019s PAS test showed the presence of alcohol in the licensee\u2019s blood is legally sufficient evidence \u201cif and only if there is a basis for believing that the test which [detected] blood alcohol was reliable.\u201d <em>(Davenport </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.4th at p. 140.) \u201cIn general, the foundational prerequisites for admissibility of testing results are that (1) the particular apparatus utilized was in proper working order, (2) the test used was properly administered, and (3) the operator was competent and qualified.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 559, 561 [131 Cal.Rptr. 190]; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>also <em>Davenport, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.4th 133, 140; <em>Coombs </em>v. <em>Pierce </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 568, 576 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 249].) For the PAS test results to be admissible to show a zero tolerance law violation, these requirements must be satisfied. It is the DMV\u2019s burden to show that the requirements are met. (Cf. <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 549.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Due process demands no less.  \u201cWhen the state acts to deprive a citizen of a protectible property right, thus triggering due process protections, the issue of what process is due is determined by balancing the following factors: (1) the private interest affected by the official action; (2) the risk of the erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; (3) the dignity interest in informing individuals of the nature, grounds and consequences of the action and in enabling them to present their side of the story before a responsible government official and (4) the governmental interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that additional or substitute procedural requirements would entail.\u201d <em>(Davenport </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, 6 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 143-144, citing <em>In re Malinda S. </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 368, 383 [272 Cal.Rptr. 787, 795 P.2d 1244]; <em>In re Jackson </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 501, 510-511 [233 Cal.Rptr. 911, 731 P.2d 36].)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Applying these considerations to the zero tolerance law, we note the following. A violation of the zero tolerance law subjects the violator to civil penalties. Violating the zero tolerance law is neither an infraction nor a public offense, as defined within section 15 of the Penal Code. In addition, since the process is administrative, the evidentiary standards are somewhat relaxed. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11513, subd. (c).) It is permissible for the state to resort to summary suspension proceedings to regulate the use of the driving privilege and to protect the public against its abuse. <em>(Davenport </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, 6 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 139.) However, a driver\u2019s license is still a protectible property interest. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The considerations \u201cjustifying summary proceedings are not so great as to allow the suspension of a license absent a showing by substantial competent evidence of facts supporting the suspension.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Moreover, attacking the reliability of the PAS test may be the licensee\u2019s only real way of defending against a zero tolerance law violation. To conclude that the DMV need not establish a foundation for the admission of the PAS tests would severely hamper the licensee\u2019s ability to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u201cIn proceedings to suspend or revoke a driver\u2019s license, the facts necessary to justify suspension can be established by the use of the sworn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>statement of the arresting officer, attesting to matters within the officer\u2019s personal knowledge, even though the officer does not personally appear and the licensee offers contrary proof. [Citations.] However, it does not necessarily follow from the mere fact that the officer\u2019s sworn statement is admissible and competent evidence under an exception to the hearsay rule that every matter in the sworn statement is admissible and legally sufficient to support a finding. Each matter sworn to must itself be supported by an adequate foundation of personal knowledge by the officer and any other appropriate guarantee of reliability, or that matter is not admissible and cannot be relied upon. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Davenport </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.4th at pp. 139-140.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u201cAn officer\u2019s sworn statement that, when tested, a licensee\u2019s BAG [blood-alcohol concentration] was at a particular level is admissible, legally sufficient evidence that the BAC was indeed at that level if and only if there is a basis for believing that the test which measured blood alcohol was reliable. In general, the foundational requirements for establishing the reliability of test results consist of a showing that (1) the apparatus utilized was in proper working order, (2) the test used was properly administered, and (3) the operator was competent and qualified.\u201d <em>(Davenport </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.4th at p. 140.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In <em>Davenport, </em>the court noted that blood-alcohol tests admitted as evidence in a section 13558 hearing must comply with California Code of Regulations title 17. Under Evidence Code section 664, there is a presumption that official duty has been regularly performed. Relying upon this \u201cofficial duty\u201d presumption, the <em>Davenport </em>court held that there is a rebut-table presumption that blood-alcohol tests reported upon official forms were obtained in compliance with governing statutes and regulations, namely title 17. (6 Cal.App.4th at p. 142.) The burden is then upon the licensee to show the \u201cnonexistence of the foundational trustworthiness of the report as a whole, and in particular, the nonexistence of the foundational reliability of tests upon which the report is partly based.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 143; see also <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 519, 525 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 18]; <em>Imachi </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 809, 816-817 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 478].)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Of course, in this case, we cannot rely upon the \u201cofficial duty\u201d presumption. As we\u2019ve already discussed, California Code of Regulations title 17 does not apply to the PAS test. Thus, there are no \u201cgoverning statutes or regulations\u201d regulating the testing and reliability of the PAS test. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>absence of such regulations, we cannot presume that the PAS test results are reliable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, it is the DMV\u2019s burden to show that the PAS test meets general foundational requirements. <em>(Santos </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 549.) Again, those requirements consist of a showing that \u201c(1) the apparatus utilized was in proper working order, (2) the test used was properly administered, and (3) the operator was competent and qualified.\u201d <em>(Davenport </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, 6 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 140.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In this case, Officer Short testified that the device was issued to him in November or December of 1993. Officer Short said the device was brand new at that time. He received approximately two hours of training covering the operating procedures and the manual of the PAS device. Officer Short testified that the device has an internal calibration mechanism that advises the user if the device is not operable. The device requires calibration service about once a year. Officer Short testified that the manufacturer\u2019s representative found his particular device to be in calibration at the police chief\u2019s conference held in February of 1994. Officer Short stated that the PAS results are extremely close and consistent with the legal blood, urine or breath test results that are obtained in driving under the influence arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">This showing did not establish the reliability of the PAS device used to test respondent. First, the testimony did not show the apparatus was in proper working order. There was no testimony about how the device was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>maintained or whether the standards for calibration were established. Officer Short\u2019s testimony that he was told by someone else in February 1994 that the device was properly calibrated is insufficient. Second, there was no evidence showing that the test was properly administered, or evidence explaining how the PAS device should be administered. Finally, the testimony did not prove that Officer Short was competent and qualified. Officer Short\u2019s training consisted of only two hours, covering the training manual and operating procedures of the device. As the trial court noted, \u201c[Officer Short\u2019s] training certainly wasn\u2019t what the normal officers will receive in the use of these devices.\u201d In addition, when questioned, Officer Short testified that there were no records relating to the machine, and admitted that \u201c[he didn\u2019t] know scientifically if the mechanism in there was functioning properly. . . .\u201d Officer Short was asked, \u201cAll you know is you turned it [the PAS device] on and the little digits came up, you blew in it and something happened, is that correct?\u201d Officer Short responded, \u201cCorrect.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that the reliability of the PAS test was not established.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The judgment granting respondent\u2019s petition for a writ of mandate is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Premo, Acting P.

We are not persuaded. First, as already noted, there is nothing in the record to show what particular type of PAS device was used here. Second, even if this was a \u201cfuel-cell\u201d device, at least one commentator has noted that these type of PAS devices pose problems because of their lack of specificity for ethanol. Hydrocarbons other than ethanol, such as methane, carbon monoxide, acetaldehyde, and gasoline fumes, can be oxidized in a fuel cell. Oxidation of these nonethanol hydrocarbons will cause a measurable current, just as with ethanol. Thus, a false positive reading is possible. Although it has been argued that none of these other substances, alone, could give a false positive reading of blood-alcohol content, this argument does not consider the potential additive effect of these substances, either working alone or in combination. Thus, although the nonethanol substances may independently produce a reading below the legal threshold, if those substances combine with a borderline blood-alcohol content, a false positive could conceivably be produced. In any event, we simply note that the reliability of such devices appears subject to some dispute.
