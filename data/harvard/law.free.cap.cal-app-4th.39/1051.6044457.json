J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atx\">In this case we consider whether corporate depositors may pursue causes of action against their bank for the negligent payment of forged checks when they failed to discover and report the forgeries to the bank in a timely manner. We hold that the statutory provisions of the California Uniform Commercial Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> preclude the depositors from asserting the forged checks against the bank and this preclusion is fatal to their claims for the negligent payment of forged checks not timely reported to the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">Plaintiffs Roy Supply, Inc. (Roy Supply), R.M.R. Drywall, Inc. (Drywall), and Edward Roy (Roy), appeal from a judgment of dismissal entered after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>the trial court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer of defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the Bank). Although we conclude that the trial court properly sustained the Bank\u2019s demurrer, we shall reverse the judgment of dismissal as to the corporate plaintiffs and remand with directions that they be given leave to amend their complaint on the question of timeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Also at issue on appeal is the question whether the trial court properly ruled that plaintiff Roy does not have an individual cause of action in negligence against the Bank for cashing the forged checks. Because the forged checks were drawn on the corporate plaintiffs\u2019 checking accounts, and because the Bank had no commercial relationship with Roy involving those accounts, we shall hold that the Bank did not owe a duty of care to Roy personally and consequently the demurrer was properly sustained without leave to amend as to Roy\u2019s individual cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The underlying action involves the commercial checking accounts of plaintiffs Roy Supply and Drywall with the Bank. The corporate plaintiffs authorized their checking accounts to be debited for checks drawn in accordance with signature cards submitted to the Bank. These signature cards authorized withdrawals from the accounts only by order of checks or drafts bearing the signatures of both Roy and Twila June Moore.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At all relevant times, Roy was president, chief executive officer and a shareholder of the corporate plaintiffs. Moore was the secretary and treasurer of the corporate plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Over a period spanning several years, the Bank honored over $3 million in checks drawn against the corporate plaintiffs\u2019 accounts which had been drawn by Moore in an irregular manner. On most of these checks Roy\u2019s signature had been forged by Moore. On the remaining checks, Roy\u2019s signature was missing altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Plaintiffs filed a nine-count complaint in March 1992. In a first amended complaint filed in April 1993, plaintiffs eliminated claims based on checks which they conceded were time-barred or which served legitimate corporate purposes, thereby reducing the Bank\u2019s potential liability to slightly over $2 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">Three of the counts in the amended complaint are based on a negligence theory. These three counts are the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>The fifth and sixth counts allege the Bank negligently maintained its records and negligently operated, managed and controlled its check processing operations so as to allow checks drawn with a forged signature to be charged against the corporate plaintiffs\u2019 accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The ninth count sought damages suffered by Roy as president of the corporate plaintiffs. It was there alleged that as a proximate result of the Bank\u2019s negligence, the corporate plaintiffs lacked sufficient funds to pay state and federal taxes for the tax years 1988 through 1991 (federal tax years) and 1989 through 1991 (state tax years), and Roy was personally required to satisfy the federal and state tax liability of the corporate plaintiffs. As a result, Roy was injured in his \u201chealth, strength, activity and marital relations, sustaining injury to his nervous system and person, all of which injuries have caused . . . Roy great mental, physical and nervous pain and suffering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The Bank successfully demurred to the fifth and sixth counts to the extent they related to the corporate plaintiffs\u2019 claim of negligence as to checks drawn with a forged signature. The Bank argued, and the trial court agreed, that the corporate plaintiffs\u2019 common law negligence remedy was supplanted by the remedies available in the Commercial Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The Bank also successfully demurred to Roy\u2019s individual cause of action for negligence, as set forth in the ninth count, ruling it was legally insufficient because the Bank did not owe a duty of care to Roy individually as he was not a customer of the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Thereafter, the parties settled the remaining claims not affected by the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">In October 1993, the trial court dismissed the first amended complaint, effectively terminating the entire action. Plaintiffs appeal from the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">In the fifth and sixth causes of action, as relevant here, the corporate plaintiffs seek recovery for the negligent payment of forged checks. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>sustaining the demurrer the trial court held, as a matter of law, that the corporate plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim was \u201cprecluded by the Commercial [C]ode as displaced by the warranty rights created thereby.\u201d  The plaintiffs contend on appeal that the Code does not foreclose their right to pursue a common law negligence cause of action for payment of forged checks and that the three-year statute of limitations applicable to negligent injury to personal property (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 338, subd. (c)), is the controlling limitation in that respect. To this argument the Bank responds that sections 1103 and 4406, subdivision (4), support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that a common law negligence action is foreclosed by the Code. As we shall explain, the Code, in sections 1103 and 4406, subdivision (4), precludes a customer from asserting a forgery against the bank unless the customer discovers and notifies the bank of the forgery within one year of receiving a statement of account showing payment of the forged check.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Section 1103 provides: \u201cUnless displaced by the particular provisions of this code, the principles of law and equity, including the law merchant and the law relative to capacity to contract, principal and agent, estoppel, fraud, misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake, bankruptcy, or other validating or invalidating cause shall supplement its provisions.\u201d This provision has been described by commentators as \u201cprobably the most important single provision in the Code. It continues the applicability of general principles of law and equity except insofar as they are \u2018displaced by particular provisions\u2019 of the Code. Thus many branches of general contract law, of the law of agency, of property law, etc., continue to apply under the Code.\u201d (1 White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code (3d ed. 1988) Introduction, \u00a7 5, p. 19.) As the comment to the Commercial Code makes clear, section 1103 \u201crestates with greater detail the principle that the general law applies when a case is not covered by statute.\u201d (Cal. U. Com. Code com., 23A West\u2019s Ann. Cal. U. Com. Code, \u00a7 1103 (1964 ed.) p. 20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">We agree with the Bank that \u201cparticular provisions\u201d of the Code are applicable here and that, for the most part, they preclude recovery for negligent payment of forged checks in the circumstances of this case. Divisions 3 and 4 of the Code contain detailed statutory provisions governing the relationship between banks and customers with respect to checks.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In particular, division 4 (\u00a7 4101 et seq.) is entitled \u201cBank Deposits and Collections\u201d and \u201cprovides uniform rules governing the (1) collection by banks of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>checks and other instruments for the payment of money and (2) relationship of banks with their depositors in connection with the collection and payment of items.\u201d (Introductory com., 23B West\u2019s Ann. Cal. U. Com. Code, div. 4 (1964 ed.) p. 513.) We turn to those rules governing forged checks.* *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Our discussion of these provisions requires that we first set forth a few basic definitions. A \u201ccheck\u201d is a draft drawn on a bank and payable on demand. (\u00a7\u00a7 3104, subd. (2)(b), 4104, subd. (3).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A \u201cpresentment\u201d is a demand for acceptance or payment of the check made upon the person or entity responsible for payment. (\u00a7\u00a7 3504, subd. (1), 4104, subd. (3).) The bank upon which the check is drawn and by which it is payable is referred to as the drawee or \u201cpayor bank.\u201d (\u00a7 4105, subd. (b).) When a maker or drawer issues a check in favor of a payee, that person will generally submit the check to a bank which may or may not be the payor bank. Regardless whether it is also the payor bank, the first bank to which a check is submitted for collection is called the \u201cdepositary bank.\u201d (\u00a7 4105, subd. (a).) If the depositary bank is not also the payor bank, it will present the check to the payor bank either directly or through one or more \u201cintermediary banks,\u201d defined as any bank to which the check is transferred in the course of collection except the depositary bank and the payor bank. (\u00a7 4105, subd. (c).) In this process any bank handling the check for collection, including the depositary bank but excluding the payor bank, is referred to as a \u201ccollecting bank.\u201d (\u00a7 4105, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">In the check collection process the duties and liabilities of a bank depend upon its definitional status, with particular distinctions drawn between payor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>banks and collecting banks. A collecting bank is required to exercise ordinary care in presenting a check or sending it for presentment; sending notice of dishonor or nonpayment or returning the check after learning that the check has not been paid or accepted; settling for a check when the bank receives final settlement;* ***<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> making and providing for any necessary protest; and notifying its transferor of any loss or delay in transit. (\u00a7 4202, subd. (l)(a), (b), (c), (d) &amp; (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">In this process there are certain statutory warranties deemed to be made by each customer and collecting bank. (\u00a7 4207.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These warranties run from the customer and depositary bank through any intermediary banks to the payor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>bank. The warranties which run to the payor bank, however, are more limited in nature than those which run to the intermediary banks. (Cf. \u00a7 4207, subds. (1) and (2).) Upon dishonor an intermediary bank can look to its transferor to reverse the transaction and take up the item. (\u00a7 4207, subd. (2).) In this manner the item may be returned up the chain of transferors to the depositary bank, which must then seek recourse from its customer. However, if the payor bank honors the item and makes payment, it can seek recovery from earlier transferors only to the extent of a breach of warranty. But the warranties made to the payor bank are limited in nature and are affected by the concept of a holder in due course.* **<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, as a practical matter, the payor bank that honors a check and makes payment will seldom have recourse against any collecting bank. (See 1 White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 15-3, pp. 751-753.) However, a payor bank that makes payment on a check may have rights in subrogation to the extent it has suffered loss by reason of its payment of the check.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The rights and liabilities of a payor bank and its checking account customer are not expressed in terms of warranty. Under the Code, a payor bank must act in good faith and with ordinary care. (\u00a7 4103.) It must act promptly to determine whether a check should be honored. (\u00a7\u00a7 4301-4302.) And the bank is liable to its customer for any damages proximately caused by wrongful dishonor of an item, although damages are limited to actual damages if the dishonor occurs through mistake. (\u00a7 4402.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>In the check paying process, a payor bank \u201cmay charge against the account of a customer an item that is properly payable from that account even though the charge creates an overdraft.\u201d (\u00a7 4401, subd. (a), Stats. 1992, ch. 914, \u00a7 40.) However, under the Code no person is liable for a check unless his signature appears thereon and thus an unauthorized signature is wholly inoperative as that of the person whose name is signed unless he ratifies it or is precluded from denying it. (\u00a7\u00a73401, 3404.)  Consequently, \u201c. . . a check with an unauthorized signature is not properly payable, and the bank breaches its agreement with its customer when paying such an item.\u201d <em>(Danning </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 961, 969 [199 Cal.Rptr. 163], disapproved on another ground in <em>In re Marriage of Arcenaux </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1130, 1137-1138 [275 Cal.Rptr. 797, 800 P.2d 1227].) Thus it is said that \u201c[t]he relationship between a payor bank and its customers is that of debtor and creditor, being founded upon contract, and the bank is under a duty to pay checks only in strict accordance with its customer\u2019s orders. [Citation.] The bank is without authority to charge its customer\u2019s account with an unauthorized order, and payment of such is said to have been made out of the bank\u2019s own funds.\u201d <em>(Danning </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>151 Cal.App.3d at p. 969.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The rule that a payor bank cannot charge a customer\u2019s account in the absence of an authorized signature operates to impose liability on the bank for payment of a forged check regardless of the quality of the forgery. \u201cUnder the Code, the drawer cannot be liable since his valid signature does not appear on the instrument. U.C.C. \u00a7 3-401(1). Nor can the drawer bank charge the drawer\u2019s account, since a forged signature is not \u2018properly payable\u2019 under U.C.C. \u00a7 4-401(1). Another basis for the drawee bank\u2019s liability to the drawer is said to lie in their contractual relationship; there is an express or implied agreement between the drawee bank and the depositor that the bank will only charge the depositor\u2019s account according to his order. [Citations.] If the bank pays an instrument with a forged signature, contrary to the depositor\u2019s order or without his authority, the bank is said to have paid from its own funds rather than from the depositor\u2019s account.\u201d (Hinchey, <em>An Analysis of Bank Defenses to Check Forgery and Alteration Claims under Uniform Commercial Code Articles 3 and 4: Claimants\u2019 Negligence and Failure to Give Notice </em>(1982) 10 Pepp. L.Rev. 2, 3, fn. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">A payor bank\u2019s initial liability to its customer for making payment of a check on a forged signature is absolute; that is, it applies without regard to whether the bank exercised due care or was negligent or worse. However, this absolute liability is temporally limited. Section 4406, which we have set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>out in full in the margin,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> imposes a duty on a customer to discover and report promptly an unauthorized signature or alteration. Under section 4406, subdivision (1), when a bank sends or makes available a statement of account accompanied by items paid in good faith, then the customer must exercise reasonable care and promptness to examine the statement and the items to discover any unauthorized signature or any alteration of an item and must promptly notify the bank of any such discovery. When a customer fails to fulfill his or her duty to discover and report a forgery then the customer may not assert the forgery against the bank if the bank has suffered loss thereby, and may not assert subsequent forgeries by the same wrongdoer which were paid by the bank in good faith after the customer had a reasonable time, not to exceed 14 days, to discover and report the forgery. However, subject to the one-year period discussed below, these preclusions do not apply if the customer establishes a lack of ordinary care on the part of the bank in paying the item or items. Under these provisions a payor bank\u2019s absolute liability ceases after the time in which the customer should have discovered and reported an unauthorized signature to the payor bank and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>thereafter the care or lack of care exercised by the customer and the bank are in issue.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The provision which most concerns us here is contained in subdivision (4) of section 4406. That subdivision precludes a customer from asserting a forgery against a payor bank unless he or she has discovered and reported the forgery within one year of the time a statement and the item were made available by the bank. That subdivision specifically applies without regard to the care or lack of care exercised by either the customer or the bank.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Section 4406 codifies and adds definitude to duties that have long been imposed upon customers with respect to payor banks. It has long been, and still is, the rule that there is no limitation upon the time in which a customer may bring an action to recover money deposited with a bank. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 348.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, since a depositor should easily be able to discover and report forged or altered checks, early judicial decisions imposed a duty upon a customer to discover and report forgeries and alterations to the bank without unreasonable delay. <em>(Janin </em>v. <em>London &amp; S. F. Bank </em>(1891) 92 Cal. 14, 23-24 [27 P. 1100].) This early rule was flexible. Its application depended upon notions of reasonableness and relative prejudice. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In addition, in order to rely upon a customer\u2019s failure to discover and report a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>forgery or alteration, the payor bank would have to be shown to be free of negligence itself. <em>(Union Tool Co. </em>v. <em>Farmers etc. Nat. Bk. </em>(1923) 192 Cal. 40, 47-48 [218 P. 424, 28 A.L.R. 1417].)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In 1905 our Legislature, following the trend established in other states, acted to make a depositor\u2019s duty more exact by amending Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (3), to provide a one-year statute of limitations for the commencement of an action \u201cby a depositor against a bank for the payment of a forged or raised check.\u201d (Stats. 1905, ch. 258, \u00a7 2, pp. 231-232.) In 1929 the statute was further amended to add \u201cor a check that bears a forged or unauthorized indorsement.\u201d (Stats. 1929, ch. 518, \u00a7 1, p. 896.) By this statute the Legislature \u201csought to fix a definite time, after which no claim could be asserted, based upon the alleged forging or raising of the check, which it was the duty of the depositor to detect.\u201d <em>(Atwell </em>v. <em>Mercantile Trust Co. </em>(1928) 95 Cal.App. 338, 342 [272 P. 799].) To this end the statute provided a distinct and narrow exception to the general rules of limitation applicable to actions against a bank. It applied only to an action by a depositor against a bank and only insofar as the action was for the payment of a forged or raised check. However, where the statute was applicable it barred recovery regardless whether the bank was negligent and it could not be defeated by artfully framing the pleadings. (See <em>Union Tool Co. </em>v. <em>Farmers etc. Nat. Bk., supra, </em>192 Cal. at pp. 50-52.) And it was held that the statute would begin to run when the canceled check and a statement of account were furnished to the customer. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 52-53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Section 4406 of the Commercial Code is consistent with this history.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Section 4406 imposes a duty upon a customer to act promptly in discovering and reporting forgeries and alterations. If the customer fails to fulfill this duty then the payor bank is relieved from absolute liability and for an initial one-year period the loss may be imposed upon the bank only if it was negligent in the matter. After one year the statute bars the customer from asserting a forgery or alteration against the payor bank unless it has been earlier discovered and reported to the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Section 4406 is not per se a statute of limitation but instead is an issue-preclusion statute. Unlike a statute of limitations, it does not purport to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>bar an action against a bank; rather, it simply precludes a customer from asserting a forgery or alteration against the bank if the customer has failed to discover and report the forgery or alteration to the bank. The effect this will have on a customer\u2019s claim against the bank will depend upon whether proof of the forgery is an essential element of the particular claim asserted. In essence, if a customer must prove a forgery in order to establish a claim then the customer will not be able to establish the claim because he or she is precluded from proving the forgery. On the other hand, any claim that is not dependent upon proof of the forgery will not be precluded by section 4406, subdivision (4), although the customer will still be precluded from asserting the forgery in pursing that claim.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Although in the abstract there may be any number of possible claims a customer could assert against a bank, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint suggests the bases for two types of claims, both of which are treated in the Code. As we have noted previously, a bank\u2019s absolute liability for payment of a forged check is statutory and contractual in nature and arises from the bank\u2019s contractual undertaking to make payment only upon the customer\u2019s authorized signature. In this respect section 3404, subdivision (1), provides that an unauthorized signature is wholly inoperative as that of the person whose name is signed \u201cunless he ratifies it or is precluded from denying it[.]\u201d Section 4406, subdivision (4), establishes such a preclusion and thus unless the customer discovers and reports the forgery to the bank within the one-year period he or she cannot pursue a contractual or statutory claim based upon the alleged forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The other type of action suggested by plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is one for negligence in making payment over a forged signature. In this respect the Code is also explicit. The preclusion of section 4406, subdivision (4), applies \u201c[w]ithout regard to care or lack of care of either the customer or the bank . . . .\u201d Where, as here, the only alleged negligence was in accepting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>the forged signatures and making payment on them, an essential element of the cause of action is proof that the signatures were forged and it necessarily follows that the plaintiffs cannot establish their causes of action for negligence to the extent they are precluded from asserting the fact of the forgeries.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">In these respects we find the provisions of the Code to be clear and unambiguous. We also find that they expressly cover the allegations of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. Under these circumstances the provisions of the Code are controlling and must be deemed to displace common law negligence principles with respect to the payment of forged checks by a payor bank. (\u00a71103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Plaintiffs contend, however, that the decision in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand, Inc. </em>v. <em>United California Bank </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 671 [148 Cal.Rptr. 329, 582 P.2d 920], <em>(Sun\u2019n Sand), </em>establishes that the preclusion in section 4406, subdivision (4), applies only in warranty actions and has no application when the plaintiff alleges negligence. We reject the decision in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>as controlling authority for a variety of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">First, the lead opinion in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand, </em>relied upon by plaintiffs, is not precedential authority. That dispute was not determined by the normal complement of seven justices, but was heard before but five. Of the five justices who participated in the decision, the first or lead opinion had the support of but two.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>\n                   It is well established that an opinion that expresses the views of less than a majority of the members of the court is not precedent. Thus, in <em>Del Mar Water, etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Eshleman </em>(1914) 167 Cal. 666 [140 P. 591], the decision of the court as issued consisted of a lead opinion that expressed the views of two members of the court and a \u201cconcurring\u201d opinion that in fact expressed the views of four justices. The court issued an opinion on the denial of rehearing stating: \u201cIn view of the principal grounds advanced in the petition, it is proper to say, in explanation, that in the decision of a case before the court in Bank the concurrence of at least four justices is necessary, and that any proposition or principle stated in an opinion is not to be taken as the opinion of the court, unless it is agreed to by at least four of the justices.\u201d (167 Cal. at p. 682. See also <em>Fuentes </em>v. <em>Tucker </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>(1947) 31 Cal.2d 1, 6 [187 P.2d 752].) Similarly, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Newland </em>(1940) 15 Cal.2d 678, 681 [104 P.2d 778], the court said: \u201cAs to the Lamson case <em>[People </em>v. <em>Lamson </em>(1934) 1 Cal.2d 648 (36 P.2d 361)], it may be said that nothing was decided in that case except that the judgment be reversed. On no other question involved on the appeal was there a concurrence of a majority of the members of the court. Therefore that portion of the first opinion in that case which quoted and approved the above excerpt from the Staples case <em>[People </em>v. <em>Staples </em>(1906) 149 Cal. 405 (86 P. 886)], cannot be considered an adjudication or an effective approval of the declaration in the prior case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The lead opinion in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>expressed the views of only two members of the court and, as Witkin would say, that opinion \u201cis not a precedent at all.\u201d (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7 808, p. 789.)</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In addition, we find the circumstances in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>inapposite to the facts involved here. There the plaintiff corporations had checking accounts with Union Bank. A faithless employee prepared and obtained authorized signatures on checks for small sums payable to the United California Bank (UCB), which in fact was owed nothing by the plaintiffs. The employee then altered the checks by increasing the sums payable, and cashed the checks at UCB by having the sums paid into her own personal account at UCB. In these circumstances UCB was the named payee on the checks, the depositary bank, and a collecting bank, but was not the payor bank. The payor bank, Union Bank, was not involved in the issues on appeal. As our earlier discussion makes clear, under the Code the rights and liabilities of a payor bank to its customer are treated separate and apart from the rights and liabilities of a payee/depositary bank/collecting bank. Since <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>did not involve a dispute between a payor bank and its customer, it may not be considered authority with respect to that relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The first question the lead opinion in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>addressed was whether the maker of a check could sue a collecting bank on the warranties set forth in section 4207. As we have noted (at pp. 1060-1061 <em>ante), </em>those warranties run through the chain of collecting banks and ultimately, in a more limited form, to the payor bank. Although they do not specifically run to the maker or drawer of a check, the lead opinion in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>concluded by implication that the maker or drawer may bring a direct action against a collecting bank based upon those warranties. (21 Cal.3d at pp. 681-682.) Although that conclusion is irrelevant to the issues we are considering, it is noteworthy that the lead opinion in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>also concluded that the bar of section 4406, subdivision (4), would apply in such an action and that the plaintiffs were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>precluded from asserting alterations <em>qua alterations </em>with respect to eight of the nine checks at issue there since they had failed to discover and report the alterations within the statutory one-year period. (21 Cal.3d at p. 692.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">After determining that section 4406, subdivision (4), precluded the plaintiffs\u2019 warranty action with respect to most of the checks at issue, the <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>lead opinion proceeded to consider whether the plaintiffs could nevertheless pursue recovery for those sums in causes of action based upon negligence. In this respect the alleged negligence was not in accepting and paying altered checks, but was in permitting the employee, who was not a party to the checks in any capacity, to cash the checks and personally retain the funds. The lead opinion found authoritative support for the claim that this was negligent behavior by a payee/depositary bank and concluded that the complaint stated causes of action in negligence. (21 Cal.3d at pp. 693-695.) In considering whether section 4406, subdivision (4), would bar the causes of action in negligence the lead opinion reached the conclusion, with which we agree, that section 4406, subdivision (4), would not bar a negligence action based on an independent wrong simply because there was also an alteration or forgery.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (21 Cal.3d at p. 700.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Although the court in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>reached a result which we find to be consistent with the language of the Code, in reaching this conclusion the lead opinion utilized language that is overbroad with respect to the issue that was presented. It purported to find an implicit legislative intent to limit the bar of section 4406, subdivision (4), to warranty actions, and concluded that the rules set forth in section 4406 were not intended to apply to negligence actions. (21 Cal.3d at pp. 699-700.) In the words of the lead opinion, \u201csubdivision (4) of section 4406 applies only to actions based on warranties set forth in the California Uniform Commercial Code.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 699.) It is this assertion that plaintiffs rely upon in asserting that the bar of section 4406, subdivision (4), does not apply to them because they have alleged that the defendant Bank was negligent in paying the checks over forged signatures. Although it is not clear that the lead opinion in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>supports this assertion of the plaintiffs,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> to the extent that it may be so construed we decline to follow it.  First, section 4406 is specifically concerned with the relationship between a payor bank and its customer and it would be anomalous to purport to find some implied legislative intent to limit the reach of that section to warranty actions when the Legislature did not see fit to define that relationship in terms of warranty and the warranty provisions of the Code have no application to begin with. (See \u00a7 4207.) Second, to adopt the construction urged by plaintiffs and purportedly supported by the lead opinion in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand, </em>we would be compelled to disregard the clear and unambiguous language of section 4406, subdivision (4), and to conclude in essence that \u201c[wjithout regard to care or lack of care\u201d means \u201c[w]ithout regard to care or lack of care <em>[unless there was a lack of care].\u201d </em>We decline to so construe the statute.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The other authorities relied upon by plaintiffs are not persuasive. In particular plaintiffs note the decision in <em>Commercial Cotton Co. </em>v. <em>United California Bank </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 511 [209 Cal.Rptr. 551, 55 A.L.R.4th 1017] <em>(Commercial Cotton). </em>That was an action for negligence, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and the intentional infliction of emotional distress, based upon the payor bank\u2019s negligent payment of a check and subsequent refusal to reimburse the customer\u2019s account. Although there were other aspects of negligence involved, the action was in part based upon the fact that the negligently paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>check bore unauthorized signatures,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and the bank refused reimbursement at least in part on the ground of the customer\u2019s failure to discover and report the unauthorized signatures within one year. In this respect the court of appeal cited the lead opinion in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>as a \u201clandmark decision\u201d that established that the bar of section 4406, subdivision (4), does not apply in negligence actions where the customer alleges a breach of duty. (163 Cal.App.3d at p. 515.) As we have been at pains to point out, not only is the lead opinion in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>not a landmark decision, it is not even precedent. The <em>Commercial Cotton </em>decision did not set forth any reasoning supportive of the position urged by plaintiffs here, and stripped of its erroneous reliance on the lead opinion in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand, </em>it has no persuasive value with respect to that position.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The only other appellate decision we have found that appears to rely upon <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>for the proposition urged by plaintiffs is <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 914 [267 Cal.Rptr. 387]. However, neither the <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>situation nor the one with which we are concerned was involved there. In <em>Lee, </em>the customer discovered the payment of an unauthorized check and reported it to the bank well within the one-year period required by section 4406, subdivision (4). Accordingly, the court\u2019s citation of the lead opinion in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>was unnecessary and lacks authoritative value.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>Plaintiffs argue that this case is governed by the decisions in <em>Bullis </em>v. <em>Security Pac. Nat. Bank </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 801 [148 Cal.Rptr. 22, 582 P.2d 109, 7 A.L.R.4th 642] and <em>Danning </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>151 Cal.App.3d 961. We do not find either <em>Bull\u00eds </em>or <em>Darning </em>to be applicable. In <em>Bull\u00eds, </em>the defendant bank was held liable for permitting one co-executor of an estate to withdraw money from the estate\u2019s account although pursuant to statute, contract and the common law the signatures of both co-executors should have been required. (21 Cal.3d at pp. 807, 811.) In <em>Darning, </em>the defendant bank erroneously paid a check which neither had nor purported to have an authorized signature thereon and the bank\u2019s error was discovered and reported almost immediately. (151 Cal.App.3d at pp. 968-969.) Neither of these decisions involved the payment of a forged or altered check and neither was concerned with a customer\u2019s failure to discover and report promptly a forgery or alteration.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Plaintiffs argue that the decisions in <em>Bull\u00eds </em>and <em>Darning </em>stand for the proposition that the loss distribution provisions of the Code do not preempt a customer\u2019s right to assert a common law cause of action against a bank. Total preemption of the common law would be a conclusion of greater breadth than our more limited reading of the statute. In applying the Code we are admonished that principles of the general law retain vitality and supplement the Code except to the extent they are displaced by particular provisions of the Code. (\u00a7 1103.) As we read it, section 4406, subdivision (4), is an issue-preclusion statute and in considering the application of that statute we may assume that a customer remains free to pursue any cause of action that is not foreclosed by a precluded issue. However, where the customer\u2019s cause of action is dependent upon proof of an issue which is expressly precluded by the Code, then the issue-preclusive effect of the statute is fatal to the cause of action. To conclude otherwise would be to ignore the clear and unambiguous provisions of the statute and, in effect, to allow the common law not to supplement but to displace the particular provisions of the Code. Nothing in <em>Bull\u00eds </em>or <em>Danning </em>compels or supports such a result.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">It remains for us to apply this reasoning to the allegations of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. From the complaint it appears that Moore\u2019s alleged misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>occurred over a period of several years, involved two commercial checking accounts, and involved hundreds of improperly drawn checks. The complaint is broken down into causes of action based upon the specific ground for recovery and the specific checking account involved. The checks involved in each cause of action are set forth in exhibits to the complaint and are listed by check number, date, and amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The fifth cause of action seeks recovery for checks alleged to have been negligently paid from Roy Supply\u2019s account. That cause of action concerns checks paid without Roy\u2019s signature which are set forth in exhibit C to the complaint, and checks paid over Roy\u2019s forged signature which are set forth in exhibit E to the complaint. The sixth cause of action seeks recovery for checks alleged to have been negligently paid from Dry wall\u2019s account. That cause of action concerns checks paid without Roy\u2019s signature which are set forth in exhibit D to the complaint, and checks paid over Roy\u2019s forged signature which are set forth in exhibit F to the complaint. The demurrer did not affect these causes of action with respect to the checks that did not bear Roy\u2019s signature and the parties entered into a settlement with respect to those checks. We are here concerned with the forged signature checks set forth in exhibits E and F. Exhibit E sets forth a lengthy list of checks with identified dates between January 24, 1989, and March 11, 1991. Exhibit F sets forth a lengthy list of checks with identified dates between January 31, 1989, and March 27, 1991. The complaint does not specify whether the date set forth for each check is the date on the face of the check or the date upon which the defendant Bank paid it. The complaint alleges that the forgeries were reported to the Bank on or about January 31, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The critical dates with respect to the applicability of the issue-preclusion provisions of section 4406, subdivision (4), are (1) the date the item and a statement of account showing payment of the item were sent or made available to the customer in a reasonable manner, and (2) the date the customer discovered the forgery and reported it to the bank. The application of that subdivision is not determined by reference to the date on the face of the check or the date it was paid by the bank. In order to avoid the preclusion of that subdivision the customer must discover and report a forgery to the bank within one year of the time the check and a statement of account showing payment of the check are made available to the customer.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">In applying this standard to the facts alleged in the complaint we may borrow two points from the lead opinion in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand. </em>First, that opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>concluded that the one-year period applies independently with respect to each forged check regardless whether multiple checks are part of a series of malefactions by the same wrongdoer. (21 Cal.3d at p. 692.) We find that conclusion to be consistent with the provisions of section 4406 and adopt that portion of the lead opinion in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>for the reasons stated there. Second, in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>the trial court took judicial notice of the custom of commercial banks to provide customers with monthly statements and canceled checks. (21 Cal.3d at p. 679, fn. 1.) The lead opinion found that with respect to eight of the nine checks involved the checks bore issuance dates sufficient to compel an inference that they were negotiated and made available in a monthly statement more than one year prior to their discovery. (21 Cal.3d at p. 692.) We are satisfied that the monthly statement custom is sufficiently established to support judicial notice, and that the antiquity of issuance of a check may support an inference that it was the subject of such a statement more than one year preceding its discovery and report by the customer. However, such an inference will not support an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend where it is reasonably possible the plaintiff could allege that a forgery was discovered and reported within one year of the statement covering the particular forged check.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Most of the checks for which recovery is sought in the fifth and sixth causes of action are identified with dates sufficiently in advance of the date the forgeries were discovered and reported as to give rise to a strong inference that they were included in statements of account beyond the one-year period preceding that date. However, one check involved in the fifth cause of action and seven checks involved in the sixth cause of action were identified with dates which would indicate that they were not the subject of statements of account more than one year before they were discovered and reported.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> And with respect to each cause of action there are checks with identified dates more than one year in advance of plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>demand but not sufficiently so that they necessarily must have been the subject of statements of account which were sent or made available more than a year before the demand. Under these circumstances and in light of section 4406, subdivision (4), as we have discussed it, we conclude that it was appropriate for the trial court to sustain the demurrer to the fifth and sixth causes of action but that plaintiffs should be accorded an opportunity to amend to set forth with greater certainty any checks that were the subject of statements of account within one year preceding their demand upon the defendant.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> (See <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 621, 634 [137 Cal.Rptr. 681]; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1951) 107 Cal.App.2d 304, 307 [237 P.2d 320].) Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of dismissal and remand with directions to give plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The ninth count of the complaint alleged that as a result of the Bank\u2019s misfeasance in paying checks drawn with Roy\u2019s forged signature, the corporate plaintiffs were deprived of funds needed to pay various state and federal taxes. Roy personally was required to pay such taxes. As a result, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>Roy \u201cwas hurt and injured in his health, strength, activity and marital relations, . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">The trial court ruled Roy had no cause of action for a wrong done to the corporate plaintiffs. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Roy\u2019s individual claim rests on the premise that the Bank, in maintaining the corporate plaintiffs\u2019 checking accounts, owed a duty of care to Roy as the president and as a shareholder of the corporate plaintiffs. But in order to state a viable cause of action for negligence, the complaint must allege facts showing the existence of a legal duty of care. <em>(Palmer </em>v. <em>Crafts </em>(1936) 16 Cal.App.2d 370, 374-375 [60 P.2d 533].) Roy has not, indeed cannot, allege any such facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The gist of any claim based upon the improper payment of a check is the Bank\u2019s express or implied contractual obligation to honor only those checks which the customer authorizes to be paid. <em>(Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Security Pacific Nat. Bank </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 797, 805 and fn. 7 [149 Cal.Rptr. 883].) The duty owed by the Bank in this case derives from its contracts with its customers, i.e., the corporate plaintiffs. Roy was not a party to those contracts, nor is there any allegation Roy was an intended beneficiary of the contracts between defendant and the corporate plaintiffs. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 1559.)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Roy relies on several decisions for the proposition a defendant who breaches a contract may be held liable for negligence to one who was not a party to the contract where harm to that person was \u201cforeseeable.\u201d None of the cited cases concerns the liability of a bank for alleged mishandling of a corporate bank account. Absent extraordinary and specific facts, which Roy neither alleges nor claims that he can allege, a bank is liable only <em>to its customer </em>for its mishandling of that customer\u2019s account. <em>(Dodd </em>v. <em>Citizens Bank of Costa Mesa </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1624, 1628 [272 Cal.Rptr. 623] [Absent a showing the noncustomer was an alter ego of, or had personally guaranteed the debts of, the bank\u2019s customer, the bank owes a duty of care only to its actual customer]; see also <em>American Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Stanfill </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1089, 1100 [252 Cal.Rptr. 861]; <em>Kendall Yacht Corp. </em>v. <em>United California Bank </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 949, 956 [123 Cal.Rptr. 848].) The trial court did not err in sustaining without leave to amend the demurrer as to the ninth count.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">The judgment of dismissal is reversed as to the fifth and sixth causes of action asserted by plaintiffs Roy Supply, Inc., and R.M.R.

The provision we find controlling here, section 4406, subdivision (4), was rewritten and redesignated as section 4406, subdivision (f), but was not changed in substance. Henceforward the provisions of the Code we cite will be those in effect at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>this action arose and which governed the relationship of the parties at that time. Where relevant we will note changes in the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b443-10\"> For the most part the applicable Code provisions are concerned with whether or not a signature was authorized. A signature may be valid if the person who placed it upon an instrument was authorized to do so regardless whether he or she is the person whose signature it purports to be. Within the meaning of the Code provisions, an \u201c \u2018[u]nauthorized\u2019 signature or indorsement means one made without actual, implied or apparent authority and includes a forgery.\u201d (\u00a7 1201, subd. (43).) Under the Code, checks with forged signatures are generally treated in the same manner as altered checks and many, but not all, of the same rules apply to checks with forged indorsements.

(a)); (2) holding the customer responsible for discovering and reporting only unauthorized payments that reasonably should have been discovered (subd. (c)); (3) extending to 30 days the period that a reasonable time to report unauthorized payments may not exceed (subd.

Subdivision (f) now provides: \u201cWithout regard to care or lack of care of either the customer or the bank, a customer who does not within one year after the statement or items are made available to the customer (subdivision (a)) discover and report the customer\u2019s unauthorized signature on or any alteration on the item is precluded from asserting against the bank the unauthorized signature or alteration. If there is a preclusion under this subdivision, the payor bank may not recover for breach of warranty under Section 4208 with respect to the unauthorized signature or alteration to which the preclusion applies.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b448-8\"> Although there is no statute of limitations with respect to moneys deposited with a bank, the procedures a customer must follow may be affected by the Unclaimed Property Law (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1500 et seq.), if the account has been inactive sufficiently long as to have come within that law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b449-9\"> The version of subdivision (4) of section 4406 that was adopted by our Legislature differs somewhat from the Uniform Commercial Code version. Specifically, the Uniform Commercial Code provides for a one-year period for a customer to discover and report forgeries of his or her own signature and alterations to the face of the check, but provides for a three-year period for the discovery and report of forged indorsements. The California State Bar found the distinction questionable and inconsistent with Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (3), and upon its recommendation forged indorsements were included in the one-year period in California\u2019s version of the Uniform Commercial Code. (See 37 State Bar J. (1962) pp. 169-170.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b450-6\"> One other difference between an issue-preclusion statute such as section 4406, subdivision (4), and a statute of limitation such as Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (3), is in the steps a plaintiff must take to fulfill the requirements of the statute. Under section 4406, subdivision (4), all the customer must do to avoid the preclusion is to notify the bank of the forgery within one year, while Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (3), requires that the customer commence suit within one year. However, Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (3), like other statutes of limitation, is subject to principles of waiver and estoppel. <em>(Calistoga Nat. Bk. </em>v. <em>Calistoga V. Co. </em>(1935) 7 Cal.App.2d 65, 71-73 [46 P.2d 246].) For example, where a customer notifies a bank of a forgery and the bank induces the customer to forego filing suit, the bank will not be permitted to rely upon the statute of limitations. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Since all section 4406, subdivision (4), requires is that the customer give notice to the bank, waiver or estoppel could arguably apply only in the event of unusual prenotice actions by the bank, but that is not a matter we need consider here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b451-9\"> The lead opinion in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>was authored by Justice Mosk and concurred in by Acting Chief Justice Tobriner. Justice Richardson concurred in the result. Justice Clark filed a concurring and dissenting opinion in which he agreed with the result but rejected the reasoning of the lead opinion. Justice Sullivan filed a separate concurring and dissenting opinion, expressing general agreement with the lead opinion but refusing to endorse its rationale in all respects. Thus, although all of the five justices who decided the case concurred in the result, only two justices concurred in the reasoning of the lead opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b453-8\"> This conclusion necessarily follows from recognition that section 4406, subdivision (4), is an issue-preclusion statute and not an action-abatement statute, such as a statute of limitations. In <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>the fact that the checks were altered was mere happenstance with respect to the negligence alleged, that is, proof of the alterations was not essential to the negligence causes of action. Although the lead opinion in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>did not secure the support of a majority of the court, all five of the justices who considered the case agreed that the negligence causes of action could proceed and in that result, although not in the reasoning of the lead opinion, <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>is precedent. However, regardless of the precedential value of <em>Sun\u2019n Sand, </em>we have no reason to doubt the specific result there.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b454-5\"> The specific conclusion reached by the lead opinion in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>was that the bar of section 4406, subdivision (4), \u201chas no application in a negligence action based on an independent wrong\u2014e.g., failure to detect an irregularity in negotiation\u2014in which there was also an alteration.\u201d (21 Cal.3d at p. 700.) But, as we have noted, the lead opinion found the bar applicable to the plaintiffs\u2019 action insofar as it was based specifically on the fact of the alterations. <em>[Id. </em>at p. 692.) The middle ground, where a plaintiff bases a claim for recovery specifically on a claim of forgery or alteration but adds an allegation of negligence in not discovering the forgery or alteration, was not at issue and was not specifically addressed in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand. </em>Although some of the language in the lead opinion was of sufficient breadth to suggest that any allegation of negligence would overcome the bar of section 4406, subdivision (4), it is by no means clear that the lead opinion was intended to propose such a result through what would be obiter dictum if the opinion had the force of precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b454-6\"> In <em>Sun\u2019n Sand, </em>the lead opinion also gratuitously states that Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (3), \u201cis not intended to apply to actions for negligence.\u201d (21 Cal.3d at p. 698.) However, after its enactment and before the relationship of bank and depositor was more clearly defined in the Commercial Code, Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (3), was held to bar recovery against a bank despite a trial court\u2019s express finding of bank negligence. (See <em>Union Tool Co. </em>v. <em>Farmers etc. Nat. Bk., supra, </em>192 Cal. at pp. 47, 52-54.) The lead opinion in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>did not discuss this or any precedent with respect to Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (3). But, in fact, that statute was not implicated in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand. </em>By its terms it applies only to an action by a depositor against a payor bank, and <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>did not involve such an action. Accordingly, that assertion by the lead opinion in <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>would be dictum if that opinion were otherwise precedential.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b455-7\"> The check at issue in <em>Commercial Cotton </em>not only bore unauthorized signatures, it was part of a series of blank checks that had been stolen and reported lost by the customer four years earlier and that was part of a different number series with a different style and color than the checks then used by the customer. (163 Cal.App.3d at p. 514.) The <em>Commercial Cotton </em>court did not address whether these additional factors constituted an independent wrong that could be addressed in a negligence action even if the customer were precluded from asserting the unauthorized signatures and that is not an issue we need consider here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b455-8\"> In determining that a customer may sue a payor bank for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the <em>Commercial Cotton </em>decision characterized that relationship as quasi-fiduciary. (163 Cal.App.3d at p. 516.) That characterization and the conclusion which followed were severely criticized in other Court of Appeal decisions. The <em>Commercial Cotton </em>court ultimately revisited the issue, found the characterization to be no longer appropriate, and withdrew approval of the <em>Commercial Cotton </em>decision. <em>(Copesky </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 678, 693-694 [280 Cal.Rptr. 338].) In doing so the court noted <em>Commercial Cotton\u2019s </em>reliance on <em>Sun\u2019n Sand, </em>but did not address the <em>Sun\u2019n Sand </em>issue. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 683.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b455-9\"> Although the customer in <em>Lee </em>reported the unauthorized check within one year and was not precluded by section 4406, subdivision (4), she did not discover and report the check \u201cpromptly\u201d and thus could have been subject to the preclusion of section 4406, subdivision (2). However, that preclusion would depend upon a showing of loss to the bank and would be defeated by a showing of negligence on the bank\u2019s part. Those questions were obviated in <em>Lee </em>because after receiving notice from the customer the bank repaid her account. Under those circumstances the Court of Appeal upheld an order sustaining a demurrer to the customer\u2019s complaint for unspecified compensatory damage and such things as emotional distress and punitive damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b456-6\"> In so holding we need not consider the decision in <em>Joffe </em>v. <em>United California Bank </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 541,557-558 [190 Cal.Rptr. 443], which is criticized by the plaintiffs here. In <em>Joffe, </em>the Court of Appeal identified the pivotal factual question as whether the check was paid to an authorized representative of the payee. If it was, then the check was \u201cproperly payable\u201d and the bank could not be held liable under the Code, while if it was not then the bank would be liable regardless whether it was negligent. In the specific circumstances presented the Court of Appeal found the particular provisions of the Code to be controlling and concluded the common law principles had therefore been displaced. That decision was concerned with different Code provisions and different factual circumstances than those which concern us here, and although its reasoning may be somewhat analogous to our own we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>need not rely upon it since we find our conclusion to be dictated by the specific Code provisions we are considering.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b457-10\"> In this respect the period within which the customer must act under section 4406, subdivision (4), begins to run at the same time the statute of limitations contained in Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (3), begins to run. (See <em>Union Tool Co. </em>v. <em>Farmers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number><em>etc. Nat. Bk., supra, </em>192 Cal. at pp. 52-53.) However, a customer acts in a timely manner with respect to section 4406, subdivision (4), by reporting a forgery to the bank within one year while under the statute of limitations an action must be commenced within that time. But the statute of limitations may be tolled and it would not be extraordinary to find the statute tolled through the express or implied conduct of a bank after notice of a forgery and while the claim was evaluated and/or negotiated, or in some other manner. In this case plaintiffs reported the forgeries to the defendant bank on January 31, 1992, and filed their complaint on March 2, 1992. The demurrer addressed only the preclusion of section 4406, subdivision (4), and under the rule that a demurrer must specify the statute of limitations as a ground in order to place that defense in issue (see <em>Minton </em>v. <em>Cavaney </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 576,581 [15 Cal.Rptr. 641,364 P.2d 473]), the statute of limitations issue was not resolved in the trial court and is not at issue in this appeal. Accordingly, we need not consider whether the statute of limitations may bar some of plaintiffs\u2019 claims that are not otherwise precluded by section 4406, subdivision (4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b458-6\"> The one check in the fifth cause of action and six of the seven checks in the sixth cause of action are identified with dates within one year of plaintiffs\u2019 demand on the bank. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>seventh check in the sixth cause of action is identified with a date one year and one day before plaintiffs\u2019 demand and thus appears unlikely to have been included in a monthly statement more than one year before the demand. These checks were also the subject of the first and second causes of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b459-9\"> The one check involved in the fifth cause of action and the seven checks involved in the sixth cause of action that clearly appear not to be subject to issue preclusion under section 4406, subdivision (4), were the subjects of the first and second causes of action which were not affected by the demurrer and which were the subject of a settlement. Plaintiffs cannot be permitted to recover twice for the same forged checks and thus may be barred from seeking recovery for those checks in the fifth and sixth causes of action. However, that is a defensive matter that must be addressed on remand. We do not find plaintiffs\u2019 failure to seek recovery for other forged checks in the first and second causes of action to preclude them from seeking recovery under the fifth and sixth causes of action for checks that may have been the subject of statements of account within one year preceding their demand. First, in the complaint there is no express concession that only the checks identified in the first and second causes of action were discovered and reported within one year of statements of account. Second, since the complaint is uncertain whether the date identified with each check is the date of issuance or the date it was paid but does not indicate the date of the statement of account covering the various checks, there is no basis for finding section 4406, subdivision (4), to be necessarily applicable to all other checks by inference or implication. Third, since each individual check must be considered on its own merits under section 4406, subdivision (4), there is no requirement that they be joined in a single cause of action and the exclusion of some checks from the first and second causes of action would not preclude their recovery under another cause of action. Finally, since under section 4406 the defendant bank\u2019s negligence is in issue with respect to forgeries which were not discovered and reported promptly but were discovered and reported within one year, the inclusion of checks in a negligence cause of action cannot be taken as an implied concession that the code would otherwise preclude recovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
