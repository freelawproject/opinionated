J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsS\">Plaintiff Cynthia Haggard alleged that Kimberly Quality Care, Inc., and Kimberly Home Health Care, Inc. (collectively KQC) breached an implied contract to terminate her employment only for cause, and that KQC and certain employees discriminated against her on the basis of disability. A jury awarded plaintiff damages of $250,000 on her breach of contract claim, but no recovery on her disability discrimination claim. KQC appeals from the portion of the judgment relating to the implied contract claim, contending that the trial court erred in admitting evidence to contradict the terms of a written employment contract. Plaintiff cross-appeals from the portion of the judgment relating to her disability discrimination claim, raising issues relating to the statute of limitations and jury instructions. We reverse the portion of the judgment relating to the implied contract claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>and affirm the portion of the judgment regarding the disability discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Due to the distinct nature of the claims made by each party on appeal, we will summarize the factual background regarding the appeal and cross-appeal separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">I. KQC\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">A. <em>Factual Background Regarding Implied-in-fact Contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Quality Care, Inc., hired plaintiff as a field staff supervisor in its Monterey branch office in January 1986. In 1987 Quality Care, Inc., promoted plaintiff to the position of branch manager. In 1988 Quality Care, Inc., merged with Kimberly, Inc., to form KQC. KQC employed plaintiff after the 1988 merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">1. <em>The 1989 Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">On June 8, 1989, plaintiff signed an \u201cEmployment and Confidentiality Agreement\u201d (Agreement or 1989 Agreement) with KQC. The Agreement contained provisions regarding access to trade secrets, confidentiality, customer lists, and termination of employment. For purposes of this appeal, the crucial provisions are paragraphs 9 and 15, which provide as follows: \u201c9. <em>Termination. </em>It is understood that the employment relationship between Employee and the Company is at the mutual consent of both parties. Accordingly, either Employee or the Company can terminate the employment relationship at will, at any time, with or without cause or advance notice. It is further understood that no employee or representative of the Company, other than the president of Company, has any authority to enter into an agreement for any specified period of time, or to make any agreement contrary to the foregoing. Moreover, the parties agree that there are no express or implied agreements contrary to the foregoing, and the president of the Company, can only enter into an agreement contrary to the foregoing if the president does so in a formal written agreement that is fully executed by the president and Employee. [Paragraphs 10-14 omitted.] [U 15. <em>Final Agreement. </em>This Agreement supersedes all previous agreements, whether written or oral, express or implied, relating to the above subject matter, and shall not be changed or subject to change orally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Plaintiff testified that she read the Agreement before she signed it. She also testified that she \u201chad some reluctance to sign the document,\u201d but did so understanding that her continued employment with KQC was contingent upon signing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>2. <em>The 1991 Employee Handbook</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">On December 5, 1991, plaintiff signed and dated an acknowledgment of her receipt of a KQC associate orientation handbook. The receipt provides: \u201cThe policies and guidelines in this handbook have been adopted voluntarily by Kimberly Quality Care and are not intended to give rise to contractual rights or obligations, nor to be construed as a guarantee of employment for any specific period of time or any specific type of work. You are an \u2018at-will\u2019 associate, meaning that your employment is for no definite period of time and may be terminated by you or by KQC at any time and for any reason. Furthermore, KQC reserves the right to interpret, amend, modify or cancel and withdraw any or all sections or provisions of this handbook at any time. H] I certify that I have received a copy of the Kimberly Quality Care Associate Orientation Handbook. I acknowledge that I am responsible for knowing and adhering to the Policies and Procedures of Kimberly Quality Care while I am working as an associate of the company.\u201d Plaintiff testified that the handbook was distributed to all administrative employees nationwide in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">3. <em>Termination of Plaintiff s Employment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Slightly over six weeks later, on January 20, 1992, KQC terminated plaintiff\u2019s employment. The parties vigorously dispute the reason for this termination. Briefly, KQC contends that it decided to terminate plaintiff\u2019s employment as branch manager because plaintiff knowingly allowed an unlicensed nurse to work on a case involving a ventilator patient, in violation of KQC\u2019s policies and the state regulations governing KQC. Plaintiff contends that she was blamed for \u201canother employee\u2019s clinical error,\u201d and that KQC discriminated against her on the basis of her disability (multiple sclerosis), which had been diagnosed in 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">4. <em>This Litigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Plaintiff filed her original complaint in this case on March 31, 1992, alleging causes of action for breach of contract, wrongful discharge, employment discrimination, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, and invasion of privacy. After various pretrial proceedings, the breach of implied contract and disability discrimination claims were tried to a jury beginning on September 13, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">In her cause of action for breach of an alleged implied contract, plaintiff claimed that the termination of her employment violated an implied-in-fact contract that her employment could be terminated only for good cause. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>support of her implied contract theory, plaintiff offered evidence of factors such as the duration of her employment, commendations, promotions, raises, annual performance ratings, and KQC\u2019s personnel policies and practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Despite KQC\u2019s consistent efforts to have evidence of the alleged implied-in-fact contract excluded,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the evidence was admitted and the question of the implied contract was submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">During its deliberations, the jury asked the trial court, \u201cDoes an \u2018at-will\u2019 contract of employment \u2018super[s]ede\u2019 an \u2018implied\u2019 contract, legally?\u201d The court responded: \u201cSomebody could write a long Law Review article on this. I\u2019m not kidding you, somebody could write a long review, a long Law Review article in response to this, because there are so many possibilities and so many factors that you have to take into account before you can say yes or no. [&lt;JQ All I can say is, depends. [&lt;jD The Foreperson: Thanks. [*][] The Court: Depends on the circumstances surrounding the parties\u2019 relationship, along with all the exhibits that you have in your jury deliberation room.\u201d The jury returned to its deliberations. The court later recalled the jury and provided an additional instruction on the integration issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">After further deliberations, the jury returned its verdict. On a special verdict form, the jury indicated its findings that KQC had entered an implied contract to terminate plaintiff\u2019s employment only for good cause, and that the termination had been without good cause. The jury found that plaintiff was entitled to damages of $250,000 on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">B. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">On appeal, KQC argues that the trial court \u201cerred when it did not rule that, as a matter of law, an integrated express at-will agreement barred [plaintiff\u2019s] cause of action for breach of an implied contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>1. <em>The 1989 Agreement\u2019s At-will Termination Provision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Paragraph 9 of the 1989 Agreement, which specifically provides that \u201ceither Employee or the Company can terminate the employment relationship at will, at any time, with or without cause or advance notice,\u201d is clearly an agreement for at-will employment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiff claims that despite this provision in the 1989 Agreement, she had an implied-in-fact contract with defendants that her employment was not at-will, but could be terminated only for cause. Defendants contend that plaintiff should not have been allowed to introduce evidence of this alleged implied contract at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">2. <em>Evidence of Prior and Contemporaneous Agreements: the Parol Evidence Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">California\u2019s parol evidence rule is codified in section 1856 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Subdivision (a) of section 1856 provides: \u201cTerms set forth in a writing intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement.\u201d <em>(Slivinsky </em>v. <em>Watkins-Johnson Co. </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 799, 804-805 [270 Cal.Rptr. 585]; <em>Gerdlund </em>v. <em>Electronic Dispensers International </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 263, 270 [235 Cal.Rptr. 279].)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">\u201cThe court shall determine whether the writing is intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein . . . .\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1856, subd. (d).) Whether the agreement is an integration is thus a question of law for the court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(Slivinsky </em>v. <em>Watkins-Johnson Co., supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 805.)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">\u201cAn integration may be partial, as well as complete; that is, the parties may intend that a writing finally and completely express certain terms of their agreement rather than the agreement in its entirety.\u201d <em>(Wagner </em>v. <em>Glendale Adventist Medical Center </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1379, 1385 [265 Cal.Rptr. 412]; <em>Masterson </em>v. <em>Sine </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 222, 225 [65 Cal.Rptr. 545, 436 P.2d 561].) If only part of the agreement is integrated, the parol evidence rule applies to that part. <em>(Slivinsky </em>v. <em>Watkins-Johnson Co., supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 805.) If a writing is deemed integrated, extrinsic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>evidence is admissible only if it is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">In determining the intent of the parties regarding whether the written agreement is integrated, the court must attempt to place itself in the same situation in which the parties found themselves at the time of contracting. <em>(Gerdlund </em>v. <em>Electronic Dispensers International, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d at p. 270.) The court may consider evidence of the circumstances surrounding the formation of the contract, and prior negotiations, to determine whether the writing was intended as the final and complete expression of the parties\u2019 agreement. <em>(Wagner </em>v. <em>Glendale Adventist Medical Center, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d at p. 1386.) The proposed parol evidence is also considered by the court to determine whether the parties intended it to be a part of their bargain at the time of contracting. If the proposed parol evidence directly contradicts an express provision of the written agreement, however, \u201cit cannot reasonably be presumed that the parties intended to integrate two directly contradictory terms in the same agreement.\u201d <em>(Gerdlund, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d at p. 271.)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Applying these principles to this case, we are persuaded that the 1989 Agreement was integrated with respect to the termination provision in paragraph 9. That paragraph contains its own integration provision, which states that there are \u201cno express or implied agreements contrary\u201d to the at-will provision, that no employee or representative of the company other than the president of the company may make any contrary agreement, and that the president \u201ccan only enter into an agreement contrary to the foregoing if the president does so in a formal written agreement that is fully executed by the president and Employee.\u201d Paragraph 15 also states that the 1989 Agreement is integrated. \u201cThis Agreement supersedes all previous agreements, whether written or oral, express or implied, relating to the above subject matter and shall not be changed or subject to change orally.\u201d It is difficult to imagine how the parties could have more fully expressed their intent to make the Agreement a full and complete statement of their contract regarding the grounds for termination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiff acknowledged and agreed to these integration provisions by signing the 1989 Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The circumstances surrounding the formation of the contract support the conclusion that the agreement was integrated as to paragraph 9\u2019s termination provision. Plaintiff testified that she read the agreement before signing it, and that she \u201chad some reluctance to sign the document,\u201d but did so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>understanding that her continued employment was contingent on signing it. By signing the contract, she agreed to both the at-will termination clause in paragraph 9 and the integration provisions of paragraphs 9 and 15. Plaintiff argues that because the 1989 Agreement was printed in \u201csmall type\u201d and prepared by KQC, it could not be integrated. We disagree. Our review of the agreement reveals a legible, four-page agreement in which all provisions (other than two capitalized lines in paragraph 8) are similar in size and type. Plaintiff did, in fact, read it. The fact that the contract was drafted by one party does not prevent it from being an integrated agreement expressing the parties\u2019 intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">The circumstances surrounding the 1989 Agreement also defeat plaintiff\u2019s argument that the termination provision was not supported by consideration. Plaintiff\u2019s argument is based on her assumption that she held some status other than as an at-will employee prior to signing the Agreement. In fact, however, plaintiff had signed at least three prior agreements in 1986 and 1987 with Quality Care, Inc., KQC\u2019s predecessor, all clearly stating that her employment was at will.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the face of these agreements, plaintiff could not have held a reasonable belief that she could be terminated only for good cause prior to the 1989 Agreement. In any event, plaintiff chose to sign the 1989 Agreement, which stated that the parties agreed that \u201cthere are no express or implied agreements contrary to the [termination at-will provision]\u201d and that the 1989 Agreement supersedes all previous agreements. As a result of her promise, KQC continued plaintiff\u2019s at-will employment and paid her wages and benefits. The court will not inquire into the adequacy of consideration. (See <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Interactive Data Corp. </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 654, 679 [254 Cal.Rptr. 211, 765 P.2d 373], citing <em>Pugh </em>v. <em>See\u2019s Candies, Inc. </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 311, 325-326 [171 Cal.Rptr. 917].)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Where the contract is integrated, parol evidence still might be admissible if it is \u201c \u2018relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Slivinsky </em>v. <em>Watkins-Johnson Co., supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 805.) The written at-will provision here, however, is not \u201creasonably susceptible\u201d to an interpretation that plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>employment could be terminated only for good cause. The Agreement states in no uncertain terms that employment is terminable by either party \u201cat will, at any time, with or without cause or advance notice.\u201d The construction commanded by the language is inescapable. The alleged implied contract to terminate only for cause directly contradicts the written Agreement, and is not admissible to explain its meaning. (See <em>Gerdlund </em>v. <em>Electronic Dispensers International, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d at p. 273 [\u201c[t]estimony of intention which is contrary to a contract\u2019s express terms . . . does not give meaning to the contract; rather it seeks to substitute a different meaning\u201d].) In addition, an agreement to terminate only for good cause could not \u201cnaturally\u201d be made separately from the 1989 Agreement, which both specifically addresses grounds for termination and precludes such a collateral agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Plaintiff argues that because the Agreement did not contain provisions such as salary, hours, position and benefits, but \u201cdealt overwhelmingly with access to trade secrets, confidentiality, and noncompetition . . . ,\u201d it was integrated only on the subjects of confidentiality and trade secrets. This argument is without merit. The plain language of the Agreement indicates that it covers various conditions relating to plaintiff\u2019s employment. (See <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Wells Fargo Realty Advisors </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 467 [199 Cal.Rptr. 613], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Interactive Data Corp., supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 688 [stock option agreement with clause regarding conditions of employment was integrated as to grounds for termination]; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corp. </em>(D.C.Cal. 1984) 608 F.Supp. 1315, 1320-1321 [\u201cpatent agreement\u201d created a binding terminable-at-will employment arrangement].) It is true that the 1989 Agreement does not set forth all of the terms that would ultimately govern the parties\u2019 relationship. But where a writing is intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to particular terms, it is integrated as to those terms and they may not be contradicted by parol evidence. (See <em>Slivinsky </em>v. <em>Watkins-Johnson Co., supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 805; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1856, subds. (a), (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Finally, plaintiff contends that the termination provision could not be integrated because it specifically permitted the parties to modify their agreement in the future by means of a written agreement between the president and the employee. According to plaintiff, this provision \u201cplainly indicated that the termination clause was subject to change, and therefore could not have been the final expression of the parties\u2019 intention.\u201d We do not accept plaintiff\u2019s analysis that no agreement may be integrated if it provides for a specific manner by which it may be modified in the future. The parties here intended to memorialize their understanding with respect to grounds for termination, subject <em>only </em>to later writings signed by the company\u2019s president <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>and the employee. That the termination provision could <em>not </em>be modified orally was part of the parties\u2019 integrated agreement. The case of <em>McLain </em>v. <em>Great American Ins. Companies </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1476 [256 Cal.Rptr. 863], in which the employment application did not contain an integration clause and stated that the relationship would remain subject to change in terms and conditions, is not similar to this case, where the contract contains two integration provisions and provides a specific, exclusive method for written modification. Moreover, the effect of plaintiff\u2019s argument (that the contract\u2019s provision that modification must be in writing should operate to admit contrary oral agreements) would thwart the clear intentions of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Because the 1989 Agreement is integrated as to paragraph 9\u2019s at-will termination provision, section 1856 of the Code of Civil Procedure precludes the introduction of parol evidence of a prior or contemporaneous agreement to vary or contradict that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">3. <em>Implied Contracts Subsequent to the 1989 Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Plaintiff argues that even if evidence of an implied agreement established prior to 1989 was inadmissible under the parol evidence rule, \u201cthe trial court properly admitted evidence to show a <em>subsequent </em>implied agreement superseded or modified the 1989 agreement.\u201d After the 1989 Agreement, however, it was absolutely clear to plaintiff that the at-will nature of her employment could only be modified in a \u201cformal written agreement\u201d signed by the president of KQC. In light of this express modification provision, no contract implied from oral statements or conduct could modify the termination provision of the Agreement. \u201c \u2018There cannot be a valid express contract and an implied contract, each embracing the same subject, but requiring different results.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Malmstrom </em>v. <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 299, 316 [231 Cal.Rptr. 820]; <em>Tollefson </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Bishop </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 843, 855 [268 Cal.Rptr. 550]; see also <em>DeHorney </em>v. <em>Bank of America Nat. Trust and Sav. </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 879 F.2d 459, 466 [written at-will contract was not modified by a later implied contract to terminate only for cause based on corporate code of conduct and policies].)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">In this case, the 1989 Agreement was absolutely clear that the relationship was at-will, and that this term could only be modified by an agreement signed by the company\u2019s president. Having signed this clear and exclusive modification provision, plaintiff could not reasonably have relied on an alleged implied contract, which was not in a writing signed by the president, to modify the Agreement. In the absence of such a written modification, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>parties had agreed that their entire understanding on this issue was set forth in the 1989 Agreement, and were entitled and required to live with the agreed terms. Evidence of oral statements and conduct was thus not admissible to create an implied contract directly contradicting paragraph 9\u2019s at-will termination provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">4. <em>Written Modification of the 1989 Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Evidence could be introduced, however, of a subsequent written modification of the 1989 Agreement. Plaintiff claims that the 1991 employee handbook was such a modification. The handbook was accompanied by a cover letter signed by KQC\u2019s president, and plaintiff signed a document acknowledging her receipt of the handbook. Plaintiff emphasizes that the handbook reserved the right to change any and all employment policies, contained progressive discipline procedures, and repeatedly promised to treat employees \u201cvery well\u201d and to apply personnel policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">We have examined the 1991 administrative associate handbook and plaintiff\u2019s signed receipt for the handbook, and find no evidence that these documents constituted or contained any modification of the at-will termination provision of the 1989 Agreement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To the contrary, both the handbook and the receipt were entirely consistent with the at-will termination provision of the 1989 Agreement. The receipt provided: \u201cYou are an \u2018at-will\u2019 associate, meaning that your employment is for no definite period of time and may be terminated by you or KQC at any time and for any reason.\u201d The handbook itself repeatedly stated that the employment relationship was terminable at will. Its preface states that the policies and guidelines in the handbook \u201care not intended to give rise to contractual rights or obligations, nor to be construed as a guarantee of employment for any specific period of time or any specific type of work. You are an \u2018at will\u2019 employee, meaning that your employment is for no definite period of time and may be terminated by you or by KQC at any time and for any reason.\u201d In a section entitled \u201cDefinition of Employment Status,\u201d the handbook states: \u201cBeing introductory or non-introductory does not affect the fact that employment at all times is at the mutual consent of KQC and of the associate and either may terminate the employment relationship at will at any time for any reason.\u201d With regard to \u201cPerformance Improvement/Corrective Discipline,\u201d the handbook provides: \u201cThe company may utilize a system of progressive discipline, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>at its sole discretion, in cases of misconduct or unacceptable performance. The use of such a system does not waive either the company\u2019s or your right to terminate employment at any time with or without cause.\u201d We find no evidence that the handbook or its receipt constituted a modification of the at-will termination provision of the 1989 Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Plaintiff argues that the receipt\u2019s statement that \u201cKQC reserves the right to interpret, amend, modify or cancel and withdraw any or all sections or provisions of this handbook at any time\u201d modifies the at-will termination provision of the 1989 Agreement. We disagree. The receipt clearly reaffirms that employment is at-will. The grounds for termination were the subject of an express agreement, and could only be changed in writing; they were not changed by this document.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Plaintiff also focuses on the following statement in the \u201cSecurity of Company Information\u201d section of the handbook: \u201cAll branch managers, regional director/vice presidents, sales persons and certain key support staff are required to sign the company non-compete agreement as a condition of employment. All other administrative associates are required to sign the confidentiality agreement as a condition of employment. Neither agreement is considered an employment contract.\u201d On the basis of this provision, plaintiff argues that the 1989 Agreement cannot be integrated because it is \u201cnot even an employment contract.\u201d This argument is without merit. The question is not whether the 1989 Agreement is an \u201cemployment contract,\u201d but whether the express provisions that it does contain (however categorized) are a complete expression of the parties\u2019 intent with regard to the topics covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Plaintiff argues that the handbook sets forth KQC\u2019s progressive discipline policies and \u201can array of commitments by [KQC] which were . . . intended to make employees committed to the company,\u201d such as the statement \u201cWe respect employee rights and uniformly apply written personnel policies.\u201d As noted above, however, the handbook clearly stated that progressive discipline, which it <em>may </em>utilize, \u201cdoes not waive either the company\u2019s or your right to terminate employment at any time with or without cause.\u201d By its own terms, this section did nothing to modify plaintiff\u2019s 1989 Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Finally, plaintiff argues that the handbook \u201cobligates employees to give two weeks\u2019 written notice of their intent to resign, and to state their reasons for leaving.\u201d The handbook itself, however, states only that an employee is \u201cexpected\u201d to give at least two weeks\u2019 written notice to the supervisor \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>ensure a smooth transition and to prevent any unnecessary discomfort for your co-workers,\u201d and that the letter of resignation \u201cshould\u201d state \u201cyour reason(s) for leaving and your last day of work.\u201d It is clear that these comments are advisory only, and do not modify the 1989 Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">5. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">In summary, we find that (1) evidence of prior and contemporaneous agreements is inadmissible to vary the 1989 Agreement, (2) the Agreement could not be modified orally or by conduct pursuant to its terms, and (3) the Agreement was not modified by any writing.  The at-will termination provision of the 1989 Agreement remained the agreement of the parties at the time plaintiff\u2019s employment was terminated, and the trial court therefore erred in admitting evidence regarding an inconsistent alleged implied contract to terminate only for good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">This error was obviously prejudicial to KQC, because without evidence of the alleged implied contract there was no evidentiary basis for plaintiff to recover on her implied contract claim. The evidence is insufficient to support the judgment on the implied contract claim. \u201c \u2018[I]n determining whether substantial evidence supports a judgment, extrinsic evidence inconsistent with any interpretation to which the instrument is reasonably susceptible becomes irrelevant; as a matter of substantive law such evidence cannot serve to create or alter the obligations under the instrument. Irrelevant evidence cannot support a judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Gerdlund </em>v. <em>Electronic Dispensers International, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d 263, 276, quoting <em>Tahoe National Bank </em>v. <em>Phillips </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 11, 23 [92 Cal.Rptr. 704, 480 P.2d 320], fn. omitted.) The judgment on plaintiff\u2019s cause of action for breach of an alleged implied contract must therefore be reversed, and judgment must be entered for defendants on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">II. Plaintiff\u2019s Cross-appeal<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">III. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">The portion of the judgment regarding plaintiff\u2019s implied contract claim is reversed, and the trial court is directed to enter judgment on this claim in favor of KQC. The portion of the judgment regarding plaintiff\u2019s employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>discrimination claim is affirmed. Costs in the appeal and cross-appeal are awarded to KQC.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Premo, J., and Elia, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The petition of appellant Cynthia Haggard for review by the Supreme Court was denied December 14, 1995. Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-9\"> KQC filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude parol evidence of the alleged implied contract, and a motion for nonsuit on the implied contract claim at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case. These motions were denied, and the implied contract issue was submitted to the jury. After the jury\u2019s verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor on this issue was returned, KQC moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which was also denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-10\"> The additional jury instruction stated: \u201cYou are to determine what was the parties\u2019 contract as of the date of Plaintiff\u2019s termination. A written at-will contract is binding if the parties intend it to be the exclusive and final embodiment of their contract. [*]0 In determining this question, you must consider the actual language of any written contract as well as the circumstances surrounding Plaintiff\u2019s employment, as you have already been instructed.\u201d Although the parties prepared and agreed upon this instruction, KQC reserved its position that whether the agreement was integrated should be decided by the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b161-10\"> This agreement is consistent with Labor Code section 2922, which provides in part that \u201c[a]n employment, having no specified term, may be terminated at the will of either party \u00bb&gt;</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AFc\"> Where, as here, the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the agreement did not turn on the credibility of extrinsic evidence and did not require a resolution of a conflict in that evidence, we make an independent determination as to whether the agreement was integrated.

This agreement may not be orally changed, but may only be modified by a subsequent agreement in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of any waiver, change or modification is sought. Nothing herein shall be construed as constituting employment for a stated term; the parties intend employment to be at will.\u201d On January 24, 1986, plaintiff signed another agreement stating that \u201cNothing herein shall be construed as constituting employment for a stated term because I understand that my employment is at will by the Company.\u201d In February 1987, plaintiff signed another \u201cRestrictive Covenant and Confidentiality Agreement,\u201d containing the same provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\"> Because we find that the handbook and receipt did not modify the termination provision of the 1989 Agreement, we need not address the parties\u2019 dispute as to whether these documents could together constitute a \u201cformal written agreement that is fully executed by the president and Employee,\u201d as required by paragraph 9 of the 1989 Agreement for modification of that paragraph\u2019s terms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b168-10\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 508.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
