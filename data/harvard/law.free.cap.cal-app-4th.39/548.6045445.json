J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akb\">This case involves a suit brought by nine low-income renters against defendants the U.D. Registry, Inc. (UDR) and its president Harvey Saltz for alleged violations of the state and federal statutes that govern the activities of consumer credit reporting and investigative agencies. Both sides appeal from a judgment granting relief to plaintiffs Ruth Cisneros and Rudine Pettus on their claim for failure to respond to a dispute request, but in favor of defendants in all other respects. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for retrial on certain issues we shall specify.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Defendant UDR gathers information regarding residential renters and sells that information to its subscribers, mainly landlords and their agents. The information comes from public records of unlawful detainers, forcible detainers, property damage cases, foreclosures, bankruptcies, and the like. UDR also solicits information from its subscribers, providing forms on which they are requested to describe each tenant, his or her treatment of the premises, and other behavior relevant to the tenancy. This information is then passed on to other subscribers screening applicants to fill a vacancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Although what UDR does is similar to the task of a conventional credit agency, there are significant differences. A credit agency\u2019s data typically comes from credit and loan documents which contain ample information to identify the person involved, such as Social Security number, driver\u2019s license number, previous addresses, and spouse\u2019s name. UDR relies primarily on court files which contain little identifying information, usually just a name and possibly an address. When a subscriber calls UDR to obtain a report on a prospective tenant, the operator brings up all the information contained in the computer under that name. In many instances, the information available to the operator is not sufficient to determine whether or not the prospective tenant about whom the inquiry is being made is tied to the information appearing on the screen. At the time the lawsuit was filed, the practice of UDR was that if the operator did not have sufficient information from which to determine a definite match, the operator told the subscriber what there was under the name, and suggested that the subscriber make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>further inquiries to determine if it was the same person. This kind of match was known as a \u201cpossible.\u201d When a tenant requested disclosure of his or her file, UDR disclosed only the information definitely matched to the person making the request, not the information \u201cpossibly\u201d related. UDR instructed its subscribers not to tell tenants or prospective tenants what UDR had reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">A statute in effect at the time the lawsuit was brought prohibited the reporting of unlawful detainer actions where the person against whom the action was filed was \u201cadjudged the prevailing party.\u201d ([Former] Civ. Code, \u00a7 1785.13, subd. (a)(4) (Stats. 1982, ch. 1127, \u00a7 4, p. 4064); see <em>U.D. Registry, Inc. </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 107 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 228].) In accordance with its interpretation of this statute, UDR reported all unlawful detainer actions resolved in any way other than by adjudication after trial or summary judgment for the defendant, including, in at least some instances, actions resolved by demurrer, dismissal for failure to prosecute, and settlement. These reports were noted, \u201cnot adjudicated as the prevailing party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The factual circumstances underlying each plaintiffs\u2019 claims were separate and distinct, and we shall discuss them in detail in the portion of the opinion to which they pertain. In general, plaintiffs alleged that UDR violated the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681-1681t) (FCRA), the California Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1785.1 et seq.) (CCRAA), and the Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1786 et seq.) (ICRA) by: failing to maintain a public office where in-person disclosures of consumer files could be made, refusing to respond to requests for disclosure, failing to disclose all information in a consumer\u2019s file, reporting unlawful detainer cases in which the tenant was the prevailing party, failing to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of consumer records, failing to follow verification procedures for investigative reports, failing to respond or reinvestigate when disputes concerning the accuracy of information contained in consumer files were brought to its attention or demanding improper concessions from the consumer prior to reinvestigating, and failing to notify consumers of certain rights. Plaintiffs sought damages and injunctive relief. In addition, plaintiffs sought injunctive relief for violation of the Unfair Business Practices Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.), and damages for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress. A demurrer was sustained without leave to amend to the Unfair Business Practices Act and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The case was tried to the court, both sides having waived the right to jury trial. After plaintiffs\u2019 case was complete, defendants brought a motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>judgment pursuant to section 631.8 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The court granted the motion as to the cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress in its entirety, and as to certain other individual claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The trial court ultimately found for defendants on all but two of the remaining claims. It granted judgment in favor of plaintiff Ruth Cisneros based on UDR\u2019s failure to formally respond to a consumer dispute letter as required by section 1785.16 of CCRAA. The court awarded her $250 for \u201cpain and suffering.\u201d The court found for plaintiff Rudine Pettus on the same ground as Ms. Cisneros. It ruled that UDR should have responded to her letter outlining reasons why she should be deemed the prevailing party in the three unlawful detainers in which she was involved, even if it believed the dispute to be frivolous. The court awarded her $100 for \u201cpain and suffering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Defendant Saltz was found jointly liable with UDR for the damages awarded because he personally made the decision not to respond to Ms. Cisneros and Ms. Pettus.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Both sides sought attorney fees. Based on the split decision, the court awarded $40,000 to defendants and $12,500 to plaintiffs for a net award of $27,500 to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Issues Raised</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal raises seven separate issues. First, they challenge the sustaining of the demurrer to their unfair business practices claim. Second, plaintiffs argue the trial court erred in ruling that UDR was not required to maintain a public office. Third, plaintiffs contend that a report in which plaintiff June Halsell was described as having damaged a rental property was an investigative consumer report, and even if it was not, UDR\u2019s failure to assure the accuracy of what was told by Ms. Halsell\u2019s former landlord about her treatment of th\u00e9 premises, or to reinvestigate a dispute raised by Ms. Halsell concerning the accuracy of the report, violated CCRAA and FCRA. Fourth, plaintiffs maintain that FCRA and CCRAA require UDR to disclose tenant files when asked to do so by the tenant\u2019s attorney. Fifth, plaintiffs assert that injunctive relief should have been granted to prohibit UDR from reporting \u201cpossibles\u201d and to require it to disclose to tenants when a \u201cpossible\u201d match had been found or discussed. Sixth, Quida Johnson appeals the judgment for UDR on her claim of failing to ensure maximum possible accuracy and refusal to correct inaccurate records. Seventh, the plaintiffs attack the award of attorney fees to UDR. Plaintiffs are supported in their appeal of the public office, attorney fees, and the unfair business practices issues by amicus curiae Consumers Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>UDR and defendant Saltz cross-appeal, contending that UDR did not violate section 1785.16 of CCRAA when it disregarded the Cisneros and Pettus dispute letters, that those two plaintiffs should not have been awarded damages for \u201cemotional distress\u201d since it was not severe, that judgment was improperly rendered against defendant Saltz as an individual, and that plaintiffs should have been forced to elect between the federal and state statutory schemes. UDR also seeks a determination that it is not covered by FCRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Because of its pertinence to other issues, we address the last issue first\u2014whether UDR is covered by FCRA. Some background about this statute is helpful to understanding the issues it presents in the context of this case. FCRA was enacted in 1969 because Congress found a \u201cneed to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumer\u2019s right to privacy.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681(a)(4).) Its stated purpose was \u201cto require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681(b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">FCRA covers consumer credit reporting agencies whether they prepare \u201cconsumer reports\u201d or \u201cinvestigative consumer reports.\u201d In contrast, when California enacted its own version of the act in 1975, it drew a distinction between \u201cconsumer credit reporting agencies\u201d and \u201cinvestigative consumer reporting agencies.\u201d The former were covered by CCRAA, the latter under ICRA. Because of this split, the definition of \u201cconsumer credit report\u201d in CCRAA is not as broad as the definition under FCRA. (Compare Civ. Code, \u00a7 1785.3, subd. (c) with 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">In 1982, the California Legislature amended the definition of \u201cconsumer credit report\u201d to expressly include \u201cany written, oral, or other communication of any information by a consumer credit reporting agency bearing on a consumer\u2019s credit worthiness, credit standing, or credit capacity, which is used or is expected to be used ... for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer\u2019s eligibility for: . . . hiring of a dwelling unit . . . .\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1785.3, subd. (c)(3) (Stats. 1982, ch. 1127, \u00a7 2).) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>definition of \u201cconsumer report\u201d under the federal statute, on the other hand, has remained the same since its inception: \u201cThe term \u2018consumer report\u2019 means any written, oral, or other communication of any information by a consumer reporting agency bearing on a consumer\u2019s credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer\u2019s eligibility for (1) credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) employment purposes, or (3) other purposes authorized under section 1681b of this title.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u201cConsumer reporting agencies\u201d are defined in relation to their procurement of consumer reports: \u201cThe term \u2018consumer reporting agency\u2019 means any person which, for monetary fees, dues, or on a cooperative nonprofit basis, regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or other information on consumers <em>for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties </em>. . . .\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(f), italics added.) Thus, to be covered by the FCRA, an agency must collect information for the purpose of \u201cfurnishing consumer reports,\u201d which, under the federal definition, does not specifically include a report used to establish eligibility for \u201cthe hiring of a dwelling unit.\u201d Because of this omission, UDR argues that the federal law was not meant to apply to agencies which, like itself, gather information for the sole purpose of establishing eligibility for the hiring of dwelling units.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">We do not agree that FCRA should be construed so narrowly. The statute\u2019s definition of \u201cconsumer report\u201d was written broadly to include everything from information bearing on \u201ccredit standing\u201d to information about \u201cgeneral reputation\u201d and \u201cpersonal characteristics.\u201d If this data is sought to establish either eligibility for \u201ccredit or insurance ... for personal, family, or household purposes,\u201d \u201cemployment purposes,\u201d or \u201cother purposes authorized under section 1681b of this title,\u201d FCRA applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Several federal courts have held or indicated that a report used to determine a consumer\u2019s eligibility to rent housing is a transaction involving \u201ccredit\u201d to be used for \u201chousehold purposes\u201d under subdivision (d)(1) of section 1681a. <em>(Cotto </em>v. <em>Jenney </em>(D.Mass. 1989) 721 F.Supp. 5, 6-7; see also <em>Conley </em>v. <em>TRW Credit Data </em>(N.D.Ill. 1974) 381 F.Supp. 473, 473-474 [consumer challenged report used to deny rental housing]; <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Moore &amp; Associates, Inc. </em>(D. Hawaii 1982) 553 F.Supp. 948, 950-951 [same].) In <em>Cotto, </em>the court pointed out that landlords \u201cseek the services provided by companies like [defendant] to assist them in determining if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>prospective tenant is a good risk vis-a-vis whether the tenant will timely pay its rent.\u201d <em>(Cotto </em>v. <em>Jenney, supra, </em>721 F.Supp. at p. 6.) Like UDR, the defendant in <em>Cotto </em>\u201cexamines an individual\u2019s financial background by reporting prior incidents of non-payment of rent, . . . late payments of rent, bounced checks and court proceedings and judgments.\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>\u201cIt follows, therefore, that if [defendant] issues a report stating that a prospective tenant has fallen behind on its rent payments on a prior occasion\u2014as apparently occurred in the present case\u2014the landlord would certainly give pause before incurring a potential financial risk by allowing the would-be tenant to occupy the residence. It is in this sense that pursuant to the FCRA the report on [the tenant] relates to her \u2018credit worthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 6-7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In a similar vein, the Ninth Circuit has held that an agency which compiles information concerning consumers who write bad checks is covered by the Act, in part because \u201c[u]nder the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act\u2019s definition of a \u2018consumer report (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(d)) ... a report of the previous issuance of an unpayable check bear[s] \u2018on a consumer\u2019s credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, [and] personal characteristics\u2019. . . .\u201d <em>(Greenway </em>v. <em>Information Dynamics, Ltd. </em>(9th Cir. 1975) 524 F.2d 1145, 1146, cert. den. (1976) 424 U.S. 936 [47 L.Ed.2d 344, 96 S.Ct. 1153]. This same conclusion was reached by the Fifth Circuit in <em>Estiverne </em>v. <em>Sak's Fifth Avenue </em>(5th Cir. 1993) 9 F.3d 1171, 1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Defendants argue at length that subdivision (d)(3) of 15 United States Code section 1681a should not be construed to apply. As noted, that catchall provision defines a consumer report in terms of its use in connection with \u201cother purposes authorized under section 1681b of this title.\u201d Section 1681b of 15 United States Code restricts the circumstances under which a consumer reporting agency may permissibly divulge a consumer report, limiting its ability to disclose to those situations specifically enumerated in the statute \u201cand no other.\u201d It, too, contains a catchall provision allowing disclosure \u201c[t]o a person which [the agency] has reason to believe . . . otherwise has a legitimate business need for the information in connection with a business transaction involving the consumer.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(3)(E).) As the authorities cited by defendants demonstrate, federal courts interpreting this provision have construed it to avoid wholesale dissemination of a consumer\u2019s files to anyone involved in any type of transaction with the consumer. (See, e.g., <em>Mone </em>v. <em>Dranow </em>(9th Cir. 1991) 945 F.2d 306, 308; <em>Ippolito </em>v. <em>WNS, Inc. </em>(7th Cir. 1988) 864 F.2d 440, 451; <em>Houghton </em>v. <em>New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co. </em>(3d Cir. 1986) 795 F.2d 1144, 1149.) But <em>Mone, Ippolito, </em>and <em>Houghton </em>involved defendants who obtained reports on adverse parties in litigation. None of the courts held that a landlord seeking to rent or lease an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>apartment does not have a \u201clegitimate business need\u201d for a consumer report.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> More to the point is the decision in <em>Estiverne </em>v. <em>Sak\u2019s Fifth Avenue, supra, </em>where the issue was whether a merchant seeking a credit report prior to honoring a check had a \u201c \u2018legitimate business need for the information in connection with a business transaction involving the consumer.\u2019 \u201d (9 F.3d at p. 1173.) The court held \u201cthat [the merchant\u2019s] obtaining of this report for the purpose of deciding whether to accept or reject a check in payment is a \u2018legitimate business need\u2019\u201d under both 1681a and 1681b. (9 F.3d at p. 1173.)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Our decision is further supported by the construction of the statute by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the federal agency specifically charged with its enforcement. (See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s(a).) In its commentary on FCRA, the FTC states that \u201c[r]eports about rental characteristics (e.g., consumers\u2019 evictions, rental payment histories, treatment of premises) are consumer reports, because they relate to character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living. . . . []QA report used to determine whether to rent a residence to a consumer is a consumer report, because it is used for a business transaction that the consumer wishes to enter into for personal, family or household purposes.\u201d (16 C.F.R., pt. 600, appen., \u00a7 603(d), \u00b6\u00b6[ 4(G) and 6(F) (1995).) The FTC\u2019s interpretation is entitled to some deference. <em>(Lukhard </em>v. <em>Reed </em>(1987) 481 U.S. 368, 378-379 [95 L.Ed.2d 328, 338-339, 107 S.Ct. 1807]; <em>Chevron U.S.A. </em>v. <em>Natural Res. Def. Council. </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 837, 843-845 [81 L.Ed.2d 694, 703-705, 104 S.Ct. 2778].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Based on these federal authorities and our construction of 15 United States Code section 1681a, we conclude that UDR\u2019s activities pertinent to this appeal are within the ambit of the FCRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">In their claim for relief under the state Unfair Business Practices Act, plaintiffs contended that defendants violated that law by repeated violations of CCRAA, IGRA, and FCRA. A demurrer to this cause of action was sustained without leave to amend. It should not have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>At the time the alleged acts occurred, section 17203 of the Business and Professions Code provided in relevant part: \u201cAny person performing or proposing to perform an act of unfair competition within this state may be enjoined in any court of competent jurisdiction\u201d and Business and Professions Code section 17200 defined \u201cunfair competition\u201d to mean \u201cunlawful, unfair or fraudulent business practice . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Stats. 1977, ch. 299, \u00a7 1.) Section 17204 allows actions for relief to be prosecuted \u201cby any person acting for the interests of itself, its members or the general public.\u201d In <em>Barquis </em>v. <em>Merchants Collection Assn. </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 94 [101 Cal.Rptr. 745, 496 P.2d 817], the Supreme Court rejected an argument that the act should be limited to common law unfair competition cases where a business enterprise presented itself, or its merchandise, to the public in a deceptive manner so as to defraud consumers. \u201cThe language of section 3369 [the predecessor of section 17203] does not limit its coverage to such \u2018deceptive\u2019 practices, but instead explicitly extends to any \u2018unlawful, unfair <em>or </em>deceptive business practice\u2019; the Legislature, in our view, intended by this sweeping language to permit tribunals to enjoin on-going wrongful business conduct in whatever context such activity might occur.\u201d (7 Cal.3d at p. Ill, italics in original.) Referring to the amendment which added the word \u201cunlawful\u201d to the types of wrongful business conduct that could be enjoined, the court noted: \u201c \u2018it is difficult to see any other purpose than to extend the meaning of unfair competition to anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 113.) The court cited as instructive the case of <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Kay-Dix Ranch </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 588 [88 Cal.Rptr. 443], in which the statute was applied to an action by agricultural workers to enjoin defendant farm owners from continuing the practice of knowingly employing illegal immigrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">More recently, in <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 377 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 487, 826 P.2d 730], the court adopted language set forth in the Attorney General\u2019s brief that \u201c \u2018[i]n essence, an action based on Business and Professions Code section 17200 to redress an unlawful business practice \u201cborrows\u201d violations of other laws and treats these violations, when committed pursuant to business activity, as unlawful practices independently actionable under section 17200 et seq. and subject to the distinct remedies provided thereunder.\u201d (2 Cal.4th at p. 383; accord, <em>Committee on Children's Television, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Foods Corp. </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 209-210 [197 Cal.Rptr. 783, 673 P.2d 660] [\u201c \u2018the section 17200 proscription of \u201cunfair competition\u201d is not restricted to deceptive or fraudulent conduct but extends to any <em>unlawful </em>business practice [citation].

Under <em>Barquis </em>such violations constitute unlawful business activities because they are by nature business practices and are forbidden by law.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">In light of this clear direction from the Supreme Court, we conclude that the wrongful acts alleged in the complaint comprised both a violation of the credit reporting statutes and the Unfair Business Practices Act. The demurrer to this cause of action was improperly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Moreover, this was not harmless error even though plaintiffs were able to seek injunctive relief under the consumer credit statutes. In proving an unfair business practice violation, claimants are entitled to introduce evidence not only of practices which affect them individually, but also similar practices involving other members of the public who are not parties to the action. <em>(Perdue </em>v. <em>Crocker National Bank </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 913, 929 [216 Cal.Rptr. 345, 702 P.2d 503]; <em>Consumers Union of United States, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fisher Development, Inc. </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1433, 1441-1442 [257 Cal.Rptr. 151]; <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>Atlantic Finance Co. </em>(1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 65, 72 [164 Cal.Rptr. 279].) Without the unfair business practices claim, the trial court restricted the scope of the evidence introduced at trial to that directly relevant to each individual plaintiff. Consequently, the case must be remanded for retrial of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The second issue raised by plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is whether UDR is required to have and maintain an office open to the public under either CCRAA or FCRA. At one time, UDR had such an office, but closed it due to threats made against its personnel. Now, when a tenant wishes to review his or her file in person, the tenant must make advance arrangements to meet UDR personnel either at its attorney\u2019s office or in some public place such as a restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Civil Code section 1785.10, a part of CCRAA, states that \u201c[e]very consumer credit reporting agency shall, upon request and proper identification of any consumer, allow the consumer to visually inspect all files maintained regarding that consumer at the time of the request.\u201d Subdivision (b) adds: \u201cEvery consumer reporting agency, upon contact by a consumer by phone, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>mail, or in person regarding information which may be contained in the agency files regarding that consumer, shall promptly advise the consumer ... of the obligation of the agency to provide disclosure of the files in person, by mail, or by telephone pursuant to Section 1785.15 .... The disclosure shall be provided in the manner selected by the consumer . . . .\u201d Subdivision (a) of section 1785.15 provides: \u201cA consumer credit reporting agency shall supply files and information required under Section 1785.10 during normal business hours and on reasonable notice.\u201d Subdivision (b), at the time of the complaint and trial, stated: \u201cFiles maintained on a consumer shall be disclosed promptly as follows: (1) In person, ... if he or she appears in person and furnishes proper identification.\u201d Although sections 1785.15 and 1785.10 have undergone extensive revision since the complaint was filed and the trial completed, we will confine ourselves to the law applicable at the time of the acts described in the complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Plaintiffs argue that UDR could not comply with Civil Code section 1785.10, subdivision (b)\u2019s requirement of disclosure to consumers contacting it \u201cby phone, mail, or in person\u201d unless it had a public office. That is not so. Section 1785.10, subdivision (b) mandated a certain response to a consumer whether the initial contact is made in person, by phone, or by mail. It did not require the agency to make itself available for in-person contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Civil Code section 1785.10, subdivision (b)\u2019s requirement that disclosure be made \u201cin the manner selected by the consumer\u201d provided a better rationale for plaintiffs\u2019 position, but it too fell short of mandating a public office. Read literally, it required only that the agency provide a means by which consumers could visually review their files in person. This UDR did by arranging to meet in public or at its attorney\u2019s office. It may be, as the trial court said, that the Legislature assumed credit agencies would have a publicly known street address, but it did not write that requirement into the statute in effect at the time of the complaint and trial. UDR complied with the literal requirements of Civil Code sections 1785.10, subdivision (b) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>1785.15 by arranging to meet with tenants at a place other than its normal business offices.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The Consumer\u2019s Union in its amicus curiae brief argues that UDR\u2019s procedures for in-person disclosure violate the CCRAA\u2019s express requirement that agencies disclose consumer files \u201cpromptly.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1785.15, subd. (b).) This provision also requires \u201creasonable notice\u201d to the agency. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1785.15, subd. (a).) As described in the statement of decision, UDR\u2019s practice was to call tenants back with information concerning where to meet for an in-person disclosure. There was no evidence describing how long this procedure took, or that suggested that in-person disclosure conducted at UDR\u2019s offices would take place with any more alacrity.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">FCRA contains similar language. Subdivision (a) of 15 United States Code section 1681g states: \u201cEvery consumer reporting agency shall, upon request and proper identification of any consumer, clearly and accurately disclose to the consumer: [TO (1) The nature and substance of all information (except medical information) in its files on the consumer at the time of the request.\u201d Section 1681h requires the agency to make the disclosure \u201cduring normal business hours and on reasonable notice.\u201d The federal statute also specifies that the required disclosure \u201cshall be made to the consumer\u2014[TO (1) in person if he appears in person and furnishes proper identification . . . .\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681h(b)(l).) The requirements of the federal statute also can be met by arranging for in-person visual inspection at a location separate from the agency\u2019s usual place of business. Plaintiffs point to commentary by the FTC on section 1681m as authority for a contrary position. That section applies to \u201cusers,\u201d not consumer reporting agencies. Under its provisions, when a user denies credit based on an adverse report, the user is to notify the consumer \u201cand supply the name and address of the consumer reporting agency making the report.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681m(a).) In its official commentary, the FTC has said that \u201c[t]he \u2018section [1681m]\u2019 notice must include the consumer reporting agency\u2019s street address, not just a post office box address.\u201d (16 C.F.R., pt. 600, appen., \u00a7 615, T 12 (1995).) But in its most recent revision of the comments made in response to criticism of this interpretation, the FTC explained: \u201cNothing in the comment precludes a user from including a post office address and a relevant street address in the [section 1681m] notice, <em>or from, providing a specialized office of the consumer reporting agency as the address where inquiries {including </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number><em>in-person </em>visits) <em>can be made.\u201d </em>(FTC Commentary, 55 Fed.Reg. 18804, 18808 (May 4, 1990), italics added.) So explained by the FTC itself, the commentary does not construe the statute to prohibit consumer reporting agencies from maintaining off-premises \u201cspecialized offices\u201d for in-person disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">We turn next to plaintiffs\u2019 claim that UDR\u2019s practice of soliciting written comments from its subscriber landlords concerning tenants\u2019 treatment of rental premises, then passing that information on to other subscribers, brings it under ICRA. The issue is significant because ICRA imposes stricter notice and verification requirements than CCRAA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The evidence showed that UDR sent forms to its subscribers asking them to report the manner in which the tenancy ended. The forms gave landlords the following examples of the kind of information being solicited: \u201cAlways paid rent late and then with NSF check. Changed jobs 7 times in 2 months. Vacated owing 3 months rent of $1200 . . . $800 damage, 2 broken windows, tom drapes, grease in carpets requiring replacement, broken light fixtures, took refrigerator belonging to apartment.\u201d UDR made no attempt to verify such information from the landlord, but simply logged it in as part of the tenant\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">This type of information appeared on only one report involved in the present appeal. The UDR file disclosed to June Halsell contained under the heading \u201cspecial info\u201d: \u201cover $1,000 property damage\u2014grease on walls and carpets; stove &amp; oven mined with substance melted in it; freezer door broken; garbage strewn on floors.\u201d Counsel for Ms. Halsell wrote to UDR stating that \u201c[t]he information contained in that \u2018Special Info\u2019 section of your consumer report is untme. There was no property damage caused by Ms. Halsell or anyone else connected with her tenancy. Although the freezer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>door was broken, it was broken by the manager when he moved the refrigerator into the apartment. Ms. Halsell did not cause the stove or oven to be \u2018ruined with substance melted on it\u2019 as alleged, nor was there garbage thrown on the floors. If there was any grease on the wall, it may have been near the stove from cooking, however there was no more than caused by ordinary wear and tear.\u201d UDR did not respond to that letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">UDR sought summary adjudication that it was not an investigative consumer reporting agency and that the reports obtained from landlords were not investigative consumer reports. The court initially denied the motion, finding that UDR \u201cis an investigative consumer reporting agency, and its \u2018Landlord Comments\u2019 constitute investigative consumer reports subject to the provisions of Civil Code section 1786 et seq.\u201d After trial, the court reversed this preliminary finding. It made known its intention to rule in this manner at trial, and counsel contended that UDR would still be required by CCRAA and FCRA to assure the accuracy of the information and reinvestigate consumer disputes. But the court ruled that Ms. Halsell could not pursue such a claim because it had not been adequately pled in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Ms. Halsell challenges both the finding that UDR is not an investigative consumer reporting agency and the ruling that she did not otherwise plead violation of CCRAA and FCRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">ICRA defines \u201cinvestigative consumer reporting agency\u201d as <em>\u201cany person who, </em>for monetary fees or dues, <em>regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating </em>employment or insurance information, or <em>information relating to the hiring of dwelling units, </em>or any combination thereof, concerning consumers for personal, family, or household purposes, <em>for the purposes of furnishing investigative consumer reports to third parties, to be used with respect to consumers </em>for employment purposes or, insurance primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, or <em>for purposes relating to the hiring of dwelling units </em>. . . .\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1786.2, subd. (d), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">It is undisputed that UDR regularly engages in the practice of assembling and evaluating information relating to the hiring of dwelling units. The issue is whether it does so for the purpose of furnishing \u201cinvestigative consumer reports.\u201d Under the statutory definition, an \u201cinvestigative consumer report\u201d is \u201ca consumer report in which information on a consumer\u2019s character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living is obtained through personal interviews with neighbors, friends, or associates of the consumer reported on, or others with whom he or she is acquainted or who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>may have knowledge concerning any of these items of information.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1786.2, subd. (c).) UDR argues that the reports it assembles and disseminates are not \u201cinvestigative consumer reports\u201d because the information is not obtained through \u201cpersonal interviews.\u201d There is merit to this contention. The landlords who submit the information do not obtain it through interviews but through personal observation of the premises. It therefore is not an investigative consumer report when prepared by the landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Whether it becomes an investigative consumer report when transmitted from the landlord to UDR is a much closer question, but one that the precepts of statutory construction require we decide in UDR\u2019s favor. Statutes are to be construed in accordance with their plain language. Civil Code section 1786.2 by its literal terms applies only to information obtained through \u201cpersonal\u201d interviews. While the dictionary definition of \u201cpersonal\u201d includes \u201cof or pertaining to a particular person,\u201d \u201cprivate,\u201d and \u201cconcerning a particular individual and his intimate affairs\u201d (American Heritage Dict. (2d ed. 1982) p. 925) in this context the word appears to mean \u201cin person.\u201d UDR solicits the information from landlords by way of forms sent to the subscribers to UDR\u2019s service, and landlords respond in writing. While this may be a form of \u201cinterview,\u201d it is not a \u201cpersonal interview.\u201d Since neither UDR nor the landlord obtains the information through personal interview, the reports do not meet the definition of \u201cinvestigative consumer reports,\u201d and ICRA is not implicated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>But this does not end the inquiry. The information collected is added to the tenant files maintained by UDR and is used \u201cas a factor in establishing the consumer\u2019s eligibility for . . . hiring of a dwelling unit,\u201d part of CCRAA\u2019s definition of \u201cconsumer credit report.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1785.3, subd. (c); see also 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(d).) As a disseminator of consumer credit files, UDR had an obligation \u201c[to] follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1785.14, subd. (b)), and to review and reinvestigate when disputes about the accuracy of the information are brought to its attention by the consumer (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1785.16). The same is true under FCRA. (See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681e(b) [\u201cWhenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.\u201d]; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681i(a) [\u201cIf the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in his file is disputed by a consumer, and such dispute is directly conveyed to the consumer reporting agency by the consumer, the consumer reporting agency shall within a reasonable period of time reinvestigate and record the current status of that information unless it has reasonable grounds to believe that the dispute by the consumer is frivolous or irrelevant. If after such reinvestigation such information is found to be inaccurate or can no longer be verified, the consumer reporting agency shall promptly delete such information\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">When Ms. Halsell attempted to go forward on her claim that UDR violated CCRAA and FCRA by failing to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information in her report and by failing to reinvestigate a disputed item, the trial court, reviewing paragraphs 20 and 21 of the second amended complaint, ruled that those claims had not been adequately pled. While it is true these paragraphs refer to an \u201cinvestigative report\u201d when discussing the specific facts relating to Ms. Halsell, the complaint also asserts that UDR failed to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom their reports relate and failed to reinvestigate the completeness and accuracy of its files when disputed by a consumer. That was sufficient to raise the issue, even if Ms. Halsell was initially mistaken about the legal basis for her claims. Ms. Halsell should have been permitted to go forward with her claim that UDR failed to assure maximum possible accuracy in a consumer report and failed to reinvestigate a disputed item.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The next issue raised by the appeal is whether UDR was required to disclose tenant files in response to a letter from the tenant\u2019s attorney. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>March of 1987, counsel for the Walkers wrote to UDR requesting disclosure of their file. At about the same time, counsel for Ms. Cisneros wrote to UDR requesting file disclosure.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> UDR responded stating that it would not disclose any information directly to representatives of consumers.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Subdivision (a) of Civil Code section 1785.10 provides: \u201cEvery consumer credit reporting agency shall, upon request and proper identification of any consumer, allow the consumer to visually inspect all files maintained regarding that consumer at the time of the request.\u201d Subdivision (b) of section 1785.15 adds: \u201cFiles maintained on a consumer shall be disclosed promptly as follows: ... (2) By mail, if the consumer makes a written request with proper identification for a copy of the file or a decoded written version of that file to be sent to the consumer at a specified address. . . .\u201d (See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681b, 1681c.) The trial court ruled that a consumer could raise a dispute through a representative, but in order to obtain disclosure of a credit file in the first instance, the request had to come from the consumer. The court relied on section 1785.15, subdivision (e) which permits a consumer who seeks in-person disclosure to be \u201caccompanied\u201d by one other person of his or her choosing, but not to send a third party in his or her stead. The court reasoned that if a consumer could not authorize a representative to obtain in-person disclosure, the representative should be equally unable to obtain disclosure by mail. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">As previously noted, the privacy right of consumers was an express concern of Congress and the California Legislature in enacting the credit reporting statutes. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1785.1, subd. (c); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681(a)(4).) This purpose underlies numerous provisions of CCRAA. For example, section 1785.11 of the Civil Code strictly limits the circumstances under which consumer reports can be disseminated, and Civil Code section 1785.14 requires reporting agencies to \u201cmaintain reasonable procedures designed ... to limit furnishing of consumer credit reports to the purposes listed under Section 1785.11.\u201d To that end, agencies must \u201crequire that prospective users of the information identify themselves, certify the purposes for which the information is sought and certify that the information will be used for no other purposes.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1785.14, subd. (a).) In addition, \u201c[e]very consumer credit reporting agency shall make a reasonable effort to verify the identity of a new prospective user and the uses certified by such prospective user prior to furnishing such user a consumer report.\u201d <em>(Ibid:, </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681b, 1681c.)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>The Legislature\u2019s concern for the confidentiality of consumer reports is also shown by the procedures set out in section 1785.15 of the Civil Code to verify the identity of the consumer prior to making disclosure. For in-person disclosures, the consumer must appear and \u201cfurnish proper identification,\u201d any third party accompanying him or her \u201cshall furnish reasonable identification,\u201d and the consumer must on request \u201cfurnish a written statement granting permission to the consumer credit reporting agency to discuss the consumer\u2019s file in such person\u2019s presence.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1785.15, subds. (b)(1) and (e); see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681h(b)(l) and (d).) Disclosure by telephone can be made only after \u201cthe consumer has made a written request, with proper identification for telephone disclosure.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1785.15, subd. (b)(3); see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681h(b)(2).) In light of these safeguards designed to prevent dissemination to unauthorized persons, it would make little sense to interpret the statute as requiring disclosure whenever the agency receives a letter containing the bald assertion that the author represents the subject consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">We agree, therefore, that both FCRA and CCRAA contemplate that requests for disclosure come from the consumer personally rather than from his or her representative.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This does not work any substantial hardship on consumers. An attorney or third party representative can just as easily prepare a disclosure request for the consumer\u2019s signature as make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>request for disclosure himself or herself. Moreover, as provided in subdivision (b)(2) of Civil Code section 1785.15, when the request is made by the consumer in writing for disclosure by mail, the consumer may ask that the files and information be sent to any \u201cspecified\u201d address, and that may be the address for the consumer\u2019s attorney or other representative.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">UDR\u2019s records contained information that two unlawful detainer actions had been filed a day apart in 1985 against \u201cAlice Arias.\u201d One involved plaintiff Alice Arias, the other involved a different individual with that name. When Ms. Arias requested disclosure of her file, the one in which she was definitely involved was disclosed to her, but not the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Similarly, UDR\u2019s files showed that \u201cQuida Johnson\u201d had been involved in two eviction actions filed in November of 1982 and February of 1983. When Ms. Johnson applied for subsidized housing, UDR reported those evictions as positively being hers. After obtaining disclosure of her file, Ms. Johnson protested that she was not the person involved in the disputes reported. She provided documentation showing a different address during the relevant time periods. Ultimately, UDR sent a letter stating \u201cwe have removed her identity from those cases\u201d but that \u2018[tjhose cases, however, will most likely continue to be reported in the event your client is inquired about, merely due to the similar name . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Plaintiffs sought an injunction preventing UDR from reporting \u201cpossibles,\u201d and requiring that it disclose to consumers all \u201cpossibles\u201d about which reports were made, even if UDR conceded it was unsure if the consumer was the party involved in the case. By order dated June 22, 1989, summary adjudication was granted for plaintiffs on the following pertinent issues: \u201c[D 2. Defendants cannot make a report about a consumer unless defendants have positively identified that consumer as the party involved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>the unlawful detainer or other action reported by the UDR; and [ID 3. Defendants must disclose to consumers all cases about which defendants have made reports, even if defendants have made reports about the consumer when defendants are unsure that the consumer is the party involved in the case reported.\u201d According to the record, UDR ceased reporting possibles after it received the preliminary order. Subsequently, the trial court refused to grant injunctive relief, in part because \u201cthe evidence at trial [is] that since [the court\u2019s] order was made, UDR no longer reports or discusses \u2018possibles.\u2019 \u201d Plaintiffs challenge this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u201cThe denial of an injunction is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will be upheld on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>(Donald </em>v. <em>Cafe Royale, Inc. </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 168, 184 [266 Cal.Rptr. 804].) \u201cA change in circumstances, rendering injunctive relief moot or unnecessary, justifies the denial of an injunction.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cAn injunction should not be granted as punishment for past acts . . . .\u201d <em>(Choice-In-Education League </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Unified School Dist. </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 415, 422 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 303].) The injunctive remedy should not be exercised \u201cin the absence of any evidence that the acts are likely to be repeated in the future.\u201d <em>(Mallon </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach </em>(1958) 164 Cal.App.2d 178, 190 [330 P.2d 423].) Injunctive relief can be denied where the defendant voluntarily discontinues the wrongful conduct. <em>(California Service Station etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>Union Oil Co. ( </em>1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 44, 56 [283 Cal.Rptr. 279].)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In denying the injunction, the trial court took particular note of the evidence that since the preliminary order was made, UDR ceased reporting or discussing \u201cpossibles.\u201d Implicit in this is the determination that the acts are unlikely to recur, and that a permanent injunction would have no impact other than as a punishment for past acts. Plaintiffs present no basis for disturbing the trial court\u2019s ruling in this regard, and we affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Quida Johnson appeals from the determination in UDR\u2019s favor of her claims under CCRAA and FCRA. Ms. Johnson contended that UDR erroneously identified her as having been involved in two unlawful detainers, based solely on the similarity of her name and the name of the defendant in the unlawful detainer actions. When she sought to have UDR correct her file, UDR initially refused to reinvestigate unless she signed a form \u201cauthorizing] The U.D. Registry, Inc., and/or its agents and/or investigators to verify and otherwise investigate the above information and any other private or public information contained or possessed by any bank, savings institution, medical practitioner, employer, or any other private or governmental entity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>as deemed necessary by the U.D. Registry, Inc.\u201d Later, UDR sent the letter which we have described, stating \u201cwe have removed her identity from those cases\u201d but that \u201c[t]hose cases, however, will most likely continue to be reported in the event your client is inquired about, merely due to the similar name . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The trial court agreed with plaintiff that an erroneous report had been made, but found that UDR was not liable because it \u201chas developed and follows \u2018reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy\u2019 as that phrase is used in [Civil Code section] 1785.14.\u201d It found that UDR had not followed its procedures in the case of Ms. Johnson, noting that \u201csomething plainly went wrong in [that] case . . . ,\u201d but that UDR\u2019s refusal to reinvestigate was justified because Ms. Johnson had refused to sign the waiver. The court granted judgment in favor of defendants on both claims. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">CCRAA and FCRA require credit reporting agencies to reinvestigate information contained in the report whenever a dispute is conveyed by the consumer to the agency. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1785.16; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681L) We hold that, as a matter of law, a consumer reporting agency\u2019s insistence that the consumer sign a form waiving all privacy rights to financial and medical information prior to reinvestigating an item in his or her file violates these statutes. It follows that the issue of whether UDR properly responded to Ms. Johnson\u2019s request for reinvestigation should have been resolved in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Turning to the erroneous report claim, the applicable law is found in the requirement of Civil Code section 1785.14, subdivision (b) that \u201creasonable procedures [be followed] to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates,\u201d and the requirement of section 1785.16 that a consumer credit reporting agency \u201cmaintain reasonable procedures designed to prevent the reappearance in a consumer\u2019s file and in consumer credit reports of information that has been deleted pursuant to this section . . . .\u201d (See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681e(b).) UDR responds that neither CCRAA nor FCRA imposes strict liability on the credit agency for an erroneous report. Defendants misconstrue what is meant by \u201cstrict liability\u201d in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Under the statutes, a credit reporting agency must have in place reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy <em>and follow them. </em>If it does, then the fact that it erroneously reported unfavorable information does not subject it to liability. (See, e.g., <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Credit Bureau, Inc. </em>(D.C. Cir. 1984) 734 F.2d 47, 51-53 [236 App.D.C. 146]; <em>Hauser </em>v. <em>Equifax, Inc. </em>(8th Cir. 1979) 602 F.2d 811, 814-815; <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>TRW, Inc. </em>(E.D.Mich. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>1980) 487 F.Supp. 1234, 1240, affd. (6th Cir. 1982) 689 F.2d 72.) If, on the other hand, it negligently fails to follow its own procedures, and as a consequence an individual is damaged by an inaccurate report, it is subject to liability. <em>(Stewart </em>v. <em>Credit Bureau, Inc., supra, </em>734 F.2d at p. 56 [holding that there was \u201ca genuine issue of material fact as to whether [defendant] followed reasonable procedures to assure the accuracy of <em>[plaintiffs] </em>credit report\u201d (italics added)]; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Credit Bureau of Garden City, Inc. </em>(D.Kan. 1988) 703 F.Supp. 897, 902 [finding that plaintiff came forward with sufficient evidence to avoid summary judgment on a claim for failure to assure maximum possible accuracy when he established that defendant recorded inaccurate information in his file without verifying the address or social security number of the real debtor]; <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>TRW, Inc., supra, </em>487 F.Supp. at p. 1238 [\u201c[T]he law is directed not at defendant\u2019s policies but at the actual procedure it followed in obtaining information and preparing the two mortgage reports <em>on plaintiff.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The issue here is whether UDR had procedures in place to assure that a positive identification would not be made between a person applying for a rental unit and a name appearing in an unlawful detainer on the strength of nothing more than a UDR employee\u2019s perception of the peculiarity of the name. Defendants did not dispute that Ms. Johnson was identified as having been involved in two unlawful detainers solely on the basis of her unusual first name. Instead, defendants sought to establish at trial, by examining voter registration and Department of Motor Vehicles rolls, that there was only one Quida Johnson in the area. In other words, they claim, if they had had adequate procedures in place, and had followed them, the same mistake would have been made. Such after-the-fact rationalization is of no consequence. To establish a defense based on these types of records, UDR needed to show that it had a procedure in place to examine such records <em>before </em>concluding that a particular name was unique, <em>and </em>that it followed such procedures prior to reporting that Quida Johnson was involved in two unlawful detainers. In the absence of such evidence, the fact that UDR had good identification procedures encompassing other situations and generally followed them, as the trial court found, was no defense to Ms. Johnson\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Because we hold as a matter of law that UDR\u2019s response to Ms. Johnson\u2019s dispute letters was unreasonable, and its sole defense to the erroneous report claim inadequate, there is no need to retry liability. On remand, the sole issue on Ms. Johnson\u2019s claims will be damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Because we reverse and remand for retrial on a number of issues, the determination of who is the prevailing party and the amount of attorney fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>to be awarded must be recalculated after further proceedings. CCRAA contains a provision by which the prevailing party, whether it be the consumer or the agency, is entitled to his or her attorney fees. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1785.31, subd. (d).) FCRA permits attorney fees to the prevailing consumer only. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681n, 1681o.) Plaintiffs seek a determination that attorney fees cannot be awarded to UDR under any circumstances on the ground that the California statute, granting recovery of attorney fees to whichever party prevails, is preempted by FCRA, which permits recovery by a prevailing consumer only.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In enacting FCRA, Congress did not attempt to reserve to itself all efforts to regulate the consumer reporting business. (See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681t [\u201cThis subchapter does not annul, alter, affect, or exempt any person subject to the provisions of this subchapter from complying with the laws of any State with respect to the collection, distribution, or use of any information on consumers, except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with any provision of this subchapter, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.\u201d]; <em>Credit Data of Arizona, Inc. </em>v. <em>State of Ariz. </em>(9th Cir. 1979) 602 F.2d 195, 197.) California is not foreclosed from enacting greater protections for consumers injured by the activities of reporting agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Nor is the Legislature\u2019s decision to include a two-way attorney fee provision barred. Under the supremacy clause, state law is preempted only if it \u201cis in direct conflict with federal law such that compliance with both is impossible, or the state law is an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of Congress . . . .\u201d <em>(Gomon </em>v. <em>TRW, Inc. </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 256]; accord, <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 1358, 1363 [243 Cal.Rptr. 572].) The remedies afforded to injured consumers by CCRAA are not inconsistent with, but are in addition to, remedies provided by FCRA. Consumers bringing lawsuits against credit reporting agencies may choose to disregard the state law entirely and rely exclusively on the federal statute. In that case, the consumer would not be exposed to the risk of incurring the cost of the agency\u2019s attorney fees. It is only when the consumer seeks the benefit of the greater protections of California law that this possibility arises. California\u2019s decision to offer greater protection to the consumer in a statute that provides for attorney\u2019s fees to whichever side prevails does not conflict with federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The same conclusion was reached in <em>Gomon </em>v. <em>TRW, Inc., supra, </em>in which the court held that CCRAA attorney fee provision does not conflict with FCRA, \u201cnor is it an obstacle to its purposes and objectives\u201d because \u201c[a] plaintiff is not precluded by the CCRAA from bringing suit under the FCRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>A consumer may sue under the FCRA and avoid the risk of having to pay the defendant\u2019s attorney fees if he or she does not prevail.\u201d (28 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1173-1174.)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">We find further support for this view in the FTC\u2019s official commentary on the FCRA\u2019s preemption provision. According to the FTC, \u201cState law is pre-empted by the FCRA only when compliance with inconsistent State law would result in <em>violation of the FCRA\u201d </em>(16 C.F.R., pt. 600, appen. \u00a7 622, \u00b61 (1995) italics added). This interpretation \u201cis based on an unequivocal statement in the principal report in the FCRA\u2019s legislative history by the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency that, under the pre-emption provision, \u2018no State law would be preempted unless compliance would involve a violation of Federal law.\u2019 S. Rep., 91-517, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 8 (November 5, 1969).\u201d (FTC Commentary, 55 Fed.Reg. 18804, 18808, <em>supra.) </em>Under this interpretation, \u201c[a] State law requirement that an employer provide notice to a consumer before ordering a consumer report, or that a consumer reporting agency must provide the consumer with a written copy of his file, would not be pre-empted, because a party that complies with such provisions would not violate the FCRA.\u201d (16 C.F.R., pt. 600, appen. \u00a7 622, \u00b6 2, <em>supra.) </em>If state law may impose additional requirements on credit reporting agencies, the state\u2019s provision of attorney fees to the party prevailing on a claim brought under its more restrictive statute is equally valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In its cross-appeal, UDR contends that plaintiffs Cisneros and Pettus should not have prevailed on their claim that UDR failed to respond to their dispute letters as required by the statute. Once again, some factual background is required for a full understanding of the parties\u2019 positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Plaintiff Vincent Loven was the defendant in an unlawful detainer action filed in December of 1985. The case was dismissed, and he remained in possession of the premises. Mr. Loven obtained a copy of his file from UDR. In a letter to UDR, Mr. Loven argued that he should be listed as the prevailing party because the landlord had wrongfully sought to evict him in order to move the landlord\u2019s son onto the premises. UDR replied, stating that it did not consider this a dispute as to the accuracy or completeness of its files, that it considered the request to be \u201cfrivolous or irrelevant,\u201d and that it would not investigate further.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Plaintiff Rudine Pettus was involved in three unlawful detainer actions. In one, she claims she withheld rent because of habitability violations. In another, she settled based on the landlord\u2019s agreement not to report the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>to any credit agency. The third was not pursued after more than five years on file and was subject to dismissal for failure to prosecute, although apparently it never was actually dismissed. All of these actions were part of her file at UDR, although UDR had not yet reported the contents of the file to any of its subscribers. After obtaining disclosure of her file, Ms. Pettus wrote to UDR through counsel, explaining why she should be deemed to be the prevailing party in each of those actions. UDR did not respond, because Ms. Pettus\u2019s counsel also represented plaintiff Vincent Loven, and UDR\u2019s position for not changing the file was similar to its reason for refusing to change Mr. Loven\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Ruth Cisneros was a defendant in three unlawful detainer actions involving the same landlord and the same premises. In each, the case was dismissed or settled and Ms. Cisneros retained possession of the premises. She moved in February of 1988 of her own accord. Counsel for Ms. Cisneros wrote to UDR, explaining that each unlawful detainer filed represented an attempt by the landlord to evict Ms. Cisneros without good cause as required under the lease including, on one occasion, a refusal to accept her proffer of rent. UDR did not respond to the dispute raised in the letter, for the same reason it had not responded to Ms. Pettus; its previous correspondence with the same attorney concerning Mr. Loven\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">By order dated July 10, 1989, partially granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the court ruled that a tenant is adjudged the prevailing party in an unlawful detainer action if a demurrer is sustained without leave to amend or a dismissal is filed for failure to prosecute, but not if the landlord voluntarily dismisses or settles. In accordance with this ruling, the court found that plaintiffs Loven, Pettus, and Cisneros were not prevailing parties when their actions were dismissed by the landlord or settled. The trial court also ruled that even if their disputes were regarded by UDR as frivolous, a response was required by Civil Code section 1785.16.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">In its cross-appeal, UDR claims that no response was required because plaintiffs Cisneros and Pettus were not disputing the accuracy of their reports as much as the reportability of unlawful detainers in which they were not adjudged the prevailing party. By focusing narrowly on the kinds of unlawful detainers it can and cannot report, UDR overlooks its broader obligations under the statutes as a credit reporting agency. Both CCRAA and FCRA require \u201cmaximum possible\u201d accuracy. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1785.14, subd. (b); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681e(b).) This means that a report violates the statutes when it is misleading or incomplete, even if it is technically accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number><em>(Koropoulos </em>v. <em>Credit Bureau, Inc. </em>(D.C. Cir. 1984) 734 F.2d 37, 40 [236 App.D.C. 136, 81 A.L.R.Fed. 187]; <em>Pinner </em>v. <em>Schmidt </em>(5th Cir. 1986) 805 F.2d 1258, 1262-1263.) In <em>Koropoulos, </em>the District of Columbia Circuit held that reporting that a consumer defaulted on a loan without also reporting that he subsequently paid the debt in full violated the FCRA. The court \u201cd[id] not agree with the district court that section 1681e(b) makes a credit reporting agency liable for damages only if the report contains statements that are technically untrue. Congress did not limit the Act\u2019s mandate to reasonable procedures to assure only technical accuracy; to the contrary, the Act requires reasonable procedures to assure \u2018maximum accuracy.\u2019 The Act\u2019s self-stated purpose is \u2018to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit ... in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information.\u2019 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681e(b). Certainly reports containing factually correct information that nonetheless mislead their readers are neither maximally accurate nor fair to the consumer who is the subject of the reports.\u201d <em>(Koropoulos </em>v. <em>Credit Bureau, Inc., supra, </em>734 F.2d at p. 40; accord, <em>Henson </em>v. <em>CSC Credit Services </em>(S.D.Ind. 1993) 830 F.Supp. 1204, 1207, revd. in part on other grounds (7th Cir. 1994) 29 F.3d 280 [adopting the <em>Koropoulos </em>test]; <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Moore &amp; Associates, Inc., supra, </em>553 F.Supp. 948, 952 [finding that \u201csection 1681e(b) of the Act, fairly read, would apply to consumer reports even though they may be technically accurate, if it is shown that such reports are not accurate to the maximum possible extent.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The Cisneros and Pettus letters raised not only the technical question of whether the unlawful detainers were reportable, but also whether it was proper to report them as nonprevailing parties in several unlawful detainer actions without explaining the circumstances. These plaintiffs were entitled to a response from UDR.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">X</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Defendants contend that the trial court wrongly awarded Ms. Cisneros and Ms. Pettus a total of $350 for \u201cpain and suffering\u201d when there was no evidence to indicate that their \u201cemotional distress\u201d was severe. We infer from the amount of the awards that the distress was not severe. Ms. Cisneros and Ms. Pettus were clearly wronged by UDR, and the minimal amount awarded by the trial court can be justified as nominal damages. (See, e.g., <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Shelter Financial Services </em>(W.D.Mo. 1984) 604 F.Supp. 201, 203; <em>Boothe </em>v. <em>TRW Credit Data </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1982) 557 F.Supp. 66, 71-72.) Therefore, we need not and do not reach the issue of whether the award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>damages for pain and suffering under the CCRAA requires a higher level of severity than that shown by the record here.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">XI</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Defendants\u2019 contention that plaintiffs should be forced to elect remedies is based on a provision in CCRAA which states: \u201cAny consumer credit reporting agency or user of information against whom an action brought pursuant to Section 168In or 1681o of Title 15 of the United States Code is pending shall not be subject to suit for the same act or omission under Section 1785.31.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1785.34, subd. (a).) The trial court ruled that this section \u201cis intended to . . . apply to a circumstance where there is a prior action pending under the federal law, and someone brings a later action under the state law. I think that\u2019s the plain meaning of the statute.\u201d We agree with the trial court\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">XII</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Defendant Saltz cross-appeals from the portion of the order imposing personal liability on him for the failure to respond to the Cisneros and Pettus dispute letters. He argues that CCRAA imposes requirements only on \u201cconsumer credit reporting agencies,\u201d and he cannot be liable because he does not fit the statutory definition of the term. Although the trial court agreed that he was not an agency, it imposed liability because the evidence was \u201cclear that it was defendant Saltz who made the decision that a response would not be made to the Cisneros and Pettus requests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">CCRAA defines \u201cconsumer credit reporting agency\u201d as \u201cany person who, for monetary fees, dues, or on a cooperative nonprofit basis, regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or other information on consumers for the purpose of furnishing consumer credit reports to third parties . . . .\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1785.3, subd. (d).) Although defendant Saltz is an officer and employee of UDR which is a consumer reporting agency, he is not, himself, an agency under the statute. There was no evidence that fees were paid to him personally as opposed to the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">The question is whether an officer, director, or other agent of a corporation is jointly liable with the corporation when he or she personally directs the corporation to violate a statutory provision. It is a well-recognized principle of law that corporate officers and directors \u201care jointly liable with the corporation and may be joined as defendants if they personally directed or participated in the tortious conduct.\u201d <em>(Frances T. </em>v. <em>Village Green Owners </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number><em>Assn. </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 490, 504 [229 Cal.Rptr. 456, 723 P.2d 573].) Our Supreme Court held in that case, \u201c[directors are liable to third persons injured by their own tortious conduct regardless of whether they acted on behalf of the corporation and regardless of whether the corporation is also liable. [Citations.] This liability does not depend on the same grounds as \u2018piercing the corporate veil,\u2019 on account of inadequate capitalization for instance, but rather on the officer or director\u2019s personal participation or specific authorization of the tortious act.\u201d (42 Cal.3d at p. 504.)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Thus, corporate officers and directors are personally liable for acts of the corporation that violate, for example, the antitrust laws if they participate in the actions or authorize them. (See, e.g., <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Oakland Raiders, Ltd. </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 67, 77 [259 Cal.Rptr. 149], and cases cited therein.) On the other hand, in <em>Doctors' Company </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 39 [260 Cal.Rptr. 183, 775 P.2d 508], where the issue was whether a corporate agent could be liable for conspiring to violate a provision of the Insurance Code, the court held: \u201cA cause of action for civil conspiracy may not arise, however, if the alleged conspirator, though a participant in the agreement underlying the injury, was not personally bound by the duty violated by the wrongdoing and was acting only as the agent or employee of the party who did have that duty. . . . [H In the present case, the only duty toward plaintiff claimed to have been breached as a result of the defendants\u2019 alleged conspiracy is the statutory duty to attempt \u2018in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear\u2019 (\u00a7 790.03(h)(5)). That duty is imposed by statute <em>solely </em>upon persons engaged in the business of insurance. (\u00a7790.01.) Because the noninsurer defendants are not subject to that duty and were acting merely as agents of the insurer \u2018and not as individuals for their individual advantage\u2019 [citation], \u2018they cannot be held accountable on a theory of conspiracy.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (49 Cal.3d at pp. 44-45, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\"><em>Self-Insurers' Security Fund </em>v. <em>ESIS, Inc. </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1148 [251 Cal.Rptr. 693] is to the same effect. In that case, the court held that a corporate officer could not be personally liable for violation of Labor Code section 3701, which imposes a penalty for failure to post security with the Director of the Department of Industrial Relations in the amount of the corporation\u2019s estimated workers\u2019 compensation liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">We conclude that the determination of whether or not a corporate officer, director, or other agent is personally liable for directing the corporation to violate a statutory requirement depends on the terms of the statute and the nature of the duties imposed. Civil Code section 1785.16, the only provision with which we are concerned here, requires a <em>consumer reporting agency </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>respond to consumer disputes within five days after a determination has been made that the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant. This duty is imposed solely on the agency itself. The requirement is statutory. There is no similar duty under common law. We conclude, therefore, that a consumer reporting agency\u2019s officer is not liable for the failure of the agency to make a formal response to a consumer complaint. Whether a corporate officer, director, or other agent may be personally liable when he or she directs or participates in the violation of other specific provisions of FCRA, CCRAA, or ICRA is an issue that is not before us, and we express no opinion concerning it.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The case is reversed and remanded for retrial of plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the Unfair Business Practices Act, plaintiff June Halsell\u2019s claims that UDR failed to assure maximum possible accuracy of her consumer report and failed to reinvestigate a disputed item, plaintiff Quida Johnson\u2019s damages, and attorney fees.

In this case, however, plaintiffs sought both injunctive relief and damages, as well as a determination that UDR was engaged in unfair business practices by violating existing law. Moreover, the record as developed is insufficient to enable us to determine whether UDR is in compliance with the amended statute.

Both statutes exclude from the definition of investigative consumer report \u201cspecific factual information relating to a consumer\u2019s credit record or manner of obtaining credit obtained directly from a creditor of the consumer or from a consumer reporting agency when that information was obtained directly from a potential or existing creditor of the consumer or from the consumer.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1786.2, subd. (c); see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(e) [\u201cHowever, such information shall not include specific factual information on a consumer\u2019s credit record obtained directly from a creditor of the consumer or from a consumer reporting agency when such information was obtained directly from a creditor of the consumer or from the consumer.\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\"> We again find support for our determination in the FTC\u2019s interpretation of FCRA. Construing section 1681a(e) of title 15 of the United States Code, the FTC has said: \u201cA consumer report that contains information on a consumer\u2019s \u2018character, general reputation, personal characteristics or mode of living\u2019 obtained through telephone interviews with third parties is an \u2018investigative consumer report,\u2019 because \u2018personal interviews\u2019 includes interviews conducted by telephone as well as in person.\u201d (16 C.F.R., pt. 600, appen., \u00a7 603(e), 1 (4) (1995).) Significantly, the FTC omits investigations conducted through written reports.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b215-7\"> Plaintiff June Halsell also alleged that UDR ignored a disclosure request from her counsel. In its statement of decision, the trial court found the evidence undisputed that her file, in fact, had been transmitted to her. Ms. Halsell does not contest this finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b215-8\"> UDR did not dispute the identity of the persons requesting disclosure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b216-5\"> Section 1785.11 of the Civil Code, in listing the only circumstances under which an agency may furnish a consumer credit report, includes as one such circumstance, \u201c[i]n accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1785.11, subd. (a)(2); see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(2).) Because that provision does not mandate that reports be made at the written instructions of the consumer, it is not directly relevant here. It is, however, a complete answer to UDR\u2019s contention that the credit reporting statutes forbade it to respond to plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 requests. (See <em>A-1 Cr. and Assur. </em>v. <em>Trans Union Cr. Information </em>(E.D.Pa. 1988) 678 F.Supp. 1147, 1150 [\u201cThe [FCRA] allows, but does not mandate, that the consumer reporting agency disclose information under the circumstances enumerated in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b,\u201d one of the circumstances being \u201c[i]n accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates.\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The trial court properly found, and UDR apparently concedes, that dispute resolution is a different matter. Once disclosure has been made and the issue is the accuracy of the information contained in the report, a representative working on behalf of the consumer can convey the consumer\u2019s position on disputed information and the requirements of response and reinvestigation contained in section 1785.16 of the Civil Code and section 16811 of title 15 United States Code apply. (See, e.g., <em>Milbauer </em>v. <em>TRW, Inc. </em>(E.D.N.Y. 1989) 707 F.Supp. 92, 95 [\u201c[C]onsumer reporting agencies such as TRW are not privileged to ignore a consumer\u2019s dispute simply because that dispute is submitted by a third party.\u201d]; <em>Pinner </em>v. <em>Schmidt </em>(E.D.La. 1985) 617 F.Supp. 342, 346-347, revd. in part on other grounds (5th Cir. 1986) 805 F.2d 1258 [\u201cIt is inconceivable to the Court that an attorney could not represent a consumer in [conveying a dispute to the consumer reporting agency], and the Court opines that requirements of direct communication elsewhere in the FCRA are intended only to protect the consumer by affording him a qualified confidentiality in the extensive information available from his credit files.\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b217-9\"> Attached to the letter written on behalf of Ms. Cisneros was an \u201cAuthorization\u201d signed by her stating \u201cI hereby authorize David Pallack . . . to be my representative, and do hereby give my authorization for release of all confidential and other information about me to David Pallack or other person associated with him, that may be contained in your file.\u201d Attached to the letter on behalf of the Walkers were similar authorizations which stated: \u201cI hereby authorize your company/organization to release any and all information pertaining thereto [to] the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles and its employees, including, but not limited to, all records and reports on file of any nature whatsoever. [&lt;\u00a10 I further instruct that all correspondence, notices and papers involving my records be sent to said Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles at its address given above.\u201d Because the issue was neither raised in appellants\u2019 brief nor argued below, we do not decide whether the requests submitted on behalf of the Walkers or Ms. Cisneros were, in fact, requests for disclosure made by the consumer personally to be sent to a specified address.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b223-8\"> The court found no corresponding requirement under FCRA, a determination which is not challenged by plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
