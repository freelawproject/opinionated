The trial court ruled that American States and another excess carrier, Truck Insurance Exchange (Truck), were co-insurers and share equally in the excess cost of settling a personal injury action brought against their insureds. We affirm. Substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the cost of settlement should be equally prorated because the excess policies provided overlapping coverage and insured against the same risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">In 1986 Azam Sher and his wife, Cynthia Yelvington, wanted to construct a home at 34 Appaloosa Lane in Bell Canyon. Alam Sher, Azam\u2019s father, a licensed general contractor in Oregon, moved to California, lived with Azam and Yelvington, and supervised construction of the new home.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>On June 9, 1988, Russell Gebhardt was seriously injured when a wood scaffold collapsed at the jobsite. The scaffold, which was 12 feet high, had no handrails and was too narrow. Deitrick &amp; Quin, Gebhardt\u2019s employer, built the scaffold with wood purchased by Alam. Alam hired Deitrick &amp; Quin to do the framing work and had it sign a subcontract providing that it would furnish \u201call necessary scaffolding.\u201d Deitrick &amp; Quin employees allegedly asked Alam to supply metal scaffolding but Alam ordered them to build the scaffold from wood at the jobsite.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\n<em>Underlying Settlement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Gebhardt filed suit against Alam, Azam, and Yelvington. (Gebhardt v. Sher (Super. Ct. Ventura County, No. 103355).) The complaint alleged causes of action against all defendants for peculiar risk, negligent maintenance and ownership, supervisory negligence and negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Alam, Azam, and Yelvington tendered the complaint to their insurer carriers. Azam and Yelvington had a Fire Insurance Exchange (Fire) policy that provided $300,000 personal liability coverage and a $1 million umbrella policy issued by Truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Alam had a $300,000 dwelling fire insurance policy issued by Safeco Insurance Company of America (Safeco) and a $1 million umbrella policy with American States. Safeco denied coverage because its policy only provided premises liability coverage for Alam\u2019s house in Oregon. American States claimed that it had no obligation to defend or indemnify until the Fire and Truck policies were exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Fire and Truck defended Azam, Yelvington, and Alam subject to a reservation of the right to seek contribution from American States and Safeco. American States attended the underlying settlement conferences but did not contribute thereto. Fire and Truck settled the Gebhardt action for $1,275,000 and filed suit against Safeco and American States for declaratory relief and equitable subrogation</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">\n<em>Declaratory Relief Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\"><em>A </em>16-day court trial ensued. Fire and Truck presented expert testimony that the settlement was fair and reasonable. James Wesely, a liability claims examiner with over 35 years\u2019 experience, testified that Gebhardt had a strong case against Alam and Azam for negligence. Wesley opined that Alam was 100 percent liable and the peculiar risk cause of action did not play a paramount role in the decision to settle. Christopher Carder, the Truck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>claims representative who participated in the settlement, agreed with Wesely and stated that Gebhardt\u2019s peculiar risk claim was not the primary theory of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The parties stipulated that Azam and Yelvington were named insureds on the Truck policy and that \u201cAlam Sher is also insured under the Truck policy, by definition, because the policy covers relatives residing in the household of the named insured.\u201d It was also stipulated that Azam and Yelvington were not insureds under the American States policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The trial court found that \u201cSafeco had no duty to defend or indemnify Alam Sher in the Gebhardt case based on the dwelling fire policy as it was written. [&lt;]Q 2. Alam Sher was an insured under the Fire policy. The Fire condo owners policy satisfied the requirement in the American States umbrella policy for [$300,000] underlying personal liability insurance or comprehensive personal liability insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The trial court further found that \u201c[t]he Truck and the American States policies are both umbrella policies. Both cover personal liability. Both provide worldwide coverage. Each has similar \u2018other insurance\u2019 clauses which cannot both be given effect. Both must be ignored as mutually repugnant. Both umbrella policies admittedly apply to provide coverage for the Gebhardt claim with respect to the type of injury claimed, the claimed bases of liability, and the location of the occurrence. Neither umbrella policy is \u2018specific insurance for a specific risk\u2019 different from the other such that it would be rendered primary to the other umbrella policy. ... [^ 5. In stacking order, both umbrella policies are excess to the primary Fire policy, and both apply after the Fire policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The trial court concluded that Fire was the primary insurer and had to pay the first $300,000 of the settlement. Truck and American States were ordered to each contribute one-half of the $975,000 excess judgment, i.e., $487,500. Judgment was entered against American States for $487,500 plus prejudgment interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">On review the judgment is presumed correct and all intendments and presumptions are indulged in favor of its correctness. \u201c[Tjhe judgment must be upheld if it was supported by any substantial evidence, even if this is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>against the weight of other contradictory evidence. [Citations.] . . . Where evidence is undisputed, but different inferences may be drawn therefrom, we are not at liberty to make our own inferences and decide the case accordingly; the conclusion of the trial court must be accepted, since it is for the trier of fact to resolve such conflicting inferences in the absence of a rule of law specifying the inference to be drawn. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(CNA Casualty of California </em>v. <em>Seaboard Surety Co. </em>(1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 598, 615-616 [222 Cal.Rptr. 276].)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\n<em>Equitable Contribution Based on Policy Limits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">American States erroneously contends that the trial court erred by not prorating the policies based on the comparative fault of each insured. At trial, counsel for American States conceded that there was no controlling California authority and \u201c[a]t some point the Court has to make an allocation\u2014what it believes is a fair allocation among the defendants.\u201d Counsel argued that \u201cthere are various ways you can stack the policies. There is no right or wrong answer . . . .\u201d Notwithstanding this concession, American States now claims that the trial court\u2019s allocation was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">The trial court found that American States and Truck were co-insurers because the umbrella policies insured against the same risk. We agree. Although each policy contained an \u201cother insurance\u201d clause, the clauses canceled one another out.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>(Olympic Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Employers\u2019 Surplus Lines Ins. Co. </em>(1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 593, 599 [178 Cal.Rptr. 908].)  \u201cWhen two \u2018excess-only\u2019 other insurance clauses collide, the courts will force both carriers to prorate, in derogation of the policy language. [Citations.] This rule is based, in large measure, on the fact that if both other-insurance clauses were given effect according to their terms, the insured would have no coverage.\u201d <em>(CSE Ins. Group </em>v. <em>Northbrook Property &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1839, 1842-1843 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 120].)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>\u201c[T]he application of \u2018other insurance\u2019 clauses requires, as a foundational element, that there exist multiple policies applicable to the <em>same loss.\u201d (Pines of La Jolla Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>Industrial Indemnity </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 714, 723 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 53].) Where, as here, two insurance companies insure the same risk and one company pays the loss (i.e., Truck), it may seek contribution from the other (i.e., American States). <em>(Pylon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Olympic Ins. Co. </em>(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 643, 648-649 [77 Cal.Rptr. 72].)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">American States contends that the doctrine of equitable contribution between co-insurers does not apply because the policies cover different \u201crisks\u201d and different insureds. The American States policy insured Alam but not Azam or Yelvington. American States asserts that it was not a co-insurer because Azam and Yelvington owed a nondelegable duty as landowners to provide Gebhardt a safe work place.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">We disagree with American States\u2019s analysis. It erroneously assumes that Alam had no potential liability on the cause of action for peculiar risk. The complaint alleged such liability against Alam, which is permitted by our Supreme Court. <em>(Privette </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 689, 701 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 72, 854 P.2d 721].) American States further assumes that every personal injury involving scaffolding is a peculiar risk case rendering the landowner 100 percent liable. We disagree.  Under American States\u2019s construction of the law, a landowner\u2019s insurer could never seek contribution from someone functioning as a general contractor who created the special risk. The law is not that black and white.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">In <em>Privette </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th 689, our Supreme Court held: \u201cEven when work performed by an independent contractor poses a special or peculiar risk of harm, however, the person who hired the contractor will not be liable for injury to others if the injury results from the contractor\u2019s \u2018collateral\u2019 or \u2018casual\u2019 negligence. [Citations.] An independent contractor\u2019s negligence is collateral, we have said, when the negligence involves an \u2018operative detail of the work, as distinguished from the general plan or method to be followed.\u2019 [Citation.] But, as we have also acknowledged, it is often difficult to distinguish those risks that are inherent in the work from those that are collateral, and the line to be drawn between the two types of risks is \u2018shadowy.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 696.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Here, the causes of action for negligence and peculiar risk overlapped. Gebhardt\u2019s complaint alleged that the defendants, including Alam, \u201cwere, and are, the owners, employers, contractors, and/or developers of the project site at which plaintiff, Russell Gebhardt, was injured.\u201d Alam functioned as a general contractor and personally took charge of the general plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>and method of construction. Gebhardt claimed that Alam refused to provide metal scaffolding and ordered Gebhardt\u2019s employer to construct the scaffolding from wood. Alam supervised the work and visited the job site twice a day. Attorney Howard Cho, who defended Azam, Alam and Yelvington, opined that Alam had potential liability under the peculiar risk doctrine because he functioned as the general contractor.  As indicated, both the owner of land and a general contractor who hires an independent contractor may have liability pursuant to the peculiar risk doctrine. <em>(Privette </em>v. <em>Superior </em>Court, <em>supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 701.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The court found that \u201cAlam Sher, Azam Sher, and Cynthia Yelvington were all at risk of liability in the Gebhardt suit. Azam and Cynthia had greater exposure than Alam under the doctrine of peculiar risk before <em>Privette. </em>Alam had greater exposure than they based on active negligence. All had significant risk of exposure and there was no utility for settlement to allocate their individual contribution to the overall risk.\u201d The court made an implied finding that the liability of Alam on one hand, and Azam and Yelvington on the other hand, was approximately the same for settlement purposes. In the exercise of its equitable discretion, the trial court concluded that the umbrella policies should be equally prorated because the policy limits were the same. This was not an abuse of discretion. (E.g., <em>Employers Reinsurance Corp. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins. Co. </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 545, 553 [230 Cal.Rptr. 792] [liability prorated among three successive carriers according to applicable policy limits].)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">American States contends that it would be more equitable to allocate the settlement based on the number of insureds in each policy. Such an analysis would mean that American States would contribute $325,000 (one-third of $975,000) rather than $487,500. The trial court found that \u201c[c]ounting insureds is an unsatisfactory way to allocate payment in this case.\u201d We agree. Assuming Azam and Yelvington had an additional partner in the project, American States would argue that it need only pay 25 percent of the $975,000. Given the nature of the underlying claim, allocation based on the number of insureds makes little, if any, sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Under California law, the reciprocal rights of co-insurers are based on principles of equity. <em>(Amer. Auto Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Seaboard Surety Co. </em>(1957) 155 Cal.App.2d 192, 195-196 [318 P.2d 84].) California courts have declined to formulate a definitive rule for equitable contribution. (See <em>CNA </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Casualty of California v. <em>Seaboard Surety Co., supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d 598, 619.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u201cWe expressly decline to formulate a definitive rule applicable in every case in light of varying equitable considerations which may arise, and which affect the insured and the primary and excess carriers, and which depend upon the particular policies of insurance, the nature of the claim made, and the relation of the insured to the insurers. [Citation.] Moreover, we affirm the wisdom expressed in <em>Amer. Auto Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Seaboard Surety Co. </em>(1957) 155 Cal.App.2d 192, 195-196 [318 P.2d 84]: \u2018The reciprocal rights and duties of several insurers who have covered the same event do not arise out of contract, for their agreements are not with each other. . . . Their respective obligations flow from equitable principles designed to accomplish ultimate justice in the bearing of a specific burden. As these principles do not stem from agreement between the insurers their application is not controlled by the language of their contracts with the respective policy holders.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Signal Companies Inc. </em>v. <em>Harbor Ins. Co. </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 359, 369 [165 Cal.Rptr. 799, 612 P.2d 889, 19 A.L.R.4th 975].)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">American States\u2019 reliance upon <em>PepsiCo, Inc. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1986) 640 F.Supp. 656 is misplaced. There, a corporation brought suit against an insurer to recover money paid on behalf of its officers and directors to settle a securities fraud action. The policy required that PepsiCo allocate the settlement costs attributable to the directors and officers. The court held that contribution should be based on the liabilities of the respective parties but acknowledged that \u201c[t]hese allocations are often made, albeit only as approximations, according to some notion of relative fault.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 662.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Here the trial court ordered American States and Truck to share the excess settlement costs because the policy limits were the same. There was no policy requirement of allocation of settlement costs as was the case in <em>PepsiCo, Inc. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., supra, </em>640 F.Supp. 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">American States\u2019 reliance upon <em>Slottow </em>v. <em>American Cas. Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1993) 10 F.3d 1355, is also misplaced. There a bank\u2019s board of directors approved a settlement with disgruntled investors for $4,750,000. It allocated 96 percent of the fault to Ralph Slottow, president of the bank\u2019s subsidiary, and 0 percent to the bank. The bank then sought reimbursement from American Casualty Company, the directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 Liability (D and O) carrier for the bank. The allocation of fault was not the product of adverse negotiation between the bank and Slottow. The Ninth Circuit viewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>the allocation with \u201cconsiderable suspicion\u201d <em>(id.., </em>at p. 1359) because it was structured \u201cfor strategic reasons\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 1359) to create 96 percent indemnification from the D and O carrier. That was not a \u201cgood faith\u201d allocation of fault. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1360.) By contrast, here there was no underlying allocation. As we shall soon explain, there is no California rule requiring allocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">American States has cited no California authority holding that equitable contribution requires a specific finding of each insured\u2019s comparative fault. Such a rule would hamper settlements and require the defendant to prove its own fault before the defendant\u2019s insurer could seek equitable contribution. (E.g., <em>Mullin Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Chandler </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 1127,1132 [230 Cal.Rptr. 122] [cross-complaint by lumber company against general contractor for equitable indemnity where carpenter fell from collapsed scaffolding built from lumber purchased for construction of house].)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">\u201cA claim such as the instant case for contribution among insurers providing overlapping coverage for the same insured rests on equitable principles. [Citation.] However, in cases involving multiple policies covering the same loss, the courts have allocated the burden of paying among several insurers without reference to questions of the comparative fault or negligence of such insurers, because their obligation to protect the insured arises from a contract, <em>not </em>because the insurers were negligent or at fault. [Citation.] Thus, in cases involving duplicate or overlapping insurers the courts have prorated the responsibility by focusing on contractual issues rather than on \u2018fault\u2019 concepts [citations], and have ordered proration based on the proportion each insurer\u2019s coverage bore to the total coverage provided by all policies [citations].\u201d <em>(Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 435, 440 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 520].)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">\n<em>Trial Within a Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">American States asserts that it is entitled to a factual finding of Alam\u2019s comparative fault, and absent such a determination, there is no legal basis to support the judgment. The trial court served the parties with a tentative decision stating that \u201ca trial within a trial to establish comparative fault and liability, if any, is . . . unsatisfactory . . . .\u201d If American States wanted special findings concerning each insured\u2019s comparative fault, it should have requested findings or moved for new trial. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 632, 662.) It failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">American States also asserts that Truck presented no evidence that Alam was liable on a negligence theory. The record is to the contrary. Alam <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>functioned as general contractor, supervised the project, hired the subcontractors, and ordered Gebhardt\u2019s employer to construct the scaffolding. Substantial evidence supported the trial court\u2019s finding that Alam, because of his active negligence, had exposure equal to that of Azam and Yelvington.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\n<em>Site-specific Coverage</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">American States finally argues that the Truck policy provided site-specific insurance and was therefore primary to the American States policy. The trial court rejected the argument and found that \u201c[njeither umbrella policy is \u2018specific insurance for a specific risk\u2019 different from the other such that it would be rendered primary to the other umbrella policy.\u201d No error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Truck\u2019s underwriting and claims experts testified that the insurance industry did not consider personal umbrella policies \u201csite specific.\u201d The Truck policy provided worldwide coverage. Substantial evidence was presented that the insuring clauses were not affected by the policy declaration page or the policy application listing the construction site address.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">American States\u2019 remaining arguments have been considered and are without merit. We agree that an insurer may not settle a case and foist the settlement costs on another insurer who insured different risks. The assertion that American States was \u201cvictimized\u201d by Truck\u2019s and Fire\u2019s failure to allocate the settlement costs has no factual basis. American States and Truck insured the same risk and should share in the excess settlement cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">\u201cCalifornia follows the general rule that an insurer that discharges a common obligation of another insurer may seek contribution from the second insurer. [Citations.] The insurers\u2019 \u2018respective obligations flow from equitable principles designed to accomplish ultimate justice in the bearing of a specific burden.\u2019 [Citation.] No specific rule governs this area of the law. Courts should consider the nature of the claim, the relation of the insured to the insurers, the particulars of each policy and any other equitable considerations. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Northern Ins. Co. of New York </em>v. <em>Allied Mut. Ins. </em>(9th Cir. 1992) 955 F.2d 1353, 1360.)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">Substantial evidence supports the finding that American States and Truck should share the excess settlement costs. The umbrella policies cover the same risk and have the same policy limits. \u201cWhere two insurers cover the same risk, the costs of settlement should be shared between them pro rata in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>proportion to their respective coverage of the risk; otherwise, one will profit at the expense of another. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Golden Eagle Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Foremost Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1372, 1390 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 242].)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The judgment is affirmed.
