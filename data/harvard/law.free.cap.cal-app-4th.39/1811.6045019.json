(\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1).) The trial judge found Flores had two prior felony convictions, within section 667, subdivision (a). One of the convictions was for section 455, attempt to bum. (People v. Flores (Super. Ct. Santa Barbara County, 1989, No. 176641).) [[]]*</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">[[]]*</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-13\">Flores contends the five-year enhancement for his attempted arson conviction in People v. Flores, <em>supra, </em>No. 176641, is improper because attempted arson under section 455 is not a \u201cserious felony\u201d under section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(14) and (27). Flores argues that only an attempted arson conviction under sections 664 (general attempt statute) and 451 may enhance punishment of a recidivist offender under section 667, subdivision (a). He adds that section 455 defines \u201cattempt\u201d behavior more broadly than the general attempt statute (\u00a7 664) because section 455 includes acts \u201cpreliminary thereto, or in furtherance thereof\u2019 attempts to bum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-14\">In February 1994, the time of Flores\u2019s present criminal offense, section 667, subdivision (a) provided: \u201c[A]ny person convicted of a serious felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1814\">*1814</page-number>who previously has been convicted of a serious felony in this state . . . shall receive, in addition to the sentence imposed by the court for the present offense, a five-year enhancement for each such prior conviction . , . \u201cSerious felony\u201d means a serious felony listed in section 1192.7. (\u00a7667, subd. (d).) Section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(14) includes \u201carson\u201d and subdivision (27) includes \u201cany attempt to commit a crime listed in this subdivision</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">The 1989 felony information in People v. Flores, <em>supra, </em>No. 176641, charged Flores with \u201cattempt to set fire and attempt to bum a structure\u201d as well as committing \u201can act preliminary thereto and in furtherance thereof\u2019 in violation of section 455. Flores pleaded guilty to attempted arson and stated, in writing, this factual basis for his plea: \u201cI admit that there are facts from which a jury could find me guilty of attempted arson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Alberts </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1424 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 401], we held that section 455 was a special statute concerning attempted arson which prevailed over section 664, the general attempt statute. (32 Cal.App.4th at p. 1428.) We reasoned that section 664 expressly applied only \u201c \u2018where no provision is made by law for the punishment of such attempts . . . .\u2019\u201d (32 Cal.App.4th at p. 1427.) Section 455 punishes \u201cattempts to set fire to or attempts to bum.\u201d Also, section 455 prohibits specific conduct while section 664 prohibits general conduct. (32 Cal.App.4th at p. 1428.) \u201cThus, the general statutes (\u00a7\u00a7 664, 451, subd. (b)) are included in the special statute (\u00a7 455). Since these sections cannot be reconciled, section 455 must prevail. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">Section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(27) includes as a \u201cserious felony\u201d \u201cany attempt to commit a crime listed in this subdivision.\u201d Subdivision (c)(14) lists arson as a serious felony. Under <em>Alberts, </em>attempted arson must be charged under section 455, the specific statute that prohibits attempted arson and acts preliminary to and in furtherance of the arson. (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Lavine </em>(1931) 115 Cal.App. 289, 296 [1 P.2d 496] [attempted extortion is punishable by specific attempted extortion statute, not general attempt statute].) Thus, by the plain language of section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(14) and (27), Flores\u2019s sentence in the present case was properly enhanced by a five-year term under section 667, subdivision (a), for his 1989 attempted arson conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1815\">*1815</page-number>[[II.]]<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Stone (S.
