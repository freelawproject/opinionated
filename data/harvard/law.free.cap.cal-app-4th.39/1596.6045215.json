(KAL) to enforce a compromise of the minors\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1600\">*1600</page-number>claims against KAL and approving the settlement. In 1983, Rebecca Scruton, the sole parent of the minors, was a passenger on KAL flight 007 and died when the plane was shot down by Soviet fighter jets. As the minors\u2019 guardian ad litem and administrator of the decedent\u2019s estate, Van Ryn brought this action for wrongful death and personal injury against KAL and others. The parties agreed to settle the minors\u2019 claims for a total of $500,000. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 372,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Van Ryn filed petitions for approval of the compromise. However, before the hearing on her petitions, new information was revealed which Van Ryn felt affected the settlement. Van Ryn withdrew the petitions, causing KAL to file a motion to enforce the settlement agreement. The trial court granted KAL\u2019s motion and approved the compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">In her appeal, Van Ryn contends under the California statutory scheme for settlements of minors\u2019 claims, the guardian ad litem may repudiate compromises at any time before trial court approval. Van Ryn also contends, once she repudiated the tentative settlement, neither the trial court nor KAL had the power to enforce it. We hold, pursuant to section 372, a guardian ad litem may repudiate a tentative compromise of a minor\u2019s claim before trial court endorsement. Once repudiated, the trial court may only unilaterally enforce the compromise after finding the guardian acted contrary to the minor\u2019s best interests.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the trial court failed to make such a finding, the judgment with respect to settlement of the minors\u2019 claims is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">[[]]<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">On September 1, 1983, KAL flight 007 was shot down over the Sea of Japan by a Soviet SU-15 interceptor aircraft.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> All 269 people on board were killed, including Rebecca Scruton. The flight was bound for Seoul, South Korea, from New York with a stopover in Anchorage, Alaska. At the time of the crash, the flight was more than 300 nautical miles off course and illegally in Soviet airspace.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1601\">*1601</page-number>On July 23, 1984, Van Ryn filed the instant personal injury and wrongful death action against KAL and Litton Systems, Inc.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> doing so in her capacity as administrator of the estate of Rebecca Scruton and guardian ad litem of the minor children of the deceased, Todd B. and Alicia Mae Scruton (at the time, ages 6 and 2, respectively). Meanwhile, the many actions filed against KAL around the country were consolidated and tried in the federal District Court for the District of Columbia. <em>(In re Korean Air Lines Disaster of September 1, 1983 </em>(S.D.N.Y 1992) 807 F.Supp. 1073, 1079.) On May 3, 1985, at the behest of KAL, this action was stayed pending termination of the consolidated federal actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">At trial in the federal consolidated actions, the plaintiffs proceeded on the theory the crew of flight 007 was aware, either before leaving Anchorage or shortly thereafter, a programming error existed in the plane\u2019s inertial navigation system. Rather than to turn back and face discipline, the crew decided to cover up the problem by fabricating the plane\u2019s location reports to the air traffic controllers. The jury found KAL guilty of willful misconduct and awarded damages to the 137 plaintiffs. <em>(In re Korean Air Lines Disaster of September 1983, supra, </em>932 F.2d at pp. 1476-1477, 1481 (hereinafter <em>In re KAL).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">In May 1991, the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the jury\u2019s liability verdict, but vacated the award of punitive damages. <em>(In re KAL, supra, 932 </em>F.2d at p. 1490.) On August 4, 1992, after all the appeals became final, the court herein lifted its stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">On March 18, 1993, Van Ryn filed petitions for compromise of the minors\u2019 disputed claims pursuant to section 372, indicating KAL had offered to pay the minors $250,000 each for the loss of support and of care, comfort, society and guidance of their mother. Two weeks later, Van Ryn informed KAL she was <em>withdrawing her consent to settle. </em>Van Ryn\u2019s attorney explained, as the result of a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs ($400,000 for predeath pain and suffering and $320,000 for loss of society) rendered in a flight 007 action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, and the many jury verdicts throughout the country which exceed the proposed $250,000 settlement here, coupled with the potentially huge prejudgment interest accumulated here, she could no longer represent to the court that the settlement was fair and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">KAL proceeded to file a motion in the trial court to enforce the settlement agreement. Acknowledging \u201c. . . the policies and principles that apply when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1602\">*1602</page-number>litigation involves adult parties differ somewhat from those instituted when a minor is involved,\u201d and \u201c[e]ven though the approval of the court in which the case is pending is essential to a valid compromise made on behalf of a minor, . . KAL claimed the agreement was binding and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">At the hearing on KAL\u2019s motion for enforcement, the court concluded it had a responsibility to determine whether the settlement was fair to protect the minors, but that the guardian ad litem cannot reject the agreement at any time before the court rules on the petition, if the compromise is \u201cin the best interest of the minor.\u201d On September 16, 1993, the trial court entered an order reflecting this ruling. As to the petitions for approval, the court found Van Ryn\u2019s attorney had justified the validity of the settlement and that it was reasonable and in the minors\u2019 best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">[[]]<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">Van Ryn [[]]* timely appeals.* <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">Van Ryn contends (1) under section 372, KAL lacked standing and the trial court lacked power to enforce the compromise, and (2) the trial court erred in finding the settlement was fair and adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">[[]]*</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">As previously noted, liability is not at issue in this action, KAL\u2019s guilt having been established in the consolidated federal cases. <em>(In re KAL, supra, </em>932 F.2d at pp. 1476-1477.)  The issues in Van Ryn\u2019s appeal are discrete, namely whether under California law a guardian ad litem may repudiate a tentative settlement before trial court approval and whether a trial court may unilaterally enforce a repudiated settlement. Van Ryn contends, under section 372, the settlement is not final until the court approves it. KAL contends the \u201cissue is whether a valid and enforceable agreement reached by two parties can be set aside for no justified reason.\u201d We hold, under section 372, a settlement of the claims of a minor by a guardian ad litem is not final or binding until the agreement is approved by the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1603\">*1603</page-number>in which the claims were brought. Faced with a compromise which the guardian has repudiated in advance of such endorsement, a trial court has limited authority to enforce the settlement unilaterally, and may do so only after finding the guardian ad litem acted counter to the minor\u2019s best interests by rejecting the proposed compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">1. <em>Choice of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">Preliminarily, the parties dispute whether this action was brought under the Warsaw Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Transportation by Air (49 Stat. 3000, T.S. 876) and the supplemental Montreal Agreement, Agreement Relating to Liability Limitations of the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Together reprinted at 49 U.S.C.A., note following former \u00a7 1502.)</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">As a general rule, where an action founded on a federal statute is brought in a state court, the law of the state controls in matters of practice and procedure unless the federal statute provides otherwise. <em>(Bach </em>v. <em>County of Butte </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 554, 561-562 [195 Cal.Rptr. 268] [an action in state court under federal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 et seq.].) Subdivision (2) of article 28 of chapter III of the Warsaw Convention specifies, \u201cQuestions of procedure shall be governed by the law of the court to which the case is submitted.\u201d (49 U.S.C.A., note following former \u00a7 1502.) Also, construction and enforcement of settlement agreements are generally governed by local law. <em>(Jeff D. </em>v. <em>Andrus </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 899 F.2d 753, 759.) Hence, even if this action had been brought under the treaties, there is no question but that California procedural law applies to settlement of the lawsuit. Indeed, KAL even concedes, citing section 372, \u201ca settlement compromising a minor\u2019s claim must be judicially approved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">2. <em>Under section 372, the compromise of a minor\u2019s claim is not final or binding until it has been approved by the trial court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">Section 372 describes the powers of the guardian ad litem. It provides in relevant part, the \u201c. . . guardian ad litem so appearing for any minor, . . . shall have power, <em>with the approval of the court </em>in which the action or proceeding is pending, <em>to compromise the same, </em>to agree to the order or judgment to be entered therein . . . and to satisfy any judgment or order in favor of the ward or conservatee or release or discharge any claim of the ward or conservatee pursuant to such compromise. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1604\">*1604</page-number>Research has revealed no California cases which deal specifically with the power of a guardian ad litem to repudiate a settlement before trial court approval, or the power of the trial court to enforce a compromise of a minor\u2019s claim despite a guardian\u2019s repudiation. However, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Dacanay </em>v. <em>Mendoza </em>(9th Cir. 1978) 573 F.2d 1075 is squarely on point. While <em>Dacanay </em>involved application of Guam law, the Guam Code of Civil Procedure section 372 is patterned after and closely follows the language of California\u2019s section 372 (573 F.2d at p. 1078),* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and so it is persuasive authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">In <em>Dacanay, </em>the minor\u2019s guardian ad litem agreed to compromise claims the minor had brought against the defendants as the result of a collision between the minor\u2019s bicycle and the defendant\u2019s automobile. The guardian moved ex parte for approval of the settlement agreement. Thereafter, additional evidence came to light reinforcing the defendants\u2019 culpability and indicating the minor\u2019s injuries would be permanent. Convinced the agreement was ill advised, the guardian ad litem moved to restore the action to the federal district court calendar. On the eve of trial, the defendants moved the district court for approval of the compromise. The district court ruled the agreement could not be repudiated and granted the motion to approve the compromise on the ground it was in the minor\u2019s best interest. (573 F.2d fat p. 1077.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district court\u2019s approval and, relying in part on California authority, interpreted Guam Code of Civil Procedure section 372 to hold \u201ca guardian ad litem may repudiate a settlement agreement prior to court approval.\u201d <em>(Dacanay </em>v. <em>Mendoza, supra, </em>573 F.2d at p. 1078.) The <em>Dacanay </em>court noted, while repudiation is not permitted by settling <em>adults, </em>section 372, which applies to the specific case of a compromise by a guardian ad litem of the claims of a minor, does permit repudiation of a settlement negotiated by the guardian for a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1605\">*1605</page-number>The <em>Dacanay </em>court\u2019s interpretation of section 372 was compelled by the historical role the guardian plays as an officer of the court, coupled with the principle that minors lack contractual capacity. As early as the courts of chancery, a guardian ad litem lacked the power to bind a minor litigant to a settlement agreement <em>absent </em>an independent investigation by the court. \u201c[E]very step in the proceeding [of a minor\u2019s lawsuit] occurs under the aegis of the court.\u201d <em>(Dacanay </em>v. <em>Mendoza, supra, </em>573 F.2d at p. 1079.) Accordingly, the guardian may negotiate a proposed compromise, but the agreement must be referred to the court because the duties of the guardian ad litem are \u201cessentially ministerial.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, \u201c[i]t is the court\u2019s order approving the settlement that vests the guardian ad litem with the legal power to enforce the agreement. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Additionally, just as a minor lacks capacity to enter into a contract, the guardian ad litem lacks contractual capacity to settle litigation without endorsement of the court. As with any other contract where one party lacks capacity, or a necessary contractual formality has been ignored, the contract is voidable until the defect is remedied. <em>(Dacanay </em>v. <em>Mendoza, supra, </em>573 F.2d at p. 1080.)</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">Hence, as the <em>Dacanay </em>court inevitably concluded, \u201c. . . since the enforceability of a contract in settlement of litigation involving a minor party depends upon the approval of a court, we hold that such a contract is voidable at the election of the minor through his guardian ad litem unless and until the court\u2019s imprimatur has been placed on it.\u201d (573 F.2d at p. 1080.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">We are persuaded by the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision and readily apply its holding.  The guardian ad litem serves merely as the representative of the minor and an officer of the court. <em>(In re Christina B. </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1453 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 918].) As an agent with limited powers, the guardian\u2019s purpose is to protect the rights of the minor <em>(ibid.)1, </em>but it is the duty of the court to see that such rights are protected. <em>(Berry </em>v. <em>Chaplin </em>(1946) 74 Cal.App.2d 652, 657 [169 P.2d 442].) A guardian has no authority to enter into an agreement compromising the claims of his charge without the sanction of the court that appointed the guardian. <em>(Ibid; Leonard </em>v. <em>Rose </em>(1967) 65 Cal.2d 589, 594 [55 Cal.Rptr. 916, 422 P.2d 604]; <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Everett </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 65, 69 [129 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1606\">*1606</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 8].) The court\u2019s order approving the compromise confers on the guardian ad litem the legal power to enforce that agreement. <em>(Dacanay </em>v. <em>Mendoza, supra, </em>573 F.2d at p. 1079.) This is so because the court effectively exercises \u201csupervision over the rights of the minor or the acts of the guardian ad litem.\u201d <em>(Berry </em>v. <em>Chaplain, supra, </em>at p. 658.) Therefore, without trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward\u2019s claim, the settlement cannot be valid. <em>(Anderson </em>v. <em>Latimer </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 667, 676 [212 Cal.Rptr. 544].)</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Nor is the settlement binding until it is endorsed by the trial court. Subject to exceptions not applicable here, contracts are voidable by minors in California. (Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6710, 6701; 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed., 1994 pocket supp.) Contracts, \u00a7 356C, pp. 71-72.) Therefore, a proposed compromise is always voidable at the election of the minor through his guardian ad litem unless and until \u201cthe court\u2019s imprimatur has been placed on it.\u201d <em>(Dacanay </em>v. <em>Mendoza, supra, </em>573 F.2d at p. 1080.)  We hold, as guardian ad litem, Van Ryn was permitted to reject the compromise and withdraw her petitions before trial court approval. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">In opposing Van Ryn\u2019s appeal, KAL relies on general principles of contract law in support of its \u201ccounterstatement of the case,\" that the issue here \u201cinvolves the enforceability of a settlement agreement reached in good faith by plaintiff-appellant . . . and defendant . . . which plaintiff subsequently sought to repudiate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">But for the fact this case concerns the claims of minors, there would be no doubt repudiation would be impossible and KAL could unilaterally enforce the settlement contract. <em>(Dacanay </em>v. <em>Mendoza, supra, </em>573 F.2d at p. 1078; \u00a7 664.6.) However, general precepts of the enforceability of contracts are inapplicable to cases concerning the compromise of the claims of <em>minors. </em>(Cf. <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Chaplin, supra, </em>74 Cal.App.2d at p. 657 [the relationship between guardian ad litem and minor is not the same as that between an attorney and an adult client].) The Legislature has spoken on that subject in the form of section 372 which specifies the power of the guardian to compromise claims on behalf of minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">3. <em>The trial court has only limited authority to enforce unilaterally a repudiated compromise.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">Van Ryn contends the trial court has no authority to enforce the compromise, only she does. KAL argues the trial court has the power to direct a settlement unilaterally, \u201cprovided that the court \u2018conducts its own inquiry to determine whether the settlement serves the best interests of the minor.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1607\">*1607</page-number>Section 372 does not provide authority for <em>KAL </em>to bring its \u201cmotion\u201d to enforce the compromise. That provision delineates the powers of the <em>guardian, </em>not those of parties opposing the minor. The rules of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County provide only for the guardian ad litem\u2019s petition for approval of the compromise of the ward\u2019s claims. (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Probate Policy Manual, rule 21:1.00 et seq.) There was no procedural authority for KAL\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Nor may KAL or the trial court enforce the settlement under section 664.6, concerning the court\u2019s entry of judgment on a stipulated settlement. It is a maxim of statutory construction that a specific provision will control over a general statute. (\u00a7 1859; <em>Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 392, 420 [128 Cal.Rptr. 183, 546 P.2d 687].) While section 664.6 generally deals with the court\u2019s power to enforce a settlement, section 372 is a special statute dealing with the power of guardians to compromise on behalf of minors. As such, the provisions of section 372 will control in litigation, as here, in which one of the parties is a minor. Additionally, at the time of the court\u2019s approval of the compromise here, section 664.6 provided, \u201cIf parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, ... the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.\u201d (\u00a7 664.6.) The record here does not contain a settlement agreement \u201csigned by the parties outside the presence of the court\u201d (\u00a7 664.6), and there was no oral stipulation before the court because Van Ryn\u2019s attorney rejected the agreement and withdrew the petitions. (\u00a7 664.6.) Hence, on the record before us, the requirements of section 664.6 were never satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">In addressing this issue, the <em>Dacanay </em>court distinguished between the standard of review when the trial court approves a settlement continuously consented to by both parties, as opposed to when the court is called upon to examine the guardian\u2019s repudiation of a settlement. <em>(Dacanay </em>v. <em>Mendoza, supra, </em>573 F.2d at p. 1080.) Only when the court <em>accepts </em>a settlement <em>endorsed by the guardian </em>does it conduct its own inquiry to determine whether the settlement serves the minor\u2019s best interests.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">By contrast, when the guardian <em>repudiates </em>the settlement, the <em>Dacanay </em>court explained, \u201c. . . the decision of the guardian deserves some deference. Consequently, ... the court has limited power to direct a settlement unilaterally, <em>but to do so, the court must first find that the guardian ad litem has acted arbitrarily and capriciously in the sense that his conduct is inimical to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1608\">*1608</page-number><em>the best interests of the court\u2019s ward.\u201d </em>(573 F.2d at p. 1080, italics added.) Consequently, the <em>Dacanay </em>court held, \u201c[a] court . . . may not summarily enforce a tentative settlement agreement when a minor is a party to the litigation. This is because the actual merits of the controversy remain of consequence as the court must base its approval upon the fact that the terms of the settlement are completely fair to the minor.\u201d <em>(Dacanay </em>v. <em>Mendoza, supra, </em>573 F.2d at p. 1078.)</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">We therefore reject KAL\u2019s analysis which vests more power in the court to enforce a settlement than in the guardian who has disavowed it simply because such agreement is seen to be in the best interests of the minor. Rather, we hold the trial court here could not unilaterally and summarily enforce the repudiated compromise without first determining whether, in rejecting the agreement, Van Ryn had acted contrary to the best interests of the minors.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">To summarize our holding, under section 372, Van Ryn had no power, without authorization of the trial court, to bind the minors to a compromise of their claims. The settlement originally negotiated was neither final nor binding until trial court approval. Hence, that compromise could be repudiated by Van Ryn at any time until such approval was rendered. Van Ryn did emphatically repudiate the compromise in advance of the hearing on her petitions.  No statutory authorization existed for KAL to move to enforce the compromise. Faced with a rejected compromise, the trial court was required to grant the guardian some deference and could unilaterally enforce the settlement only upon a finding Van Ryn\u2019s repudiation was adverse to the best interests of the minors. Because the trial court failed to make such a finding, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">As a result of our holding here, we need not reach Van Ryn\u2019s corollary argument the trial court erred in finding the settlement was fair and adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1609\">*1609</page-number>[[4. <em>The trial court properly denied the Beals leave to file their complaint in </em>intervention.]]<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">The judgment is reversed.

Section 372 of the Guam Code of Civil Procedure provided, \u201c. . . \u2018[t]he general guardian or guardian ad litem so appearing for any infant... in any suit shall have power to compromise the same and to agree to the judgment to be entered therein for or against his ward, <em>subject to the approval of the court </em>in which such suit is pending.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dacanay </em>v. <em>Mendoza, supra, </em>573 F.2d at p. 1078, original italics.) In California, the power of the guardian is <em>\u201cwith the approval of the court </em>in which such action or proceeding is pending.\u201d (Italics added.) In the context of this case, this is a wording difference without a distinction: in either case, the power of the guardian ad litem to compromise is <em>contingent </em>upon trial court approval.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b914-14\"> KAL\u2019s arguments to the contrary, <em>Dacanay </em>mirrors the facts presented here. In a futile attempt to distinguish <em>Dacanay, </em>KAL insists that the court here merely enforced a settlement agreement because it was in the best interests of the minor. However, that is exactly what the federal District Court for the District of Guam did in <em>Dacanay. (Dacanay </em>v. <em>Mendoza, supra, </em>573 F.2d at p. 1077.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b915-9\"> In fact, the <em>Dacanay </em>court noted, while it is always the prerogative of the legislature to grant the guardian ad litem with personal authority to bind the minor to a settlement, neither the Guam nor the <em>California </em>Legislature has done so. <em>(Dacanay </em>v. <em>Mendoza, supra, </em>573 F.2d at p. 1080, fn. 9.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b917-9\"> Hence, KAL quotes <em>Dacanay </em>out of context in pursuit of this contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b918-7\"> KAL\u2019s claim to the contrary, this appeal concerns the settlement pursuant to section 372 between KAL and Van Ryn solely in her capacity as guardian ad litem for the minors. The personal injury claim brought by Van Ryn as executor of the estate of Rebecca Scruton is not implicated in our holding here. In other words, we do not address the personal injury claim. We reviewed KAL\u2019s citations in support of their contention \u201cKAL agreed to settle all claims for damages as a result of the death of decedent Rebecca Scruton for $500,000.\u201d The references do not support this contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b919-8\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1596.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
