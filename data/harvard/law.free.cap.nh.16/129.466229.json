Plea the general issue, with a brief statement, alleging that on the 14th day of December 1841, upon a writ of attachment which the firm of which the defendant was a member sued out upon several promissory notes due them from one Streeter. Reuben Stephenson a deputy sheriff attached the property in question as that of said Streeter, and sold the same by agreement of parties, agreeably to the statute, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-9\">It appeared that the plaintiff as deputy sheriff had, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>October 80, 1841, upon a writ in favor of one Carpenter against Streeter, returnable November term 1841, attached the property in the barn occupied by Streeter, made return thereof on the writ, posted a written notice on the barn, and wrote a notice with red chalk thereon, but did not employ Streeter or any other person to take charge of the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-5\">Judgment was rendered in that suit at said November term, and execution issued within thirty days, upon which the plaintiff returned among other matters, that he went with ihe execution, for the purpose of levying it, to the barn where he left the property attached on mesne process, and there finding that Eeuben Stephenson a deputy-sheriff had previously sold the- same on mesne process by agreement of parties, he returned the execution in no part satisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-6\">It further appeared that the property was used by Streeter after the attachment by the plaintiff, as it had been before the attachment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-7\">The defendant introduced in evidence a writ of attachment sued out by his firm against Streeter December 14, 1841, returnable at May term, on which was a return by Stephenson, December 20, of an attachment of the property in question. He proved that by an agreement of parties the property was duly sold at public auction and its proceeds applied to the payment of the debt. The action was settled and not entered in court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-8\">\u00abThe plaintiff objected to the admission of the writ and return in'evidence, because no judgment was had thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-9\">There was no evidence'that any member of the defendant\u2019s firm had any knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s attachment before the sale, and Stephenson did not know of it when he made his attachment, but he was informed of it before the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-10\">The court instructed the jury, that if the suit of the defendant\u2019s firm was on a debt honestly due by Streeter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>if the attachment and sale were made <em>bond </em>fide, and were not intended to cover up the property of Streeter, and keep it from the reach of his creditors, their verdict should be for the defendant, otherwise for the plaintiff. A verdict was thereupon taken by consent for the defendant, subject to the opinion of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-5\"><em>Young </em>and <em>Benton, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6o\">The defendant must first prove a valid attachment by himself. Between third parties and to justify an act otherwise wrong, the process must be made matter of record, and the record produced. 2 Stark.

The course taken upon the defendant\u2019s writ was therefore unauthorized and released his attachment, leaving the plaintiff\u2019s good. 2 Stark. Ev. 281, 282 ; 2 Vt. 388 ; 8 N.

Whether the property were cumbersome or not, its custody should have been retained, or if the owner did not procure a receipter it should have been removed. 3 N. H. 210 ; 5 N.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEg\">The attachment of the plaintiff was lost because no possession was retained by him. It is the duty of the officer who makes an attachment to retain the possession of the property, if it is not receipted for. <em>Odiorne </em>v. <em>Colley, </em>2 N. H. 66; <em>Dunklee </em>v. <em>Fales, </em>5 N. H. 528; <em>Young </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>12 N. H. 506. The rule is the same in other States where attachments on mesne process are allowed. <em>Sanderson </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>16 Pick. 144 ; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Patten, </em>18 Me. 231. Cases may exist in which it is his duty to attempt to procure a receipter, or to secure the property in the place where it is found. <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>White, </em>3 N. H. 210. But if this can not be done, and a removal is necessary in order that he may retain possession, it is the duty of the officer to remove it, and the fact that the removal will be attended with some inconvenience, does not furnish an excuse for a neglect to retain the possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">In this case no receipter was procured. No person was placed in custody of it. There was not even an agreement of the debtor that it might remain in the barn without interference, if that with the posting of notices might have .been sufficient. The plaintiff ' retained no custody of the property in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">On this state of the facts the defendant might well attach the property. He had no notice ; and had he possessed merely knowledge that an attachment had been made, that will not avail to prevent a subsequent attachment, if no possession be retained. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>12 N. H. 502. It is but the common case of property attached, which goes back into the hands of the debtor by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>means of a settlement, or receipt, or some arrangement that dissolves the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The objection to the admission of the return upon the defendant\u2019s writ as evidence of the attachment upon that, \u201cbecause no judgment was ever had thereon,\u201d can not avail. The general principle is stated in <em>Brown </em>v. Davis, 9 N. H. 76. That the return of the sheriff of matters material to be returned upon a writ, is evidence, seems to be generally admitted. The question has been, whether it is conclusive, or only <em>prima fade, </em>evidence. As between the parties to the suit and those claiming under them as privies, and all others whose rights and liabilities are dependent upon the suit, the return is conclusive. But it is not conclusive as to third persons whose interests are not connected with the suit, but whose interests may be affected by the proceedings of the sheriff^ nor as to collateral facts or matters not necessary to be returned. It is sufficient for the purposes of this case if the return was only <em>prima fade </em>evidence. There was nothing to contradict it. And it is not necessary in order to its admission as evidence that the action should have proceeded to judgment and the return have thus become a matter of record. Writs are made returnable to the next term of the court. The officer is commanded to make return of his doings. When served it is proper that they should be returned even if the action is settled. It may be important to the security of the officer. Perhaps it is necessary that the return should become matter of record in order to give it the character of evidence. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>9 N. H. 79, 81. But it will be so, within our practice, if it be returned and placed upon the files of the court without any extended registry by the clerk as a recording officer. The objection in this case was, not that the writ had not been returned, but that the action had not been prosecuted to judgment. If the objection had been that the writ had not been returned, and such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>was the fact, 'the court might have permitted the writ to be filed on motion. This may be done, by leave, after the return day.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">There was evidence therefore of a lawful attachment by the defendant, and the agreement to sell and apply the proceeds to the payment of the debt was valid. Whether the statute provisions for that purpose were strictly pursued or not, is of no importance to the plaintiff. The attachment which he made having been dissolved, he has no ground of objection on account of what was done by the parties subsequent to the defendant\u2019s attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
