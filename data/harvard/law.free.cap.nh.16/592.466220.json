On the 28d day of January 1882, the plaintiff Eobert JBuntin and his son Eobert Buntin, Jr., were seized in fee-simple as tenants in common in equal shares, of the farm described in the bill, and in pursuance of an arrangement between the parties, Eobert Buntin, Jr., conveyed his undivided half to his father, who thereupon conveyed the whole in fee-simple to his son-in-law Joseph French, one of the defendants. French, in consideration, paid eight hundred dollars to Eobert Buntin, Jr., and discharged debts of his to the amount of about three liundi\u2019ed dollars more, and entered into an indenture with the plaintiffs, Eobert Buntin and wife, by which he leased to them for the life of the survivor, an undivided half of the farm; covenanted to support the lessees during life; and to do certain other things detailed in the indenture as an equivalent for his own use and occupation of the leased premises; which he also covenanted to farm in a prudent and husbandlike manner. \u201c And the above described property,\u201d meaning apparently the whole farm, \u201cthe said Joseph French doth by these presents pledge to said Bun-tin as security for the performance of each and all of the above conditions.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-5\">French thereupon took possession, and fulfilled all the conditions till the year 1838, when, he failed to furnish the stipulated maintenance for the plaintiff's, who soon afterward entered and took possession of the premises, and have ever since retained the same without disturbance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-6\">The Mechanics Bank, James Collins, Grin Foster, and James II.

This was, for any thing that appears or is alleged, made according to the intention of the parties. An estate in fee can not be con veyed by the word pledge.

For this, French paid eleven hundred dollars to Robert Buntin, Jr., or for his use and benefit, and conveyed to the plaintiffs for their lives one undivided half of the premises, and agreed to maintain the plaintiffs during their lives in a. manner described in the indenture, using for that purpose the undivided share of which they had a lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Now for the'purpose of disincumbering the case of certain questions that have been discussed, it may be conceded that upon these facts these plaintiffs would be entitled to the personal services of French and his family in furnishing the support provided for by the indenture, and that the duty could not be delegated by French to another party, either directly or by the agency of legal execution transferring his interest in the estate to a creditor or other purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">For the same purposes and limiting the concession to the precise exigency of the present case, it may also be conceded that as between the plaintiffs and French, and purchasers under the latter with full notice of the facts, an equitable lien for that part of the consideration which remained due upon the execution of the conveyance, resulted in favoi* of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>But here another fact intervenes. The plaintiffs, instead of relying upon such supposed equitable lien, have substituted another security, which by ihe admission of counsel'at the bar, and by the theory upon which all the parties have proceeded, if not abundantly adequate, is still a substantial and appreciable security. , By the indenture, the whole of the premises were pledged, or charged with the covenants which French had made for the support of the plaintiffs. Whether the words by which this charge is effected are or are not sufficient to convey a fee, it is not necessary for us to determine. But adopting the notion upon which the parties have in general acted, that the plaintiffs can entitle themselves under those words to an estate for life only, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the parties to the indenture deemed such to be a fair and adequate security, considering that French had paid the value of half the farm with his own money.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The taking of this security is totally inconsistent with the preservation of any such equitable lien as is contended for by the plaintiffs. Tt shows the business finished. The price was paid, so far as the nature of the transaction admitted it to be paid, and as to the remainder, which was to consist in the personal offices of French and his family, security was <em>taken; </em>and there is no shadow of reason to suppose that the parties ever intended that any further security should be taken or payment made, before the sale should be considered as consummated.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The plaintiffs have no case here that requires us to decide what estate they have in the land by force of the indenture or otherwise. It is strictly a legal question. Ttie plaintiffs claim an estate in fee-simple, and the defendants claiming a reversion, would limit them to an estate for their lives and the life of the survivor. They are in undisturbed possession, and are under no engagement to make a title; nor is the precise nature of their estate a question before the court in any point of view.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>There is no suggestion that the indenture did not truly contain the agreement that the parties to it intended to enter into, or that it was obtained through fraud, surprise, accident, or mistake, or that it ought for any other equitable cause to be reformed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The case furnishes no apparent ground for the equitable interposition of this court, and we are therefore of the opinion that the bill should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">\n<em>Bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
