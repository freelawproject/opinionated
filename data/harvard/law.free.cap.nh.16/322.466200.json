Rollins or his order in two years from the date thereof with interest, and by said Rollins negotiated to one Emerson, and by Emerson indorsed to the plaintiffs. The case was submitted to the determination of the court upon a statement of facts, from which it appeared that said Jeremiah M. Rollins filed a complaint in the name of the State, before said Emerson as a magistrate, on the 20th day of February 1840, charging the defendant Ricker with having committed the crime of adultery with his said Rollins\u2019 wife; that a warrant in due form of law was issued by Emerson upon said complaint, by virtue of which Ricker was arrested and carried before Emerson for examination; that before entering upon the examination a proposition was made to have the matter settled, which resulted in a settlement by the defendants^ signing notes to the amount of $200, of which this note is one; that Emerson was present and assisted in making the settlement, and knew for what the note was given j that in a few days afterward Emerson procured this note to be negotiated to him. on an agreement with Rollins, that if the note could be collected he, Emerson, should discharge a demand due him from Rollins, and pay certain small debts due to other persons from Rollins; but Emerson was not to account for any thing if the note could not be collected, and-he has neither discharged his own demand or paid out any thing in discharge of the others. Emerson negotiated the note to the plaintiffs on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>the 4th day of February 1842, without the knowledge of Rollins, with an agreement on the back of said note that he would be accountable to the indorsers \u201cwithout demand or notice; \u201d that the plain tiffs paid to him at the time the note was indorsed to them the sum of $50; and the plaintiffs had no notice at the time of the want of a good consideration for the note.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-5\">W.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AU_\">The note appears to have been. given along with others, not merely to settle the damages sustained by Rollins, which standing alone would have been a good consideration, but the settlement included also, as a part of the consideration, the discharge of the criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>prosecution which, had been commenced. This was altogether illegal. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Spooner, </em>9 N. H. 197; <em>Hinds </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>6 N. H. 225; <em>Plumer </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>5 N. H. 553. Rollins could not have sustained a suit upon the note. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Ricker </em>&amp; a., 14 N. H. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Emerson the first indorser had full knowledge of the transaction, and stood in no better situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">But the plaintiffs appear to have purchased this note, and to have paid for it the amount of the principal, without any notice of its invalidity. There is nothing to show that this was not done in the ordinary course of business. The discount of the interest is not to a sufficient amount to render the transaction suspicious. Nor does the fact that Emerson indorsed stipulating that he would be holden without demand or notice, indicate of itself' that the plaintiffs had notice, or should have made faxther inquiry. Its tendency is x\u2019ather to hold out on the part of the indorser strong evidence of confidence that the note would be promptly paid when it became due. The inference to be dexived from it is the very reverse of that which might possibly be dx\u2019awn from an indorsexnent \u201c without recourse,\u201d if that would be sufficient. The plaixxtiffs therefore appear to be <em>bond fide </em>indorsees for value before due, and are entitled .to judgment. <em>*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiffs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
