It appeared that the spirit was sold at the respondent\u2019s bar, by one Fales. There was evidence tending to show that Fales had hired the bar by the day, and made the sale wholly on his own account and for his own benefit. There was also evidence tending to show that the respondent was a partner with him in the business of selling liquor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b131-6\">The court instructed the jury that if Fales sold the spirit, solely upon his own account and for his own benefit, the indictment could not be maintained; but that if it was understood between Fales and the respondent that spirit should be sold at the bar, and the spirit in question was sold in pursuance of such understanding, and the respondent was interested in the sale, Fales was the agent of the partnership, and the defendant was liable for the act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b131-7\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty.

That the liquor in question was sold in pursuance of that understanding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-14\">These are all questions of fact, and it is difficult to perceive any conclusion of law involved in the instructions.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b132-15\">Woods, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1y\">Instructions to the jury refer to the evidence before them, and are to be interpreted by it. Here, there was evidence of a partnership. But, as if that alone were insufficient to implicate the respondent in the acts of his partner, Fales, the jury were told that if the spirits were sold in pursuance of an understanding, which means an agreement, between the two, that they should be so sold, and the sale was not upon the account and for the benefit of Fales only, but the respondent also had an interest in the sale, then Fales was an agent and an instrument of the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>spondent, in the perpetration of the illegal act, so as to involve him perfectly in the guilt of it. The case is not one of assent to an unlawful act, but of procurement; and upon the instructions of the court, the jury must have found that the defendant procured and instigated the witness to perform the overt act, contrived by the two, against the law, and in the fruits of which both participated. It is difficult to see how the defendant can found an exception to such instructions. We discover no ground upon which it can avail him.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
