And in order to bar the same by deed, the wife must join with the husband in the deed, and there must be apt words of grant, showing an intention on her part to relinquish her dower. 4 Kent, 59; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Arven, </em>25 Maine Rep. 98; <em>Catlin </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>9 Mass. Rep. 218; <em>Lufkin </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>13 Mass.

The principle which g\u00f3verns this case seems conclusively settled in <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Sleeper, </em>2 N. H. Rep. 525; <em>Contra, </em>9 Mass. Rep. 223; 13 Pick. 382.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-7\">2. A widow may convey her right of dower by separate deed. <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>2 N. H. Rep. 507. See, also, 2 N. H. Rep. 405; 4 N. H. Rep. 423; Laws of 1815, page 193. And the form of such conveyance so it be under seal, and evince an assent to the conveyance of a complete title, seems not material. The common form is a mere release. See, also, <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>2 N. H. Rep. 507. The plaintiff is estopped to claim against this deed, containing a warranty against this very right, executed in her presence. 12 N. H. Rep. 133; 13 N. H.
