The questions in it arise upon the amended declaration upon which the trial took place. In that declaration the plaintiff complains that defendant sold him a horse, and by false warranty obtained from him a promissory note for the sum of one hundred and fifty dollars; that plaintiff, on discovery of the fraud, rescinded the sale and tendered back the horse and demanded back the note; that defendant refused to surrender the note, to plaintiff\u2019s damage the amount thereof, wherefore he brings suit. The defendant claims that this is a declaration in tort; and if it is, the justice had no jurisdiction of the case under it. I do not think this is the case. The declaration is in assumpsit to recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>back the value of that which defendant has obtained without consideration, by means of a fraud. This was the view taken by the circuit judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">I do not think any of the errors relied upon are well assigned, but the others seem to me to require no special attention.</p>\n<judges id=\"b232-5\">The judgment should be affirmed.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
