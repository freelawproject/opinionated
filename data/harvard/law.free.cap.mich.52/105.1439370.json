The record showed that as agent for his mother who owned a building which formerly belonged to the Taylors, but which they had lost on foreclosure, he caused Mrs. Taylor to be removed from it by some employees of his. The Taylors had already been thrice ejected by writ of assistance, but had again entered clandestinely with a little furniture and had refused to leave on being ordered to do so by Adams. He allowed Mrs. Taylor to remain all night and in the morning he again ordered her to leave, and on her refusal to do so one of Adams\u2019 employees broke in the door of her room. As she was in an apparently unconscious condition, Adams directed his assistants to carry her out and take her to a neighboring hotel which they did. She claimed to be injured in the transit and complained of Adams who was convicted in the Police Court of Grand Rapids and afterwards, on appeal, in the Circuit Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b123-11\">Attorney General <em>Jacob J.
