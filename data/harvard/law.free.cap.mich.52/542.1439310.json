The probate \u2022court granted the relief prayed, which was on appeal to the circuit court rescinded, and the case is brought here for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">In the probate court the action proceeded on the ground that the income of the fund was designed to be expended, \u2022and not to\u2018be accumulated. The will, which divided testator\u2019s estate into five equal shares, gave four of these shares to a surviving sister and to the heirs of a deceased sister and of two deceased brothers. These four poi tions were \u2022disposed of absolutely and unconditionally. The fifth share he dealt with as follows : To his nephew Albert H. Knorr, father of petitioners, he gave the amount of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>promissory note held by the testator, for $150. The rest of the fifth portion he gave to Knorr\u2019s children or the survivors of them, to be placed at interest by the executor and divided equally between them when' they should severally become of age, and in case any of them died under age leaving children, -then to such children the share of their parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">We are inclined to think this was designed to have the fund accumulated for distribution at the times specified. If so, the probate court does not appear to have any power to interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">But inasmuch as these bequests are not contingent except as to time of payment, and as the chances of all the children are equal, the power has been recognized in the court of chancery, in its administration of trusts, to provide for making necessary advances out of the income when the infants are otherwise likely to suffer, even where by the terms, of the trust itself an accumulation is contemplated. The doctrine is fully discussed and cases cited in Perry on Trusts, sections 615-617 and notes. Our statutes have expressly provided for the application of this same doctrine to trusts in land. Comp. L., \u00a7 4106. [How. St. \u00a7\u00a7 5555]. We see no reason why, on a proper original application to the circuit judge sitting in equity, on a petition with sufficient showing, he may not, if in his opinion the exigency warrants it, give such relief as will be proper, under such safeguards and conditions as will secure its honest use.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">We have made this suggestion because the matter seems to have been brought up with a willingness on the part of the executor to act fairly and liberally, so far as his own safety will allow. But there is no way in which such aid can be granted on this record. This was an application originally to the probate court, and not to a court of chancery. The circuit court refused to affirm the order giving the relief, and we are asked to review such refusal on writ of error, which is not a proper form of writ to bring up such questions as present no issues of a common-law nature. See <em>Brinsmade's Appeal, </em>decided at this term, ante, p. 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>The whole proceeding has been misunderstood. The parties must apply, if they desire relief, to the circuit court. We can make no suggestions in advance as to the propriety of granting or refusing aid, which must depend on such showing as will satisfy the circuit judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">The present writ must be dismissed without costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b563-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
