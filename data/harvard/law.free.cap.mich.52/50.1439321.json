This fact appeared from the notice to remove them, served by the commissioner of highways upon the defendant. The latter offered to prove that he owned the land in fee; that the fences were portions of the enclosures of his fields, and that no highway had been laid out. He admitted however that he had not notified the commissioner that he should deny the existence of the highway, and his offer of proof was therefore excluded and judgment rendered for plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-14\"><em>Ohamvplm &amp; More </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aoae\">A justice of the. peace cannot try actions involving land titles, and plea of title is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>a defense: <em>Little v.

The former term has been applied to impediments to travel and passage placed in the open street, and tending to make its use difficult or dangerous; while the latter has embraced the actual enclosure of a portion of the street by fences or walks, or occupation by buildings. The mode of dealing with the two offences has almost always been different, and the penalties also.\u201d <em>City of Grand Rapids v. Hughes </em>15 Mich. 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The penalty under the statute invoked in aid of the plaintiff\u2019s cause for obsti\u2019ucting the highway is twenty-five dollars for each offense, while that for encroachment is fifty cents per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>\"We are all satisfied with the exposition of the law as given by Mr. Justice Cooley in the case cited, and the judgment must be reversed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b70-4\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
