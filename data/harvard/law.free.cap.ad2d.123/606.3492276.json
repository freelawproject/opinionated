No such reasonable excuse was offered at bar, where the additional evidence consisted for the most part of public records and information within the knowledge of the movants at the time of the original motion <em>(see, Lo Breglio v Marks, </em>105 AD2d 621, <em>affd </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>65 NY2d 620; <em>Silinsky v State-Wide Ins.
