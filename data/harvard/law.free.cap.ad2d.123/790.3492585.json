The victim\u2019s testimony regarding the commission of this crime was more than sufficient to support the verdict and we find no basis to disturb the jury\u2019s findings with respect to her credibility.</p><p id=\"b825-6\">The defendant\u2019s remaining contentions have not been preserved for this court\u2019s review and we decline to reach them in the interest of justice. Mangano, J. P., Brown, Rubin and Spatt, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
