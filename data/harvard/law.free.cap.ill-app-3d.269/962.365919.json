The arresting officer asked defendant to undergo a breath test, and when he refused, a statutory summary suspension of his driver\u2019s license resulted (625 ILCS 5/11 \u2014 501.1 (West 1992)).</p> <p id=\"b983-12\" pgmap=\"983(22) 984(12)\">In April 1994, defendant filed a petition to rescind the statutory summary suspension. After a hearing in May 1994, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s petition, ruling that the arresting officer improperly stopped defendant\u2019s vehicle.</p> <p id=\"b984-3\" pgmap=\"984\">The State appeals, and we reverse.</p> <p id=\"b984-4\" pgmap=\"984\">I. BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b984-5\" pgmap=\"984\">A summary of the evidence presented at the hearing on defendant\u2019s petition to rescind statutory summary suspension is as follows. In the late evening hours, defendant left a tavern in Urbana, went to his car in the tavern\u2019s parking lot, and drove north on Cunningham Avenue. Urbana police officer Andrew Charles watched defendant do so from a vantage point in a parking lot across the street from the tavern. He was part of a DUI patrol in that area because of numerous DUI arrests of people who had been drinking at that tavern. Charles decided to follow defendant\u2019s vehicle to see if he would drive in compliance with the Illinois Vehicle Code (Code) (625 ILCS 5/1\u2014 100 et seq. (West 1992)). Charles followed defendant\u2019s vehicle for about 12 blocks down Cunningham Avenue, a four-lane road with a fifth lane in the center for turning. At that hour of the night, traffic was light.</p> <p id=\"b984-6\" pgmap=\"984\">As Charles followed defendant\u2019s vehicle in the left-hand lane, he noticed the driver\u2019s side wheels of defendant\u2019s car cross into the center turn lane by six inches or more. A few moments later, Charles observed the right-side wheels of defendant\u2019s vehicle cross into the right-hand lane, and again the tires went six inches beyond the lane line. Defendant did not signal any lane changes either time, nor did there appear to be any reason, such as traffic or potholes, for why he did not drive entirely within the bounds of the left-hand northbound lane.</p> <p id=\"b984-7\" pgmap=\"984\">Charles viewed defendant\u2019s driving as a violation of the Code and pulled him over accordingly. Charles testified that when he stopped defendant\u2019s car, he intended to give defendant a verbal warning instead of a ticket regarding his driving across the lane lines. He also intended to determine whether defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol. Once Charles approached defendant\u2019s vehicle, he smelled a strong odor of alcohol on defendant\u2019s breath and noticed that his speech was slurred. Defendant admitted to Charles that he had been drinking. He also had difficulty getting his driver\u2019s license out of his wallet. Charles asked defendant to perform a field-sobriety test, and defendant complied and failed. Charles then arrested him for DUI.</p> <p id=\"b984-8\" pgmap=\"984\">We commend the trial court for explaining its findings of fact and conclusions of law in its ruling on defendant\u2019s motion to rescind statutory summary suspension. The court\u2019s doing so has greatly helped this court and has clarified the issues on appeal.</p> <p id=\"b985-3\" pgmap=\"985\">The trial court described Charles as testifying \"with commendable candor\u201d and explicitly stated that it found Charles \"to be very credible.\u201d The court noted that Charles did not claim to be stopping defendant because \"of any reasonable, articulable facts to suggest that he had been driving under the influence of alcohol,\u201d but instead because the officer believed defendant drove his vehicle in violation of the Code other than DUI. Although defendant argued that Charles\u2019 stop of defendant\u2019s vehicle was a mere subterfuge because Charles intended to stop any vehicle driven by someone who left the tavern in question, the court concluded that Charles had not determined to stop defendant\u2019s vehicle unless Charles saw it involved in a violation of the Code. The court commented that what Charles asserted, \"in essence, was his right to follow any vehicle in his unbridled discretion. I believe this he may do without contravening the fourth amendment.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b985-4\" pgmap=\"985\">The trial court then focused upon section 11 \u2014 709(a) of the Code (625 ILCS 5/11 \u2014 709(a) (West 1992)), which defines the offense of improper lane usage, and stated that the issue it must resolve is whether defendant\u2019s automobile, as observed by Charles, violated that section. After carefully analyzing case law, the court concluded that defendant\u2019s driving did not violate that section and that Charles did not have reasonable, articulable facts to justify the stop of defendant\u2019s car.</p> <p id=\"b985-5\" pgmap=\"985\">II. ANALYSIS</p> <p id=\"AvH\" pgmap=\"985\">A. Standard of Review</p> <p id=\"b985-6\" pgmap=\"985\">In People v. Adams (1992), 225 Ill. App. 3d 815, 817, 587 N.E.2d 592, 594, this court wrote the following:</p> <blockquote id=\"b985-7\" pgmap=\"985\">\"A proceeding to rescind a summary suspension is a civil action in which the burden of proof rests on the motorist. [Citation.] The trial court\u2019s determination of whether the motorist\u2019s evidence constitutes a prima facie case for rescission will be overturned on appeal only if the finding is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b985-8\" pgmap=\"985(88) 986(14)\">In the present case, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s petition to rescind statutory summary suspension based upon the court\u2019s determination that the information Charles obtained about defendant\u2019s condition (which led Charles to arrest defendant for DUI) was obtained after Charles improperly stopped defendant\u2019s vehicle, thus violating the fourth amendment. Accordingly, the matter was presented to the court, and the court resolved it, as essentially a motion to suppress evidence, namely, the evidence Charles obtained as a result of stopping defendant\u2019s vehicle. For that reason, the standard of review that applies regarding motions to suppress applies under these circumstances as well.</p> <p id=\"b986-3\" pgmap=\"986\"> Generally, a court of review will not reverse a trial court\u2019s determination on a motion to suppress unless it is manifestly erroneous. (See People v. Garriott (1993), 253 Ill. App. 3d 1048, 1050, 625 N.E.2d 780, 782.) As this court explained in Garriott, \"[t]his rule exists because motions to suppress typically involve assessing the credibility of witnesses and weighing their testimony, functions the trial court is best suited to accomplish.\u201d (Garriott, 253 Ill. App. 3d at 1050, 625 N.E.2d at 782-83.) In the present case, as in Garriott, the State (as appellant) does not contest the trial court\u2019s findings of fact which underlie its conclusions of law, and in our review of the trial court\u2019s decision in this case, we accept fully its factual determinations. Accordingly, because only the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions are at issue in this appeal, we review those conclusions de novo. See In re D.G. (1991), 144 Ill. 2d 404, 408-09, 581 N.E.2d 648, 649 (\"where neither the facts nor credibility of the witnesses is contested, the issue *** is a legal question which a reviewing court may consider de novo\u201d); see also O\u2019Neill, Standards of Review in Illinois Criminal Cases: The Need for Major Reform, 17 S. Ill. U. L.J. 51, 78-80 (1992).</p> <p id=\"b986-4\" pgmap=\"986\">B. The Standard for Determining Whether Stopping Defendant\u2019s Vehicle was Justified</p> <p id=\"AbC\" pgmap=\"986\"> In determining whether Charles justifiably stopped defendant\u2019s vehicle, we must first determine the correct standard by which to judge that action. In People v. Repp (1988), 165 Ill. App. 3d 90, 94, 518 N.E.2d 750, 753, the trial court rescinded the statutory summary suspension of defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license on the ground that the arresting officer did not have probable cause to stop defendant\u2019s vehicle. The appellate court reversed, explaining as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b986-5\" pgmap=\"986\">\"It is elementary that the correct standard to be applied in ascertaining whether an investigatory stop is justified is not the constitutional requirement of 'probable cause\u2019 to arrest or search, which is synonymous with this State\u2019s statutory standard of 'reasonable grounds\u2019 [citation], but the less exacting test of whether the police had a reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity to warrant the stop [citation]. [Citations.] In order for an investigatory stop to pass constitutional [citation] and statutory [citation] muster, a police officer must have knowledge of specific, articulable facts which, when combined with the rational inferences from them, create a reasonable suspicion that the person in question either has committed or is about to commit a crime.\u201d Repp, 165 Ill. App. 3d at 94, 518 N.E.2d at 753-54.</blockquote> <p id=\"b986-6\" pgmap=\"986(26) 987(20)\">See also Adams, 225 Ill. App. 3d at 818, 587 N.E.2d at 594 (even though no probable cause exists to make an arrest, a police officer may make an investigatory stop if the officer\u2019s decision is based upon specific, articulable facts and the rational inferences therefrom).</p> <p id=\"b987-3\" pgmap=\"987\">C. Construction of Section 11 \u2014 709 of the Code</p> <p id=\"AIp\" pgmap=\"987\"> Section 11 \u2014 709(a) of the Code reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b987-4\" pgmap=\"987\">\"Driving on roadways laned for traffic. Whenever any roadway has been divided into 2 or more clearly marked lanes for trafficf,] the following rules in addition to all others consistent herewith shall apply.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b987-5\" pgmap=\"987\">(a) A vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practicable entirely within a single lane and shall not be moved from such lane until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made with safety.\u201d 625 ILCS 5/11 \u2014 709(a) (West 1992).</blockquote> <p id=\"b987-6\" pgmap=\"987\">The question which the trial court wrestled with as it attempted to construe this section was whether it consists of two elements or just one. The court explained that it accepted Charles\u2019 testimony that defendant\u2019s vehicle twice drove out of its lane, but the court then found a division of authority on whether that driving constituted a violation of section 11 \u2014 709(a) of the Code. The court noted that it had always understood this section as requiring two things: \"First, that you drive your vehicle completely within one lane to the extent you can, you can\u2019t straddle the lane line; and secondly, you can\u2019t change lanes until that can be done with reasonable safety. Left to my own devices, that is still the way I would read the statute.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b987-7\" pgmap=\"987\">However, the court cited People v. Halsall (1989), 178 Ill. App. 3d 617, 619, 533 N.E.2d 535, 536, a decision of the Third District Appellate Court, which reversed a defendant\u2019s conviction of improper lane usage because, although the evidence showed that the defendant did not drive within a single lane as nearly as possible, \"[tjhere was no evidence that when the defendant moved outside of his lane[,] he endangered himself, pedestrians, or other vehicles. Accordingly, we find that the State failed to prove that when the defendant moved outside of his lane[,] he did so without first determining that the movement could be made safely.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b987-8\" pgmap=\"987\">The trial court noted that in Repp, the Second District Appellate Court seemed to interpret section 11 \u2014 709(a) of the Code differently than the Halsall court and more in the manner the trial court thought appropriate. (See Repp, 165 Ill. App. 3d at 95-96, 518 N.E.2d at 755.) Nonetheless, the trial court adopted the construction of the section given by Halsall primarily because of a 1965 abstract decision of the Fourth District Appellate Court (People v. Pierceson (1965), 61 Ill. App. 2d 246, 209 N.E.2d 193 (abstract of opinion)) that seemed to interpret that section as Halsall did.</p> <p id=\"b988-3\" pgmap=\"988\">In Pierceson, this court construed section 60(a) of the Uniform Act Regulating Traffic on Highways (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1963, ch. 951/2, par. 157(a)), an earlier version of section 11 \u2014 709(a) of the Code that reads verbatim with the current version, and held as follows: \"Under [this statute,] the State has the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant moved from one lane of traffic to another, and also that he made such movement without ascertaining that it could be done with safety.\u201d (Emphasis added.) (Pierceson, 61 Ill. App. 2d 246, 209 N.E.2d 193 (abstract of opinion) (slip op. at 4).) The trial court was obligated to follow Pierceson, but we are not, and we now overrule it. Further, we disagree with Halsall to the extent its construction of section 11 \u2014 709(a) of the Code accords with Pierce-son.</p> <p id=\"b988-4\" pgmap=\"988\">We construe section 11 \u2014 709(a) of the Code as containing two separate, independent, and unconnected prohibitions regarding lane usage. To clarify the ambiguity of that section, we construe it as if it read as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b988-5\" pgmap=\"988\">\"(i) A vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practicable entirely within a single lane.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b988-6\" pgmap=\"988\">(ii) A vehicle being driven within a single lane shall not be moved from such lane until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made with safety.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b988-7\" pgmap=\"988\">Defendant\u2019s vehicle as observed by Charles was not driven \"as nearly as practicable\u201d entirely within a single lane. Thus, as we now construe section 11 \u2014 709(a) of the Code, Charles possessed specific, articulable facts upon which to believe defendant\u2019s vehicle was in violation of the Code when he pulled it over.</p> <p id=\"b988-8\" pgmap=\"988\">We note that this construction of the statute comports with several prior decisions which discuss improper lane usage. In People v. Houldridge (1983), 117 Ill. App. 3d 1059, 1062, 454 N.E.2d 769, 771-72, this court discussed whether certain articulable facts could provide a sufficient basis for an investigatory stop of a motor vehicle and wrote the following: \"[E]rratic driving, such as weaving across a roadway or even weaving within the lane of traffic within which a vehicle is traveling, provides a sufficient basis for an investigatory stop of a motor vehicle.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We note that unless section 11 \u2014 709(a) of the Code were construed as set forth above, the statement in Houldridge about \"even weaving within the lane of traffic within which a vehicle is traveling\u201d as providing a sufficient basis for an investigatory stop of a motor vehicle would not be correct.</p> <p id=\"b988-9\" pgmap=\"988(37) 989(23)\">Further, in People v. Loucks (1985), 135 Ill. App. 3d 530, 533, 481 N.E.2d 1086, 1087, the court cited Houldridge and held that \"[weaving within the lane of traffic in which a vehicle is traveling provides a sufficient basis for an investigatory stop of a motor vehicle.\u201d Finally, we note that even in Pierceson, this court wrote the following:</p> <blockquote id=\"b989-3\" pgmap=\"989\">\"All motorists are required to drive in one lane of traffic 'as nearly as practicable.\u2019 This is not an inflexible or unyielding rule. It is tempered with practicality and reason in the use of lanes of traffic in light of existing conditions.\u201d Pierceson, 61 Ill. App. 2d 246, 209 N.E.2d 193 (abstract of opinion) (slip op. at 5).</blockquote> <p id=\"b989-4\" pgmap=\"989\"> Our construction of section 11 \u2014 709(a) of the Code serves to illustrate the important distinction between evidence sufficient to sustain a conviction and evidence sufficient to merely justify an investigatory stop \u2014 a distinction courts have not always appreciated. In the present case, for example, some reason might have existed (unknown to Charles) to explain why defendant did not drive his vehicle in just one lane, but instead drove it across lane markers on both the left and right sides. Once Charles stopped defendant\u2019s vehicle, he might have agreed with defendant\u2019s explanation regarding why defendant\u2019s driving entirely within a single lane was not \"as practicable\u201d as it may have appeared to Charles when he pulled over defendant\u2019s vehicle. That explanation, assuming it was forthcoming, would not, however, affect or diminish the legitimacy of Charles\u2019 stop of defendant\u2019s vehicle based upon the specific, articulable facts Charles then possessed, namely, that defendant was not driving entirely within a single lane.</p> <p id=\"b989-5\" pgmap=\"989\">We point this out because in People v. Collins (1987), 154 Ill. App. 3d 149, 151, 506 N.E.2d 963, 965, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s petition to rescind statutory summary suspension on the ground that the police officer improperly pulled him over and then discovered he was driving while under the influence of alcohol. The Third District Appellate Court affirmed, noting that the only reason given for stopping defendant was the officer\u2019s observation of the defendant\u2019s car crossing the center line. At the hearing on the defendant\u2019s petition, he testified that he intentionally drove into a different lane in order to get around a car parked in his lane of traffic. The arresting officer testified that he could not remember whether a car had been so parked. The appellate court concluded that no initial traffic violation justified the investigatory stop by the police officer because \"[t]he arresting officer did not refute defendant\u2019s claim that he swerved to avoid a parked car.\u201d (Collins, 154 Ill. App. 3d at 151, 506 N.E.2d at 965.) We disagree with Collins because it is based upon an analysis more appropriate to determining whether the State proved the charge of improper lane usage beyond a reasonable doubt, not to determining whether the officer had specific, articulable facts to conduct an investigatory stop.</p> <p id=\"b990-3\" pgmap=\"990\">We further disagree with Collins where it places any relevancy on the fact that \"the officer admitted he did not issue any traffic violations for improper lane usage.\u201d (Collins, 154 Ill. App. 3d at 151, 506 N.E.2d at 965.) In Collins, once the officer stopped the defendant, he charged defendant only with DUI. On this issue, we concur fully with the Second District Appellate Court in Repp, where that court wrote that the arresting officer\u2019s decision not to charge the defendant with improper lane usage \"is insignificant for purposes of our analysis because, as we have stated previously, an officer 'need not charge a minor violation when, after a stop, he discovers a serious one.\u2019 \u201d Repp, 165 Ill. App. 3d at 96, 518 N.E.2d at 755.</p> <p id=\"b990-4\" pgmap=\"990\">In People v. Gerwick (1992), 235 Ill. App. 3d 691, 602 N.E.2d 93, this court reversed a trial court\u2019s order rescinding the statutory summary suspension of defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license. At the hearing on the defendant\u2019s petition to rescind, the defendant admitted he drove across the solid yellow center line of the roadway. Citing section 11\u2014 709 of the Code, the trial court concluded that the defendant was improperly stopped because no evidence was presented that defendant\u2019s crossing the center line was not \" 'made safely.\u2019 \u201d (Gerwick, 235 Ill. App. 3d at 695, 602 N.E.2d at 96.) In reversing, this court cited the testimony of the defendant and the arresting officer regarding defendant\u2019s driving across the yellow center line as establishing a sufficient basis for the officer to pull the defendant over. This court then concluded as follows:</p> <p id=\"b990-5\" pgmap=\"990\">\"In Village of Lincolnshire v. DiSpirito (1990), 195 Ill. App. 3d 859, 865, 552 N.E.2d 1238, 1241, the court found:</p> <blockquote id=\"b990-6\" pgmap=\"990\">'The fact that the defendant may later demonstrate a valid reason for what reasonably appears to be illegal conduct may affect his ultimate liability for that offense, but it should not affect the validity of the police officer\u2019s investigatory stop.\u2019</blockquote> <p id=\"b990-7\" pgmap=\"990\">The reasoning adopted by the DiSpirito court is sound. The facts and circumstances known to the officer at the time of the stop did warrant him, as a reasonable and prudent person, to believe a traffic violation had been committed. The trial court\u2019s determination was in error.\u201d (Gerwick, 235 Ill. App. 3d at 696, 602 N.E.2d at 97.)</p> <p id=\"b990-8\" pgmap=\"990\">We now reaffirm this court\u2019s holding in Gerwick.</p> <p id=\"b990-9\" pgmap=\"990\">D. Defendant\u2019s Subterfuge Argument</p> <p id=\"Ahu\" pgmap=\"990(55) 991(132)\"> As a last matter, we note that defendant argued that Charles\u2019 stop of his vehicle for improper lane usage was a mere subterfuge. Defendant contended that Charles always intended to pull defendant over to see if he might be driving while under the influence of alcohol. The trial court appropriately rejected this argument, but because defendants apparently continue to make it, we take this opportunity to reaffirm what this court has repeatedly said in rejecting it: if police officers are objectively doing what they are legally authorized to do, their actions are not to be questioned on the basis of any subjective intent with which they acted. (See People v. Salvator (1992), 236 Ill. App. 3d 824, 837, 602 N.E.2d 953, 961; People v. Flores (1992), 231 Ill. App. 3d 813, 823, 596 N.E.2d 1204, 1211; People v. Sorrells (1991), 209 Ill. App. 3d 1064, 1069, 568 N.E.2d 497, 500.) The trial court in this case appropriately focused at all times on whether Charles had articulable, reasonable grounds to stop defendant and disregarded all of defendant\u2019s arguments about what Charles\u2019 \"real intent\u201d may have been.</p> <p id=\"b991-4\" pgmap=\"991\">III. CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b991-5\" pgmap=\"991\">For the reasons stated, we reverse the trial court\u2019s order granting defendant\u2019s petition to rescind statutory summary suspension.</p> <p id=\"b991-6\" pgmap=\"991\">Reversed.</p> <p id=\"b991-7\" pgmap=\"991\">KNECHT, P.J., concurs.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b991-8\" pgmap=\"991\">JUSTICE McCULLOUGH,</author> <p id=\"AQr\" pgmap=\"991\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b991-9\" pgmap=\"991\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s need to rewrite section 11 \u2014 709 of the Code.
