The present litigation followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>The issue of law presented in this appeal concerns the relationship between statutes and ordinances governing the civil service system of the county and enactments dealing with public employee bargaining. The civil service enactments came first: The County Civil Service Enabling Law (now Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 31100-31117) authorizes a county to adopt a civil service system by means of an ordinance which \u201cshall not go into effect until the proposition of its approval has been submitted to a vote . . . and has received the affirmative vote of a majority of the electors voting on the proposition.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 31105.) The County of Contra Costa acted upon this authorization in 1944 by adopting an ordinance creating a merit system for county employment, to be administered by a civil service commission (Ord. No. 325, now div. 32, Contra Costa County Ordinance Code). The presently effective enactment authorizes the civil service commission to make regulations governing \u201cpromotion based on competitive examination and records of efficiency, character, conduct and seniority\u201d (Ord. Code, \u00a7 32-4.662). The commission has by regulation established a procedure for merit promotion, and has prohibited discrimination based on political or union activity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The regulations of the commission make no express provision for appeal to the commission in relation to a promotion where an employee contends merit principles have been violated, but the general tenor of the regulations supports the contention of the county that the commission would take cognizance of a complaint that promotion of a tenured employee had been withheld because of political discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">In the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act (MMBA; Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3500-3510) the Legislature authorized agencies of local government to recognize employee organizations (\u00a7 3503). Contra Costa County has provided for implementation of the act in division 34 of the Ordinance Code (see Gov. Code, \u00a7 3507, authorizing a public agency to adopt \u201creasonable rules and regulations ... for the administration of employer-employee relations\u201d). Promotion of employees has been reserved from submission to MMBA procedures (Ord. Code, \u00a7 34-8.004); equally explicitly, it is provided that \u201cIt is the exclusive right of the county to administer the merit system. . . .\u201d (Ord. Code, \u00a7 34-8.006.) The trial court pointed out in its memorandum of decision that promotion having thus been excluded from the scope of representation, a dispute concerning promotion could not be recognized as a grievance. (Ord. Code, \u00a7 34-4.024.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>In <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Crane </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 442 [155 Cal.Rptr. 695, 595 P.2d 129], the California Supreme Court gave effect to an arbitration provision in a memorandum of understanding under MMBA which had been entered into between the City of Berkeley and a police organization. The court determined that the memorandum of understanding was not in conflict with the city charter in providing for arbitration of cases involving discipline of police officers. (24 Cal.3d at p. 449.) Here there is no memorandum of understanding making promotion issues arbitrable, and the provisions of the civil service ordinance, reviewed above, exclude promotion and other merit system matters from arbitration. The civil service ordinance was ratified by popular vote (Gov. Code, \u00a7 31105). There is no indication in the record that it has been effectively repealed or modified by division 34 of the Ordinance Code. (See <em>Rains </em>v. <em>County of Contra Costa </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 263 [231 P.2d 55].) The ruling of the trial court that arbitration could not be compelled was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Caldecott, P. J., and Paik, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied October 15, 1979, and appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied December 6, 1979. Bird, C. J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-5\"> Article XIII, section 1, Regulations of Contra Costa County Civil Service Commission: \u201cNo person in the classified service, or seeking admission thereto, shall be appointed, promoted, reduced or removed, or in any way favored or discriminated against because of his political, religious, or labor opinions or affiliations,. . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b101-7\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
