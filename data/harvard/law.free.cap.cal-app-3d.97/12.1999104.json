J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABj\">Respondent was stopped by police officers while he was driving his automobile in the early morning hours of January 30, 1978, and was subsequently arrested for violation of Vehicle Code section 23102, subdivision (a) (driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor.) Having failed to submit to any of the chemical tests specified in Vehicle Code section 13353 and having been later advised by appellant of the suspension of his driver\u2019s license, he thereafter was afforded a hearing, all in accordance with subdivisions (a), (b) and (c) of that statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The referee before whom the hearing was held was of the opinion the suspension was improper because the testimony presented was such as to justify the conclusions respondent was initially detained on less than probable cause and therefore was subsequently unlawfully arrested. After its own review of the matter, however, appellant rejected those suggestions, made its own findings to the contrary and upheld the suspension. On respondent\u2019s petition for mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the trial court concluded: \u201cThe Court an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>nounces its intention to find for Petitioner on the basis of insufficiency of the evidence to sustain Respondent\u2019s findings \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB.\u201d It appears that the Court is bound to apply the substantial evidence test by <em>McGue </em>vs. <em>Sillas, </em>82 CA (3) 779. Nevertheless, the Court\u2019s view is that under the circumstances of this case, where the Respondent\u2019s own Referee, made \u201cnegative findings on reasonable cause and lawful arrest,\u201d which clearly were based upon his determinations of the credibility of Hartz and Petitioner. Respondent\u2019s opposite determination on a cold record does not rest upon substantial evidence. Petition for Writ of Mandate granted. Alternative Writ of Mandate discharged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">The appeal challenges the validity of this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">We note at the outset our serious reservations respecting the reasoning and result found in <em>McGue </em>v. <em>Sillas </em>(1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 799 [147 Cal.Rptr. 354], relied upon by the court below.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude neverthe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>less, that however the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 are or should correctly be understood, the trial court\u2019s determination under the circumstances here present was in error.  That is to say, upon the facts contained in this record, whether one\u2019s right to drive a motor vehicle in the State of California be viewed as fundamental, so as to require an independent judicial review of the evidence, or as not fundamental, so as to limit review to the question whether substantial evidence supports the administrative decision, <em>(Strumsky </em>v. <em>San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn., supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 28; <em>Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 130), is without significance, since under either test the issuance of the writ here was without foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Evidence from the arresting officer concerning his reasons for stopping respondent consisted of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">[Direct Examination]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">\u201cRef. Tillema: All right, all right. Fine. Now officer will you tell us why you stopped the vehicle in the first place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">Off. Knopp: Basically because of the erratic driving and the weaving, westbound on Santa Monica Blvd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-8\">\u201cRef. Tillema: All right. What were your observations of this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">\u201cOff. Knopp: All right. I first observed the defendant\u2019s vehicle, a brown Mercedes, westbound in the # 1 lane west of Fairfax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-10\">\u201cRef. Tillema: Ummmm hummn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-11\">\u201cOff. Knopp: Observed it approximately 35 miles per hour and observed it to weave across the double yellow lines by approximately two feet and jerk the vehicle back into the # 1 lane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>\u201cRef. Tillema: Did this happen more than once?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-4\">\u201cOff. Knopp: Yes, it did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">\u201cRef. Tillema: How many times did you observe it do you remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">\u201cOff. Knopp: From first observation until the stop was two to three over the double yellows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">\u201cRef. Tillema: Now what\u2019s the speed limit there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">\u201cOff. Knopp: Thirty miles an hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-9\">\u201cRef. Tillema: And this occurred at 1:50 you said in the report here. Were there any oncoming cars during this period of observation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-10\">\u201cOff. Knopp: Yes there were. If I remember correctly it was a weekend night, Friday or Saturday, I\u2019m not sure which one which would preclude ahh\u2014Somewhat heavy traffic, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-11\">\u201cRef. Tillema: I see, this was the morning of January 30 huh? The night is January 29.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-12\">\u201cOff. Knopp: It was Sunday morning, I think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-13\">\u201cRef. Tillema: Sunday morning, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-14\">\u201cOff. Knopp: It would be Saturday night traffic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-15\">[Cross Examination]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-16\">\u201cAtty. Manes: O.K. Now when you approached his vehicle sir, oh, by the way on these two occasions that you say he may have gone over the yellow line, double yellow line, it was a matter of only a foot or two is that right sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-17\">\u201cOff. Knopp: That\u2019s approximately two feet, yes on both occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-18\">\u201cAtty. Manes: All right. And on both occasions he would jerk back into the former lane is that right sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-19\">\u201cOff. Knopp: Well on the first occasion yes he jerked back. On the second occasion he changed lanes from the westbound #2 across the # 1, across the double yellows and then jerked back.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-20\">The <em>only </em>testimony tending to dispute these observations was that of respondent to the effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-21\">\u201cRef. Tillema: Do you remember any particular times when your left wheels were across the center line?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-22\">\u201cMr. Thomas: No, I don\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>By any adequate measure and no matter how generously this ambiguous disclaimer is treated, we deem it insufficient to obviate otherwise uncontroverted evidence of the fact respondent was observed to engage in such actions as would have justified his initial detention. Beyond this, the record is clear that respondent\u2019s breath contained the odor of alcohol, that his reactions to five different field sobriety tests were unsatisfactory, that his eyes were bloodshot and his speech slow and slurred, and that, by his own admission, he had previously in the evening consumed \u201ca couple of beers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Under such circumstances, we conclude appellant\u2019s findings in support of its suspension of respondent\u2019s license were not subject to judicial modification by either standard of review referred to above.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Nor is this conclusion varied by the suggestion that because the referee appointed to conduct the section 13353 hearing rejected the testimony of the arresting officer, his findings were binding upon appellant. On the contrary, the ability and the requirement for appellant\u2019s making its own determination are established both by case law and statute. <em>(Serenko </em>v. <em>Bright </em>(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 682 [70 Cal.Rptr. 1]; Veh.

(Cf. <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 293, 305 . . . .) Enforcement of this rule does not effectively deny an individual transportation, not even by private automobile. At most, it puts an economic burden on him by requiring that he use other means of transportation. The resulting expense and inconvenience are not sufficient to raise the right to drive to the stature of a fundamental right.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) <em>(McGue </em>v. <em>Sillas </em>(1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 799, 805 [147 Cal.Rptr. 354].)</p>\n<p id=\"Akb\">In our opinion this formulation of the test whereby fundamental rights are determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>is misconceived. While the weighing process described may well be appropriate in limiting or divesting such a right, it would not seem germane to its ascertainment. Stated otherwise, how is the fact there may be conflicting interests involved with any given \u201cright\u201d relevant to the basic question dealt with in <em>Bixby </em>and <em>Strumsky, </em>i.e., whether abrogation of the right is too important to the <em>individual </em>to relegate it to exclusive administrative extinction. (See <em>Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d 130 at pp. 144-147; <em>Strumsky </em>v. <em>San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn., supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 28 at pp. 34, 45.)</p>\n<p id=\"A0H\">When a right is fundamental and vested, <em>Bixby </em>and its progeny define the procedure for divestment or other limitation of any such rights. The procedure so defined does not contain any exception for a variance of such procedure to revocation of a license to drive because of \u201cthe public\u2019s interest in the strict enforcement of traffic laws ....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b40-9\"> The sections provide respectively: (\u00a7 14109) \u201cUpon the conclusion of a formal hearing the referee or board shall make findings on the matters under consideration and may prepare and submit recommendations to the director.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AFRY\">(\u00a7 14110) \u201cThe director, or an employee at or above the level of assistant division chief of the Department of Motor Vehicles designated by the director to act on his behalf, following a formal hearing, upon review of the records, evidence, and of the findings, if any, shall render his decision concerning the refusal to issue or renew a driver\u2019s license, the imposing of terms or conditions of probation, or concerning the suspension or revocation of the privilege of operating a motor vehicle, or in those cases in which an action has been previously taken by the department, the director, or his designee shall render his decision sustaining, modifying, or reversing the order of suspension or revocation or the refusal to issue a license or the order imposing terms or conditions of probation, or he may set aside the prior action of the department and direct that probation be granted to the applicant or licensee and fix the terms and conditions of the probation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
