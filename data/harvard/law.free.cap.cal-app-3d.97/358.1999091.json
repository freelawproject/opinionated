J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1Y\">On defendant\u2019s appeal challenging the validity of a state prison sentence imposed pursuant to the purported terms of a negotiated plea agreement, we examine the novel question whether a trial court may properly condition a prison sentence based solely upon a defendant\u2019s failure to appear at the time regularly set for imposition of sentence. We conclude that such an extraordinary practice is invalid as a matter of law. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The relevant facts follow: Defendant, then 19 years of age, was charged by information with five counts of aggravated assault (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)), including use of a firearm in the commission of the offenses (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.5). On July 15, 1977, defendant pled guilty to counts 1 and 2, pursuant'to a negotiated plea bargain announced in open court under the terms of which the remaining counts and use clause were to be dismissed, and no actual state prison sentence was to be imposed. The trial judge then announced his intention to summarily impose a state prison sentence with execution stayed for the sole purpose of assuring defendant\u2019s appearance upon his being released on his own recognizance (O.R.) pending formal sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>After defendant indicated his understanding and willingness to waive \u201call of the important constitutional rights ... set forth in this form\u201d (a procedure questionable at best under applicable <em>Boykin-Tahl </em>requirements),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the trial judge accepted defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to the designated counts and took the People\u2019s motion to dismiss the remaining charges under submission until the time set for sentencing. After the defendant provided assurances of his ability to make bail on the other pending charges, the trial judge then imposed a prison sentence in conjunction with the O.R. release.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the course of a number of continuances to permit the defendant to process a work-furlough application (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1208), the same trial judge, on August 24, 1977, again granted the defendant an O.R. release subject, however, to execution of a written promise to appear (see Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1318-1318.4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>superimposed on the damoclean penalty earlier prophesied in the event of nonappearance. Thereafter, defendant failed to appear on the newly scheduled October sentencing date and was subsequently apprehended in December. At the outset of formal sentencing proceedings on March 20, 1978, defendant expressed his desire to withdraw his plea of guilty if the court intended to follow a diagnostic evaluation report recommending a state prison sentence; that request was expressly denied in the order remanding defendant into custody for purpose of carrying out the previously imposed prison sentence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">It is of course axiomatic that when a plea bargain is made the defendant is entitled to withdraw his plea if the negotiated bargain is incapable of actual fulfillment. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1192.5; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kaanehe </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 1, 13-15 [136 Cal.Rptr. 409, 559 P.2d 1028]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 868 [112 Cal.Rptr. 556, 519 P.2d 604]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 305, 308-309 [98 Cal.Rptr. 822, 491 P.2d 406]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Preciado </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 144 [144 Cal.Rptr. 102]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pinon </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 120, 125 [110 Cal.Rptr. 406].) Under the provisions of the authorizing statute, once the plea specifying the punishment is accepted by the prosecutor and approved by the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>the defendant cannot be sentenced on such plea \u201cto a punishment more severe than that specified in the plea and the court may not proceed as to such plea other than as specified in the plea.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1192.5.) Moreover, the statute expressly requires that in approving such plea, the court must inform the defendant of the conditional nature of its approval and defendant\u2019s right to withdraw his guilty plea in the event such approval is ultimately withdrawn.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Inexplicably, that duty was not discharged herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Defendant\u2019s plea in exchange for the prosecutor\u2019s agreement to dismiss the remaining charges expressly rejected the possibility of a \u201cphysical\u201d or actual sentence of imprisonment. Whether the proffered plea was acceptable was within the exclusive discretion of the court. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1192.5; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Orin </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 937, 942-943 [120 Cal.Rptr. 65, 533 P.2d 193]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1971) 22 Cal.App.3d 25, 30 [99 Cal.Rptr. 171].) But the discretion to conditionally approve the negotiated plea bargain did not sanction the wholly unrelated and unbargained condition interjected by the court concerning defendant\u2019s candidacy for immediate O.R. release pending contemplated formal sentencing proceedings. No authority validating such an unusual sentencing-release procedure has been advanced or otherwise discovered by us.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The announced purpose of promoting administrative convenience while providing an \u201cincentive\u201d ensuring timely appearance, hardly justifies such a summary sentencing procedure in open conflict with established procedural requirements (e.g., see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203 mandating a probation presentence report and recommendation where defendant is otherwise eligible; see also Pen. Code, \u00a7 1200, arraignment for judgment). Moreover, the Legislature already provided adequate means, later invoked herein, calculated to assure a defendant\u2019s presence at all necessary stages, including sentencing (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1318 et seq.); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>under the statutory scheme of O.R. release, a defendant who thereafter fails to appear without justification is subject to punishment upon conviction of the separate offense of a wilful failure to appear (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1319.4) in an action brought at the discretion of the prosecutor, not by peremptory judicial fiat. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 697, 707-708 [117 Cal.Rptr. 905]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 193, 204 [103 Cal.Rptr. 645, 66 A.L.R.3d 717]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Orin, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 937, 943.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">In effect, defendant\u2019s punishment was triggered solely by reason of another uncharged, unproven offense. The attempted \u201cshort cut\u201d O.R. process, resulting in the immediate sentencing choice of imprisonment, without regard for minimal procedural requirements, was clearly arbitrary and an abuse of discretion. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1191, 1203; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 796, 800-801 [135 Cal.Rptr. 411, 557 P.2d 995]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Arredondo </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 973, 981-982 [125 Cal.Rptr. 419]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rojas </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 676, 680-681 [21 Cal.Rptr. 564, 371 P.2d 300]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Carl B. </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 212, 218-219 [155 Cal.Rptr. 189, 594 P.2d 14]; cf. Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170; Cal. Rules of Court, rules 410 and 418.) Nor does the fact that execution was stayed, and a probation report and diagnostic evaluation thereafter received, sanitize the tainted procedure. As the trial judge made unmistakably clear, defendant was sentenced to state prison notwithstanding the terms of the negotiated plea simply by reason of his failure to \u201cshow up\u201d at the time of formal sentencing. (See fn. 1, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">While trial courts are encouraged to fashion procedural innovations, consistent with due process requirements, designed to effectively and fairly expedite the processing of criminal cases, we cannot condone unconventional techniques which clearly infringe upon a defendant\u2019s basic rights or otherwise fetter prosecutorial discretion as are here manifested.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Since the defendant was not accorded the full benefits of the negotiated plea bargain, unhindered by the invalid condition, he was entitled to withdraw his plea of guilty and enter a new and different plea to the original charges upon reinstatement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Kaanehe, supra, </em>19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Cal.3d 1, 13-15; cf. <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 182 [156 Cal.Rptr. 289].) Accordingly, we must reverse the judgment of conviction and remand with directions to set aside defendant\u2019s guilty plea, reinstate the original charges filed and undertake further proceedings as appropriate. (See <em>In re Sutherland </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 666, 671-672 [100 Cal.Rptr. 129, 493 P.2d 857].) In view of our decision, we need not discuss the remaining issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Elkington, J., and Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\"> In order that the full circumstances surrounding the genesis of the unique sentencing-release agreement may be understood, we report the relevant colloquy herein prior to change of plea in some detail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtV_\">\u201cMR. ROLLAND [defense counsel]: At this time, Your Honor, Mr. Morris wishes to withdraw his previously entered plea of not guilty and, pursuant to negotiations with the District Attorney and discussions with the Court, to enter a plea of guilty to Count One and Two, each one being a violation of Section 245(a) of the Penal Code, assault with a deadly weapon, with the understanding that Counts Three, Four, and Five would be dismissed, and that the allegation of use under 12022.5 would be stricken. <em>The District Attorney has indicated that there will be no physical State Prison pursuant to a negotiated plea, </em>and the Court has indicated that it would release Mr. Morris today on his own recognizance pending report and sentence with a condition, or at least a strong reminder, that there should be no violations of the law between now and the report and sentence day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aak\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, I want you to understand that I have adopted Judge Lindsay\u2019s O.R. system. I\u2019ll sentence him to State Prison and stay it until the R&amp;S date. If he doesn\u2019t show up, he goes to State Prison. If he does show up, it\u2019s reduced to the bargain of no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>physical. That\u2019s maximum incentive.

But if you don\u2019t come back, a warrant will go out, you\u2019ll go to State Prison.

Contrary to the People\u2019s construction, <em>Pinon </em>is in symmetrical alignment with the line of authority discussed herein holding that a defendant must be sentenced within the limits of the negotiated plea or be afforded an opportunity to withdraw his plea of guilty. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 124-125.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b298-7\"> We obviously reject the rationale underlying the People\u2019s contention that by acceding to the judicially imposed condition, defendant validly pleaded to a prison sentence properly conditioned upon his appearance. As we' have explained, the appended condition and resulting sentence were wholly ineffectual. At best, the engrafted condition could only be plausibly construed as a separate condition to <em>final </em>judicial approval of the terms of the negotiated plea precluding an actual prison sentence. However viewed, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>result is the same; defendant was entitled to withdraw his plea unless sentenced within the limits of the negotiated bargain.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
