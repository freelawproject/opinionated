C. Fullerton (respondents) in an action brought for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">The summarized facts reveal that in April 1977, trawl nets belonging to appellant, a commercial fisherman, were seized by respondents for the reason that they had undersized net meshes in violation of section 8602 of the Fish and Game Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequently, two misdemeanor complaints were filed in the municipal court charging appellant with violation of sections 8841, 8831 and 2002. Thereafter, civil actions were brought in the superior court under section 8630 which provides for forfeiture of illegal trawl nets (actions Nos. M 8717, M 8718).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">Since the outcome of both the criminal and civil actions, in the final analysis, depends on section 8602, which sets out the manner of determining the length of meshes, appellant initiated a declaratory relief action seeking a judicial interpretation of section 8602 and his rights thereunder. Appellant strenuously contended in the proceeding below <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>that, pursuant to the plain meaning of section 8602,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the knotted nets (the type of nets owned by appellant and seized by respondents) should be measured in a separate or random fashion, and the statutory requirement that the length of meshes must be determined by taking four meshes while they are simultaneously drawn closely together should be applied only to knotless nets, not involved in the present dispute. The pretrial order limited the issues to the interpretation and constitutionality of section 8602. After receiving evidence and considering the legal arguments of the parties, the trial court, sitting without a jury, decided both issues against appellant by holding that under section 8602 both knotted and knotless nets shall be measured while four meshes are simultaneously drawn closely together and that section 8602 does not suffer from constitutional infirmity due to vagueness or uncertainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Appellant assails both of the trial court\u2019s rulings. First, appellant claims: (1) the code section in question is clear and unambiguous, and as a consequence its meaning must be ascertained solely from the words used therein <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 30 [127 Cal.Rptr. 122, 544 P.2d 1322]; <em>Outboard Marine Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 30 [124 Cal.Rptr. 852]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Van Alstyne </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 900 [121 Cal.Rptr. 363]); (2) the plain meaning of the statute is contrary to the interpretation reached by the trial court; and (3) the admission of extrinsic evidence to show legislative intent (i.e., legislative history of \u00a7 8602, the legislative objective, contemporary administrative construction, and the like) constitutes prejudicial error. The second major thrust of appellant\u2019s argument is that if the interpretation of the trial court is correct, section 8602 is unconstitutional because it is vague and uncertain. As the ensuing discussion will demonstrate, none of appellant\u2019s contentions have any merit and as a consequence the judgment below must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\"><em>Statutory Interpretation: </em>Since we are called upon to interpret section 8602, as a threshold matter we set out the basic rules relating to interpretation of statutes.  As emphasized time and again, <em>the fundamental principle of statutory interpretation is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law (People </em>ex rel. <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 30, 40; <em>Select Base Materials </em>v. <em>Board of Equal. </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 640, 645 [335 P.2d 672]). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>determining the legislative intent, the court turns first to the words used in the statute <em>(People </em>v. <em>Knowles </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 175, 182 [217 P.2d 1]). <em>The words, however, must be read in context, keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute </em>where they appear <em>(Tripp </em>v. <em>Swoap </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 671, 679 [131 Cal.Rptr. 789, 552 P.2d 749]; <em>Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224]), and the statutory language applied must be given such interpretation as will promote rather than defeat the objective of the law <em>(Steilberg </em>v. <em>Lackner </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 780, 785 [138 Cal.Rptr. 378]; <em>City of L.A. </em>v. <em>Pac. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>(1958) 164 Cal.App.2d 253, 256 [330 P.2d 888]). Finally, <em>in ascertaining the legislative intent, the courts should consider not only the words used, but </em>should <em>also </em>take into account other matters as well, such as <em>the object in view, </em>the evils to be remedied, <em>the legislative history, </em>public policy, <em>and contemporaneous administrative construction (English </em>v. <em>County of Alameda </em>(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 226, 233-234 [138 Cal.Rptr. 634]; <em>Alford </em>v. <em>Pierno </em>(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 682, 688 [104 Cal.Rptr. 110]).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">When tested and analyzed in light of the foregoing principles, the record convincingly demonstrates that, prior to the 1973 amendment, section 8602 (formerly \u00a7 848) consistently provided that the length of any net meshes was to be measured by taking four meshes while they were simultaneously drawn closely together.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As explained at the trial, this method of taking four meshes piled on each other rather than one mesh at a time served the objective of preventing an excessive stretching of meshes which would distort their size and make their measurement arbitrary. As appears from the oral and documentary evidence received at the trial, the 1973 amendment introduced by Assembly Bill No. 574 was adopted solely for the purpose of providing measuring methods with respect to the knotless nets, and was not aimed at changing the existing system of measuring knotted nets. Thus Director Fullerton, who had testified before the legislative committee dealing with Assembly Bill No. 574, stated at the trial that the thrust of the 1973 amendment was to add a provision for the measurement of knotless nets and not to change the longstanding, established method of measuring knotted nets.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The analysis of the legislative counsel also confirms that the bill containing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>amendment only updated \u201cpresent law, necessitated by the fact that fishermen generally don\u2019t use knotted nets any more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">In addition to the aforestated legislative history, the contemporaneous construction given to the statute makes it also crystal clear that the 1973 amendment to section 8602 did not alter the basic rule that the meshes in both the knotted and knotless nets were to be measured by taking four meshes and piling them on top of each other. Thus, Captain Bradford testified that during his tenure in the department from 1951 through 1976, the agency\u2019s requirement was to measure four meshes while they were simultaneously drawn together. His testimony was reaffirmed by both Mr. Kaneen, regional manager of the Marine Resources Region, and Inspector Goodrich. Mr. Kaneen testified that since 1940, the department\u2019s policy was to measure four meshes while they were piled up on each other. This information was laid down in procedural guides, bulletins and department manuals sent to marine wardens in charge of the enforcement of the statute. Inspector Goodrich testified as to two department memos dated in 1974 and 1976 which had described the proper method of measuring mesh size under section 8602. Moreover, the inspector underlined that he had explained the department\u2019s measurement method and publicly demonstrated the technique to the members of the fishing industry. Finally, Warden Boettcher stated at trial that upon instructions received from Inspector Goodrich he had informed both the other wardens and the fishermen in the Monterey area (including appellant, who was present at the meeting) that the applicable method of measuring mesh size in nets remained the same, that is, the department would measure four meshes while they were simultaneously drawn closely together. It is, of course, elementary that contemporaneous and practical construction of a statute by those who have a duty to carry it into effect is given great weight <em>(F.T.C. </em>v. <em>Mandel Brothers </em>(1959) 359 U.S. 385, 391 [3 L.Ed.2d 893, 898, 79 S.Ct. 818]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McGee </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 948, 961 [140 Cal.Rptr. 657, 568 P.2d 382]).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument, that considering the clear and unambiguous language of the statute the legislative history and the contemporaneous administrative construction were inadmissible to prove legislative intent and the purpose of the statutory amendment, is ill-founded and must fail for two major reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>First, it is commonplace that a word is a symbol of thought and as such has no fixed or true objective meaning. The meaning of particular words or groups of words varies with the verbal context and the surrounding circumstances in which the words are used <em>(Pacific Gas &amp; E. Co. </em>v. <em>G. W. Thomas Drayage etc. Co. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 33, 38 [69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641, 40 A.L.R.3d 1373]; <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>State Social Welfare Board </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 184, 195 [5 Cal.Rptr. 553, 353 P.2d 33]). In line with these premises, the \u201cplain meaning rule\u201d advocated by appellant has been severely criticized by 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th ed. 1973) section 45.02, page 4: \u201cThis rule is deceptive, however, in that it implies that words have intrinsic meanings. . . . [A] word is merely a symbol which can be used to refer to different things. ... It is impossible to determine the referent of the word without a knowledge of the facts involved in its use. ... It is only through custom, usage, and convention that language acquires established meanings. The assertion in a judicial opinion that a statute needs no interpretation because it is \u2018clear and unambiguous\u2019 is in reality evidence that the court has already considered and construed the act. It may also signify that the court is unwilling to consider matter or evidence bearing on the question as to how the statute should be construed, and is instead declaring its effect on the basis of the judge\u2019s own uninstructed and unrationalized impression of its meaning. <em>Because issues as to what a statute means or what a legislature intended are essentially issues of fact, </em>even though they are decided by the judge and not by a jury, <em>a court should never exclude relevant and probative evidence from </em>consideration.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">In the case at bench, the extrinsic evidence in dispute was highly relevant to show the legislative intent underlying the statute. This is especially true with respect to the legislative history of the enactment which furnishes crucial evidence with respect to the measurement of knotted nets, the subject matter of the present controversy. It follows that the trial court was not only free, but also duty bound to admit the challenged extrinsic evidence to ascertain the true intent of the Legislature and to effectuate the purpose of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Second, appellant\u2019s argument is untenable for the additional reason that section 8602 is far from being clear or unambiguous. Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>contends the statutory provisions regulating the measurement of knotted nets are included solely in the first part of the section which provides \u201cThe length of the meshes of <em>any </em>net shall be determined by taking at least four meshes and measuring them inside the knots\u201d (italics added). However, even a brief analysis is persuasive that if read in isolation, as appellant suggests, the cited portion of the statute suffers from fatal ambiguities. In the first place, it includes \u201c any net,\u201d that is, both knotted and knotless nets in an apparent contradiction with the rest of the statutory provisions which purport to regulate the measuring method of the knotless nets. Additionally (and even more to the point), taken out of context and.standing alone, the cited part of section 8602 is patently incomplete in that it fails to give any guidance or direction on whether the four meshes shall be measured separately or while they are simultaneously drawn closely together. Or to put it another way, the interpretation of the sentence as recommended by appellant does not give a definite answer as to the seminal issue raised in this case, and as a consequence, even under the authorities cited by appellant <em>(Outboard Marine Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.3d 30; <em>People </em>v. <em>Van Alstyne, supra, </em>46 Cal.App.3d 900; <em>Skivers </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 652, etc. [91 Cal.Rptr. 707]), the legislative intent must be ascertained by resort to the rules of statutory interpretation, including the admission of relevant extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Although unessential for the determination of the case, we note parenthetically that appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>People </em>v. <em>Caudillo </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 562 [146 Cal.Rptr. 859, 580 P.2d 274], and <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 30, is obviously misplaced. While in both instances it has been pointed out that the courts should give effect to the statutes according to the usual, ordinary import of the language employed in them, the court in each of these cases emphasized that the statutes must be interpreted in accordance with the applicable rules of construction, the most fundamental of which is ascertainment of legislative intent so that the purpose of the law may be effectuated. In harmony with these principles, in <em>Caudillo </em>the court did consider the legislative history of the statute involved, and in <em>Younger </em>it pointed out that legislative history of the code section was not available and as a consequence it had to dispense with that aspect of the statute and rely solely on the general rules of interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\"><em>Constitutionality of Section 8602: </em>Appellant\u2019s second major contention, that section 8602 is unconstitutional because it is vague and uncertain, requires but a relatively brief discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>As a general rule, all enactments should be interpreted when possible to uphold their validity. In accordance therewith, it has been held that the courts should construe enactments to give specific content to terms that might otherwise be unconstitutionally vague <em>(Bloom </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 71 [127 Cal.Rptr. 317, 545 P.2d 229]; <em>Associated Home Builders etc., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Livermore </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 582, 598 [135 Cal.Rptr. 41, 557 P.2d 473, 92 A.L.R.3d 1038]). Even more importantly, the cases have unanimously concluded that \u201capparent ambiguities frequently may be resolved by the contemporaneous construction of the Legislature or of the administrative agencies charged with implementing the new enactment.\u201d <em>(Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 208, 245 [149 Cal.Rptr. 239, 583 P.2d 1281]; see also <em>State of South Dakota </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 765, <em>777 </em>[144 Cal.Rptr. 758, 576 P.2d 473]; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 137, 140 [173 P.2d 551, 174 P.2d 4].)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">In the present case we are squarely confronted with the latter situation. The record here is replete that the ambiguity of section 8602, if any, was dispelled by respondents who repeatedly explained to the interested members of the fishing industry, including appellant, that the meaning of section 8602 and the practice of the Fish and Game Department was to measure four meshes while they were simultaneously drawn closely together, and that the described method of measurement included both knotted and knotless nets. Since the alleged ambiguity and vagueness of section 8602 was removed by the authoritative construction of respondents, the administrative agency in charge of the enforcement of the enactment, and since official interpretation of the disputed section was brought to the personal attention of appellant, the claim that section 8602 is unconstitutionally vague and/or that appellant\u2019s due process rights have been violated due to his ignorance of the true meaning of the statute, must be held totally groundless and be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In light of our conclusion, the additional issues raised by the parties need not be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Taylor, P.
