Esposito was barred by the statute of limitations. After granting reconsideration, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board) held that the employer, Michael Hurwitz, and his workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier, Industrial Indemnity Company, were estopped to assert the statute of limitations and remanded the case for further proceedings at the trial level. The employer and its insurance carrier (collectively, defendants) unsuccessfully petitioned for reconsideration and thereafter petitioned this court for a writ of review which was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The applicant, born July 14, 1952, was employed as a legal secretary by Michael Hurwitz, an attorney practicing in Palm Springs in association with another attorney, Philip H. Flickinger. On May 2, 1975, with the permission of Mr. Hurwitz, applicant stayed at the office past the usual 5 o\u2019clock closing time typing a paper for her husband, Samuel Esposito. At about 9 p.m. she left the office, and, in coming down the allegedly unlighted common stairway of the office building, she fell, injuring her right leg. She had never before done typing of a personal nature after hours at the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Applicant continued working for Mr. Hurwitz until approximately May 14, 1975, at which time she wrote a letter to Messrs. Hurwitz and Flickinger to the effect she was resigning her position. She assigned as reasons for her resignation: \u201cBreach of employment contract\u201d; \u201cclandestine and surreptitious manipulation of my emoluments\u201d; having to work in an atmosphere where her self-respect was continually being \u201cput to the test\u201d by the use of profane language; mental harassment; and \u201c[cjomplete disregard of my physical injury to my leg, which occurred on the job, May 2, 1975.\u201d Although not specifically mentioned in the letter, Mr. Hurwitz had apparently rebuked applicant for reporting late to work because of a medical appointment without giving him advance notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">No medical or temporary disability benefits were furnished by defendants. Although applicant consulted an attorney and engaged him to pursue a third party action for damages on account of her injury against the owners of the office building, she filed no application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits with Board until April 11, 1977, almost two years after the date of her injury. In response to the application, defendants denied that the injury arose out of and in the course of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>employment and further asserted that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations inasmuch as the application was not filed within one year after the date of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">The case was heard on November 14, 1977. The trial judge found applicant\u2019s claim barred by the statute of limitations. In the opinion he stated: \u201cApplicant was represented by counsel. Applicant and counsel were well aware of her rights under the compensation laws, but apparently chose to pursue the third party case, thus permitting the Statute to run.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Applicant filed a timely petition for reconsideration. Board issued an opinion and order granting reconsideration for further study of what Board referred to as the \u201cpeculiar facts\u201d and the law \u201cin order to make a just and reasoned decision.\u201d On January 4, 1979, Board issued its opinion and decision after reconsideration holding, on the authority of <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., </em>12 Cal.3d 726 [117 Cal.Rptr. 79, 527 P.2d 631], that defendants were estopped from asserting the statute of limitations by their failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the administrative director pertaining to notices to be given an injured employee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>Defendants then petitioned for reconsideration contending that the <em>Reynolds </em>decision was based upon the doctrine of estoppel and was inapplicable in the case at hand because the evidence established that applicant was represented by an attorney, was aware of her rights under the workers\u2019 compensation law, and was specifically aware that her claim must be filed within one year from the date of injury; that applicant discussed the matter with her attorney and deliberately chose not to pursue a workers\u2019 compensation claim until almost one year after the statute of limitations had expired and that her delay in filing did not result from defendants\u2019 failure to give her the required notice or notices.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On March 23, 1979, Board issued its opinion and order denying reconsideration reiterating that <em>Reynolds </em>was applicable and that defendants were estopped from asserting the statute of limitations because of their failure to comply with the notice requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Defendants advance on review essentially the same contentions urged in their petition for reconsideration: that the rationale of the <em>Reynolds </em>decision is inapplicable in this case in which the applicant was fully aware of her rights under the workers\u2019 compensation law and made a deliberate choice not to file a workers\u2019 compensation claim within the period of the statute of limitations and that, therefore, the Board\u2019s decision is contraiy to law and unreasonable; that Board\u2019s conclusion that defendants are estopped from asserting the statute of limitations is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>supported by its findings; and that its findings are not supported by substantial evidence based on the entire record.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">The principal contention of both applicant and Board is that the <em>Reynolds </em>decision is controlling.  However, applicant appears to contend that Board found that applicant\u2019s failure to file a workers\u2019 compensation claim within the statutorily prescribed period resulted from intimidation and warnings by her employer and her attorney\u2019s having misled her into believing that her employer\u2019s assistance was necessary in the third party action and that that finding by Board is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Applicant is incorrect in several respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">First, Board made no such finding. Although in its opinion and decision after reconsideration holding that defendants were estopped from asserting the statute of limitations Board did refer to applicant\u2019s allegations, contentions and assertions about threats and intimidations, the Board\u2019s decision was based squarely on defendants\u2019 failure to fulfill the \u201cmandatory obligation to inform applicant of her rights or to issue a disclaimer of liability or notice of nonpayment of benefits\u201d and the <em>Reynolds </em>decision. (See fn. 1, <em>ante.) </em>Board itself confirmed that fact in its opinion and order denying defendants\u2019 petition for reconsideration in which it expressly stated: \u201cIn the Board\u2019s January 4, 1979, decision, the Board relied upon the doctrine set out in <em>Reynolds vs WCAB </em>(1974), 12 Cal.3d, 726, 39 CCC 768, <em>as the basis of its decision </em>that defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>estopped to raise the statute of limitations as a defense herein.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">It is true that in the last substantive paragraph of Board\u2019s opinion and order denying defendants\u2019 petition for reconsideration it is stated: \u201cFurther, the record in this case indicates that applicant was subjected to intimidation and warnings by defendant employer discouraging applicant from filing a worker\u2019s compensation claim and that applicant\u2019s counsel led applicant to believe that defendant employer\u2019s assistance was necessary in applicant\u2019s third party case, thereby discouraging applicant from filing a worker\u2019s compensation claim until after the statutory period had passed.\u201d  However, it is abundantly clear that the decision after reconsideration was not based on such a finding,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and it is reasonably clear that the same is true of the order denying defendant\u2019s petition for reconsideration. Significantly, in its response to the petition for writ of review, Board makes no attempt to uphold its decision on the basis of such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Secondly, no such finding would be supported by substantial evidence based on the entire record. All parties are agreed that the trial judge\u2019s summary of the evidence \u201cadequately sets forth the facts of the accident and the matters that transpired after the accident pertaining to the issue of [the] statute of limitations . . . .\u201d The trial judge\u2019s summary of the evidence was itself well summarized by the trial judge in his report and recommendation on applicant\u2019s petition for reconsideration. It reads in pertinent part: \u201cThe applicant testified that, from her experience working in an attorney\u2019s office, she was aware that she could file a compensation [application] and that she had one year within which to file it. She hired an attorney, William Jones, to represent her, as she had a civil case against the office building. He, she stated, did not want to file a compensation case against her employer, as he told her this would create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>a conflict. Attorney Jones apparently had other cases with her employer. In any event, because of this advice, she relied on him and did not filed.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">\u201cApplicant\u2019s former husband, Samuel Esposito, testified that the defendant employer had advised him that he would fight a compensation claim; that Attorney Jones had told him he would not handle a compensation case for the applicant.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">\u201cMichael Hurwitz, applicant\u2019s employer, testified that he did not threaten to withhold his testimony in any civil suit as he had no testimony to give.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>\u201cWilliam E. Jones, the attorney, testified, and denied that he said anything about applicant having a claim against the defendant; he did talk with the defendant and was advised that if he filed a compensation case not to expect help. However, there was no reason, he stated, that he needed the defendant\u2019s help. He believed the applicant did not want to file a compensation case. There was no reason why he could not have represented her and made a compensation claim.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The trial judge concluded: \u201cApplicant was furnished no benefits. She had one year to file her compensation application. She waited from May 2, 1975 until April 11, 1977, a period of almost two years. There was nothing the defendant did that she relied on. She was aware of her rights. She had counsel representing her and apparently relied upon his advice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Even if all credibility doubts are resolved in favor of applicant,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> there is no substantial evidence that applicant\u2019s delay in filing her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits resulted from any intimidation or warnings on the part of her employer. The only evidence of any statements of any kind on the part of the employer is found in the testimony of Samuel Esposito and attorney Jones. Mr. Esposito testified that in a telephone conversation between Mr. Hurwitz and him, Mr. Hurwitz had stated to him that he would resist any workers\u2019 compensation claim by applicant on the ground that her injury did not result from her employment but from her staying in the office to type a term paper for her husband. Mr. Esposito also testified that Mr. Hurwitz also said he \u201cwould be of no other assistance in the other case against the building.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Attorney Jones testified that Mr. Hurwitz said two things to him: \u201cnot to worry about taking the lawsuit\u201d; and \u201cthat if they filed a compensation case[,] to not expect help.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (See fn. 8, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">The only two statements by Mr. Hurwitz that could possibly be deemed intimidating or threatening were: (1) that he would resist a workers\u2019 compensation claim; and (2) that if applicant filed a workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>compensation claim, she could expect no help from him in the third party action. The first cannot possibly be considered any kind of improper threat. It conveyed no more than a rejection of any claim that applicant\u2019s injury was incurred in her employment and notice that if applicant felt she was entitled to any workers\u2019 compensation benefits, she would have to take appropriate legal action to secure them. That very same information must be given an employee under the notice requirements of the administrative director by an employer who rejects a claim for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Hurwitz\u2019 statement to Mr. Esposito, if in fact it was made to Mr. Esposito (see fns. 10 and 11, <em>ante), </em>that he would not assist applicant in her third party action, while perhaps not admirable, was not unlawful nor sinister. It was not as if applicant had an open and shut workers\u2019 compensation claim; there was a serious question as to whether or not her injury arose out of and was incurred in the course of her employment. Mr. Hurwitz was under no legal duty voluntarily to assist her in the third party action. He could, of course, be subpoenaed to appear and testify if his testimony were wanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Turning to the evidence of what Attorney Jones said and did, we first observe that applicant and Board, too, to the extent that it referred to Jones\u2019 actions, overlooked a. rather important circumstance. There is no evidence whatever that in doing or saying anything he did Jones was acting as an agent for the employer or that he and the employer were engaged in a conspiratorial effort to prevent applicant, contrary to her wishes, from filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim. On the contrary, the evidence was that Mr. Jones was applicant\u2019s good friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">If, as applicant testified, Jones informed her that he had some cases in which Mr. Hurwitz was involved and that commencement of a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding against Mr. Hurwitz might put him in a position of conflict, his doing so was commendable, not opprobious. Neither was Mr. Jones blameworthy for relating to applicant, who was then his client, or his prospective client, the statement made, if it was made, by Mr. Hurwitz that they could expect no. help in the third party action. Applicant was entitled to be fully informed, and Attorney Jones was fully privileged to discuss with her his reasons for his tactical suggestions. Finally, if, as applicant claims, Attorney Jones indicated to her that it would be helpful to have Mr. Hurwitz\u2019 cooperation in the third party action, that evaluation could not be said to be wholly without foundation. In addition to being able to testify about giving applicant permission to remain at the office after normal closing hours, Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>Hurwitz might well be able to testify about applicant\u2019s demeanor evidencing pain or discomfort and her disability during the approximately two-week period she worked for him following the accident. If as applicant asserted the building stairway was unlighted, she had a promising third party tort action, and it cannot be said as a matter of law that a decision to pursue that remedy exclusively and thereby avoid whatever complications a workers\u2019 compensation claim would involve was unsound advice. In any event, if Jones misadvised applicant, that is a matter between her and him.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">Perhaps most importantly, applicant did not testify that her delay in filing was in any way caused by intimidation or threats on the part of her employer. The summary of her testimony contains not a single reference to any threat, intimidating statement or other communication to her from Mr. Hurwitz (see fn. 5, <em>ante), </em>and her letter of resignation demonstrates well nigh conclusively that she was not in the least intimidated by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Applicant\u2019s testimony affirmatively establishes that she wanted Attorney Jones to represent her in the third party action and that, relying upon his reasoning and advice, she made a deliberate choice not to pursue her possible workers\u2019 compensation remedy but rather to pursue exclusively her apparently viable tort action. Applicant testified that several months after the telephone conversations between her husband and Mr. Hurwitz, she sought Mr. Jones\u2019 advice. He came to her home where he had a conversation with her and her husband in which Jones stated, \u201cthat he had not been [jzc] able to proceed with [the] civil case in the event [she] were to file a workmen\u2019s compensation case against Mr. Hurwitz.\u201d Applicant was then asked by her attorney: \u201cDid he say why?\u201d After replying in the affirmative, applicant explained: \u201cWell, it would present \u2014I believe this is what he said\u2014a conflict of interest. That was number one. Number two, Mr. Hurwitz was rather adamant about giving me any assistance on my other case and probably would not give me any aid in my other case.\u201d The next question was: \u201cSo then it was his advice that you waive your comp claim in order to obtain the assistance of Mr. Hurwitz in your civil case?\u201d Applicant responded: \u201cAnd also to have Mr. Jones represent me.\u201d Finally, applicant was asked by her attorney: \u201cAs a result of the advice of Mr. Jones, then, you failed to file a workmen\u2019s compensation claim?\u201d She answered: \u201cYes, I did.\u201d After several questions by the court to clarify applicant\u2019s testimony, her attorney again asked her: \u201cAnd as a result of this advice [from Attorney Jones], then did you fail to file a worker\u2019s compensation claim until, I believe it\u2019s, April of this year?\u201d Twice applicant responded: \u201cCorrect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>On cross-examination defendant\u2019s attorney asked applicant: \u201cWell if you felt pressure . . . why didn\u2019t you change attorneys in respect to your civil action at that time?\u201d Applicant responded: \u201cI got to know Mr. Jones fairly well and he also became a good friend. I trusted him implicitly.\u201d She was then asked: \u201cAlthough you felt pressured by what he [Jones] indicated to you about not filing a workmen\u2019s compensation claim?\u201d She answered: \u201cI felt Mr. Jones had my best interests at heart. If Mr. Jones advised me that I should not do it and I wanted him to represent me in my civil matter I would have. I think I knew that he knew what he was talking about. If he knew that he relied on Mr. Hurwitz\u2019 assistance for my civil matter, I would take his best council [j/c], which I did.\u201d Applicant\u2019s testimony in this regard was corroborated by that of Mr. Esposito.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Turning to the estoppel question, Board\u2019s statement is representative of the position of respondents. It states: \u201c. . . Board contends that the statute of limitations was tolled because petitioners failed to comply with their affirmative duty to give respondent Esposito notice of her workers\u2019 compensation rights as required by the <em>Reynolds </em>case. The Board\u2019s position is that <em>Reynolds </em>establishes an absolute requirement for notice on the part of a knowledgable employer except in those limited situations\u201d which are excepted by statute or the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Respondents, and Board in particular, place great emphasis on the 1975 amendment to Labor Code section 5402 which added to the preexisting language of the section the following: \u201cUpon receiving such knowledge [knowledge of an employee\u2019s injury for which he might be entitled to benefits], the employer shall notify the injured employee . . . that he may be entitled to benefits under this division. Such notice by the employer shall be within the time period and in the manner prescribed by the administrative director for such purpose. However, such notice shall not be required when the application for benefits has been filed on behalf of the injured employee, or in the case of death, his dependents.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>(Stats. 1975, ch. 1099, \u00a7 2, pp. 2670-2671.) Labor Code section 138.3 which was added to the code by the same statute that amended section 5402 (Stats. 1975, ch. 1099, \u00a7 1, p. 2670) provides: \u201cThe administrative director shall, with respect to all injuries, prescribe, pursuant to Section 5402, reasonable rules and regulations requiring the employer to serve notice on the injured employee that he may be entitled to benefits under this division.\u201d Labor Code section 138.4 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe administrative director shall, with respect to injuries involving loss of time: [H] (a) Prescribe reasonable rules and regulations for the serving on the employee of reports dealing with the payment or nonpayment of benefits with copies to the administrative director.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">Pursuant to this statutory authority, the administrative director has promulgated rules and regulations concerning the giving of notices, which are found in various sections of title 8 of the California Administrative Code. Section 9816 provides that in every case in which the employer has notice or knowledge of an injury that requires hospitalization or results in disability of more than three days he shall give the injured employee notice of payment or nonpayment of benefits and of termination of benefits. Section 9817 sets out the time period in which the employer is to give notice. Subdivision (d) of section 9817 reads: \u201cNotice of rejection of liability shall be sent upon making the decision to deny liability.\u201d Section 9854 specifies the information that is to be contained in a notice of nonpayment of benefits which includes: \u201cA statement that the employee . . . may contact the Information and Assistance Officer at the Division of Industrial Accidents . . . or . . . may consult an attorney of his or her choice.\u201d Section 9859 specifies the information that must be set forth in a notice of rejection of claim or denial of benefits including: \u201c[a]n unequivocal statement that the claim or benefit is being denied and an explanation of the reason or reasons for denial.\u201d Subdivision 3 of section 9859 reads: \u201cThe following paragraph is mandatory: \u2018If you are not satisfied with this explanation, please contact the Information and Assistance Officer at the (city)_office of the State Division of Industrial Accidents [setting forth his or her name, address and telephone number], and there is no charge for this service, or you may consult an attorney of your choice.\u2019 \u201d Section 9880 provides that an employer \u201cupon receiving knowledge of an injury ... as defined in Labor Code section 3208, or notice or knowledge of a claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>injury sufficient to afford an opportunity to make an investigation into the facts, shall within 5 working days advise the injured employee ... of the benefits to which the employee . . . may be entitled .... The document shall also contain information as to the services of Rehabilitation Consultants and Information and Assistance Officers located in the offices of the Division of Industrial Accidents, Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board, and of the services of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board as final arbiter of claims.\u201d Section 9822 specifies a number of situations not here involved in which the various notices are not required.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The language of the statutes and rules and regulations is mandatory, and respondents are correct that the notices specified are mandatorily required to be given in the circumstances enumerated in the statutes and regulations unless specifically excepted. However, that conclusion does not answer the question presented. The question presented is what is the effect of an employer\u2019s failure to give one or more of the required notices. Applicant and Board contend that regardless of the other facts and circumstances, the consequence is that the employer is estopped to assert the statute of limitations. Their position is that the actual knowledge of the employee and the actual cause for the delay in filing are immaterial. In effect, they contend that the statute of limitations simply does not commence to run until the required notice is given.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Respondents rely primarily on <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 726. In that case an employee suffered a heart attack while at work. The employer was aware of that fact and indeed had an ambulance called to take the employee to the hospital. Because of his heart attack the employee was unable to work for approximately one year. During that year he received unemployment disability compensation and paid all of his own medical expenses. The employee apparently failed to recognize he had a colorable workers\u2019 compensation claim until three years after suffering the heart attack and after the applicable statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>of limitations had run. The Board ruled that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">The Supreme Court annulled the Board\u2019s decision. Noting that the idea that he might be entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits \u201chad apparently not occurred to petitioner\u201d until nearly three years after his heart attack when it was suggested to him by a relative (12 Cal.3d at p. 728) the court held his workers\u2019 compensation claim was not barred by the statute of limitations because the employer had failed to notify him that there was a possibility he would be entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits or to send him an unequivocal statement that it denied he was entitled to benefits as was required by the rules and regulations issued by the administrative director. <em>(Id.) </em>In stating its conclusion, however, the court said: \u201cAs a result, <em>the statute of limitations had not commenced to run at the time petitioner filed his claim.\u201d (Id.) </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Similar language is found in <em>Buena Ventura Gardens </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., </em>49 Cal.App.3d 410 [122 Cal.Rptr. 714], which followed <em>Reynolds. </em>In that case the employee was a housekeeper in an apartment complex. Her work required strenuous physical labor. As a result of her work she began experiencing pain in her chest and legs as well as shortness of breath. Her employer was aware she was experiencing these problems and instructed her husband to take her to a doctor. The employer, however, failed to notify her of her potential fight to workers\u2019 compensation benefits in accordance with the statutory provisions and administrative rules. Eventually she filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim after expiration of the period prescribed by the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">In holding that the employee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim was not barred by the statute of limitations the court stated: \u201c[Employer] had a duty to either give written notice of denial of benefits under Administrative Code section 9859 or written notice that a possible claim might exist under Administrative Code section 9816 <em>in order to commence the running of the statute of limitations. </em>[Employer] did neither. It may not now argue that the statute of limitations ran while [employee] was ignorant of her rights of which it had a duty to advise her. . . .\u201d (49 Cal.App.3d at p. 416; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Similar language is found in <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., </em>19 Cal.3d 329 [137 Cal.Rptr. 878, 562 P.2d 1037], in which the statute of limitations was involved, but the question before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>court was somewhat different. In the opening paragraph in which the court summarized its holding, it said: \u201cConcluding, as we do, that the one-year period commences to run when the potential claimant is notified that the employer and its compensation carrier reject liability under the Act, we will affirm the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board . . . which held the claim was barred because it was filed more than one year after such notice was given.\u201d (19 Cal.3d at pp. 331-332.) We observe, however, that in the substantive portion of the opinion the court twice expressly stated its reasoning to be that the statute of limitations began to run \u201cno later\u201d than the date on which notice was given. (19 Cal.3d at pp. 335, 336.)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Apparently it is upon the language quoted above from these opinions that respondents rely. In so doing they misinterpret these precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Notwithstanding the language used, we are unable to accept that the courts literally meant that the statute of limitations does not commence to run until the notice prescribed by the administrative director has been given. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act specifies in unusual detail the precise events which commence the running of the statute of limitations. (See Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5404-5412.) In the case at bench since no occupational disease or cumulative injury is involved and no benefits were furnished, the applicable statutory provision prescribes that the period of limitations commences on \u201c[t]he date of injury.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5405, subd. (a).) Although notice to the injured employee is specifically required by statute (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5402) and the administrative director is authorized by statute to prescribe rules and regulations concerning the giving of notice (Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 138.3, 138.4), the statutes neither provide nor suggest that the event which commences the running of the statute of limitations is other than that prescribed in the applicable statutory provision. Neither the administrative director nor a court is at liberty to disregard the event specified by the statute and designate a different event as commencing the running of the period of limitations. And we decline to ascribe to the <em>Reynolds </em>and <em>Buena Ventura </em>courts the intention of doing that.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">However, the doctrine of equitable estoppel or estoppel in pais is an accepted jurisprudential technique of long standing for avoiding the effect of the running of the statute of limitations when the delay in instituting proceedings has resulted from some breach of duty or other conduct on the part of the party asserting the statute. And it has frequently been applied in workers\u2019 compensation proceedings. <em>(Benner </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>26 Cal.2d 346, 349-350 [159 P.2d 24]; <em>Nolan </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., </em>70 Cal.App.3d 122, 129-130 [138 Cal.Rptr. 561]; <em>Industrial Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Ind.

It is our conclusion that the true basis of the <em>Reynolds </em>and <em>Buena Ventura </em>decisions was equitable estoppel.  The rule they establish is that when an employer has the requisite notice or knowledge of an employee\u2019s injury as to which there is a reasonable possibility the employee may be entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the employer has a duty to notify the employee of the potential right to benefits, and if the employer fails to do so, and if as a consequence the employee fails to file an application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits until after the applicable period of limitations has expired, the employer is estopped to assert the statute of limitations for a period of time equal to the delay resulting from the failure to give the required notice. (Also cf. <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 336.) A more precise use of language by the courts should have indicated not that the statutory period had not commenced to run, but that the employers were estopped to assert it had run or, perhaps, commenced to run.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">Our conclusion that the <em>Reynolds </em>and <em>Buena Ventura </em>decisions are founded on the doctrine of equitable estoppel derives not only from our belief that that is the only sound legal basis upon which the decisions could have been predicated, but, also, from a number of other considerations.  The precedential import of a case cannot be accurately determined without reference to its facts. In both <em>Reynolds </em>and <em>Buena Ventura </em>the employees were ignorant of their potential rights under the workers\u2019 compensation law, and in each case the court expressly took note of and placed reliance upon that fact. (See 12 Cal.3d at pp. 729, 728; 49 Cal.App.3d at p. 416.)</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The rationale of the <em>Reynolds </em>case is found in its statement of the purpose of the administrative director\u2019s rules and regulations concerning notice: \u201cThe clear purpose of these rules is to protect and preserve the rights of an injured employee <em>who may be ignorant of the procedures or, indeed, the very existence of the workmen\u2019s compensation law. </em>Since the employer is generally in a better position to be aware of the employee\u2019s rights, it is proper that he should be charged with responsibility of notifying the employee, <em>under circumstances such as those existing here </em>[e.g., where the employee was ignorant of the possible industrial nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>his injury], that there is a possibility he may have a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits.\u201d (12 Cal.3d at p. 729; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Perhaps even more conclusively, the only precedent cited by the court in <em>Reynolds </em>for its holding that the employer was not permitted to raise the defense of the statute of limitations was <em>Mihesuah </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals. Bd., </em>29 Cal.App.3d 337, 340-341 [105 Cal.Rptr. 561]. The <em>Mihesuah </em>decision at the pages cited by the <em>Reynolds </em>court commences with the heading \u201cEstoppel.\u201d Beneath the heading, in dicta, the court indicated that in all probability its decision that the applicant\u2019s claim was not barred by the statute of limitations could also be reached on the basis of equitable estoppel. (29 Cal.App.3d at pp. 340-341.)</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">In <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at page 335, the Supreme Court clearly indicated its conclusion that the <em>Reynolds </em>decision was based on estoppel. It said: \u201cFinding the employee\u2019s claim timely filed for this reason, the <em>Mihesuah </em>court further held that it was not required to consider the alternative argument (later accepted by us in <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 726 [117 Cal.Rptr. 79, 527 P.2d 631]) that the employer was <em>estopped </em>from asserting the statute of limitations because of its failure to notify the employee of the fact that the employer considered the injury as nonindustrial.\u201d (Orig. italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">We note also that the Board itself both in its opinions and decisions at issue in the case at bench and in its response to the petition for writ of review constantly refers to the <em>Reynolds </em>decision as having been that the employer was estopped to assert the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Having identified the legal basis for the <em>Reynolds </em>and <em>Buena Ventura </em>decisions as the doctrine of equitable estoppel, the resolution of the dispute in the case at bench is not difficult.  It is universally recognized that prerequisites to applicability of the doctrine of equitable estoppel are that the party asserting the estoppel must have been ignorant of the true facts and must have relied upon the words or conduct of the adverse party to his or her detriment. <em>(Neff </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins.

Com., supra, </em>204 Cal.App.2d at p. 278.)</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">The evidence in the case at bench establishes that applicant was aware from the beginning that her injury might be job related and that she might be entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Not later than two months after the date of injury, she was aware that to seek workers\u2019 compensation benefits she must institute proceedings within one year after the date of injury. She was fully aware that her employer rejected and would resist any claim that her injury arose out of and in the course of her employment. She engaged an attorney to file a third party tort action on her behalf and discussed with her attorney the workers\u2019 compensation aspects of the case. Based on the tactical evaluations and advice of her attorney, who was also her friend, applicant made a deliberate decision not to file an application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits but, rather, exclusively to pursue her third party tort remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Thus applicant was not ignorant of the true facts and her delay in filing an application for adjudication of claim was not caused by the employer\u2019s failure to give the required notice or notices. The doctrine of equitable estoppel is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The decisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board are annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Tamura, Acting P. J., and McDaniel, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-6\"> In pertinent part the opinion and decision after reconsideration read: \u201cUpon review of the facts of this case and the law pertaining thereto, the Board finds merit in applicant\u2019s argument. Applicant alleges that subsequent to her claimed May 2, 1975, industrial injury, she hired an attorney, Jack Jones, to represent her in a third-party case. She contends this attorney told her that he would not proceed in her third-party case if she filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim in relation to her May 2, 1975, injury. He informed her that he was involved in other cases to which defendant employer herein was a party and that if applicant proceeded on a workers\u2019 compensation claim, conflict would result. Applicant\u2019s husband testified at the November 14, 1977, hearing that he had occasion to engage in two telephone conversations with defendant employer in which he claims defendant employer informed him that he, defendant employer, would oppose any workers\u2019 compensation claim applicant might file in relation to her injury. He also testified that applicant\u2019s attorney, Mr. Jones, informed him that Mr. Jones believed defendant employer\u2019s assistance was necessary in applicant\u2019s third-party case. Applicant submits that as a result of the advice of her attorney and the threats and warnings of defendant employer, she delayed filing an Application for Adjudication of Claim until April 11, 1977. Applicant contends that given the circumstances of this case, the statute of limitations should not act as a bar to her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag0\">\u201cIn reviewing the record of this case, the Board notes that the evidence does not indicate that defendant employer complied with the Rules and Regulations of the Administrative Director, sections 9816, 9817, 9859 and 9880 which set the notice requirements applicable to an employer of an injured employee. Those sections require an employer to notify an injured employee of that employee\u2019s possible right to workers\u2019 compensation benefits and/or the employer\u2019s intention to deny liability for such benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"AOGs\">\u201cIn <em>Reynolds vs. WCAB </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 726, 39 CCC 768, the California Supreme Court held that an employer is estopped to assert the statute of limitations as a defense to an employee\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits where that employer has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>knowledge of a possible workers\u2019 compensation claim and fails to notify the employee of his possible right to workers\u2019 compensation benefits or the employer\u2019s denial of liability for such benefits. &lt;\u00ab</p>\n<p id=\"AYjF\">\u201cApplying these principles to the instant case, it would appear that since defendant employer had both notice and knowledge of applicant\u2019s alleged injury, defendant employer was under a mandatory obligation to inform applicant of her rights or to issue a disclaimer of liability or notice of nonpayment of benefits. The record indicates that defendant employer failed to fulfill this duty. Under <em>Reynolds, </em>defendant is, therefore, now estopped to raise the statute of limitations as defense. Consequently, we will issue a decision amending the Findings and Order filed February 9, 1978, accordingly and return this case to the trial level for hearing and decision on all issued [szc: issues] presented.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b724-10\"> So far as we have discerned there is no evidence in the record as to whether defendants did or did not give the required notice or notices. Perhaps that is due to the fact that, except for an obscure reference to the <em>Reynolds </em>decision in points and authorities filed by applicant, there was apparently no mention of the notice problem at the trial court level. Indeed, applicant\u2019s petition for reconsideration did not mention any failure on the part of defendants to give the proper notices. However, the <em>Reynolds </em>decision was again mentioned in the points and authorities filed by applicant in support of her petition for reconsideration. Since the parties make no issue of these matters and have proceeded on the premise that the required notice or notices were not given and that the question of lack of notice is properly in issue, we give no consideration to the questions that might otherwise have been presented by these circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b725-6\"> Citing <em>Argonaut Ins.

In her third party case she first hired an attorney, Jack Jones. He told her that he would not procede [.w'c] in the civil case if she filed a compensation claim. He said that this would create a conflict. Attorney Jones had other cases with the defendant employer. She knew she could file a compensation case.
