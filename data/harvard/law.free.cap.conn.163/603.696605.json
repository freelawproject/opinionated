The allegations in the complaint, as related to Homestead, recited that this defendant claimed to have an interest by virtue of a mechanic\u2019s lien in the property being foreclosed. By judgment of strict foreclosure dated November 20, 1970, the trial court, in addition to determining priorities among the named defendants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>found that Homestead\u2019s lien was invalid by virtue of a signed waiver of its mechanic\u2019s lien rights. On December 10, 1970, Homestead filed a motion to \u201creopen\u201d the judgment in which it alleged that on November 20, 1970, the trial court heard motions for judgment by strict foreclosure and to determine priorities; that the court ruled .that certain documents signed by Homestead constituted waivers of its mechanic\u2019s lien; that these documents were intended to be and were waivers of priority as to the first mortgagee; and that the judgment of the court was reached without Homestead \u201chaving the opportunity to present evidence as to the nature and intent \u25a0of said documents and their effect on the priorities.\u201d On December 18, 1970, the motion was denied. On January 5, 1971, Homestead appealed to this court from the judgment of strict foreclosure and the order of priorities entered therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Homestead\u2019s assignments of error are directed to the court\u2019s \u201cfinding\u201d that certain documents executed by Homestead were absolute waivers of lien rather than waivers of priority; in its refusal to grant Homestead an opportunity to present evidence as to the nature and intent of those documents and in refusing to \u201creopen\u201d the judgment for that purpose; and in its refusal to qualify the judgment by omitting certain language from the judgment. On February 11, 1971, Homestead filed written notice with the clerk of the Superior Court that it had \u201cdecided to abandon all phases of the appeal which would require a finding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">As in the case before us, where error is claimed in the court\u2019s rulings on evidence and its conclusions of law or fact that do not appear on the face of the record, a finding is essential. Practice Book \u00a7 609; <em>Saraceno </em>v. <em>Capitol Theatre Realty Corporation, </em>154 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Conn. 669, 672-73, 228 A.2d 507; <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>153 Conn. 713, 714, 216 A.2d 182; <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Spangle, </em>151 Conn. 709, 710, 200 A.2d 487; <em>Gitlitz </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>146 Conn. 280, 281, 150 A.2d 213; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 126. Homestead did not file either a request for a finding or a draft finding. Consequently no finding was made. \u201cWe can decide the merits of an appeal only on the record presented. <em>State </em>v. <em>Keating, </em>151 Conn. 592, 595, 200 A.2d 724.\u201d <em>Wooster </em>v. <em>Wm. C. A. Fischer Plumbing &amp; Heating Co., </em>153 Conn. 700, 703, 220 A.2d 449. The only facts of record in the case at bar are those which appear from the pleadings and the judgment. See <em>Gitlitz </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra. No pleadings in response to the allegations made in the complaint appear in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The judgment recites that all the defendants were defaulted for failure to disclose a defense and that the court found that Homestead\u2019s certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien was invalid and did not entitle it to any priority or right of redemption by virtue of having signed a waiver of its mechanic\u2019s lien rights. Without the subordinate facts on which the court based its rulings and conclusions, we are in no position to do other than affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
