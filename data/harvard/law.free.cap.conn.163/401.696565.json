It is the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the defendant\u2019s predecessor, the administrator of the Unemployment Compensation Act of the state of Connecticut, erroneously interpreted and applied \u00a7 31-226 of the General Statutes, Revision of 1958, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>as amended, in computing the plaintiff\u2019s tax or unemployment contribution rate for the years 1968 and 1969, resulting in the determination of an erroneous tax or contribution rate for the plaintiff and in the payment by the plaintiff of excess taxes in those years.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">At the request of the parties, the case was reserved pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-235 for the advice of this court and for an answer to each of nine questions. Only those questions we find relevant to a disposition of this case are set forth in the footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The facts as contained in the .stipulation between the parties, and the summary of facts in the plaintiff\u2019s brief which are not in dispute, may he stated as follows: The plaintiff is a Delaware corporation with an office and principal place of business in East Hartford, Connecticut. During the years 1968 and 1969 it was subject to the provisions of the Connecti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>cut Unemployment Compensation Act. The defendant is the duly appointed and qualified administrator of the Unemployment Compensation Act and as such is charged with its administration. '</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Each employer subject to .the unemployment compensation law is required under \u00a7 31-225 (a) to pay a tax equal to 2.7 percent of the wages paid by it with respect to employment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> subject to any applicable adjustment in tbe rate of contribution as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>provided in \u00a7 31-226.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 31-226, if, on June thirtieth, of any year, the balance in the unemployment compensation fund is at least 1.25 percent of the total state payroll for the three-year period ending on June 30, the defendant is required to adjust the rate of contributions. When an adjustment is made the employer will pay a tax measured by the adjusted rate rather than the base rate of 2.7 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Tiie amount of the downward adjustment of each employer is determined, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-226, by computing a merit rating index for each of the eligible employers with respect to the whole three-year period ending on June 30. The merit rating index is the quotient obtained by dividing the experience payroll of a particular employer by the total unemployment benefit paid as a result of compensable separations charged to the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Section 31-226 (b) provides that the defendant then divide the total of the experience payrolls of all employers with a merit rating index into thirteen approximately equal parts, with the first of these parts consisting of the experience payrolls of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>employers with the lowest (or worst) merit rating indexes, and the thirteenth of these parts consisting of the experience payrolls of those employers with the highest (or best) merit rating indexes. The payrolls of the other employers would then be divided among the intervening parts according to their merit rating indexes. If the division of the total of the experience payrolls into thirteen exactly equal parts would require that an employer\u2019s payroll be divided between two of the parts, then his payroll would be included in the lower numbered merit rating and the employer would be taxed at the higher rate, as set forth in \u00a7 31-226 (b) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The statute sots forth a tax table establishing the contribution rate applicable to employers in each of the thirteen parts. The portion of this table applicable for the years 1968 and 1969 is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Merit Rating Part Rate</p>\n<p id=\"ASJ\">1 2.7%</p>\n<p id=\"Az5\">2 2.55</p>\n<p id=\"Ayb\">3 2.4</p>\n<p id=\"A-0A\">4 2.25</p>\n<p id=\"AjD\">5 2.1</p>\n<p id=\"ABa\">6 1.95</p>\n<p id=\"AXg\">7 1.8</p>\n<p id=\"AZ0\">8 1.65</p>\n<p id=\"Ait\">9 1.5</p>\n<p id=\"A4gJ\">10 1.35</p>\n<p id=\"AyS\">11 1.2</p>\n<p id=\"ACJ\">12 1.05</p>\n<p id=\"AHb\">13 .9</p>\n<p id=\"Abp\">In 1968 the total experience payroll of all employers under the plan was $7,727,645,871. To arrive at thirteen approximately equal parts, the defendant first divided the total payroll into thirteen exactly equal parts, with each part containing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>$594,434,298. The employers with the lowest merit rating were taxed at the rate applicable to merit rating part one, or 2.7 percent. The employers with the lowest rating were placed in part one until that merit rating equaled $594,434,298; the employers with the next lowest merit rating index would then be placed in merit rating two until that equaled $594,434,298. This procedure would continue until the entire experience payroll for the state had been placed, subject to the adjustment of contribution rates in accordance with \u00a7 31-226 (b) of the General Statutes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">In 1968, the plaintiff\u2019s experience payroll was $658,195,373. After dividing the total of the experience payrolls into thirteen approximately equal parts, the plaintiff\u2019s experience payroll would have been spread among merit ratings nine, ten, and eleven, falling into the merit rating parts as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AMi\">Amount of Merit Bating Plaintiff\u2019s Payroll Contribution</p>\n<p id=\"APV\">Part in the Part Bate</p>\n<p id=\"AOo\">9 $ 63,746,940 1.5%</p>\n<p id=\"A2ea\">10 594,434,298 1.35</p>\n<p id=\"AHJ\">11 14,134 1.2</p>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 3L226 (b) (4), the defendant allocated the entire experience payroll of the plaintiff to merit rating nine, thus requiring the plaintiff to pay the contribution rate of 1.5 percent, the highest of the three rates for the parts into which the payroll fell. In taxing the plaintiff in this manner no payroll of any employer was allocated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>merit rating part ten because the plaintiff\u2019s payroll took up this category and under statutory direction the administrator placed the employer\u2019s payroll in the lower number, viz. nine.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">In the year 1969, the total experience payrolls of all employers with a merit rating index was $8,354,563,157 and this was divided into thirteen approximately equal parts of $642,658,704. The plaintiff\u2019s total experience payroll for 1969 was $749,040,786. The payrolls were assigned to the thirteen parts based on the employer\u2019s merit rating index and the plaintiff\u2019s payroll, once again, fell among parts nine, ten and eleven as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AfHq\">Amount of Merit Rating Plaintiff\u2019s Payroll Contribution</p>\n<p id=\"AqG5\">Part in the Part Rate</p>\n<p id=\"AfI\">9 $ 90,539,151 1.5%</p>\n<p id=\"AhMY\">10 642,658,704 1.35</p>\n<p id=\"AvT\">11 15,842,931 1.2</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">The defendant then allocated the plaintiff\u2019s entire payroll to part nine and taxed the entire experience payroll at 1.5 percent. As was the ease in 1968, no payroll was allocated to merit rating part ten because the plaintiff\u2019s payroll exceeded one part and took up all of category ten.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">The plaintiff duly notified the defendant of its claim that he had erred in his interpretation of \u00a7 31-226 (b) for the purpose of determining the contribution rate for the plaintiff for the years 1968 and 1969. The plaintiff requested that the defendant correct the allocation made with respect to its experience payroll for 1968 and 1969 and refund to the plaintiff the amounts by which it had overpaid the taxes. The defendant refused to alter the allocation made under \u00a7 31-226 (b), or to refund to the plaintiff any alleged overpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>The plaintiff argues, in the first instance, that the words of \u00a7 31-226 (b) (4) are clear and unambiguous and that they do not cover the situation where the experience payroll of a single employer is initially divided among more than two parts. Later in its brief, however, it states that the absence of an express provision covering the present situation in which a payroll falls into three parts \u201cmay arguably render the statute ambiguous as it applies to the plaintiff\u201d in the years in question and in that event the statute should be construed in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The Unemployment Compensation Act was first enacted at a special session of the General Assembly in 1936. The particular provision before us was added as an amendment in 1939, \u00a7 1337e, and appears in the 1939 Supplement to the 1930 Revision of the General Statutes. The primary purpose of the act is to relieve the distress of unemployment; it is remedial in character; and it is to be liberally construed. <em>New Haven Market Exchange, Inc. </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>139 Conn. 709, 712, 97 A.2d 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\"When \u00a7 31-226 (b) (4) of the act was enacted in 1939 no single employ er was large enough so that its experience payroll was likely to be divided among more than two parts. The statutory language in question is clear and describes a specifically delineated procedure which admits of no ambiguities. We cannot \u201csearch out some intent which we may believe the legislature actually had and give effect to it, . . . we are confined to the intention which is expressed in the words it has used.\u201d <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>134 Conn. 295, 301, 57 A.2d 128. The intention of the legislature, expressed in the language it uses, is the controlling factor and the application of common sense to the language is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>to be excluded. <em>Knoll </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>142 Conn. 592, 594, 115 A.2d 678. There is no room for statutory construction where the legislative intent is clear; <em>Hartford Hospital </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>160 Conn. 370, 376, 279 A.2d 561; and the legislature clearly expressed what it intended to mean at the time the legislation was adopted. There is no ambiguity. The scheme and plan of the Unemployment Compensation Act is plain. The entire enactment must be examined and its parts reconciled and made operative so far as possible. <em>Garbaty </em>v. <em>Norwalk Jewish Center, Inc., </em>148 Conn. 376, 382, 171 A.2d 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The defendant is required to compute the tax liability for each of several thousand employers subject to the unemployment compensation law in accordance with standards and procedures set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 31-226. The establishment of the plaintiff\u2019s rates for the years in question affected the establishment of the rates of contribution of the other employers subject to the provisions of the act. A reading of the statutes makes it readily apparent that the legislature was aware of the complicated and technical nature of the method for fixing the rates of contribution to the fund. The tax or contribution is based on the balance in the trust fund and the employers\u2019 employee turnover experience. Most of the employers\u2019 payrolls fall into one of the thirteen parts; some payrolls spread into two. Section 31-226 (b) (4) in effect in 1968 and 1969 expressly provided for this eventuality so that the whole payroll, in such a ease, must be placed in the lower part, which imposes the higher tax. For the first time in the history of the unemployment compensation law, however, the plaintiff\u2019s payroll spread over three parts in 1968 and 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The defendant, as administrator of the act, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>required to carry out a number of steps under the law as part of his administration of the act. He must first determine the fund balance in proportion to the three-year payroll of all employers subject to the law and then, in fixing a merit rating status for any employer within the act, he must compute a merit rating index for each employer who has been subject to the act during a so-called experience period, which is the three-year period next before June 30 in the year in which the computation is made. This is followed by a division of the experience payrolls into approximately equal parts. It is noted that the word approximately is used. The experience payrolls are placed thereafter in parts as follows: The lowest rating index is placed in the first part or at the highest tax rate; the highest rating indexes are placed in the thirteenth part<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or at the minimum rate; any other part consists of the experience payrolls of employers whose merit rating indexes are lower than the merit rating indexes of all employers whose experience payrolls are included in any higher numbered part. Under the steps set forth in \u00a7 31-226 (a) and the then applicable provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 31-226 (b) (1), (2), (3), the administrator is directed to divide the total of experience payrolls into thirteen approximately equal parts; there is no directive to place a payroll or payrolls into all of the parts in the third step of the taxing procedure. Only the first (subject to one exception) and the thirteenth parts are specifically mentioned in subdivisions (1), (2) and (3) of the then \u00a7 31-226 (b). The mentioning of these specific parts requiring specific placement into those parts, namely, the first and thirteenth, is significant. If the legislature intended that each of the thirteen parts would be filled, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>in the third procedural step, the statute, which is otherwise very specific, would have so stated. The thirteen approximately equal parts mentioned in the statute are merely a preliminary calculation modified by the fourth step toward the ultimate computation of the tax. When we reach the fourth step, namely, subdivision (4) of $ 31-226 (b), in effect in 1968 and 1969, we see not a directive to divide the experience payrolls into exactly equal parts, but a subjunctive provision, that is, the proposition that if a certain act provides a given result, then the next step shall be taken in a specified manner. The fourth step of exact division is, therefore, decidedly different from the earlier step of the approximate division. The sole purpose of the division in the fourth step is to determine the payroll spread. The division into thirteen exactly equal parts does not carry with it a direction to impose a tax at each of the thirteen steps but only to determine a payroll spread. The payroll spread determination, therefore, brings in the next step in the imposition of the tax: the placing of an entire payroll, previously spread, into a single part for the purpose of assessing a tax higher than would be assessed under another system. The aggregate experience payroll was divided into thirteen parts as provided by law. The law does not provide that the parts shall be equal after the allocation of employer merit rating index numbers. The law provides that the allocation of the employer merit rating index numbers may cause a part to be unequal if an employer\u2019s payroll would have to be divided between two parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Section 31-226 (b) (4) does not specifically describe the situation where an employer\u2019s payroll falls into three merit rating parts and there are three possible tax rates. It would apply, however, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>this situation since it requires that in dividing the experience payroll into thirteen parts if a payroll falls between two of the parts it will be placed in the lower. Manifestly, any payroll which falls into three parts must fall into two parts. To hold otherwise would be to construe the statute as excluding payrolls falling into more than two parts and therefore negating \u00a7 31-226 (b) (4) entirely. The court may not supply a statutory failure to mention the unanticipated situation in express terms merely because the court feels good reason so exists; the remedy in such a situation lies with the General Assembly, not the court. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Mars, </em>138 Conn. 593, 598, 87 A.2d 388; <em>State ex rel. Heimov </em>v. <em>Thomson, </em>131 Conn. 8, 12, 37 A.2d 689. The statute simply delineates a procedure for applying one of two possible tax rates. The fact that three possible tax rates might be involved does not warrant a finding that the legislature did not intend \u00a7 31-226 (b) (4) to cover the situation as to two of the parts. We must avoid an absurd consequence so as to attain a rational and sensible result which bears most directly on the object which the legislative body sought to obtain; <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>142 Conn. 634, 644, 116 A.2d 508; and give effect to the obvious and express object of the statute which contemplated the eventuality where a portion of an employer\u2019s payroll fell into two parts even though no express statutory attention was given to a situation involving an additional third part of that payroll. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Vaill, </em>158 Conn. 478, 483, 262 A.2d 169. In this particular situation the enactment should be construed as nearly as may be in harmony with the purpose and the reasons on which it rests. As this court has stated: \u201cAll of the rates of all the employers must be set at a level that will produce a tax return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>sufficient to maintain the integrity of the funds.\u201d <em>Allen Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>139 Conn. 402, 407, 94 A.2d 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The only express provision that the .statute lacked was a specific instruction as to where to place an employer\u2019s payroll which spreads among more than two parts. The express provision when the payroll spread over two parts which had been used in the past provided for an acceptable, uniform and workable standard in administration and tax computation even though its practical effect results in circumstances in which the thirteen parts are no longer equal. See <em>Muller </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>145 Conn. 325, 331, 142 A.2d 524; <em>Allen Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>supra, 412. In such a case the wisdom of the above result is not a matter for consideration by this court. Taxation is \u201ceminently, practical.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>306 U.S. 363, 370, 59 S. Ct. 551, 83 L. Ed. 763. The court cannot read something into a statute to reach a just result nor can it substitute its judgment of what would constitute a wiser provision for the clearly expressed intent of the legislature. <em>Dental Commission </em>v. <em>Tru-Fit Plastics, Inc., </em>159 Conn. 362, 365, 269 A.2d 265. In such a case the administrator must follow the statutory directive as closely as possible, consistent with the clear intent of the law, so as to afford employers similarly circumstanced equal protection of the law. Statutes relating to taxation are not penal, nor in derogation of natural right, and are to be so construed as to carry into effect the obvious intent of the legislature. <em>Cornwall </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>38 Conn. 443, 447. Had the plaintiff\u2019s payroll fallen into all or a portion of the ninth part and all of the tenth part, with no portion in the eleventh part, the allocation of the entire payroll to the ninth part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>would have been mandatory under the statute and no payroll of any employer could have been assigned to the tenth part. That a construction of a statute might in exceptional cases work to the disadvantage of a taxpayer who may be affected does not justify a construction violating an expressed intent of the legislature. <em>Savings Bank of Rockville </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>117 Conn. 188, 195, 167 A. 709. Taxing the entire payroll at the highest rate might be deemed unjust or inequitable; any change, however, must necessarily rest with the General Assembly.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is a legislative, not a judicial, function to reduce the hardships resulting from a statute. <em>Second National Bank of New Haven </em>v. <em>Loftus, </em>121 Conn. 454, 459, 185 A. 423. Adopting the solutions which the plaintiff proposes would thwart the plan and scheme of the legislation and defeat the clear intent of the legislature when it enacted the act and the amendments thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Since \u00a7 31-226 (b) (4) does apply to the plaintiff\u2019s payroll for the years 1968 and 1969, and the plaintiff\u2019s payroll did fall between merit rating parts nine and ten, the portion of the plaintiff\u2019s payroll falling into merit rating part ten must be placed in merit rating part nine and taxed at the corresponding rate pursuant to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The portion of the plaintiff\u2019s payroll falling into merit rating eleven in 1968 and 1969 should remain therein and be taxed at the corresponding rate of 1.2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>percent. The initial division of the experience payrolls for all employers under \u00a7 31-226 (b) (1) resulted in the assignment of $14,134 in 1968 and $15,842,931 in 1969 of the plaintiff\u2019s payroll to merit rating eleven. The tax rates for such sums would be at the corresponding rate of 1.2 percent unless subsection (b) (4) operated to force the payroll into a higher merit rating part. We have applied \u00a7 31-226 (b) (4) to that portion of the plaintiff\u2019s payroll falling into merit rating part ten, but we conclude that this section does not apply to that portion of the plaintiff\u2019s payroll falling into merit rating eleven. Section 31-226 (b) (4) specifically states that the payroll must be placed in the lower numbered of the two parts. The use of the comparative form, lower, in \u00a7 31-226 (b) (4) and the failure of the legislature to specifically authorize consecutive application of subsection (b) (4) to a single payroll precludes concluding that subsection (b) (4) applies to the portion of the plaintiff\u2019s payroll falling into merit rating eleven.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Since subsection (b) (4) does not apply to the portion of the plaintiff\u2019s payroll falling into merit rating part eleven, the commissioner was without authority in placing that portion of the payroll into merit rating nine. The administrator cannot act beyond the statutory scheme by which he is empowered to act. <em>Hammerberg </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>131 Conn. 616, 621, 41 A.2d 771; <em>DeFlumeri </em>v. <em>Sunderland, </em>109 Conn. 583, 585, 145 A. 48. The portion of the plaintiff\u2019s payroll falling into merit rating eleven in 1968 and 1969, therefore, was unaffected by subsection (b) (4) and must remain taxable at the rate determined by the initial division of the experience payroll into thirteen parts as determined by \u00a7 31-226 (b) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The Unemployment Compensation Act pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 31-268 and 31-269 requires, in the event of an overpayment of a contribution, that the administrator shall make an adjustment either by means of a reduction in future contributions or through a refund.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The administrator did not make an adjustment pursuant to \u00a7 31-268; therefore, a refund must be made to the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 31-269. <em>Allen Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>139 Conn. 402, 411, 94 A.2d 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The answer to questions one and four propounded in the reservation is that the portion of the plaintiff\u2019s payroll falling into merit rating parts nine and ten for the years 1968 and 1969 was properly placed in merit rating part nine and taxed at 1.5 percent; that portion of the plaintiff\u2019s payroll falling into merit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>rating eleven for tbe years 1968 and 1969, $14,134 and $15,842,931 respectively, remain's in merit rating eleven and is taxed at 1.2 percent; the item relating to interest contained in question four is not answered since it was neither briefed nor argued to this court. Reference is made, however, to \u00a7 31-269, inter alia.
