Based on the record below, the answer in this case is real property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant appeals the judgment entered after a jury found him guilty of breaking and entering, larceny after breaking and entering, possession of stolen property, and willful and wanton injury to real property. On appeal, defendant contends that: (1) the trial court erred in failing to strike the victim's testimony that \"other witnesses\" saw defendant outside her home on the day the air-conditioner was damaged; (2) the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to dismiss the injury to real property charge because there was insufficient evidence that the air-conditioner was real property; (3) the trial court erred by instructing the jury that the air-conditioner constituted real property; (4) the restitution order requiring defendant to pay $7,408.91 was not supported by evidence; and (5) defendant is entitled to a new sentencing hearing because it is unclear whether the trial court based his sentence on defendant's conviction for felony possession of stolen goods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After careful review, we conclude that defendant received a trial free of error but remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 25 July 2011, Zulema Bass (\"Ms. Bass\") arrived home and noticed that her mobile home was hot inside even though the air-conditioner was on. After hearing a loud noise outside, she asked her fifteen-year-old son Brendell Bass (\"Brendell\") to investigate. Brendell went to the back door and began screaming that a man was out there. Ms. Bass ran to the door and saw a man riding away on a bicycle; she only saw half of the man's face and was unable to identify him. Ms. Bass went outside and saw that the air-conditioning unit was \"demolished\" and noticed a twisted pipe on the ground beside the unit. She also noticed that there was extensive water damage under her home from \"pipes leaking everywhere.\" Ms. Bass called 911. The State did not elicit any identification testimony from Ms. Bass regarding whether the man she saw that day was defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Ms. Bass about her inability to identify defendant to police officers. Ms. Bass responded that she could not identify him because she \"did not see his whole face ... when [defendant] was riding off.\" Defense counsel then asked: \"So you can't tell this jury that it was [defendant] that was outside your home that day; is that correct?\" Ms. Bass replied: \"That was him, because I had\n   other witnesses that saw him go on the bicycle in the woods, and my-also my son was there.\" Defense counsel immediately objected that the answer was nonresponsive and requested that her answer be stricken from the record. The trial court overruled the objection. Ms. Bass did not offer any further testimony clarifying her statement about \"other witnesses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Brendell also testified at trial that, after hearing \"loud\" noises, he saw a man coming out of the crawlspace beneath their home holding copper wire and went out to confront him. At trial, he identified defendant as the man he had seen and confronted. Brendell testified that once defendant heard him yell, defendant threw the copper wire on the ground beside a tree. Before Brendell was able to answer the State's question as to whether he had ever seen defendant before, defense counsel objected, and the trial court excused the jury to determine whether Brendell's testimony was \"objectionable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During\n   <em>\n    voir dire,\n   </em>\n   Brendell testified that he had seen defendant around the neighborhood about four or five times, including one particular incident where he saw defendant take a refrigerator out of another house in the neighborhood. The trial court allowed Brendell to testify to the jury that he had seen defendant around the neighborhood, but did not allow any testimony concerning the refrigerator incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Detective Parchman, the officer who responded to the 911 call from the mobile home, corroborated Brendell's testimony, claiming that Brendell identified the man he saw as defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Jack Gregory (\"Mr. Gregory\"), a handyman with 40 years of experience, testified that he went to Ms. Bass's mobile home to inspect and attempt to repair the air-conditioner. Mr. Gregory explained that Ms. Bass's air-conditioner was a two-piece unit. The outside unit was a condensing unit, which sat on the ground outside the mobile home and is connected to a second unit. The second unit, known as the A-coil, was located on the inside of the home and sat on the top of the home's heater. A high pressure copper pipe beneath the mobile home connected the outside unit to the indoor A-coil. Mr. Gregory testified that Ms. Bass's outside condensing unit had been completely \"gutted.\" The compressor had been completely removed, and the wiring in the control box had been pulled out. Almost the entire high pressure copper piping that ran beneath the home had been removed. Mr. Gregory also noted some water line damage in the crawlspace of the mobile home; the water lines were broken so extensively that the entire back side of the brick wall on the underpinning was \"soaked through.\" The air-conditioner was inoperable and beyond repair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Dale Davis (\"Mr. Davis\") testified that he owned the mobile home but used it as a rental property. He testified that he had received an estimate of over $6,000 to repair \"just the AC\" from Jackson &amp; Sons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the end of the State's evidence, defense counsel made a motion to dismiss the injury to real property charge because the air-conditioning unit \"would be more better described as personal property\" since part of it was outside of the mobile home's crawlspace. The trial court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During jury instructions, the trial court instructed the jury on the charge of injury to real property as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The [d]efendant has also been charged with willful and wanton injury to real property. For you to find the [d]efendant guilty of this offense the State must prove two things beyond a reasonable doubt:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   First, that the [d]efendant injured the air conditioner of Dale Davis. An air conditioner affixed to a house is real property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   And second, that the [d]efendant did this willfully and wantonly[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The jury found defendant guilty of all charges. Before judgment was entered, defendant pled guilty to attaining habitual felon status in exchange for the State's recommendation of a mitigated sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On 14 February 2012, the trial court sentenced defendant to 77 months to 102 months imprisonment and ordered defendant to pay $7,408.91 in restitution. The restitution amount was based on the amount Mr. Davis paid to Mr. Gregory to inspect the air-conditioner and fix the water pipes, $918.91, and\n   an estimate from Jackson &amp; Sons to replace the \"heat pump\" for $6,490.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On the same day as judgment was entered but after sentencing defendant, the trial court arrested judgment on defendant's conviction for possession of stolen goods. The trial court did not modify defendant's sentence. Defendant appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Victim's Testimony Regarding \"Other\" Witnesses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant first argues that the trial court erred by overruling defense counsel's objection and motion to strike Ms. Bass's testimony concerning her knowledge that defendant committed the crimes because \"other witnesses\" identified him as the perpetrator. Specifically, defendant contends that Ms. Bass's testimony was nonresponsive and beyond the scope of defense counsel's question, was hearsay, and was not based on personal knowledge. We conclude that defendant was not prejudiced by the testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"The admission of evidence which is technically inadmissible will be treated as harmless unless prejudice is shown such that a different result likely would have ensued had the evidence been excluded.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Wilkerson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151061\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/363/382/#p412\">\n    363 N.C. 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 412,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=683%20S.E.2d%20174\">\n    683 S.E.2d 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 192 (2009) (noting that because the witness's testimony constituted a \"nonresponsive outburst,\" defense counsel did not \"invite\" the error), defendant is unable to show that he was prejudiced by this testimony. Defendant argues that Ms. Bass's testimony \"impermissibly bolstered the identification of [defendant] as the perpetrator.\" However, any value in Ms. Bass's nonspecific testimony was negligible given the strength of other undisputed identification evidence. Brendell testified that, on the day in question, he saw defendant coming out of the crawlspace of the mobile home carrying copper wire, and that he had seen defendant in the neighborhood several times over the years. While Brendell admitted that he could not specifically recall defendant's name on the day of the incident, he was able to provide it to Detective Parchman two days later. Detective Parchman corroborated this evidence, testifying that Brendell positively identified defendant as the man he saw coming out of the crawlspace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In light of Brendell's testimony, which was corroborated by Detective Parchman and not refuted by other evidence, we believe that Ms. Bass's allegedly unresponsive and hearsay testimony had little or no effect on the jury's verdict of guilt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Anderson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8300897\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/177/54/#p62\">\n    177 N.C.App. 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 62,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12635395\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/627/501/#p505\">\n    627 S.E.2d 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 505 (2006) (holding that our standard of review to determine whether a trial court committed prejudicial error in admitting evidence is \"whether a reasonable possibility exists that the evidence, if excluded, would have altered the result of the trial\"). Furthermore, we note that the only other reference to Ms. Bass's allegations that \"other witnesses\" saw defendant ride off on a bicycle that day occurred during cross-examination of Brendell when defense counsel asked if he had \"asked other folks in the neighborhood if they had seen anybody on a bike.\" Brendell replied that he had, but he never testified about what others had told him. Defense counsel then asked Brendell whether he had seen anybody else in the neighborhood besides defendant ride a bike. Brendell replied that he had.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although it seems likely that Ms. Bass's testimony that \"other witnesses\" had identified defendant as the perpetrator was based on double hearsay-conversations Brendell had with \"other folks\"-the probative effect of her testimony was negligible, given that Brendell, in his testimony, never identified the person \"others\" saw riding a bike, and given that Brendell identified defendant on an entirely independent basis. Therefore, in sum, any error in the admission of Ms. Bass's testimony was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    State v. Mitchell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8570822\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/270/753/\">\n    270 N.C. 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20S.E.2d%2096\">\n    155 S.E.2d 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967), is misplaced. In\n   <em>\n    Mitchell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8570822\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/270/753/\">\n    270 N.C. at 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20S.E.2d%2096\">\n    155 S.E.2d at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the defendant was charged with armed robbery and felonious assault for opening the victim's car door, taking the victim's wallet, and shooting the victim. The victim testified that \"somebody had told him [that] defendant had admitted [to] taking\" the wallet.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20S.E.2d%2096\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   During cross-examination, the victim's identification of defendant as the perpetrator was \"considerably shaken.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 757,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20S.E.2d%2096\">\n    155 S.E.2d at 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the inadmissible hearsay was prejudicial because: (1) the evidence constituted an admission of guilt by the defendant, and (2) it was the only significant evidence offered to identify the defendant as the perpetrator. Here, Ms. Bass's testimony that \"other witnesses\" saw defendant riding his bike that day did not suggest an admission of guilt by defendant. Further, a separate witness, Brendell, in his testimony before the jury identified defendant as the perpetrator. Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable and is not controlling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In sum, where a witness who has not offered testimony identifying defendant as the perpetrator refers in response to cross examination to hearsay evidence that \"other witnesses\" had identified defendant and where a separate witness positively identified defendant during the trial, any error by the trial court in failing to strike the hearsay testimony was not prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Denial of Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the injury to real property charge because there was insufficient evidence that the mobile home's air-conditioner was real property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant cites\n   <em>\n    State v.

Chapter 14, the section of our General Statutes containing our state's statutory criminal law, does not provide a definition of \"real property,\" and the only discussion concerning the difference between real property, fixtures, and personal property is in N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-83.1 titled \"Fixtures subject to Larceny,\" which abolished the common law distinctions between personal property and personal property affixed to real property, which would include fixtures, for purposes of a larceny charge. Thus, under section 14-83.1, which became effective 1 December 2008, the carrying and taking away of fixtures supports a conviction of larceny whereas, under the common law, it would not.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   P.

The \"personal property\" at issue was 4,800 feet of copper signal wire that had been affixed to signal poles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Because the offenses occurred prior to 1 December 2008, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-83.1, which, as discussed above, abolished the common law distinction between personal property and personal property affixed to real property for purposes of larceny, did not apply. Therefore, if the copper wire was so affixed to the poles that it became real property, the defendant could not have been guilty of larceny. The\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   Court applied the logic\n   enunciated in\n   <em>\n    Schultz\n   </em>\n   to conclude that the copper wire was affixed to real property because: (1) the signal poles themselves were buried up to eight feet into the ground, making them fixtures appurtenant to the land; (2) the copper wires were attached to the signal poles in such a way that removing them would require cutting the wires and they were not, as were the urns at issue in\n   <em>\n    Schultz,\n   </em>\n   attached with a \"slight twist\"; and (3) the attachment of the copper wire to the poles was a \"crucial part of the contemplated purpose\" of both the signal poles and the wire since their purpose was to carry electronic signals along the tracks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. Accordingly, \"the copper wire was attached to the signal poles, as to make it an integral part of such signal poles and [was], therefore, real property or chattels real.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, this Court reversed the trial court's order denying the defendant's motion to dismiss the felony larceny charge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Even though not controlling in this case, we adopt the logic used in\n   <em>\n    Schultz\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   and concepts of fixture law to determine whether the air-conditioner attached to Ms. Bass's mobile home was affixed such that \"it, too, became an irremovable part of the [mobile home].\"\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   at *3. The air-conditioner at issue in this case comprised two separate units: an inside unit, referred to as the A-coil, which sat on top of the home's heater, and an outside condensing unit, which had a compressor inside of it. The two units were connected by copper piping that ran from the condenser underneath the mobile home into the home. Mr. Gregory testified that the compressor, which was located inside the condensing unit, had been totally \"destroyed,\" and that although the condensing unit itself remained in place, it was rendered inoperable. Thus, unlike the vases and urns in\n   <em>\n    Schultz\n   </em>\n   that could be simply \"twisted off,\" the entire air-conditioner could not be removed but had to be \"gutted\" and removed in pieces. Moreover, when defendant cut the copper piping underneath the home, he caused significant damage to the water pipes that were also located in the crawlspace. Thus, here, not only could the air-conditioner not be easily removed from the mobile home but it also could not be easily removed from other systems of the home given the level of enmeshment and entanglement with the home's water pipes and heater.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   While the mobile home could serve its \"contemplated purpose\" of providing a basic dwelling without the air-conditioner,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   at *3, the purpose for which the air-conditioner was annexed to the mobile home supports a conclusion that it had become part of the real property. Mr. Davis attached the air-conditioner to the mobile home for the use and enjoyment of Ms. Bass, who was renting the home; thus, a presumption arises that the air-conditioner was attached to enhance the value of the real property and thus became real property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Little,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8523153\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/79/688/#p692\">\n    79 N.C.App. at 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=340%20S.E.2d%20510\">\n    340 S.E.2d at 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The intent with which a party annexes a chattel to real property is determined, in large measure, by the relationship of the parties to the land and to each other.

Defendant argues that Mr. Gregory's invoice was based on repairs to water pipes, a water line, and a water pump and tank. However, according to defendant, the receipt \"failed to link the work completed\" on the mobile home to the crimes of which defendant was convicted. Furthermore, defendant asserts that there was insufficient evidence to link the invoice with the mobile home because the receipt did not contain the address of the mobile home but, instead, referenced a subdivision in Goldsboro.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Despite these discrepancies, the receipt was consistent with Mr. Gregory's testimony of the damage he observed at the victim's home and the necessary repairs. Moreover, contrary to defendant's assertions, the description of the work performed was related to defendant's criminal acts of \"gutting\" the outside unit and cutting the copper piping from underneath the house which, based on Mr. Gregory's testimony, resulted in breaks in the water lines underneath the mobile home. Ms. Bass's testimony corroborated this when she testified that she did not notice any water damage in the crawlspace until immediately after the air-conditioner was damaged. Therefore, there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's order awarding restitution based on Mr. Gregory's invoice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Defendant also contends that there was insufficient evidence to support ordering defendant to pay for an entirely new air-conditioning system because \"the proper amount of restitution is the fair market value of the property at the time and place of destruction,\" not the cost to replace the property. Moreover, defendant argues that he should not have to pay for replacement of the heat pump because there was no evidence that defendant damaged the heat pump, only the air-conditioner. We believe that\n   section 15A-1340.34 should be interpreted to allow a defendant who damages property to be held responsible for all damage directly and proximately caused by the injury to property, including reasonable costs of repair and replacement, especially in a case like this where the air-conditioner was completely inoperable due to defendant's actions. Defendant has provided no case authority prohibiting this interpretation. Furthermore, Mr. Davis testified that the estimate from Jackson &amp; Sons, which was provided to the trial court in support of the restitution award, was for replacing \"just ... the AC.\" Thus, the amount of the restitution with regard to the replacement cost of the air-conditioner was based on \"something more than a guess or conjecture,\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moore,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2492889\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/327/378/#p383\">\n    327 N.C. 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 383,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=395%20S.E.2d%20124\">\n    395 S.E.2d 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 127-28 (1990).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Here, defendant was indicted for and convicted of felony larceny and felonious possession of stolen goods (\"felony possession\"). After the jury returned its verdict, based on the State's agreement to a mitigated sentence, defendant pled guilty to attaining habitual felon status pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-7.6. After determining that defendant had a prior record level of IV, the trial court consolidated the offenses for judgment and sentenced him to 77 months to 102 months imprisonment. Under the version of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-7.6 that was in effect at the time defendant committed the offenses, defendant was automatically sentenced as a Class C felon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the State requested a sentence at the high end of the mitigated range, the trial court imposed a sentence in the midpoint of the mitigated range. Defendant was sentenced to 77 to 102 months imprisonment. The allowable mitigated sentence for these offenses committed by a defendant with a class IV prior record level ranges from a minimum of 66 to a maximum of 166 months imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Later the same day, following the sentencing hearing, likely based on the trial court's recognition that a defendant may be not be convicted of both larceny and possession of stolen property based on the same conduct,\n   <em>\n    State v.

Therefore, we must remand this matter back to the trial court for resentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moore,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2492889\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/327/378/#p383\">\n    327 N.C. at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=395%20S.E.2d%20124\">\n    395 S.E.2d at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We further\n   conclude that, given the evidence in this case, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of injury to real property and did not err in instructing the jury that the air-conditioner was real property. Because the amount of restitution was supported by evidence at trial, the trial court's order of restitution was without error. Finally, because we are unable to determine what weight, if any, the trial court gave to the erroneous entry of judgment on felony possession despite the fact that the trial court later arrested that judgment, we must remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   NO ERROR IN PART; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Judges BRYANT and DAVIS concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    On 27 December 2012, this Court entered an order allowing defendant's petition for writ of certiorari to review the judgment entered.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Neither party raises any question that the mobile home in this case constitutes real property so, for purposes of this opinion, we will treat the mobile home as real property.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    N.C.
