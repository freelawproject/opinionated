The question presented by this case is whether this statute is applicable when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>cause of action giving rise to the judgment involves not a motor vehicle accident but, instead, is based on breach of a contract for improper repair of a motor vehicle. We hold that it is not; MVA\u2019s suspension authority applies exclusively to unpaid judgments in actions involving motor vehicle accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In 1984, appellant, Robert T. Emmet (\u201cEmmet\u201d), sued Rufus J.L. Beebe in the District Court for Anne Arundel County for Beebe\u2019s breach of contract to repair Emmet\u2019s road tractor. On December 13, 1984, judgment was entered in Emmet\u2019s favor. Over the next five years, Emmet was unsuccessful in his attempts to collect the $9,900 judgment from Beebe.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">On November 30, 1989, Emmet requested that MVA, pursuant to Md.Transp.Code Ann. \u00a7 17-204 (1987 Repl. Vol.),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> suspend Beebe\u2019s driver\u2019s license and the registration of all vehicles owned by Beebe. As required by \u00a7 17-202, Emmet submitted a certified copy of the judgment and a document entitled \u201cCertificate of the Facts Relative to Judgment\u201d to MVA. Emmet crossed out the portion of the certificate of facts which asked for the date of the accident and, in the space provided, wrote \u201cRe: contract action arising out of maintenance &amp; repair of motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">On January 3, 1990, an MVA official notified Emmet that MVA would not take action on his case, explaining that \u201cWe can only take suspension action on judgments that were as a result of motor vehicle accident damages.\u201d On March 7, 1990, Emmet filed a complaint for Writ of Mandamus to compel appellee, W. Marshall Rickert, the Administrator of MVA, to enforce \u00a7 17-201 and \u00a7 17-204 \u201cby suspending the vehicle registration and driver\u2019s license\u201d of Beebe. Both Emmet and MVA moved for summary judgment and on January 28, 1991, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>County (Cawood, J.) granted MVA\u2019s motion. The trial court held that MVA does not have the authority to suspend a person\u2019s license or registration on the basis of judgments resulting from a failure to make repairs on a vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The essence of Emmet\u2019s argument is that MVA\u2019s statutory duty to suspend the driver\u2019s licenses and car registrations of judgment debtors, which is set forth in \u00a7 17-201, <em>et seq., </em>is not confined to judgment debtors in actions involving motor vehicle accidents. He heavily relies upon the \u201cplain language\u201d of \u00a7 17-204 and \u00a7 17-201. Section 17-204 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">Except as otherwise provided in this subtitle, on receipt of a certified copy of a judgment and a certificate of facts, the Administration shall suspend:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">(1) The license to drive of the judgment debtor; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-9\">(2) The registration of all vehicles owned by the judgment debtor and registered in this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Section 17-201 defines \u201cjudgment\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-11\">In this subtitle, \u201cjudgment\u201d means any final judgment resulting from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-12\">(1) A cause of action for damages arising out of <em>the ownership, maintenance, or use on any highway or other property open to the public of any vehicle of a type required to be registered in this State; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-13\">(2) A cause of action on an agreement of settlement for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use on any highway or other property open to the public of any vehicle of a type required to be registered in this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">(emphasis added.) Emmet points out that this definition \u201cnowhere ... mention[s] the occurrence of an accident as a requirement for inclusion on the word, judgment.\u201d He maintains the legislature has \u201cspecified at least two categories [of judgments] in which a[n] accident might not have happened: ownership and maintenance.\u201d Thus, he argues the plain meaning of the statute requires the conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>that, at his request, MVA must suspend the license and registration of a mechanic who has improperly maintained, <em>i.e., </em>repaired, Emmet\u2019s car and failed to pay the resulting judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">The difficulty with Emmet\u2019s argument is that the \u201c \u2018meaning of the plainest language\u2019 \u201d is controlled by the context in which it appears; even when the words of a statute carry a definite meaning, a court is not \u201c \u2018precluded from consulting legislative history as part of the process of determining the legislative purpose or goal\u2019 \u201d of the law. <em>Morris v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>319 Md. 597, 604, 573 A.2d 1346 (1990) <em>(quoting Wilde v. Swanson, </em>314 Md. 80, 92, 548 A.2d 837 (1988)). Therefore, in attempting to glean legislative intent from the words of the statute, a court should read statutory words in light of the full context in which they appear, and in light of external manifestations of intent or general purpose available through other evidence. <em>See Cunningham v. State, </em>318 Md. 182, 185, 567 A.2d 126 (1989). Moreover, the Court of Appeals has held that when the literal words of a statute result in a construction clearly not contemplated by the legislature, the literal meaning should not be adopted. <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 514, 525 A.2d 628 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Accordingly, we turn to the context and legislative history of \u00a7 17-201.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">(iii)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Subtitle 2 of Title 17 of the Transportation Article is the \u201cNonpayment of Judgments\u201d portion of a statute, titled \u201cVehicle Laws \u2014 Required Security.\u201d Title 17 is the mechanism for insuring that the necessary financial responsibility is demonstrated by persons who wish to drive or own vehicles in this state. Subtitle 2 specifically relates to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>consequences of nonpayment of certain judgments by the drivers and owners of vehicles. Section 17-201 defines \u201cjudgment\u201d for the exclusive purpose of Subtitle 2. Because \u00a7 17-201 is <em>solely </em>a definitional statute, it cannot stand alone; its context is particularly important.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">That context, Subtitle 2, is comprised of nine sections. Some of these sections contain specific language indicating their applicability only to judgments resulting from motor vehicle accidents. For example, in \u00a7 17-206(b)(2), there is an exception to a suspension if the insurer for the vehicles goes into insolvency, reorganization or liquidation after <em>\u201cthe accident </em>involving the owner or driver.\u201d Similarly, \u00a7 17-208(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">A payment made in settlement or any claim because of bodily injury, death, or property damage <em>arising from the accident </em>shall be credited in reduction of the payment required by subsection (a)(1) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">(emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The reference to \u201cthe accident,\u201d as opposed to \u201can accident,\u201d in both of these statutes is an indication that the legislature intended that only unsatisfied judgments resulting from accidents would fall within the ambit of these statutes. Because these statutes are in the same subtitle as \u00a7 17-201, this would seem to suggest that such an interpretation was the legislative intent with regard to \u00a7 17-201. On the other hand, as Emmet points out, this language in \u00a7 17-206(b)(2) and \u00a7 17-208(b) also demonstrates that when the legislature intended to confine judgment to one arising from \u201cthe accident,\u201d it was perfectly capable of doing that. Its failure to do so in \u00a7 17-201 may suggest that it did not intend to so limit \u201cjudgment\u201d in that statute. Another provision of Subtitle 2, \u00a7 17-205, however, indicates that this is not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Section 17-205 identifies an exception to MVA\u2019s authority to suspend a judgment debtor\u2019s license and registration. Specifically, \u00a7 17-205 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>The Administration may not suspend a license or registration under this subtitle if the judgment arose out of an accident caused by a vehicle that, at the time of the accident:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">(1) Was owned or leased by the United States; this State, or any political subdivision of this State; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">(2) Was operated with the permission of its owner or lessee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Two interpretations of this language, which speaks solely in the context of accidents but which is expressly applicable to the entire subtitle, are possible: (1) \u00a7 17-205 totally excludes governmental entities from MVA suspension authority, <em>or </em>(2) \u00a7 17-205 excludes governmental entities from MVA suspension authority when judgments arise from accidents but not in any other situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">If Emmet\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 17-201 is accepted, then \u00a7 17-205 must be read in the second manner, <em>i.e., </em>to exclude MVA suspension authority <em>only </em>in cases involving accidents and not in any others. If, however, \u00a7 17-201 itself is construed to apply solely to judgments arising out of accidents, then \u00a7 17-205\u2019s exclusion is total, <em>i.e., </em>government entities are never subject to MVA\u2019s suspension authority. There seems to be no reason for providing a government entity exclusion for judgments resulting from accidents and not providing it for other judgments. That is, the policy considerations which led the General Assembly to exclude governmental entities from the suspension authority of MVA would seem to apply with equal force to judgments resulting from accidents and other judgments. Accordingly, we believe consideration of the context of \u00a7 17-201 suggests that the legislature intended to confine its definition of judgment to those judgments arising out of motor vehicle accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">(iv)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">The legislative history of \u00a7 17-201 confirms this conclusion. An act establishing the authority of the then Commissioner of Motor Vehicles to suspend licenses and registra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>tions for nonpayment of judgments was originally enacted in 1931. <em>See </em>1931 Md.Laws Ch. 498. In that year, the General Assembly adopted 18 new sections of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1924 edition) entitled \u201cLicenses\u201d and subtitled \u201cMotor Vehicles.\u201d <em>See </em>Md.Ann.Code Art. 56, \u00a7\u00a7 187-187Q (1935 Supp.). The General Assembly specifically stated that the purpose of this legislation was to provide \u201cfor the revocation of the license of an operator or chauffeur and the registration certificate of the owner of a motor vehicle, under certain conditions, <em>if any final judgment for personal injuries, and/or any final judgment for property damage in excess of fifty dollars ($50.00) caused by the negligent operation of such motor vehicle </em>by such operator or chauffeur remains unsatisfied ...\u201d 1931 Md.Laws Ch. 498 (emphasis added). That legislation specifically provided, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">The operator\u2019s and/or chauffeur\u2019s license and all of the registration certificates of any person, in the event of his failure within thirty (30) days thereafter, to satisfy any judgment ... <em>for damages on account of personal injury, including death, or damage to property in excess of fifty dollars ($50.00) resulting from the ownership, maintenance, use or operation hereafter of a motor vehicle </em>shall be forthwith suspended by the Commissioner upon receiving a certified copy or transcript of such final judgment ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Md.Ann.Code Art. 56, \u00a7 187B (1935 Supp.) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Thus, it is clear that when the statute was originally enacted, the legislature intended to and in fact did provide motor vehicle authorities with the statutory power and mandate to suspend licenses and registrations of judgment debtors <em>only </em>in cases resulting in \u201cpersonal injuries\u201d or \u201cproperty damage ... caused by the negligent operation of [the] motor vehicle.\u201d 1931 Md.Laws Ch. 489 (statement of purpose). This original definition of judgment was recodified without substantive amendment on a number of occa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>sions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On each occasion, reference is made to the cause of action underlying the unpaid judgment as arising from loss of services due to bodily injury or death, or injury or destruction of property caused by negligent operation of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">In 1975, the General Assembly re-wrote the law governing the financial responsibility of owners and drivers. <em>See </em>1975 Md.Laws Ch. 54. The legislature did not state that the purpose of the amendment was to broaden significantly the prior legislation. Rather, the purpose is stated to be simply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">providing certain procedures and penalties for failing to satisfy judgments arising <em>out of the ownership or use of vehicles, </em>... relating generally to the financial responsibility and required security for the ownership and operation of vehicles in Maryland ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added.) The word \u201cmaintenance\u201d is not included in the Act\u2019s statement of purpose. For the first time, however, the \u201cmaintenance\u201d language appears in the legislation. Judgment is defined as a final judgment resulting from \u201ca cause of action arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use upon a highway ... for damages, including damages for loss of services, because of bodily injury to or death of any person, or for damages because of injury to or destruction of property ...\u201d Md.Ann.Code Art. 66V2, \u00a7 7-201 (1975) (repealed and recodified at Md.Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7 17-201 (1987)). Thus, although removing the \u201cnegligent operation of the motor vehicle\u201d language, the General Assembly clearly appears to have retained its original intent to limit the scope of this statute to judgments arising from claims for damages because of personal injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>or \u201cinjury to or destruction of property,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>not to include damages for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">In 1977, the legislature recodified the Maryland motor vehicle laws and, in so doing, enacted the current version of \u00a7 17-201(1). <em>See </em>1977 Md.Laws Ch. 14. In the new definition of judgment, the language identifying the damages necessary in order for an action to be the predicate for the suspension powers (\u201cincluding damages for loss of services, because of bodily injury to or death of any person, or for damages because of injury to or destruction of property, including loss of use thereof\u201d) was eliminated. The re-visor\u2019s note, however, states that \u201cthis subsection is new language derived <em>without substantive change from </em>Art. 661/2, \u00a7 7-201.\u201d 1977 Md.Laws Ch. 14. (emphasis added). The Court of Appeals, interpreting precisely this section and this revisor\u2019s note, has directed that, although \u201cthe revisor\u2019s notes are not law and may not be considered to have been enacted as part of the act, ... they are entitled to weight.\u201d <em>Rentals Unlimited v. Administrator, </em>286 Md. 104, 109, 405 A.2d 744 (1978). The <em>Rentals </em>court went on to hold that the revisor\u2019s note established that another provision of the successor statute meant the same thing as its predecessor even though it did not have the express language of the earlier statute. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, here too, while the current version omits former express language, in light of the revisor\u2019s note, there is no reason to believe that the meaning of the statute has changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The most thorough judicial discussion of the legislative intent of the motor vehicle nonpayment of judgments law is found in <em>Rentals. </em>There, the Court of Appeals held that MVA may suspend the license and registration of a Maryland resident who failed to satisfy a judgment rendered by a court in the District of Columbia as a result of a vehicular accident. With respect to the legislative intent behind the nonpayment of judgment provisions, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">Title 17, \u201cVehicle Laws \u2014 Required Security,\u201d is the <em>most recent formulation of a consistent legislative policy </em>designed to make certain that those who own and operate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>vehicles in Maryland are financially responsible. <em>The legislative objective </em>of this statute, like the objective of its predecessors, <em>is </em>to achieve the remedial purpose of <em>protecting the public from the reckless operation of vehicles by financially irresponsible drivers by assuring that operators and owners of vehicles against whom judgments might be entered on account of negligent driving, are financially able to pay damages to persons injured by such negligence. Amalgamated Casualty Ins. Co. v. Helms, </em>239 Md. 529, 534 [212 A.2d 311] (1965); <em>National Indemnity Co. v. Simmons, </em>230 Md. 234, 238-39 [186 A.2d 595] (1962); <em>Keystone Mutual Casualty Co. v. Hinds, </em>180 Md. 676, 679 [26 A.2d 761] (1942). To accomplish that purpose fully, the MVA must be authorized to suspend the license and registration of any financially irresponsible vehicle owner or driver whether that person\u2019s negligent driving occurred in Maryland or in some other jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">(emphasis added.) <em>Rentals, </em>286 Md. at 110, 405 A.2d 744 (footnote omitted). <em>See also Harrison v. MVA, </em>302 Md. 634, 648, 490 A.2d 694 (1985) (legislative purpose of law which allows MVA to suspend driving privileges of uninsured motorist until outstanding judgment is paid is to provide \u201cfor the welfare of the public and for the correction or rectification of offenders against the health and security of the public\u201d). Thus, both the legislative history of \u00a7 17-201 and prior judicial interpretation of that history support the conclusion that the legislature intended the nonpayment of judgment law to apply <em>only </em>to judgment debtors whose debts emerged from vehicular accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">(v)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">In sum, the legislative context and history of \u00a7 17-201 require the conclusion that this statute is only applicable when the cause of action giving rise to the judgment involves a motor vehicle accident. Since the judgment on which Emmet seeks MVA action does not qualify as such, we affirm the holding of the court below. Because this is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>an issue of public importance, the resolution of which will benefit the MVA, we exercise our discretion to direct that the costs be equally divided between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID ONE HALF BY APPELLANT AND ONE HALF BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-9\">.
