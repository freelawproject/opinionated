The State, presents the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\">Whether the Circuit Court Judge can exercise discretion in a forfeiture proceeding and deny a forfeiture once the Plaintiff has established and the Court has found the motor vehicle was being used by its operator, the owner, to transport or to facilitate the transport of marijuana ?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The facts of this case are uncontroverted, and the parties stipulated to them at the forfeiture hearing. Michael Stanley Patrick (\u201cPatrick\u201d) was the registered owner of a 1989 Harley Davidson motorcycle that he purchased with $9,500 obtained from his trust fund. On April 20, 1990, Patrick was travelling on his motorcycle from Washington, Pennsylvania to Daytona Beach, Florida accompanied by friends who were driving an automobile. His friends were stopped along Route 40 near Grantsville, in Garrett County, Maryland by Corporal Randy Sines of the Garrett County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The occupants of the automobile were subsequently arrested on motor vehicle and controlled dangerous substance (\u201cCDS\u201d) charges that are not before us. Initially, Patrick continued on without his friends, but he returned in about 15 minutes to where his friends were stopped to see what was happening, and Corporal Sines flagged him down. Patrick was arrested on motor vehicle charges at the scene and was searched. The circumstances of the stop, arrest, and search were not challenged and are not before us. In the outside pocket of Patrick\u2019s jacket, Corporal Sines discovered 22.1 grams of marijuana. Patrick pled guilty to possession of CDS and served five days in the local jail. Prior to this incident, Patrick had no criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">A Complaint for Forfeiture was filed by the State\u2019s Attorney for Garrett County requesting, <em>inter </em>alia, an order decreeing civil forfeiture of Patrick\u2019s motorcycle. The proper procedures in terms of notification, posting, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>publishing were followed, and a forfeiture hearing was held on March 28, 1991. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court decided to deny the petition for forfeiture and to return the motorcycle to Patrick. Speaking from the bench, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">Well, this, in my opinion, is one of these relatively unclear cases which requires the utilization of some discretion and I believe that the Court does have discretion to review all of the circumstances which surround the seizure of this motorcycle and to determine the propriety of the forfeiture. If that were not the case, all of these standards for seizure would not require their presentation to a forfeiting authority or to the Court for final determination; and reviewing the circumstances, I think it\u2019s perfectly clear that the motorcycle here was a conveyance used to [transport] or facilitate the transportation of the controlled dangerous substance, simply because its operator was in possession while he operated it; but reviewing further, that\u2019s all there is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">\u2666 * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">The petition for forfeiture will be denied and I\u2019ll order that the vehicle be returned to its owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">For reasons that we will explain, we reverse the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">In this appeal, the State asks us to decide the amount of discretion, if any, that a trial judge possesses under Md. Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 297 (Supp.1991) to deny a petition for forfeiture after it has been determined that a motor vehicle was used by its owner to transport or to facilitate the transport of CDS. We do not write on a clean slate in interpreting or applying the provisions of \u00a7 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">Subsection (b) describes property that is subject to forfeiture:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>(b) The following shall be subject to forfeiture and no property right shall exist in them:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\">* -is * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">(4) All conveyances including aircraft, vehicles or vessels, which are used, or intended for use, to transport, or in any manner to facilitate the transportation, sale, receipt, possession, or concealment of [CDS.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Patrick testified that he had marijuana in his jacket pocket when he was riding the motorcycle. Patrick\u2019s motorcycle therefore was \u201cused ... to transport [CDS,]\u201d and there can be no question that it was property subject to forfeiture. Patrick argues that because the motorcycle was being used for the purpose of transporting Patrick, not CDS, it was not subject to forfeiture. Patrick\u2019s argument is creative, but unconvincing. Section 297 does not require that a vehicle be used \u201cfor the purpose of\u201d transporting CDS to be subject to forfeiture; it requires only that the vehicle be used \u201cto transport\u201d CDS. Here, the motorcycle was used to transport CDS: the marijuana was concealed in Patrick\u2019s clothing, which was on Patrick, who was on the motorcycle. The trial court correctly determined that \u201cthe motorcycle ... was a conveyance used to [transport] or facilitate the transportation of controlled dangerous substance, simply because its operator was in possession while he operated it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">After making this determination, however, the trial court continued by examining and applying the list of \u201cstandards for seizure\u201d currently codified at \u00a7 297(i).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">(i) In exercising the authority to seize motor vehicles pursuant to this section the following standards shall be utilized:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">(1) A motor vehicle used in violation of this section shall be seized and forfeiture recommended to the forfeiting authority when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">(i) Controlled dangerous substances in any quantity are sold or attempted to be sold in violation of this subtitle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>(ii) Although the violator has not sold or attempted to sell controlled dangerous substances in violation of this subtitle, an amount of such substances or paraphernalia is located which would reasonably indicate that sale is contemplated by the violator; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\">(iii) The total circumstances of the case dictate that seizure and forfeiture is justified; these circumstances would include such factors as the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">1. The possession of controlled dangerous substances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">2. An extensive criminal record of the violator;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">3. A previous conviction of the violator for a controlled dangerous substance violation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">4. Corroborated information is developed indicating that the violator is or was recently a seller, or frequently associates with individuals known to be distributors of illegal controlled dangerous substances or paraphernalia;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">5. Circumstances of the arrest; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">6. The manner in which the vehicle was being used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">These standards have been the source of much confusion. Their significance has been explained, however, on prior occasions. We quote from an opinion of this Court authored by Judge Moylan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-12\">The source of the legal mistake is clear. Subsection 297(f) [currently codified at \u00a7 297(i) ] provides a set of \u201cguidelines for the exercise of discretion by the seizing authority in deciding whether to recommend forfeiture to the State\u2019s Attorney.\u201d <em>State v. One 1967 Ford Mustang, </em>266 Md. [275] at 278 n. 3, 292 A.2d 64 [(1972)]. As we made clear in <em>State v. 1982 Plymouth, </em>[67 Md.App. 310, 507 A.2d 633 (1986)] \u201c[t]hese clearly are not guidelines for the judge____ The decision to seize and the decision to recommend forfeiture to the State\u2019s Attorney are not judicial decisions either in the first instance or by way of <em>de novo </em>determination.\u201d 67 Md.App. at 319 [507 A.2d 633].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>The guidelines for seizure, in any event, are only for the benefit of the executive branch and are not subject to judicial review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><em>State v. One 1985 Ford, </em>72 Md.App. 144, 152-53, 527 A.2d 1311 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court obviously considered the standards for seizure set forth in \u00a7 297(i)(l). It then exercised discretion in concluding that forfeiture was inappropriate under the circumstances. The trial court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">[I] think it\u2019s perfectly clear that the motorcycle here was a conveyance used to [transport] or to facilitate the transportation of the controlled dangerous substance ... but reviewing further, that\u2019s all there is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">Indeed, the motorcycle was not involved in the transportation of controlled dangerous substance for the purpose of sale, or attempted sale, nor was it used in making a sale or an attempted sale. [\u00a7 297(i)(l)(i).] The amount or quantity of the controlled dangerous substance might perhaps have been in reasonable quantity to indicate an intention to distribute^] but the State chose and we proceeded with simple possession. [\u00a7 297(i)(l)(ii).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">Mr. Patrick has no criminal record either as a violator for controlled dangerous substances or otherwise. [\u00a7 297(i)(l)(iii)(2), (3).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">The circumstances of arrest indicate to me that it\u2019s a flat, common garden variety of arrest. [\u00a7 297(i)(l)(iii)(5).] The vehicle was being used to transport its operator who happened to have marijuana in his pocket [\u00a7 297(i)(l)(iii)(6) ], and on that basis, I do not believe that forfeiture\u2019s appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">The petition for forfeiture will be denied and I\u2019ll order that the vehicle be returned to its owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">For the trial court to consider and apply the standards for seizure that the legislature intended for the benefit of the executive branch and then exercise discretion to deny forfeiture was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>The proper role of the judiciary in forfeiture proceedings was explained by Judge Digges in <em>State v. One 1967 Ford Mustang, </em>266 Md. 275, 292 A.2d 64 (1972). In that case, the trial court had returned a car seized by the State police finding \u201cit \u2018neither consistent nor conceivable\u2019 that the legislature would place the judiciary in \u2018an inflexible strait jacket\u2019, \u2018paint [it] into a corn\u00e9r\u2019, or remove the \u2018power and ability [of the trial court] to exercise discretion and make an intelligent equitable consideration and disposition according to the extent of the wrong and the degree of culpability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 277, 292 A.2d 64. In reversing the trial court, Judge Digges, for the Court, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">Once the seizing authority decides to seek forfeiture, the court\u2019s only responsibilities are to require proof that the vehicle seized was \u201cused, or intended for use, to transport, or in any manner to facilitate the transportation, sale, receipt, possession, or concealment of [controlled dangerous substances]\u201d; determine that no statutory exceptions are applicable; and insure the adherence to due process requirements. <em>State v. Greer, </em>263 Md. 692, 284 A.2d 233 (1971); <em>Pr. George\u2019s Co. v. Blue Bird Cab, </em>263 Md. 655, 284 A.2d [203] (1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-5\"><em>Id. </em>[266 Md.] at 278, 292 A.2d 64. To the extent that the trial court in the case <em>sub judice </em>did more than this, it committed error. Here, the trial court found the vehicle was used to transport CDS. Patrick did not argue that the seizure fell within any of the statutory exceptions to forfeiture. The parties stipulated that Patrick received the proper notice. Once these determinations were made, the trial court did not have discretion to deny the forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">While we sympathize with the trial court because it must impose what may seem to it a harsh measure, \u00a7 297 requires forfeiture in this case. The language of <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Blue Bird Cab, </em>263 Md. 655, 662, 284 A.2d 203 (1971) again seems apropos:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">We agree that in some ways this is a harsh law; however, it is within the Legislature\u2019s power to decide whether such a forfeiture provision is desirable. Its purpose is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>attempt not only to curtail drug traffic in this state, but to discourage such a blight from continuing in the future. Historically, decisive action has been required to prevent any plague from spreading. In the present case the Legislature has clearly indicated its purpose for this act. It is to control the proliferation of dangerous drugs in our society and it is a noble purpose, but an arduous task. The measures that have been taken are not out of step with the great weight of authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.
