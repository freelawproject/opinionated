Real Prop.Code Ann. \u00a7 9-102(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">On 19 February 1990, the appellant entered into an agreement with COMACS, Inc. (\u201cCOMACS\u201d) to furnish and install mirrors, sliding mirrored doors, bathroom accessories and other specialty items for homes being built by CO-MACS in a project known as \u201cSomerset\u201d in Calvert County, Maryland. COMACS was to perform as the general con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>tractor of the subdivision while the appellant was one of the subcontractors hired by COMACS.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">On 22 March 1990, Roger and Cheryl Flynn purchased and took title, as tenants by the entirety, to lot 17 and a house on the lot that was under construction by COMACS in the \u201cSomerset\u201d subdivision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On or about 14 May 1990, appellant began to perform under the subcontract, providing bathroom enclosures and accessories, shelving, door accessories and locks to the Flynn property. Appellant completed performance of the contract at the Flynn property in mid-July<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, but never received payment from the contractor, COMACS.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">On 10 May 1990, appellant began shipping and installing goods under the subcontract to the house under construction on lot 25 in the \u201cSomerset\u201d subdivision. On 21 May 1990, Sadegh and Moky Rahbar purchased and took title to lot 25 as tenants by the entireties. Appellant completed its work on or about 26 July 1990, but never received payment from the contractor, COMACS.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">On 7 May 1990, appellant began shipping and installing goods under the subcontract to the house under construction on lot 21 of the \u201cSomerset\u201d subdivision. Scott and Barbara Smith purchased and took title to lot 21 as tenants by the entireties on 25 May 1990. Appellant completed its work under the contract on or about 2 July 1990, but never received payment from the contractor, COMACS.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Finally, on 1 June 1990, appellant began shipping and installing goods under the subcontract to the house under construction on lot 18 of the \u201cSomerset\u201d subdivision. On 19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>June 1990, Paul and Leigh Burch purchased and took title to lot 18 as tenants by the entireties. Appellant completed its work on or about 2 July 1990, but never received payment from the contractor, COMACS.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">In each of the above cases, appellant demanded payment from COMACS. Since appellant never received payment from COMACS, it subsequently pursued mechanics\u2019 lien actions against the appellees and their properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">In each of the instant cases the trial court denied appellant\u2019s Petition to Establish and Enforce Mechanic\u2019s Lien because the appellant failed to meet its burden of proving that the appellees were not bona fide purchasers of the subject properties. Appellant argues that a purchaser who acquires legal title while subcontractors are working on a dwelling cannot be a bona fide purchaser under Md.Real Prop.Code Ann. \u00a7 9-102(d), <em>infra, </em>since the purchaser has constructive notice that claims may arise by subcontractors who may not ultimately be paid for their work or materials. Appellant\u2019s argument misapprehends the trial court\u2019s rulings and the nature of this appeal. In each case, the trial court concluded that the appellant failed to meet its burden of proving that the appellees were not bona fide purchasers for value. None of the various trial court rulings decided that an intervening purchaser can never have notice of a potential claim so as to destroy its bona fide purchaser status. Our review of the final judgments, the Briefs and the Records for each of the cases <em>sub judice </em>convinces us that the lower court rulings must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Maryland\u2019s Real Property Article, \u00a7 9-102(a), which authorizes the imposition of mechanics\u2019 liens, provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[e]very building erected ... is subject to establishment of a lien in accordance with this subtitle for the payment of all debts ... contracted ... for materials furnished for or about the building____\u201d Section 9-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>102(d) provides an exemption from this provision. It provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">However, a building or the land on which the building is erected may not be subjected to a lien under this subtitle if, prior to the establishment of a lien in accordance with this subtitle, legal title has been granted to a bona fide purchaser for value.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Clearly, the mere taking of legal title prior to the establishment of a lien does not serve to exempt the property under \u00a7 9-102(d). <em>Talbott Lumber Co. v. Tymann, </em>48 Md.App. 647, 650, n. 2, 428 A.2d 1229 (1981). The statute plainly requires that the intervening purchaser be a bona fide purchaser for value. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The burden of establishing the right to a lien is on the claimant. <em>Id. </em>at 653, 428 A.2d 1229. The claimant\u2019s general burden includes proving that an intervening owner is not a bona fide purchaser for value. <em>Id. </em>The property owner need do no more than contravene a claimant\u2019s allegation in order to challenge the validity of the claim. He or she need offer no evidence of his or her status except in response to evidence first offered by the claimant tending to show that the property owner is not a bona fide purchaser for value. <em>Id. </em>at 653-54, 428 A.2d 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In the instant cases, the petitions to establish mechanics\u2019 liens were devoid of any evidence tending to show that the appellees were not bona fide purchasers for value. In fact, the petitions merely set forth facts and attached exhibits (deeds and deeds of trust) which tended to establish that the appellees were indeed bona fide purchasers for value. Moreover, at the various hearings held on the petitions, appellant failed to offer any evidence to prove that appellees were not bona fide purchasers for value. The absence of a statutory or judicially-declared definition of the phrase \u201cbona fide purchaser for value\u201d in Maryland does not excuse the appellant from making any effort to meet its burden to produce evidence as required by our opinion in the <em>Talbott Lumber </em>case. We shall review the judgment in each of the cases before us, <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>\n<em>The Flynns</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">On 27 December 1990, a show cause hearing was held on the appellant\u2019s Petition to Establish and Enforce Mechanic\u2019s Lien against property owned by Roger and Cheryl Flynn. The evidence demonstrated that the Flynns had purchased their property for value on 22 March 1990, approximately two months before the appellant began to supply and install materials. At the close of the appellant\u2019s case, counsel for the Flynns made a Motion for Judgment. Counsel for the appellant opposed the motion, arguing that \u201cthe Flynns were not bonified [sic] purchasers for value because they had notice, based on the evidence accepted by Your Honor that they knew that there was work still being done.\u201d During the entire course of the hearing, however, no evidence was admitted to show that the Flynns had actual notice, and there was no evidence, apart from the appellant\u2019s bald allegations, that the Flynns had constructive notice that there may be claims against the property by subcontractors for non-payment. In fact, appellant presented no evidence regarding the Flynns\u2019 lack of status as bona fide purchasers for value. To the contrary, appellant established that the Flynns executed a purchase money deed of trust in the principal amount of $278,200, representing the financed portion of the total $361,300 which they paid for the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The purpose of Maryland\u2019s Mechanics\u2019 Lien Statute, Md.Real Prop.Code Ann. \u00a7 9-101 <em>et seq., </em>is to protect those who furnish labor and materials during the construction process. <em>Riley v. Abrams, </em>287 Md. 348, 412 A.2d 996 (1980). While it is true that the mechanics\u2019 lien law is remedial and is to be construed in the most liberal and comprehensive manner in favor of mechanics and material-men, courts have no power to extend it to cases beyond the obvious designs and plain requirements of the statute. <em>Freeform Pools, Inc. v. Strawbridge Home for Boys, Inc., </em>228 Md. 297, 301, 179 A.2d 683 (1962); <em>Caton Ridge, Inc. v. Bonnett, </em>245 Md. 268, 225 A.2d 853 (1967). Although we recognize that the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Statute is designed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>protect subcontractors generally, the provisions of \u00a7 9-102(d) make it clear that the statute was not intended to protect subcontractors against bona fide purchasers for value. The <em>Talbott Lumber </em>case clearly places on claimants the burden of establishing the right to a lien and proving that the property owner is not a bona fide purchaser for value. That burden was not met in the Flynns\u2019 case. Consequently, we hold that the circuit court did not err in granting the Flynns\u2019 Motion for Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\n<em>The Rahbars</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">On 2 January 1991, a hearing was held on appellant\u2019s Petition to Establish and Enforce Mechanic\u2019s Lien against property owned by Sadegh and Moky Rahbar. At that hearing the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">THE COURT: In other words, you\u2019re not suggesting that they had any reason to know that the bills were not being paid. You\u2019re not suggesting they had any reason to know there was any leave [sic] pending. You\u2019re only saying that because there was work which, and we don\u2019t know how much, but there was some \u2014 the mirrors apparently, some part of the erection of the mirrors or the installation of the mirrors, that that alone is sufficient to put them on notice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: That\u2019s correct, your Honor. THE COURT: That\u2019s all the proof you have. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: That\u2019s it, your Honor. While work was being done they ended up buying this or becoming the owners of this property. The work was not completed. Had the work been completed, your Honor, and everything finished and the Rahbars come along and buy the house, then yes, they would be bonified purchasers for value because they wouldn\u2019t know when construction had ended. They would be protected by this statue [sic]. But if they buy it during the construction, then they in essence are the builders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Here, as in the Flynn\u2019s case, the appellant failed to produce any evidence, aside from the mere allegation that the Rahbars were on notice, to show that the Rahbars were not bona fide purchasers for value. Again, appellant only produced evidence that the Rahbars had paid $383,000 for their property and had executed a purchase money deed of trust in the principal amount of $280,000. Since the appellant did not meet the burden of proof set forth in the <em>Talbott Lumber </em>case, the property owned by the Rahbars falls within the exemption provided by \u00a7 9-102(d). The circuit court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s Petition to Establish and Enforce Mechanics\u2019 Lien must, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\n<em>The Smiths</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">On 2 January 1991, a show cause hearing was held on appellant\u2019s Motion to Establish and Enforce Mechanic\u2019s Lien against property owned by Scott and Barbara Smith. During the hearing the appellant presented the following argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">[THE COURT]: Again, in your case here, you\u2019re claiming that they did have notice because some of the mirrors or some of the items were not installed, is that correct? [APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: That\u2019s correct. They were being installed while they assumed ownership.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">[THE COURT]: I mean don\u2019t you have to prove that, prove that some circumstance that would make it less than \u2014 that they have tried to sell to a cousin or an officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: But, your Honor, what if they just sell it to someone while it\u2019s being constructed. Anyone, a friend, a cousin. Yes, I mean if we could prove it, sure, we would present that. But what we\u2019re saying is that while the house is under construction the contractor steps out and the purchaser steps into the shoes of that contractor and assumes any risks that the subcontractors weren\u2019t paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>To be a bonified [sic] purchaser they would buy it after it\u2019s completed when they have no reason to inquire into whether subcontractors weren\u2019t paid.<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">After hearing argument from both parties, the trial court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">I do think that the Talbott Lumber Case requires that there be some \u2014 that the burden is on the Plaintiff here to show that they are not a bonified [sic] purchaser for value or that there is some notice, they were put on some kind of notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">I don\u2019t think that just the work being done, particularly when you\u2019re talking about twenty-seven hundred dollars worth of glass work or mirror work is sufficient to put a person on notice. Accordingly I will deny the Interlocutory or any Mechanic\u2019s Lien in this particular case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">After a thorough review of the Briefs and the Record in the instant case, we find that the trial court\u2019s ruling was correct. There was no evidence presented either in the Petition or at the Show Cause Hearing tending to prove that the Smiths were not bona fide purchasers for value. Appellant offered proof that the Smiths paid $414,140 for the property and executed a purchase money deed of trust in the principal amount of $331,300. Aside from the appellant\u2019s allegations, however, there was no evidence that the Smiths had any notice whatsoever of appellant\u2019s claim or potential claim or that the Smiths had any reasonable cause to make inquiry into whether there were any claims as of the time they purchased the realty. Since the appellant has failed to meet its burden under the <em>Talbott Lumber </em>case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the Smiths are entitled to the exemption provided by \u00a7 9-102(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\n<em>The Burches</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">On 27 December 1990, a Show Cause hearing was held on appellant\u2019s Motion to Establish and Enforce Mechanic\u2019s Lien against property owned by Paul and Leigh Burch. The circuit court granted the Burches\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">... I think under these exemptions the [legislative] intent was that if it was settlement and unless there is some showing that he was not a bonified [sic] purchaser, I don\u2019t think this is a fact that it was ongoing work at the time of the settlement. It\u2019s not enough.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">As in the three previously discussed cases, the appellant failed to meet the burden set forth in the <em>Talbott Lumber </em>case. The appellant merely argued \u201cthat the property in question was purchased while construction was ongoing. Therefore, they were on notice that there may be subcontractors who have not been paid. Therefore, they are not bonified [sic] purchasers for value because they aren\u2019t innocent purchasers. They have notes [sic]. A bonified [sic] purchaser for value was a purchaser without notice.\u201d Once again, appellant proved only that the Burches paid $433,900 for the property, of which $347,000 was in the form of a purchase money deed of trust. Since the appellant failed to offer any evidence tending to show that the Burches were not bona fide purchasers for value, we find that the trial court did not err in granting the Motion for Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS IN EACH CASE TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-12\">. The four cases have been consolidated for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b223-13\">. In the Burches\u2019 case, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant-appellees. In the Flynns\u2019 case, the trial court granted the defendant-appellees\u2019 Motion for Judgment and dismissed the Petition for Mechanics\u2019 Lien.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b224-8\">. Of the four cases presented in this appeal, only the Flynns took title to their property prior to the time when appellant began to perform under the subcontract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b224-9\">. In its Brief, the appellant states that it completed performance of the contract on or about 3 July 1990. In the Petition to Establish and Enforce Mechanic\u2019s Lien, however, the appellant states that it furnished work and materials during the period of 14 May through 26 July 1990.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[5]\">\n<p id=\"b230-8\">5. If appellant\u2019s position that all construction must be completed before settlement in order for a buyer to be a bona fide purchaser were correct, the common practice of utilizing at settlement a \u201cpunch list\u201d for the completion or correction of minor items would be foreclosed. Considering the stage of completion of the homes in the cases <em>sub judice </em>and their value (in some cases upwards of $400,000), the relatively small sums sought by appellant may well represent claims for payment for \u201cpunch list\" type items. We cannot discern from the record, however, whether they were so considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
