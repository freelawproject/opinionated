Following a jury\u2019s special verdict on specific questions of fact, the Circuit Court for Cecil County declared, <em>inter alia, </em>that: (1) Nolt was entitled to <em>pro rata </em>insurance coverage (including his attorneys fees) from U.S.F. &amp; G. and U.S. Fire arising out of a fatal traffic accident in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Nolt was the driver at fault; and (2) U.S.F. &amp; G. must bear Nolt\u2019s counsel fees and expenses in the declaratory judgment action. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Nolt is the owner and operator of a 1978 Ford tractor truck. In each year since 1984, Nolt has leased his tractor for one-year terms, beginning December 31 of each year, to Lester R. Summers, Inc. (\u201cSummers\u201d), a company engaged in the interstate transport of property as authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission (\u201cI.C.C.\u201d). Under the agreement, Summers would contact Nolt when a transport job became available and pay Nolt on a per-job basis. The agreement stipulated that, during the term of the lease, Summers held \u201cexclusive possession, control, use and responsibility for the operation of the equipment [the tractor] (including full responsibility to the public, the shippers, and all regulatory agencies having jurisdiction).\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The lease further mandated that Summers would provide Nolt\u2019s tractor with all necessary I.C.C. identification placards as required under federal law. <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1057.11(c) (1986). Nolt\u2019s truck was insured under Summers\u2019 policy with U.S.F. &amp; G.; Nolt did not carry his own insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">During late 1988, Summers provided Nolt with very little work. According to Nolt, in early December 1988, he visited Lester Summers at his office to pick up his paycheck and inquire as to the availability of future work. Nolt testified that, on this occasion, Summers granted him permission to \u201chaul for someone else\u201d until business revitalized, without requiring that Nolt terminate the existing lease or turn in his I.C.C. placards. On December 5, 1988, Nolt independently called the Charles M. Shirk Trucking Company (\u201cShirk\u201d) in search of an assignment. Shirk agreed to lease Nolt\u2019s tractor the next day for a one-day hauling job; Charles Shirk testified at trial that he agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>to lease Nolt\u2019s tractor based on Nolt\u2019s representation that Summers had given Nolt permission to seek other employment. Although Summers disputed Nolt\u2019s claim that Summers gave Nolt permission to operate the trailer for Shirk for one day, the jury found that Summers did give Nolt permission to operate his truck on December 6, 1988 for Shirk. No party on appeal claims that this finding was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Like Summers, Shirk was an I.C.C.-authorized carrier that had been in the business for many years. Nolt had previously transported goods for Shirk, but only as facilitated by Summers. That is, on previous occasions, Shirk contacted Summers, or Summers\u2019 dispatcher, when Shirk wanted to hire one of Summers\u2019 drivers and tractors and, if drivers and truckers were available, Summers' dispatcher assigned the work to one of Summers\u2019 truckers. As with any other outside contract, Shirk would pay Summers for the work and Summers, in turn, would pay the driver, including Nolt on occasion, after keeping a commission for itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">For the December 6, 1988 trip, and that trip alone, Shirk and Nolt executed a one-day lease which stated that Shirk was to provide Nolt with identification placards, to \u201cassume complete responsibility for the operation of the equipment,\u201d and \u201cto provide Insurance only to the extent it is legally obligated to do so for the protection of the public pursuant to ICC regulations.\u201d Though the lease was drawn up by Shirk on December 5,1988, Nolt did not sign the agreement until after the assignment. Nor did Shirk transfer to Nolt any I.C.C. placards to place in the truck, despite such a requirement in the lease and under federal law. Shirk was paid by its customer for the trip and Shirk in turn paid Nolt, keeping the entire commission itself; Summers received no payment for the trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">On the morning of December 6, 1988, Nolt began his trip to Cecil County, Maryland with a load of concrete under a bill of lading issued by Shirk. Nolt\u2019s truck continued to display Summers\u2019 I.C.C. placards. Nolt\u2019s rig collided with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>another vehicle, causing a serious automobile accident, which resulted in the death of one person and the injury of another. Immediately after the accident, Nolt instructed the Maryland State Police to call Shirk. While on his way to the scene of the accident, Charles Shirk contacted both his insurance company, U.S. Fire, and Summers.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Approximately four months after the accident, Shirk, Summers and Nolt were named as defendants in a case filed by the personal representative and survivors of the person killed in the accident. Nolt sought coverage and representation from both U.S. Fire and U.S.F. &amp; G. U.S. Fire agreed to defend Nolt and retained counsel for him. U.S.F. &amp; G. denied coverage of Nolt and refused to participate in Nolt\u2019s defense; it did provide a defense to Summers.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">On April 18, 1990, Nolt initiated this declaratory judgment action to determine the respective obligations of the two insurance companies. Questions of fact relevant to the interpretation of the U.S.F. &amp; G. insurance policy were submitted to a jury, which found that Nolt had permission from Lester R. Summers, the owner of Lester R. Summers, Inc., to operate his truck on December 6, 1988 for Shirk and that, on December 6, 1988, Nolt\u2019s truck was used exclusively in <em>both </em>Shirk\u2019s and Summers\u2019 businesses as truckers.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">On February 15, 1991, the circuit court issued a declaration that \u201cNolt is afforded <em>pro rata </em>insurance coverage for the December 6th automobile accident\u201d from U.S.F. &amp; G. <em>and </em>U.S. Fire; the court further held the two insurers \u201cjointly liable, on a <em>pro rata </em>basis, for the counsel fees and expenses\u201d expended by Nolt in the underlying tort action, and U.S.F. &amp; G. \u201cliable for Nolt\u2019s counsel fees and expenses\u201d in the declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Further facts will be set forth within as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">At issue before us is the \u201cdouble coverage\u201d of a single vehicle. Double coverage exists when more than one insurance policy covers a claim. <em>Nat\u2019l Indemnity v. Continental Ins., </em>61 Md.App. 575, 578, 487 A.2d 1191 (1985) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number><em>(iciting </em>8A J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, \u00a7 4907.65 at 364 (1981) [hereinafter <em>Appleman </em>]). In this situation, often the insurance policy limits the insurer\u2019s liability in two ways based on the availability of other coverage. First, an <em>excess </em>clause specifies that an insurance company will make payment on a policy so long as: (1) it becomes liable only after the claimant has recovered the sums available under the other policies involved, and (2) it pays an amount equal to the difference between the total insurance paid by the other companies and the limit of its own policy. <em>Nat\u2019l Indemnity, </em>61 Md.App. at 578, 487 A.2d 1191 <em>(citing </em>8A <em>Appleman </em>\u00a7 4907.65 at 347-349). Second, a <em>pro rata </em>clause limits an insurer\u2019s liability to its proportionate share in relation to all available coverage. <em>Nat\u2019l Indemnity, </em>61 Md.App. at 578, 487 A.2d 1191 <em>{citing </em>8A <em>Appleman </em>\u00a7 4907.65 at 345). At the heart of the dispute here are the excess and <em>pro rata </em>clauses found in both the U.S.F. &amp; G. policy and the U.S. Fire policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Both policies provide coverage for \u201cinsureds\u201d in addition to the \u201cnamed insured,\u201d i.e.: (1) \u201canyone [besides the named insured] while using with your permission a covered \u2018auto\u2019 \u201d and (2) \u201canyone from whom you hire ... a covered \u2018auto\u2019 ... while the covered \u2018auto\u2019 is being used exclusively in your business as a trucker\u201d and \u201cis being used pursuant to operating rights granted to you by a public authority.\u201d In relevant part, the identical, \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in each policy provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">(a) This Coverage Form\u2019s Liability Coverage is primary for any \u201cauto\u201d <em>while hired or borrowed by you and used exclusively in your business as a </em>\u201ctrucker\u201d <em>and pursuant to operating rights granted to you by a public authority. </em>This Coverage Form\u2019s Liability Coverage is excess over any covered \u201cauto\u201d while hired or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">borrowed from you by another \u201ctrucker.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">(e) When this coverage form and any other coverage form or policy covers on the same basis, either excess or primary, we will pay only our share. Our share is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>the proportion that the Limit of Insurance of our Coverage Form bears to the total of the limits of all the Coverage Forms and policies covering on the same basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">(emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Section (a) of the \u201cother insurance\u201d provisions constitutes the excess clause; section (e) is the <em>pro rata </em>clause. There are well-defined procedures under Maryland law that dictate how one such clause in an insurance policy will be treated when it conflicts with another. Specifically, an excess clause will prevail over a <em>pro rata </em>clause. <em>Consolidated Mut. Ins. Co. v. Bankers Ins. Co., </em>244 Md. 392, 399, 223 A.2d 594 (1966). When both policies provide excess coverage only, liability is shared equally by the insurers. <em>Ryder Truck Rental, Inc. v. Schapiro &amp; Whitehouse, Inc., </em>259 Md. 354, 364-65, 269 A.2d 826 (1970). A conflict between two <em>pro rata </em>clauses results in a proportional sharing of liability without either insurer being considered primary or excess. <em>Celina Mut. Cas. Co. v. Citizens Cas. Co., </em>194 Md. 236, 241, 71 A.2d 20 (1950). <em>See also Centennial Ins. v. State Farm Mutual, </em>71 Md.App. 152, 158, 524 A.2d 110 (1987). These principles, however, apply <em>only </em>if there is a conflict. Under Maryland law, a court\u2019s interpretation of a policy must be based on its plain meaning and, if a case involves a claim of double coverage, a court should attempt to reconcile any conflict. <em>Nat\u2019l Indem. Co. v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>61 Md.App. 575, 487 A.2d 1191 (1985). <em>See also Nat\u2019l Grange Mut. Ins. Co. v. Pinkney, </em>284 Md. 694, 399 A.2d 877 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Prior to the circuit court\u2019s determination of the insurers\u2019 legal obligations under the policies, the jury was asked to arrive at a special verdict on the following two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApG\">1. Did the Plaintiff, Allen Ray Nolt, have permission from Lester R. Summers, the owner of Lester R. Summers, Inc., to operate his truck on December 6, 1988 for Charles M. Shirk Trucking Company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>YES_ NO_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">2. If you voted \u201cyes\u201d, then you must answer the following question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">On December 6, 1988, was Mr. Nolt\u2019s truck used exclusively in Shirk\u2019s or Summers\u2019 business as trucker[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">SHIRK_ or SUMMERS_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">To the first question, the jury answered \u201cyes\u201d; Summers did give Nolt permission to operate his truck for Shirk. This question was critical to the determination of whether U.S.F. &amp; G. had <em>any </em>liability in this case. If the jury had answered this question in the negative, U.S.F. &amp; G. would have had no coverage responsibility here. It is conceded that the jury\u2019s affirmative answers mean that, at the very least, U.S.F. &amp; G. is an excess insurer of Nolt because he is a covered \u201cinsured,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>using the vehicle with Summers\u2019 permission, under U.S.F. &amp; G.\u2019s policy with Summers.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">The significance of the second question is not as clear. Apparently, it was originally propounded in an effort to assist the judge in determining which company was the primary insurer of Nolt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both the policy that U.S.F. &amp; G. issued to Summers and the policy that U.S. Fire issued to Shirk provided primary insurance to a covered auto <em>only </em>while (1) \u201cused exclusively\u201d in the trucking company\u2019s \u201cbusiness as a \u2018trucker\u2019 \u201d and (2) \u201cpursuant to [the trucking company\u2019s] operating rights granted to\u201d it \u201cby a public authority.\u201d If the jury had answered that Nolt\u2019s truck was \u201cused exclusively\u201d in Shirk\u2019s <em>or </em>Summers\u2019 business on December 6, 1988, and this verdict was based on any evidence, the first factor as to primary coverage would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>been determined.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The jury did not answer this question, however, in the originally proposed \u201ceither-or\u201d fashion. Rather, prior to its deliberations, the jury asked for and received the court\u2019s permission, over U.S.F. &amp; G.\u2019s objection, to answer this question as \u201cShirk,\u201d or \u201cSummers,\u201d or \u201cboth.\u201d The jury then answered the question that Nolt\u2019s truck was, in fact, used \u201cexclusively\u201d in <em>both </em>Shirk\u2019s and Summers\u2019 businesses as truckers. Upon hearing this, the trial court, which had during the trial repeatedly stated that U.S.F. &amp; G. and Summers were entitled to a \u201cdirected verdict\u201d that Nolt\u2019s truck was used exclusively for Shirk on the day of the accident, concluded that this was \u201cnot quite a clear question.\u201d The court explained, \u201cAside [from] the jury verdict, there\u2019s no question there was a lease signed, exclusive, but you have another lease signed also saying exclusive, which was not terminated, and you also have the I.C.C. placard and number on the other vehicle, and the I.C.C. statute says that you must have insurance to protect the public.\u201d For this reason, the circuit court \u201crule[d] you\u2019re [U.S.F. &amp; G. and U.S. Fire] jointly and severally liable up to this point\u2014 you have the excess.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">U.S.F. &amp; G. claims that the circuit court erred in permitting the jury to find that Nolt\u2019s truck was used \u201cexclusively\u201d in <em>both </em>Shirk\u2019s and Summers\u2019 business because, it asserts, the undisputed facts establish that Nolt\u2019s truck was used exclusively in Shirk\u2019s business. Accordingly, U.S.F. &amp; G. contends that no conflict exists between the two policies, that U.S. Fire provided primary coverage to Nolt, and that U.S.F. &amp; G. provided only excess coverage. U.S. Fire<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>claims that either the two policies conflict, <em>i.e., </em>both provide primary coverage or both provide excess coverage, and, therefore, the circuit court\u2019s proration of liability between U.S.F. &amp; G. and U.S. Fire was correct under the rules enunciated in <em>Ryder Truck </em>and <em>Celina Mutual </em>or, in the alternative, that the U.S.F. &amp; G. policy provides primary coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">(iii)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The parties agree that the basis for the lower court\u2019s holding is a conflict between the two policies. The only possible basis for such a conflict is evidence that: (1) either Nolt\u2019s truck was used exclusively in <em>both </em>Summers\u2019 business and Shirk\u2019s business <em>and </em>pursuant to operating rights granted to each carrier; or (2) Nolt\u2019s truck was not used exclusively by, and pursuant to, the operating rights of either carrier. In the former situation both carriers would be primary;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in the latter both would be excess. In either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>situation, the policies would be regarded as conflicting and <em>pro rata </em>coverage would then be required. <em>Ryder, </em>259 Md. at 364-65, 269 A.2d 826; <em>Celina Mutual, </em>194 Md. at 241, 71 A.2d 20. Since each policy provides an identical amount of coverage \u2014 $1 million \u2014 the coverage liability of U.S.F. &amp; G. and U.S. Fire would be equal.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">In arguing that the circuit court's holding be affirmed, U.S. Fire concedes, as it must, that on December 6, 1988, Nolt was operating under a bill of lading with Shirk, hauling cargo for Shirk, pursuant to Shirk\u2019s instructions. It claims, however, that the December 6 trip was identical to a number of other trips in which Shirk hired a driver, under an annual lease to Summers, for a day trip, and the driver hauled cargo for Shirk, under Shirk\u2019s bill of lading, following Shirk\u2019s instructions <em>but </em>pursuant to the driver\u2019s lease with Summers, under Summers\u2019 I.C.C. placards and <em>Summers\u2019 insurance. </em>For this reason, U.S. Fire asserts there is evidence that Nolt\u2019s truck was used \u201cexclusively\u201d and pursuant to the operating rights of <em>both </em>Summers and Shirk \u2014 or used \u201cexclusively\u201d by neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">We have searched the record to find evidence to support this theory. There is none. Rather, a number of undisputed facts render it impossible. Accordingly, we reverse. <em>See Canal Ins. Co. v. First General Ins. Co., </em>889 F.2d 604, 607 (5th Cir.1989) (appellate court found facts underlying district court\u2019s declaratory judgment as to liability of insurer of tractor\u2019s lessor were \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d and so reversed).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">First, Nolt and Shirk were in direct contact prior to this trip and contracted directly for this trip. On every other occasion in which Nolt hauled Shirk\u2019s freight, Shirk had contacted Summers or Summers\u2019 dispatcher and contracted with Summers for one of Summers\u2019 drivers and trucks. Second, Nolt and Shirk executed a day-trip lease evidencing their direct contract in which they agreed that Nolt gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Shirk \u201cexclusive and unrestricted control and possession\u201d of the tractor and that Shirk was to provide Nolt with I.C.C. identification placards for the trip, assume \u201ccomplete responsibility for\u201d the truck\u2019s \u201coperation,\u201d and provide liability insurance as required by the I.C.C.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On no other occasion had Shirk executed a lease directly with a driver under lease to Summers; rather, previously, Shirk\u2019s contact and contract were with Summers, and the only lease at issue was Summers\u2019 lease with the driver. Third, although Shirk did not supply Nolt with the required I.C.C. identification placards, Shirk himself testified that this was <em>not </em>because he thought Nolt was working for Summers but because Shirk \u201cforgot\u201d to give Nolt the placards. Thus, according to Shirk\u2019s own testimony, Nolt\u2019s truck was being driven under Summers\u2019 placards, rather than Shirk\u2019s, simply because of Shirk\u2019s mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Fourth, although here, as on prior occasions, when Shirk had contracted with Summers to have a Summers driver haul a load for Shirk, Shirk had prepared a bill of lading, on previous occasions Summers had <em>also </em>prepared a bill of lading. For the December 6 trip no bill of lading was prepared by Summers. Fifth, Nolt and Shirk testified unequivocally that Nolt was working for Shirk, not Summers, on December 6, 1988. Sixth, it is similarly undisputed that Nolt asked the Maryland State Police at the accident to call Shirk, not Summers, and Nolt was in contact with U.S. Fire, not U.S.F. &amp; G., with regard to coverage for the accident. Finally, in Nolt\u2019s daily log, which he was required to keep by I.C.C. regulations and which he signed and certified to be true and correct, he stated that Shirk was the I.C.C. carrier for whom he drove on the December 6, 1988 trip. Indeed, Nolt specifically scratched out Summers\u2019 preprinted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>name and address as the carrier and wrote in Shirk\u2019s name and address. On no other occasion did Nolt certify in his daily log that he was working for Shirk rather than for Summers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In sum, there are simply no facts to support the finding that on December 6, 1988, Nolt\u2019s truck was used exclusively in Summers\u2019 business. Rather, the evidence is uncontroverted that Nolt\u2019s truck was used exclusively in Shirk\u2019s business, hauling Shirk\u2019s load for Shirk\u2019s customers, in accord with Shirk\u2019s bill of lading, as agreed to in a lease between Nolt and Shirk (to which Summers was not a party), in which Shirk contracted to assume complete responsibility for Nolt\u2019s truck. All of the parties so testified. Moreover, this is indicated on all contemporaneous documents, none of which were prepared by Summers, <em>i.e., </em>the day-trip lease and the bill of lading, both of which were prepared by Shirk, and Nolt\u2019s daily log, which Nolt prepared and certified to be correct. Accordingly, Summers\u2019 insurer, U.S.F. &amp; G., was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law that U.S. Fire\u2019s coverage was primary for Nolt\u2019s tractor because, on December 6, 1988, Nolt\u2019s truck was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>hired by Shirk, pursuant to \u201coperating rights\u201d granted to Shirk by the I.C.C., and was \u201cused exclusively\u201d in Shirk\u2019s, and only Shirk\u2019s, business as a \u201ctrucker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">(iv)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Nor do certain I.C.C.-mandated provisions in the leases and insurance policies at issue here, which the circuit court apparently relied upon, require a different result. In 1956, Congress amended the Interstate Commerce Act to allow the I.C.C. to prescribe regulations to ensure that motor carriers would be fully responsible for the operation of vehicles they leased. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 304 (1956) (revised and recodified at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11107 (1978)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> I.C.C. certified carriers are now required to maintain \u201cexclusive possession, control and use of the equipment for the duration of the lease,\u201d and \u201cassume complete responsibility for the operation of the equipment for the duration of the lease.\u201d 49 C.F.R. 1057.12(c). Both the Summers-Nolt annual lease and the Shirk-Nolt day-trip lease contained such a provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">In addition, I.C.C.-certified carriers must maintain insurance or another form of surety so that the carrier is prepared to \u201c \u2018Pay any final judgment recovered against such motor carrier for bodily injuries to or death of any person resulting from the negligent operation, maintenance, or use of motor vehicles\u2019 under the carrier\u2019s permit.\u201d <em>Empire Fire and Marine Ins. Co. v. Guaranty Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>868 F.2d 357, 362 (10th Cir.1989) <em>(quoting </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1043.-1(a)). The I.C.C. enforces this regulation by requiring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>following endorsements in insurance policies obtained by I.C.C. certified carriers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">It is understood and agreed that no condition, provision, stipulation or limitation contained in the policy, this endorsement, or any other endorsement thereon, or violation thereof, shall relieve the company from liability or from the payment of any final judgment, within the limits of liability herein described.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\"><em>See </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.3. Both Summers\u2019 policy with U.S.F. &amp; G. and Shirk\u2019s policy with U.S. Fire contained such an endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">This endorsement is intended to negate any clauses in the body of a carrier\u2019s insurance policy to which it is attached that would have the effect of limiting that carrier's insurance liability; an \u201cexcess coverage\u201d clause is such a \u201ccondition\u201d or \u201climitation\u201d that could \u201crelieve a company of liability.\u201d <em>See Empire Fire, </em>868 F.2d at 363. Because an excess coverage clause is the type of limitation rendered ineffective by the I.C.C. endorsement, a general rule has emerged in some jurisdictions that an I.C.C.-endorsed policy which contains an excess coverage clause is \u201ctreated as affording primary coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>U.S. Fire asserts that this endorsement in the U.S.F. &amp; G./Summers policy means that U.S.F. &amp; G. is the primary insurer. Relying upon <em>Transamerican Freight Lines, Inc. v. Brada Miller Freights Systems, Inc., </em>423 U.S. 28, 96 S.Ct. 229, 46 L.Ed.2d 169 (1975), U.S.F. <em>&amp; </em>G. claims that this endorsement only applies when protection of the public is at stake and cannot be invoked by one insurance company against another in a suit like the one at hand. In <em>Brada Miller, </em>the Supreme Court made clear, albeit in another context, that the I.C.C. regulations, placing on the lessee the non-delegable responsibility for control of the vehicle and provision of liability insurance, existed for the protection of the public, not for the purpose of resolving matters between the parties themselves. \u201cThe party responsible in law to the injured or damaged person may seek indemnity from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>party responsible in fact,\u201d the Court said. 423 U.S. at 40, 96 S.Ct. at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Federal courts have taken one of three positions with respect to the effect of similar I.C.C. endorsements in cases between insurance companies: (1) the endorsement makes the insurance policy to which it attaches primary as a matter of law over other policies which lack such a provision, <em>Hagans v. Glens Falls Ins. Co., </em>465 F.2d 1249 (10th Cir.1972); <em>Argonaut Ins. Co. v. Nat\u2019l Indem. Co., </em>435 F.2d 718 (10th Cir.1971); (2) the endorsement negates all limiting language in the policy to which it is attached, but does not establish sole primary liability as a matter of law, <em>Empire Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Guaranty Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>868 F.2d 357 (10th Cir.1989);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or (3) the endorsement applies only in cases involving claims by a shipper or a member of the public, it does not apply when allocating liability among insurance carriers, and the courts review the language of the insurance policies and state insurance contract law to determine the relative responsibility of insurance carriers. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. v. Transport Ins. Co., </em>787 F.2d 1133, 1140 (7th Cir.1986); <em>Carolina Cas. Ins. Co. v. Ins. Co. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number><em>North America, </em>595 F.2d 128, 138 (3rd Cir.1979); <em>Carolina Cas. Ins. Co. v. Underwriters Ins. Co., </em>569 F.2d 304, 313 (5th Cir.1978); <em>Carolina Cas. Ins. Co. v. Transport Indem. Co., </em>533 F.Supp. 22, 25 (D.S.C.1981), <em>aff'd, </em>676 F.2d 690 (4th Cir.1982) (unpublished opinion), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 829, 108 S.Ct. 65, 74 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Although the parties spend a great deal of time arguing which of these theories is most reasonable and which of these cases we should follow, in fact, these theories are irrelevant and these cases are inapposite here. This is so because, here, in contrast to all of the cases cited above, <em>two </em>insurance policies with the I.C.C. endorsements are involved. In such a situation it is well recognized, even by courts which find the I.C.C. endorsement determinative in disputes between insurance companies, that a different rule is applicable. <em>See, e.g., Railhead Freight Systems, Inc. v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co., </em>924 F.2d 994, 996 (10th Cir.1991); <em>Empire Fire and Marine Ins. v. Guaranty Nat\u2019l Ins., supra, </em>868 F.2d at 365 (dicta); <em>Carolina Cas. Co. v. Transport Indem. Co., supra, </em>488 F.2d at 790. Indeed, both U.S. Fire and U.S.F. &amp; G. agree, citing, quoting, and relying upon the same case, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">It comports with common sense to hold that, when more than one policy contains an ICC endorsement, the insurance company providing coverage to the person or company <em>whose ICC authority was implicated is the primary insurer.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-7\"><em>Empire Indem. Ins. Co. v. Carolina Cas. Indem. Co., </em>838 F.2d 1428, 1432 (5th Cir.1988) (emphasis added). Thus, the critical question here is, not <em>should </em>the insurer with the I.C.C. endorsement be the primary insurer, but <em>which </em>insurer with the I.C.C. endorsement should be the primary insurer. This depends upon which carrier\u2019s I.C.C. authority was \u201cimplicated\u201d \u2014 Shirk\u2019s or Summers\u2019. Maryland law, the policies at issue here, and the facts of this case, as demonstrated within, permit only one answer to that question. On December 6, 1988, Nolt\u2019s truck was used \u201cexclusively\u201d in Shirk\u2019s business; thus, it was Shirk\u2019s I.C.C. authority that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>was \u201cimplicated,\u201d and Shirk\u2019s insurer, U.S. Fire, is the primary insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">(v)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">In addition to issuing a declaration that Nolt was entitled to <em>pro rata </em>insurance coverage from U.S.F. &amp; G. and U.S. Fire, the circuit court also declared that U.S.F. &amp; G. \u201cis liable for the counsel fees and expenses of the Plaintiff in bringing this Declaratory Judgment action\u201d and U.S.F. &amp; G. and U.S. Fire are \u201cjointly liable, on a <em>pro rata </em>basis, for the counsel fees and expenses expended\u201d in the defense of Nolt in the underlying tort action. Because of our holding that U.S. Fire was the primary insurer here and U.S.F. &amp; G. provided only excess coverage, we must reverse the award of these fees against U.S.F. &amp; G. with respect to the underlying tort action. Moreover, because U.S.F. &amp; G.\u2019s obligation to defend Nolt was never triggered, we reverse the trial court\u2019s order that U.S.F. &amp; G. pay Nolt\u2019s costs in the declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Under Maryland law, an insurer has the duty to defend its insured if there is a <em>potentiality </em>that a claim could be covered by a policy. <em>See, e.g., Continental Cas. v. Board of Education, </em>302 Md. 516, 528, 489 A.2d 536 (1985); <em>Brohawn v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>276 Md. 396, 407-408, 347 A.2d 842 (1975); <em>Eastern Shore Financial Resources, Ltd. v. Donegal Mut. Ins. Co., </em>84 Md.App. 609, 617, 581 A.2d 452 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>322 Md. 131, 586 A.2d 13 (1991). A primary insurer\u2019s duty to defend is triggered if a reasonable evaluation of the policy determines that its language and requirements, coupled with the nature of the action against the insured, would necessitate coverage if the action were successful, even if that action is frivolous. <em>See Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v. Lee, </em>62 Md.App. 176, 187, 488 A.2d 988, <em>cert. denied, </em>303 Md. 471, 494 A.2d 939 (1985) <em>(iciting St. Paul Fire and Marine v. Pryseski, </em>292 Md. 187, 194, 438 A.2d 282 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">In contrast, an excess insurer\u2019s duty to defend, and thus its \u201cpotentiality\u201d of coverage, does not arise until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>the full amount of the primary policy is actually exhausted. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. Rairigh, </em>59 Md.App. 305, 322--23, 475 A.2d 509 (1984). Exhaustion of primary coverage is a prerequisite to an excess carrier\u2019s duty to defend; that duty does not arise simply where the claims asserted against the insured exceed the policy limits of the primary insurer. <em>Id. </em>This rule has emerged in recognition that \u201cthe demand in a complaint frequently has little relation to the true value of the claim.\u201d 7C <em>Appleman </em>\u00a7 4682 at 33.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Here, the plaintiff in the underlying tort action sued Nolt for more than $4 million. U.S.F. &amp; G., Nolt\u2019s excess insurer, made no promise in its contract to defend Nolt in claims prior to exhaustion of the primary policy. U.S. Fire, Nolt\u2019s primary insurer, provided him with primary coverage of $1 million; the underlying tort case against Shirk and Nolt settled for significantly less than that. Accordingly, U.S.F. &amp; G.\u2019s duty to defend Nolt under the excess clause was never triggered because his primary insurance covered the full amount of the settlement of the underlying tort claim. U.S.F. &amp; G., therefore, is not liable for the expenses incurred in Nolt\u2019s defense in the underlying tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Similarly, U.S.F. &amp; G. is not liable for Nolt\u2019s costs of prosecuting this declaratory judgment action. Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>der Maryland law, an insurer is required to pay the insured\u2019s expenses in a declaratory judgment action where the insurer\u2019s refusal to defend is unjustified.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Cohen v. American Home Assur. Co., </em>255 Md. 334, 258 A.2d 225 (1969); <em>See also, Bankers &amp; Shippers Ins. Co. v. Electro Enter., </em>287 Md. 641, 648, 415 A.2d 278 (1980); <em>Travelers Indem. Co. v. Ins. Co. of North America, </em>69 Md.App. 664, 680, 519 A.2d 760 (1987); <em>Maryland Auto Ins. Fund v. Sparks, </em>42 Md.App. 382, 395, 400 A.2d 26 (1979). For example, in <em>Maryland Auto Ins. Fund v. Sparks, supra, </em>we held that, despite a finding that the insurer owed the insured a duty to defend, the insured was <em>not </em>required to pay the insured\u2019s attorney fees in the declaratory judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>action due to the \u201cfacts of this case which provide a very close question for determination by the fact finder.\u201d 42 Md.App. at 396, 400 A.2d 26. Similarly, here the question of whether or not Nolt was covered even by the excess provision of the U.S.F. &amp; G. policy was a \u201cvery close question for determination by the fact finder.\u201d There was a conflict in Summers\u2019 and Nolt\u2019s recollection of their conversation as to Nolt obtaining Summers\u2019 permission to drive the truck for others. The jury chose to believe Nolt; but the decision could have gone either way on this issue. Thus it well may be that U.S.F. &amp; G.\u2019s refusal to provide even excess coverage was justified. We need not reach that issue because its obligations as an excess carrier were never triggered. We have found no case where, as here, an insurer which refused to acknowledge its status as excess carrier was thereafter required to assume the insured\u2019s declaratory judgment costs, when the primary insurer assumed all liability in the underlying tort action. Given U.S. Fire\u2019s prompt assumption of its duty to defend Nolt, there was never a time when Nolt faced the prospect of no defense. Accordingly, U.S.F. &amp; G. is not liable for Nolt\u2019s costs in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-7\">. I.C.C. regulations require all I.C.C.-licensed carriers to include such language in their leases. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1057.12(c) (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b364-10\">. Interestingly, in light of the jury\u2019s answer, is the fact that U.S. Fire objected to this question below. U.S.F. &amp; G., after being denied its motion for judgment, specifically requested and formulated the question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\">. As to the second factor, it is undisputed that Nolt was driving pursuant to the \"operating rights\" granted by the I.C.C. to both Summers and Shirk. Thus, the first factor is determinative here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\">. Nolt also seeks to have the circuit court's decision upheld. Most of his argument, however, is directed at issue (v) herein, <em>i.e., </em>the declaration that U.S.F. &amp; G must pay all of Nolt\u2019s fees in the declaratory judgment action and a portion of them in the underlying tort action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>To the extent Nolt makes any argument as to the other issues he follows U.S. Fire's position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b366-8\">. Both policies also require that an \"auto\" be \u201chired\u201d or \u201cborrowed\" by the insured in order for coverage to be primary. U.S. Fire asserts that the \u201clogo liability\" rule should be applied here and requires the conclusion that Nolt\u2019s truck was hired by Summers on December 6, 1988. The \u201clogo liability\" rule has arisen from an I.C.C.-mandated lease provision discussed <em>infra </em>at part iv. A number of courts have held that, because of the I.C.C.-mandated lease provision, when \u201ca carrier lessee permits a lessor [truck owner] to use its [the carrier\u2019s] authority it is responsible\u201d to a tort victim \u201cfor injuries caused thereby even if the lessor is embarked on an undertaking of his own while using the authority.\u201d <em>Rediehs Exp. Inc. v. Maple, </em>491 N.E.2d 1006, 1009 (Ind.App.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>480 U.S. 932, 107 S.Ct. 1571, 94 L.Ed.2d 762 (1987). <em>See also Rodriguez v.

Transamerican Freight Lines, </em>371 F.2d 403 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>387 U.S. 931, 87 S.Ct. 2053, 18 L.Ed.2d 992 (1967); <em>Gudgel v. Southern Shippers, Inc., </em>387 F.2d 723 (7th Cir.1967). Thus, the \u201clogo liability\" rule has been applied in tort actions to make a lessee a statutory employer of the driver and so liable on principles of respondeat superior for the negligence of the driver. There is no need to reach the question of whether the \u201clogo liability\u201d rule should be applied in this declaratory judgment action to make Summers the statutory employer of Nolt because here it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>undisputed that Nolt\u2019s truck was under lease to, and therefore <em>hired </em>by, <em>both </em>Summers and Shirk on December 6, 1988.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b368-6\">. Shirk testified that he and Nolt orally agreed to terms and he drew up the day trip lease himself the night <em>before </em>the accident, but Nolt did not sign it until the next day, right after the accident; Nolt testified that he executed it before the accident. In any event, no party disputes the existence of a valid day-trip lease between Shirk and Nolt was in effect for December 6, 1988, the day of the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b369-6\">. There is one other significant difference between the December 6 trip and other occasions on which Nolt drove for Shirk. That is the method and amount of payment to the parties. For the December 6 trip, Shirk paid Nolt directly a percentage of the gross amount he (Shirk) received from his customer for the trip. On all other occasions Shirk paid Summers a percentage of the gross amount Shirk received from his customer, and Summers, in turn, paid Nolt after retaining a commission for itself. Apparently, no arrangements as to method or precise amount of payment (it was agreed that it would be the normal percentage) were made by Shirk and Nolt prior to the accident. Shirk testified that, a few days after the accident, he discussed Nolt\u2019s payment with Summers who said, \u201cYou just pay him and let me out of it.\u201d Summers testified he did not remember that conversation but did not dispute it, explaining: \u201cI\u2019m not involved, I haven\u2019t been involved in this thing from Monday to Friday. Why would I want to get involved in it Saturday? The whole thing\u2019s over with. I haven\u2019t been involved in it.\u201d Contrary to U.S. Fire\u2019s contention, this does not appear to be simply a \"hindsight\u201d deviation from normal routine; however, because there was no agreement as to direct payment <em>prior </em>to the accident, that factor is <em>not </em>part of our analysis set forth in the text of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\">. Prior to Congress\u2019s action, the use by truckers of leased or borrowed vehicles led to a number of abuses threatening public safety. ICC-licensed carriers used leased vehicles to avoid safety regulations governing equipment and drivers; in addition, the use of non-owned vehicles led to public confusion as to who was financially responsible for accidents caused by those vehicles. <em>See Empire Fire Marine Ins. Co. v. Guaranty Nat'l Ins. Co., </em>868 F.2d 357, 362 (10th Cir.1989) <em>(citing American Trucking Ass\u2019ns v.

Co., 275 </em>Md. 460, 341 A.2d 399 (1975), adopted either the first or second position set forth above, both of which are espoused chiefly in Tenth Circuit cases. In <em>Federal, </em>the Court of Appeals, in affirming this court, held that the I.C.C. endorsement changed the normal order of priority of policies with conflicting \"other insurance\" clauses and rendered the policy containing the I.C.C. endorsement primary as a matter of law. 275 Md. at 477-480, 341 A.2d 399. Two things are noteworthy about <em>Federal. </em>First, it predates the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Brada Miller </em>and the more recent federal cases adopting a different position in response to <em>Brada Miller. </em>Second, and more important for the case at hand, <em>Federal, </em>like all of the other cases adopting the first or second position set forth in text above, involved only <em>one </em>insurance policy that had an I.C.C. endorsement. Indeed, the late Chief Judge Gilbert, speaking for this court in <em>Federal, </em>noted this and distinguished the situation in <em>Federal </em>from that in <em>Carolina Cas. Co. v. Transport Indem., </em>488 F.2d 790 (10th Cir.1973) for this very reason. <em>See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Federal Ins. Co., </em>23 Md.App. 105, 118, 326 A.2d 29 (1974), <em>modified, Federal Ins.

Accordingly, <em>Federal, </em>like other cases having only one insurance policy with an I.C.C. endorsement, is inapposite here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\">. A number of additional arguments support the rule against requiring an excess carrier to defend an insured when the initial duty properly rests with the primary insurer. For example, a primary insurer should not be able to avoid or reduce its obligations under an insurance contract, simply because the insured happens to be privy to an excess policy. <em>See, e.g., Transport lndem. Co. v. Home Indem. Co., </em>535 F.2d 232, 238 (3rd Cir.1976); <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Surety Co. v. Certain Underwriters, </em>56 Cal.App.3d 791, 806, 129 Cal.Rptr. 47 (1976). Moreover, requiring an excess insurer to provide insurance before the exhaustion of the primary limits \"invites a change of attorneys and other staff ... and can subject the insured to questions as to who will provide him with a defense.\u201d 7C <em>Appleman </em>\u00a7 4682 at 32. <em>See also Raymond v. Monsanto Co., </em>329 F.Supp. 247 (D.N.H.1971). Furthermore, as long as the \"primary carrier is providing a defense that it should be giving to the insured, the insured is not being prejudiced because the excess insurer has not entered into the defense of the claim.\u201d 7C <em>Appleman </em>\u00a7 4682 at 31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b376-5\">. Other jurisdictions are divided over the issue of when, if ever, an insurer must pay for an insured\u2019s declaratory judgment action to determine a duty to defend. <em>See generally </em>Annotation, <em>Insured\u2019s Right to Recover Attorney\u2019s Fees Incurred in Declaratory Judgment Action to Determine Existence of Coverage Under Liability Policy, </em>87 A.L.R.3d 429 (1979). First, some courts adhere to the \"American Rule\u201d of attorney\u2019s fees, which mandates that, in the absence of a contractual provision, statute, or recognized ground of equity, attorney\u2019s fees in a declaratory judgment action are not recoverable, even though an insurer\u2019s duty to defend is found to exist. <em>See, e.g., Kremers-Urban Co. v.

Rees, </em>27 Wash.App. 369, 617 P.2d 747, 749 (1980), <em>aff'd, </em>96 Wash.2d 679, 638 P.2d 580 (1982). Second, other courts permit recovery if it can be shown that the insurer acted in bad faith, fraudulently, unreasonably, or was stubbornly litigious. <em>See, e.g., American Family Life Assur. Co. </em>v. <em>U.S. Fire Ins. Co., </em>885 F.2d 826, 834-35, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>892 F.2d 89 (11th Cir.1989); <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc. v. Pacific Indem. Co., </em>557 F.2d 51, 60 (3rd Cir.1977); <em>Western Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Marchant, </em>615 P.2d 423, 427 (Utah 1980); <em>American Family Mutual Ins. Co. v. Brown, </em>631 S.W.2d 375, 379 (Mo.App.1982). The third segment of courts hold that, \"where a declaratory judgment action is filed to determine whether an insurer has a duty to defend its insured under its policy, if the insurer is found to have such a duty, its insured is entitled to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees arising from the declaratory judgment action.\u201d <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Pitrolo, </em>342 S.E.2d 156, 161-62 (W.Va.1986). <em>See also Green v. J.C. Penney Auto Ins. Co., Inc., </em>806 F.2d 759, 765-66 (7th Cir.1986). Maryland law falls closest to the second group of cases; when an insured in Maryland initiates a declaratory judgment action against an insurer in Maryland, the insurer is required to pay the insured\u2019s expenses in that action where the refusal to defend is <em>unjustified.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
