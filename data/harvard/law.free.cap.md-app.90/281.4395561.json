A Motion for Reconsideration was filed by appellant on February 11, 1991. An appeal was filed to this Court on March 5,1991 from the judgment of February 5, 1991. The trial court denied the motion for reconsideration on May 2, 1991 and, on May 17, 1991, a second appeal was filed from the denial of the motion for reconsideration and \u201cany judgments which may not have been considered final until the May 2, 1991 judgments because of the motion for reconsideration.\u201d Based on the foregoing we are satisfied that all of the judgments from which appellant intended to appeal are properly before this . Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">The judgment underlying the garnishment issues raised in this appeal was obtained by appellant Flat Iron Mac Associates (\u201cFlat Iron\u201d) against Maurice P. Foley (\u201cFoley\u201d) in the Circuit Court of the City of Norfolk, Virginia. The judgment was in the amount of $239,621.09, plus 8% annual interest, costs of $76.00 and attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $10,075.00. On June 9, 1989, Flat Iron recorded the judgment in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Maryland.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since the recording of the judgment, Flat Iron has made valiant but unsuccessful efforts to collect.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\n<em>Issues Presented</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">I. Issues as to M. Carol Jawish:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">A. Can a garnishee\u2019s receipt of a debtor\u2019s property, to which she obtains legal, but not beneficial title, constitute a fraudulent conveyance under Maryland law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">B. In Maryland, does a writ of garnishment of property attach a debtor\u2019s property in a garnishee\u2019s hands on the date of service and his property coming into garnishee\u2019s hands thereafter, but prior to entry of judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-9\">C. Should a judgment creditor be entitled to judgment for all debtor\u2019s property in garnishee\u2019s hands, both at the time of service and thereafter, if the judgment creditor does not specifically allege or plead that the writ also seeks the \"after service\u201d property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-10\">D. If an allegation of \u201cafter service\u201d property is required and not made, is it an abuse of discretion for the trial court to deny leave to allow the judgment creditor to amend its pleadings accordingly?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">II. Issue as to Chevy Chase Savings Bank, F.S.B.: Should a bank be required to honor a writ of garnishment to attach all property of the debtor, when funds \u2014 which the bank is on actual notice belong to debtor \u2014 are placed in the account of another, who freely admits the funds belong to the debtor?</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">III. Issues as to Marriott Corporation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-13\">A. May a judgment creditor\u2019s untimeliness in replying to a garnishee\u2019s answer be excused when: (a) such un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>timeliness is due solely to judgment creditor\u2019s inability to contest garnishee\u2019s answer in good faith because of garnishee\u2019s failure to divulge information about the debtor uniquely in the garnishee\u2019s possession; (b) a reply was filed prior to the filing of a motion for judgment by garnishee; and (c) there has been no argument of prejudice because of the untimely filing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">B. Was it an abuse of discretion for the court to dismiss a writ of garnishment of property under Maryland Rule 2-645 due to an untimely reply where, prior to the filing of the reply, the garnishee filed no motion to dismiss the writ, the court did not dismiss it, and there has been no argument of prejudice because of the late filing?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\n<em>Statement of Facts Jawish</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">A writ of attachment was issued, in October 1989, against Jawish, individually and d/b/a International Realty Consultants, Inc. (\u201cIRC\u201d). In a subsequent deposition, Jawish admitted that from approximately March 1988 until late October 1989, either she had deposited or had allowed Foley to deposit Foley\u2019s funds into her personal checking account in the Chevy Chase Savings Bank, F.S.B. (\u201cChevy Chase\u201d). In order that the money so deposited would be available to Foley, Jawish supplied Foley with blank checks, signed by her, or blank checks on which Foley would sign Jawish\u2019s name. From March 1988 through October 1989, more than $250,000.00 of Foley's money passed through Jawish\u2019s account. Jawish freely admitted, in her deposition, that she permitted Foley to use the account because \u201c[sjomeone had attached all the moneys in the one account that he had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ALV\">On December 6, 1989, Flat Iron had a second writ of garnishment served on Jawish,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by which it attempted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>reach all of Foley\u2019s funds that had passed through Jawish\u2019s account based on a fraudulent conveyance theory. Jawish confessed to holding $141.48 of Foley\u2019s money on the date of service, December 6, 1989, and, in addition, denied any fraudulent conveyance. Flat Iron responded by reasserting its fraudulent conveyance claim. Subsequent to the December 6th writ, an additional $40,000 of Foley\u2019s money passed through Jawish\u2019s account. In August 1990, Jawish was served with Flat Iron\u2019s new complaint alleging fraudulent conveyance and in September 1990 Flat Iron filed motions for summary judgment against Jawish in both the garnishment action and fraudulent conveyance action. Flat Iron alleged a total of $290,000.00 of Foley\u2019s money passed through Jawish\u2019s account from March of 1988 to August of 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">After a hearing on February 5, 1991, the court entered judgment against Jawish in the amount of $141.48. At this hearing and without any amendment to the pleadings, Flat Iron sought to attach funds which came into Jawish\u2019s account after December 6, 1989 but prior to the date of hearing. The court found that the only issue before it was the December 6, 1989 attachment and it denied Flat Iron\u2019s attempt to go beyond that date. Flat Iron\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\n<em>Chevy Chase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">A writ of garnishment on the property of Maurice P. Foley was served on Chevy Chase on August 3, 1989. On the same day, Chevy Chase filed an answer in which it denied holding any funds in the name of Maurice P. Foley. When advised informally that the account was in Jawish\u2019s name, Flat Iron supplied evidence to the bank\u2019s counsel that the money in Jawish\u2019s account belonged to Foley. Chevy Chase, however, maintained its denial. This motivated Flat Iron to file a partial motion for summary judgment to which Chevy Chase responded with an opposition to that motion and its own motion for summary judgment. After a hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>ing on February 5,1991, Chevy Chase\u2019s motion was granted and summary judgment entered in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\n<em>Marriott</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Flat Iron filed writs of garnishment against Marriott on August 2, 1989, for property and wages belonging to Maurice P. Foley. In its answer, Marriott stated that Foley was not an employee and that Marriott was not holding any of his property. Flat Iron did not file timely responses to Marriott\u2019s answer in accordance with Md.Rules 2-645(g) and 2-646(g). Flat Iron did not respond until over one year later when, on October 17, 1990, it filed a motion for partial summary judgment. Marriott filed a cross motion for judgment which was granted based on Flat Iron\u2019s failure to comply with the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">I.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Flat Iron contends that Jawish\u2019s receipt of funds from Foley constitutes fraudulent conveyance. The appeal before us today arises from Civil Action No. 43729, a writ of garnishment action by Flat Iron against Jawish based in part on a fraudulent conveyance theory. In addition to this action, Flat Iron filed a separate suit, Civil Action No. 61121, also alleging fraudulent conveyance by Jawish. At a hearing on February 5, 1991, the trial court denied Jawish\u2019s motion to dismiss two of the counts alleging fraudulent conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud in Civil Action No. 61121; denied Flat Iron\u2019s request for summary judgment on those two counts; and denied Flat Iron\u2019s request to consolidate the two civil actions because Judge Miller found that the actions did not require the same evidence. (The trial court\u2019s denial of summary judgment was not entered as a final judgment.) Trial for Civil Action No. 61121 is set for early 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">In <em>Dodson v. Temple Hill Baptist Church, </em>248 Md. 697, 702-03, 238 A.2d 239 (1967), the Court of Appeals recognized that a judgment creditor, in an attachment proceeding for money, was entitled to present evidence that a debtor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>had fraudulently conveyed property to a garnishee, and if so proved, the judgment creditor was entitled to collect the amount so conveyed from the garnishee even if the judgment creditor could not collect from the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Judge Miller found that there were sufficient facts to let the case go to trial on fraudulent conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud counts in Civil Action No. 61121 but never made factual determinations or decided the issue of fraudulent conveyance presented in Civil Action No. 43729.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">We remand to the trial court, with instruction to consolidate Civil Action No. 43729 and Civil Action No. 61121, for resolution of the fraud claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">I.B., and C.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Flat Iron contends that a writ of garnishment of property attaches the debtor\u2019s property in the garnishee\u2019s hands on the date the writ is served and any property belonging to the debtor which comes into the garnishee\u2019s hands thereafter, but prior to entry of judgment, even if the judgment creditor does not plead \u201cafter service\u201d property specifically.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">Appellee Jawish claims that it is well-settled in Maryland that a writ of garnishment applies only to property held as of the date of service of the writ. Jawish argues this is so because Maryland Rule 2-645(j) requires that the \u201cjudgment shall be limited to the value of the property of the judgment debtor ... in the hands of the garnishee____\u201d This argument is weak in light of the history of attachment of property in Maryland, and the plain language of the statute. We agree with Flat Iron\u2019s contention and hold that under the principles of attachment in Maryland the trial court erred by limiting the judgment to the amount of Foley\u2019s money in the hands of Jawish at the time the writ was served and not including property which came into Jawish\u2019s possession after service but prior to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">The statute does not specify the time frame in which the debtor\u2019s property must come into the hands of the gar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>nishee in order for the garnishee to be accountable for it under the writ. Under Md.Rule l-201(c) we look to the common law to fill in this omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The history of attachment of property in Maryland and a thorough explanation of this law was provided by the Court of Appeals in <em>Bedding Co. v. Warehouse Co., </em>146 Md. 479, 487-493, 126 A. 902 (1924). In summary, the Court established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">This early construction of the statute, that an attachment affects all property and credits of the debtor in the hands of the garnishee or which may come to his hands at any time after laying the attachment and before trial, is the settled law of this State, (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">[FJrom the time of the garnishment, the goods in the possession of the garnishee, or that may come into his possession prior, to the trial, are considered as in <em>custodia legis, </em>and the garnishee is bound to keep them safely____ It is his duty to hold them until the question of his liability is determined, as well against the defendant as against any subsequent purchaser or pledgee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-11\"><em>Id., </em>at 491-492, 126 A. 902. The Court noted that the applicability of garnishment from the time of service until trial was a leading characteristic of the remedy of attachment in Maryland, and in large part responsible for its effectiveness. <em>Northwestern Nat\u2019l. Ins. v. Wetherall, </em>272 Md. 642, 654, 325 A.2d 869 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">Recently, this Court, in resolving the priority of claims for the debtor\u2019s money obtained by a writ of garnishment of property under the current Md.Rule 2-645, reaffirmed that \u201c \u2018an attachment on judgment served on a garnishee creates an inchoate lien which is binding not only on all the judgment debtor\u2019s assets which the garnishee then has in his possession, but also on all those which come into his hands before judgment in the garnishment action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard County v. Allnutt, Inc., </em>74 Md.App. 422, 426, 538 A.2d 321 (1988) (quoting <em>Fico, Inc. v. Ghingher, </em>287 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>150, 161, 411 A.2d 430 (1980)). Thus, a writ of garnishment of property, as a matter of law, includes all of the debtor\u2019s property in the hands of the garnishee and which comes into the hands of the debtor prior to trial or entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Jawish contends that even if a writ of garnishment covers \u201cafter service\u201d property, Flat Iron failed to raise the issue of future funds in its Reply to Jawish\u2019s Answer to the Writ of Garnishment and also in its Motion for Summary Judgment. Jawish argues, therefore, that the issue was not before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Jawish gives no documentary or legal support for this argument and we will not provide either for her benefit. We hold that it was not necessary for Flat Iron to plead \u201cafter service\u201d funds, specifically, because the writ of garnishment served on Jawish directed her, individually and d/b/a International Realty Consultants, Inc., \u201cto hold the property of the judgment Debtor named above [Maurice P. Foley] <em>subject to further proceedings in this Court.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In light of the law of attachment in Maryland, this language sufficiently instructed the garnishee to hold any and all of the debtor\u2019s property of which she was possessed from the time she received the garnishment until court proceedings were held. This language in no way implies the only property that was to be held was that which was in her possession at the very moment the writ was served. Interpreting this language in the writ or the law of garnishment to permit seizure of only that property in hand at the time of service would result in waste of judicial resources. The judgment creditor would be required to appear in court at least daily to prevent a debtor from continuing to use a particular garnishee to shield the debtor\u2019s easily transferable assets, e.g. money, from the creditor and would be required to constantly amend his pleading every time a new asset, or even the same asset once again, came into the garnishee\u2019s possession prior to trial or entry of judgment. The garnishee would be able to continue to aid the debtor by shielding the debtor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>assets with impunity, despite the court issued writ, thereby defeating the whole purpose of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The purpose of attachment is to place the debtor\u2019s property \u201con hold\u201d until the court determines its proper disposition given the various legal claims to it. \u201c[U]ntil judgment ..., the attachment serves the useful function of preventing the garnishee from prematurely disposing of any of the judgment debtor\u2019s assets.\u201d <em>Fico, </em>287 Md. at 162, 411 A.2d 430. The effect of laying the attachment in the hands of the garnishee is to warn and notify her that all property of the debtor, then in or coming into her hands subsequently, is subject to the inchoate lien of the attachment by garnishment. <em>Bedding Co., </em>146 Md. at 493, 126 A. 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Once served with a writ of garnishment \u201cit is the garnishee\u2019s duty to hold the attached assets until the entry of a judgment in the garnishment action.\u201d <em>Fico, </em>287 Md. at 162, 411 A.2d 430 (citing <em>Northwestern Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. Wetherall, </em>267 Md. 378, 385, 298 A.2d 1 (1972); <em>Bedding Co., </em>146 Md. at 492, 126 A. 902). Consequently, if the property possessed by the garnishee, after service but prior to judgment, is not in the hands of the garnishee at the time of the judgment hearing, because the garnishee surrendered the property to the debtor, the garnishee is liable for the value of the debtor\u2019s property which came into her hands from the time she was served with the writ until the time of the hearing, and a judgment <em>in personam </em>will be rendered against the garnishee for any deficiency. <em>Bedding Co., </em>146 Md. at 492, 126 A. 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">In the case <em>subjudice, </em>Jawish was served on December 6, 1989, with a writ of garnishment for property belonging to Foley. The writ instructed Jawish to hold Foley\u2019s property until further court proceedings. Flat Iron replied to Jawish\u2019s answer dated January 8, 1990, on January 26, 1990. The Reply refers to the $141.18, because that is the amount Jawish claimed to have in her account at the time of service. Flat Iron\u2019s Reply went on to contend that Jawish had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>$275,000 at the time of service. Clearly this does not and cannot limit the amount garnished by the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Because Flat Iron\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is not in the Record Extract we are under no obligation to review Jawish\u2019s contention that it limited Flat Iron\u2019s claim to \u201cafter service\u201d funds. We have reviewed the Summary Judgment document in the court record, however, and we find nothing in it that would limit the requirement that Jawish retain for Flat Iron\u2019s benefit all funds coming into her possession from the time of service until the court proceedings. The first court proceedings following Jawish\u2019s receipt of the writ took place on February 5, 1991. Under Maryland law, Jawish was required to hold all property belonging to Foley which came into her possession from December 6,1989 until February 5, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">On February 5, the trial court heard arguments about the amount of Foley's money in Jawish\u2019s Chevy Chase checking account on the date of service, namely, $141.48. The trial court refused to consider other funds belonging to Foley which passed through Jawish's account prior to the hearing, but after the filing of Jawish\u2019s answer. The trial court based its decision on the mistaken belief that under Md. Rule 2-645(j) the judgment was limited to the value of the property of the judgment debtor confessed by Jawish in her answer to the writ of garnishment. Jawish\u2019s answer was filed 30 days after the writ was served, more than one year before the hearing, and admitted funds possessed on the date of service only. The trial judge ruled that funds beyond those admitted in the answer were \u201cfuture\u201d funds and, therefore, could not be considered. The trial court erred in limiting the judgment to the amount of Foley\u2019s money in the hands of Jawish on the date the writ of garnishment was served. We remand to the trial court for an accounting of funds which were in the possession of Jawish for the benefit of Foley from December 6, 1989 through February 5, 1991, and the entry of a judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>I.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Whether the trial court abused its discretion by prohibiting Flat Iron from amending its pleading is moot, since we hold, as a matter of law, the writ of garnishment includes property coming into the possession of the garnishee after service but prior to judgment, and we find nothing in Flat Iron\u2019s pleading which limited this requirement in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Flat Iron contends that the court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Chevy Chase because Chevy Chase had actual notice the funds in Jawish\u2019s account belonged to Foley and Jawish freely admitted the funds belonged to Foley. Flat Iron, therefore, concludes Chevy Chase was required to honor a writ of garnishment by attaching Foley\u2019s funds in Jawish\u2019s account. We disagree and affirm the trial court\u2019s granting of Chevy Chase\u2019s request for summary judgment. We hold it was the duty of Flat Iron to identify accurately the debtor and the location of the debtor\u2019s property, and to obtain a writ which correctly attached the property. Chevy Chase had no duty to conduct an independent investigation on behalf of Flat Iron to identify the location of the Foley property. Specifically, Chevy Chase was not obligated to search for the debtor under any name but that specified in the writ of garnishment, nor was Chevy Chase obligated to make detailed inquiries as to the status of any account not listed in the writ to determine whether part or all of the funds \u201cbelonged\u201d to someone other than the person or persons authorized to use the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Section 5-306 of the Financial Institutions Article which directs the activities of a bank with respect to adverse claims to property it holds reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a banking institution is not required to recognize or take any action on any claim to a deposit or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>money or property held by it or contained in a safe-deposit box, if that claim is adverse to the interests of any person who, on its records, appears to be entitled to the deposit, money or property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">(b) <em>Effect of court order. </em>\u2014 If, in an action to which the adverse claimant is a party, a court order or decree involving a claim to the deposit, money, or property is served on the banking institution, the banking institution may or, if required by the court, shall impound the deposit, money, or property, subject to further order of the court, without, any liability on its part to anyone for doing so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Md.Fin.Inst.Code Ann. \u00a7 5-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">This Court has noted that \u201c[f]or the purposes of garnishment a bank deposit <em>prima facia </em>belongs to the person in whose name it stands, the general test being whether, but for the garnishment, the deposit would be subject to defendant\u2019s check, or whether defendant could sue the bank therefor in debt or assumpsit.\u201d <em>Wanex v. Provident State Bank, </em>53 Md.App. 409, 413, 454 A.2d 381 (1983) (quoting 38 C.J.S. Garnishment \u00a7 80 (1943)).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The Writ of Garnishment for Property served upon Chevy Chase named Maurice P. Foley only. It did not name M. Carol Jawish, nor did it mention the specific account in the name of M. Carol Jawish. Jawish was the sole record owner of the account in question and Foley was not an authorized signatory. Even if Chevy Chase had actual notice of Foley\u2019s use of Jawish\u2019s account, Chevy Chase had no authority to take action without a court order or decree identifying Jawish's account. It was Flat Iron\u2019s responsibility to obtain such a court order, not Chevy Chase\u2019s. Flat Iron could have taken the evidence of Jawish\u2019s involvement, it presented to Chevy Chase, to the court and sought an injunction and/or new writ of garnishment correctly identifying Jawish\u2019s account. Chevy Chase fulfilled its responsibility by checking its records for authorized account owners and users. Chevy Chase was not required to undergo a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>detailed investigation but rather was entitled to rely on the name on the account as <em>prima facia </em>evidence that the funds belonged to Jawish. <em>Wanex, </em>53 Md.App. at 413, 454 A.2d 381. Counsel for Flat Iron conceded twice, at the February 5th hearing, that Chevy Chase had not acted in bad faith or participated willfully in a scheme to defraud Flat Iron. The burden of proof of the garnishee\u2019s liability is on the judgment creditor. <em>Walsh v. Lewis Swim. Pool Constr., </em>256 Md. 608, 610, 261 A.2d 475 (1970). Flat Iron has not proved that Chevy Chase acted inconsistently with the court ordered writ of garnishment or its authority under \u00a7 5-306. We affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the writ of garnishment served on Chevy Chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">III.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Flat Iron contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it dismissed the writ of garnishment served on Marriott because Flat Iron failed to reply to Marriott\u2019s answer within the 30 day time period required by Md.Rule 2-645(g). Flat Iron argues it was unable to reply in good faith to Marriott\u2019s answer, denying it held property belonging to Foley, because Marriott failed to divulge the basis for its answer. We affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling that the writ of garnishment for property served on Marriott terminated, absent a reply by Flat Iron, within 30 days of the filing of Marriott\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Garnishment rights and proceedings are created by statute and \u201ctheir existence is dependent upon special provisions authorizing them.\u201d <em>Northwestern Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>267 Md. at 384, 298 A.2d 1. Maryland Rule 2-645 governs the garnishment of property. It prescribes the time frames within which the judgment creditor and garnishee must act to protect their respective rights under the statute and the remedies for failure to abide by the time frames. Subsection (g) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">If the garnishee files a timely answer, the matters set forth in <em>the answer shall be treated as established </em>for the purpose of the garnishment proceeding <em>unless the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>judgment creditor files a reply </em>contesting the answer <em>within 30 days </em>after its service. If a timely reply is not filed, the court may enter judgment upon request of the judgment creditor, the judgement debtor, or the garnishee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">Marriott answered the writ of garnishment of Foley\u2019s property on August 14,1989, denying it held property belonging to Foley. Flat Iron did not file a reply to Marriott\u2019s answer until January 29, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Flat Iron concedes it did not file a reply within the 30 day time period but argues that (1) it was unable to reply within the 30 days, in good faith because Marriott withheld unique information about Foley that was solely within Marriott\u2019s control, and (2) the trial court was not required, although it was permitted, to deem Marriott\u2019s answer as established. We do not find Flat Iron\u2019s first argument persuasive and we disagree with its second.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Maryland Rule 2-645(e) requires only that Marriott admit or deny possession of property belonging to Foley, which it properly did in its August 14, 1989 answer. Flat Iron does not deny this and even conceded that Marriott acted in good faith at all times. Maryland Rule 2-645 imposes no duty on Marriott to investigate Foley or IRC on behalf of Flat Iron, or volunteer information beyond admitting or denying its possession of Foley\u2019s property. We assume that Flat Iron had a good faith basis for seeking a writ of garnishment against Marriott in the first place and assume this good faith basis would have supported Flat Iron\u2019s further pursuit of discovery after Marriott\u2019s answer. Under Md.Rule 2-645(h) Flat Iron could have filed, but did not file, interrogatories directed at Marriott\u2019s reasons for answering as it did and further exploring Marriott\u2019s knowledge of Foley. And Flat Iron could have, but did not, request an extension of the 30 day period from the court. For these reasons, we find Flat Iron\u2019s first argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Precedent in Maryland, as well as the plain language of Md.Rule 2-645, mandates that Marriott\u2019s answer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>denying that it held Foley\u2019s property, was established when Flat Iron failed to reply. \u201cThe word \u2018shall\u2019 in a statute is \u2018presumed mandatory on the parties, denoting \u201can imperative obligation inconsistent with the exercise of discretion.\u2019\u201d\u201d <em>Robinson v. Pleet, </em>76 Md.App. 173, 544 A.2d 1 (1988) (quoting <em>Tranen v. Aziz, </em>59 Md.App. 528, 534, 476 A.2d 1170 (1984)) (citing <em>Johnson v. State, </em>282 Md. 314, 321, 384 A.2d 709 (1978)). Since the statute created a garnishment right not existing at common law, compliance with the time periods established in the statute is a condition precedent to maintaining an action. <em>Trimper v. Porter-Hayden, </em>305 Md. 31, 35, 501 A.2d 446 (1985) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Because Marriott\u2019s answer, namely that Marriott did not hold any of Foley\u2019s property, was established for the purpose of the garnishment proceeding, the fact that Marriott did not request the court to enter judgment until after Flat Iron filed its untimely reply cannot change the outcome, as urged by Flat Iron. The writ of garnishment against Marriott was properly dismissed because Marriott held no property of Foley\u2019s, as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">III.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Flat Iron contends that its August 2; 1989 writ of garnishment of wages, answered by Marriott on August 14, 1989, was not automatically dismissed by Flat Iron\u2019s failure to request a hearing within 15 days after service of the answer because the court did not formally dismiss the writ until February 5,1991. Flat Iron argues, therefore, that its writ is first in time and has priority over Foley\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s writ served on Marriott on November 17, 1989. We hold that Flat Iron\u2019s writ was not first in time. The writ of garnishment terminated at the expiration of the 15 day period, as a matter of law, because Flat Iron did not request a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Maryland Rule 2-646 establishes the procedure for garnishment of wages. Subsection (e) provides that the garnishee shall answer the writ within 30 days of service. When an answer is filed subsection (g) provides: \u201cIf the answer denies employment, <em>the court shall </em>dismiss the proceeding against the garnishee unless the creditor files a request for hearing within 15 days after service of the answer.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plain language of this rule makes termination of the writ mandatory when the judgment creditor fails to request a hearing within the 15 day period. <em>Robinson, </em>76 Md.App. 173, 544 A.2d 1. The statute does not require the garnishee to move for dismissal, but places the responsibility for dismissing the writ on the court. Thus, under Md.Rule 2-646, in the absence of a timely request for a hearing to contest an answer which denies employment, the garnishment proceeding terminates with respect to the garnishee, as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In the case <em>sub judice </em>Flat Iron\u2019s writ of garnishment of Foley\u2019s wages, dated August 2, 1989, was answered by Marriott on August 14, 1989. Marriott denied employing Foley. Flat Iron concedes that Foley was not an employee of Marriott on that date and did not become an employee of Marriott\u2019s until November 6, 1989. Flat Iron did not request a hearing within the prescribed 15 day period and at the end of that period the writ of garnishment terminated as to Marriott, even though the court had not taken the ministerial step to dismiss the writ. Flat Iron served Marriott with a second writ of garnishment of Foley\u2019s wages on November 30, 1989, thirteen days after Foley\u2019s ex-wife served Marriott with a similar writ. Under Md.Rule 2-646(i) \u201cif a garnishee is served with more than one writ for the same debtor, the writs shall be satisfied in the order in which served.\u201d Having been served with Foley\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s writ first, Marriott is obligated to satisfy it before satisfying Flat Iron\u2019s writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>JUDGMENT VACATED IN PART AS TO JAWISH AND CASE REMANDED FOR AN ACCOUNTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION.
