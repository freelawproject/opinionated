The court imposed probation before judgment and placed Willey on three years of supervised probation. On March 1 and 7 of 1988, Willey assaulted Jackson and Chris Luecking. Willey was convicted of two out of the four charges lodged against him in the District Court for Anne Arundel County. Those convictions became final on February 3, 1989. Thereafter, on December 7, 1989, Judge Themelis held a violation of probation hearing. The court decided to revoke Willey\u2019s probation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">I\u2019m going to strike probation before judgment and enter in lieu thereof a finding of guilt. I\u2019m going to impose 14 years to the Division of Correction____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">Willey appealed that decision to our court. In an unreported opinion, <em>Willey v. State, </em>(Md.Ct.Spec.App. No. 190, September Term, 1990, filed: December 5, 1990) Slip Op., we reversed the judgment and remanded the case for a hearing before a different judge because the lower court had predetermined guilt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">In the interim, Willey was convicted of murder in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>On April 2,1991, Judge Friedman of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City held the second violation of probation hearing. This time, the court imposed a sentence of fifteen years on Willey.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">THE COURT: All right. This case comes before me today with a most unfortunate history. There is no doubt about that. I think that the death of the victim in the case, for which Mr. Willey was convicted of first degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence would not have occurred if Mr. Willey had not gone to wherever that woman [Shifflett] was and shot her____ Mr. Willey is apparently a dangerous and deadly man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">All right. The Court had previously in this case granted probation before judgment, so that the judgment was stayed. Judgment in this case is reinstated, and the probation before judgment is struck. And I impose a sentence of 15 years consecutive to the sentence which Mr. Willey is presently serving____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Willey appeals his sentence and asks whether his sentence is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">In his brief, Willey contends that his sentence of fifteen years \u201crepresents an illegal increase in Appellant\u2019s sentence resulting from a successful appeal.\u201d To support his position, Willey cites <em>Jones v. State, </em>307 Md. 449, 514 A.2d 1219 (1986) and \u00a7 12-702(b) of the Courts Article.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-13\">(b) <em>Remand for sentence or new trial; limitations on increases in sentences. </em>\u2014 If an appellate court remands a criminal case to a lower court in order that the lower <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>court may pronounce the proper judgment or sentence, or conduct a new trial, and if there is a conviction following this new trial, the lower court may impose any sentence authorized by law to be imposed as punishment for the offense. However, it may not impose a sentence more severe than the sentence previously imposed for the offense unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\">(1) The reasons for the increased sentence affirmatively appear;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">(2) The reasons are based upon additional objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">(3) The factual data upon which the increased sentence is based appears as part of the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">At the time of the <em>Jones </em>decision<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u00a7 12-702(b)(2) read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">(2) The reasons are based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the original sentence was imposed____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">In <em>Briggs v. State, </em>289 Md. 23, 421 A.2d 1369 (1980), the Court of Appeals examined the background of \u00a7 12-702. The Court noted that \u201c[t]he operative language of the statutory enactment derives from <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711 [89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656] [1969]....\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Briggs, </em>289 Md. at 27-28, 421 A.2d 1369. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Subsequent to the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Pearce, </em>our court adopted the <em>Pearce </em>standard in <em>Cherry v. State, </em>9 Md.App. 416, 425, 264 A.2d 887, <em>cert. granted, </em>259 Md. 730 (1970).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <em>Briggs </em>Court pointed out that \u201c[w]ith no decisions of this Court to guide them, the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Cherry v. State, supra, </em>elected to join those courts which had held that the principles announced in <em>Pearce </em>apply with equal force to a trial <em>de novo.\u201d Briggs, </em>289 Md. at 29, 421 A.2d 1369.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Shortly thereafter, \u201cthe Maryland General Assembly, by its enactment effective July 1, 1972, rewrote Article 5, section 43 of the Maryland Code to include the expansion of the <em>Pearce </em>doctrine as enunciated in <em>Cherry.\u201d Briggs, </em>289 Md. at 29, 421 A.2d 1369. The United States Supreme Court took a different tack.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">In <em>Colten v. Kentucky, </em>407 U.S. 104, 92 S.Ct. 1953, 32 L.Ed.2d 584 (1972), the Supreme Court decided that the prophylactic rule announced in <em>Pearce </em>did not apply to the judge of a superior panel when resentencing a defendant following a <em>de novo </em>trial on appeal from an inferior tribunal. <em>Colten, </em>407 U.S. at 118, 92 S.Ct. at 1961. Lately, the Supreme Court has backed away from <em>Pearce. Wasman v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number><em>United States, </em>468 U.S. 559, 571, 104 S.Ct. 3217, 3224, 82 L.Ed.2d 424 (1984) (plurality opinion) (\u201cWe conclude that any language in <em>Pearce </em>suggesting that an intervening conviction for an offense committed prior to the original sentencing may not be considered upon sentencing after retrial, is inconsistent with the <em>Pearce </em>opinion as a whole.\u201d); <em>see Texas v. McCullough, </em>475 U.S. 134, 144, 106 S.Ct. 976, 982, 89 L.Ed.2d 104 (1986) (\u201cIt is appropriate that we clarify the scope and thrust of <em>Pearce, </em>and we do so here.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s retreat from <em>Pearce, </em>the State asked the Court of Appeals to reinterpret \u00a7 12-702(b) in <em>Jones v. State, </em>307 Md. 449, 514 A.2d 1219 (1986). The Court refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Jones had been tried and convicted of, \u201camong other things, robbery with a deadly weapon.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>307 Md. at 451, 514 A.2d 1219. On that conviction, Judge Raker of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County sentenced him to nine years of imprisonment. <em>Jones, </em>307 Md. at 451, 514 A.2d 1219. In an unreported opinion, <em>Jones v. State, </em>(Md. Ct.Spec.App. No. 361, September Term, 1983, filed: December 22, 1983) Slip Op., we reversed the conviction. <em>Jones, </em>307 Md. at 451, 514 A.2d 1219. Another jury reconvicted Jones of the same offense. <em>Jones, </em>307 Md. at 451, 514 A.2d 1219. At sentencing, Judge Mitchell considered Jones\u2019s record. The \u201crecord listed a number of criminal offenses that Jones had <em>committed </em>before his first trial but of which he had not been <em>convicted </em>until after it.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>307 Md. at 451, 514 A.2d 1219. The State persuaded Judge Mitchell that under Supreme Court decisions, he could increase the sentence \u2014 effectively, ignoring \u00a7 12-702(b). The judge apparently agreed with the State, \u201cfor he gave Jones 12 years.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>307 Md. at 452, 514 A.2d 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The Court of Appeals, taking the opposite position, stated that \u201con its face, \u00a7 12-702(b) bars an increase in sentence under the circumstances of this case.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>307 Md. at 453, 514 A.2d 1219. Additionally, the Court explained why it chose not to reinterpret \u00a7 12-702(b) in a manner that would reflect current Supreme Court ideology. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>pointed out that the Legislature was presumptively aware of the <em>Briggs </em>decision (construing the \u201cconduct\u201d provision of \u00a7 12-702(b)(2))<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and did not amend that subsection. <em>Jones, </em>307 Md. at 455, 514 A.2d 1219. Furthermore, the Legislature met two times after the <em>Wasman </em>case was handed down and did not amend the subsection. <em>Jones, </em>307 Md. at 455, 514 A.2d 1219. Thus, the Court declared, \u201cThis supports our view that \u00a7 12-702(b) is a statement of legislative policy that stands independent of current Supreme Court notions of what due process may require.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>307 Md. at 455, 514 A.2d 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Unfortunately, Willey fails to perceive that the Legislature amended the language of \u00a7 12-702(b)(2), effective July 1, 1988.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> According to Sutherland,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">The legislature is presumed to know the prior construction of terms in the original act, and an amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>substituting a new term or phrase for one previously construed indicates that the judicial or executive construction of the former term or phrase did not correspond with the legislative intent and a different interpretation should be given the new term or phrase.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">1A Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction (by N.J. Singer) \u00a7 22.30 at 265 (Sands 4th ed. 1984 rev.); <em>cited with approval in, In re Criminal Investigation No. 1-162, </em>307 Md. 674, 689, 516 A.2d 976 (1986). The present language of \u00a7 12-702(b)(2) is incongruous with Willey\u2019s position. The Legislature added the word \u201cadditional\u201d and deleted the phrase \u201coccurring after the original sentence was imposed.\u201d Thus, as the State points out, \u201cWilley eschews any constitutional basis for his claim and bottoms his assertion solely on construction given to an earlier version of ... \u00a7 12-702(b) by the Court of Appeals in <em>Jones v. </em>State____\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">With the correct statute in mind, we consider whether Willey\u2019s sentence is illegal. At the outset, we note that \u201c[sentencing is a matter left largely to the discretion of the trial judge____\u201d <em>Hill v. State, </em>64 Md.App. 194, 197, 494 A.2d 757, <em>cert. denied, </em>304 Md. 298, 498 A.2d 1185 (1985). Normally, we review sentences to determine whether: (1) they constitute cruel and unusual punishment or violate some other constitutional guarantee; (2) the sentencing judge was motivated by ill-will, prejudice or other impermissible considerations; and (3) the sentence falls within the statutory limitations. <em>Hill, </em>64 Md.App. at 197, 494 A.2d 757. In the instant case, Willey does not complain under (1) or (2), rather, his contention is a variant of (3). After reviewing the transcript of the second probation hearing, we conclude that Willey\u2019s sentence is legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">At the second probation violation hearing, Judge Friedman stated the reasons for Willey\u2019s increased sentence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\">THE COURT: All right. This case comes before me today with a most unfortunate history. There is no doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>about that. I think that the death of the victim in the case, for which Mr. Willey was convicted of first degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence would not have occurred if Mr. Willey had not gone to wherever that woman [Shifflett] was and shot her____ Mr. Willey is apparently a dangerous and deadly man.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Judge Friedman told the State and the defense that she did not want to know what sentence Judge Themelis gave Willey.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, she sentenced Willey without reference to or knowledge of the prior sentence. She could have given Willey more time, less time, or the same amount of time that Judge Themelis gave him. The sentence she gave was one year longer than the sentence given by Judge Themelis. The increased sentence was proper because the record reflected that Willey had been convicted of the murder of Shifflett. The State, pursuant to an agreed statement of facts, made representations to Judge Friedman about the murder conviction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">[MR. COHEN FOR THE STATE] Subsequently, Your Honor, August 27, 1989 the Defendant committed a crime of homicide, the victim being a girlfriend Venus Shifflett. On December 10, of 1990, defendant [w]as convicted of murder in the first degree and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, received a sentence of life plus 20 years from Baltimore County Circuit Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">State would offer into evidence, a true test copy of the Baltimore County conviction as well as the Statement of Charges indicating the offense occurred August 27, 1989, which is also during the period which the Defendant was on probation for Judge Themelis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">The reasons for the increased sentence were based upon additional objective information concerning identifiable conduct on Willey\u2019s part. Judge Friedman stated that \u201cMr. Willey is apparently a dangerous and deadly man.\u201d The murder conviction (objective information) buttressed her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>subjective view. We are aware that the term \u201cconviction\u201d is not synonymous with the word \u201cconduct.\u201d <em>Briggs, </em>289 Md. at 32, 421 A.2d 1369. The <em>Briggs </em>Court pointed out that \u201c[a] conviction does not constitute criminal behavior or conduct on the part of a defendant, but merely judicially establishes its previous occurrence.\u201d <em>Briggs, </em>289 Md. at 32, 421 A.2d 1369. Judge Friedman found, after hearing the statement of facts and Willey\u2019s corrections, that Willey was convicted of murder.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">THE COURT: All right. All right. Stand up, sir. I find based on the Statement of Facts that the Defendant is in violation of his probation for violation of Condition No. 4,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> having been convicted of three subsequent offenses, all of which occurred while he was on this probation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An8\">Thus, the trial court observed the judicially established previous criminal conduct. The record contains the factual data upon which the increased sentence was based. In addition, Willey did not contest his murder conviction. He did, however correct the date.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">[MR. COHEN] That essentially, Your Honor, would be the Statement of Facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">MR. PARKER [WILLEY\u2019S COUNSEL]: Mr. Willey, any additions or corrections to the facts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes. There are several dates on here that are incorrect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">THE COURT: All right, any other corrections?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">THE DEFENDANT: There was a date here, being convicted of first degree murder on December 10, \u201990, that was the date I was sentenced I was convicted on October 15th.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Under the current version of \u00a7 12-702(b)(2), Judge Friedman took proper notice of Willey\u2019s conduct (murder of Shifflett) by way of his murder conviction. Therefore, we hold that Willey\u2019s second sentence is not illegal because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>record reflects that the exceptions to \u00a7 12-702(b) have been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-14\">. The lower court learned, outside of the record, that Willey fatally shot Venus Ann Shifflett.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b380-14\">.

The <em>Pearce </em>Court stated that</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">[i]n order to assure the absence of such a motivation [vindictiveness], we have concluded that whenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial, the reasons for his doing so must affirmatively appear. Those reasons must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant <em>occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding. </em>And the factual data upon which the increased sentence is based must be made part of the record, so that the constitutional legitimacy of the increased sentence may be fully reviewed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number><em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. at 726, 89 S.Ct. at 2081 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b382-8\">.

The <em>Pearce </em>rule applied only to sentences following retrial before the same judge. The doctrine sought to keep judicial vindictiveness out of the sentencing process. <em>Texas v.

The Conference proposed HB 718, which bore a superficial resemblance to HB 1139.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">According to Norris\u2019s letter,</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">[a]n increased sentence under HB 718, to the contrary [meaning HB 1139], must be based upon an event occurring after imposition of the first sentence. The Conference bill is thus designed to address the problem of <em>Jones v. State, </em>307 Md. 449 [514 A.2d 1219] (1986), in which the Court of Appeals interpreted the present statute not to permit an increased sentence even though the defendant in that case had committed another crime, because conviction for that crime had not occurred when the original sentencing took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">House Bill 718 was read the first time and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. Apparently, the bill never progressed from there. House Bill 1139, on the other hand, became the law of Maryland. Thus, we can safely say that the Legislature intended to remove the time limitation on the defendant\u2019s conduct that the sentencing court could use when deciding whether to increase the defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b386-11\">.
