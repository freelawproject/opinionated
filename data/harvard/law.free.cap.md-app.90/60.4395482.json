Briggs, was properly convicted of assault, disorderly conduct, and resisting arrest, and whether the trial court properly refused to instruct the jury about self defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">The appellant was charged with disorderly conduct, three counts of battery, resisting arrest, and two counts of malicious destruction of property. Briggs\u2019s jury trial was conducted on January 11, 1991 in the Circuit Court for Caroline County, Wise, J., presiding, and he was convicted on all counts except one of the malicious destruction of property charges. Judge Wise sentenced Briggs to sixty days incarceration each for disorderly conduct and for malicious destruction of property. He also sentenced Briggs to two years incarceration for each of the battery counts, and six years for resisting arrest. Briggs now appeals, presenting the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\">1. Was the evidence sufficient to sustain Appellant\u2019s convictions for any charged assault or disorderly conduct, or resisting arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-13\">2. Did the trial court err when it refused to give proper jury instructions regarding self defense?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">The police charged Briggs with the aforementioned crimes as the culmination of an episode that occurred on the evening of July 30, 1990, at the annual Federalsburg Carnival in Caroline County. Briggs had been gambling at the Federalsburg Volunteer Fire Company's dice table. The firemen testified that as Briggs began losing at the game, he also began cursing, using obscenities at an increasingly loud volume. One fireman testified that Briggs grabbed from the table the money he had just lost. He also was rough with the gaming table, throwing the dice at it hard enough to bounce off its surface. The firemen tried unsuccessfully to dissuade Briggs from acting this way, and eventually they sought police help.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Briggs's account and the officers\u2019 accounts differ as to what transpired next. Officer Adams testified that as he and Officers Miles and Collins approached the gambling booth, he saw Briggs yelling and screaming profanities. Briggs looked at Miles and asked, \u201cWhat the fuck do you want?\u201d Adams told Briggs that he would have to leave the carnival, and Briggs replied, \u201cFuck you, I don\u2019t have to leave if I don\u2019t want to.\u201d The police told Briggs that he would have to leave because he was offending people, and he could not continue to stand there and shout obscenities. After several attempts to induce Briggs to leave, the officers began escorting him from the grounds, and Briggs continued shouting, \u201cFuck you, motherfucking cops.\u201d The area was crowded, and Briggs\u2019s behavior noticeably affected carnival patrons.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Briggs continued to shout obscenities outside the grounds, and the officers decided to arrest him for disorderly conduct. They announced that Briggs was under arrest and told him to put his hands against a nearby truck. Briggs asked, \u201cWhat the fuck is that for? I\u2019m leaving.\u201d But the officers told him it was too late, that he was under arrest. Adams grabbed Briggs\u2019s arm to handcuff him, but Briggs threw his arms up, striking Adams and knocking Adams\u2019s watch off his wrist. The officers tried to put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Briggs on the ground: he had on one handcuff and was fighting violently. Briggs kicked Miles close to the groin, and as Briggs struggled, he continued to yell obscenities and shouted, \u201cyou fucked with the wrong person now\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m going to get you.\u201d Briggs found a place to hold onto the truck and would not let go. Eventually the officers decided to use mace on Briggs, and this caused him to let go of the truck, but he became more violent.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Adams testified that a large crowd had gathered to watch. Briggs screamed that the police were beating and killing him. Collins went to his police car to get his dog out to use in controlling the gathering because the officers feared that the crowd would try to take Briggs from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Eventually, the officers got Briggs into a squad car. As they took him to the Sheriff\u2019s office, and once inside the station, he continued yelling. At Briggs\u2019s behest, the police called an ambulance crew to check his injuries, but Briggs yelled at them, and rejected their efforts to treat him. He urinated on the heater and carpet in the room where he was held, and had to be restrained in a straight jacket before he could be taken to a hospital for examination. The hospital found no injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Briggs\u2019s version of these events differs from those of the officers. He says that he was winning money when the officers asked him to leave. \u201cThe only thing I can think, they didn\u2019t like I was winning money or it was another mishap in there and they thought I did it.\u201d Wishing to avoid trouble, he prepared to leave. As he departed the tent, he indicated his plan to leave and told the officers that he didn\u2019t need an escort. \u201cAnd then when I got to the ... made the left to go outside the fence and I just looked around and there he goes. You know, the guys were on top of me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Briggs testified that the police threw him to the ground, sprayed mace in his eyes, and beat him with a stick or clubs. The officers handcuffed him while he was on the ground, and by his estimate, he spent five to ten minutes there, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>two or three officers on top. of him. Next, the officers put him in a police car and drove him to the station, where they handcuffed him to a stationary object. He stated that he cooperated with the paramedics, but that their equipment malfunctioned. And by Briggs\u2019s account, he urinated on the floor because the police ignored his pleas to allow him to go to the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">I. THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The State contends that Briggs \u201chas failed to preserve his attack on the sufficiency of the evidence for appellate review.\u201d We agree. After the trial judge denied defense counsel\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, Briggs called two witnesses, rested his case, but failed to renew his motion for judgment of acquittal. Having withdrawn the motion by putting on evidence, he has not preserved for our review the court\u2019s denial. <em>Winkles v. State, </em>40 Md.App. 616, 392 A.2d 1173 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">In order to avoid further litigation, we shall address the merits of appellant\u2019s arguments. We first address whether the police officers had probable cause to arrest Briggs, because all else follows from that determination. Briggs argues that, at most, the State\u2019s evidence demonstrates that he talked loudly and used obscene, offensive language at a neighborhood carnival, and that this did not give the officers probable cause to arrest him.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Briggs was charged with violating Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 123 (Supp.1991), a statute proscribing disorderly conduct in public places.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">(a) A person may not act in a disorderly manner to the disturbance of the public peace, upon any public street, highway, alley, park or parking lot, or in any vehicle that is in or upon any street, highway, alley, park or parking lot, in any city, town, or county in this State, or at any place of public worship, or public resort or amusement in any city, town or county in this State, or in any store during business hours, or in any elevator, lobby or corri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>dor of any office building or apartment house having more than three separate dwelling units, or in any public building in any city, town or county of this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">We look to the many Maryland cases interpreting this statute to determine whether it sanctions Briggs\u2019s behavior. This court in <em>Reese v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 73, 80-81, 299 A.2d 848 (1973) (citations omitted) considered whether the statute applied to a defendant who conversationally used an obscenity in the presence of others who were offended by the language, and who \u201ccarried on.\u201d We described the conduct proscribed by the section as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqF\">[T]he gist of the crime under the statute, as it was in the cases of common law predecessor crimes, is the doing or saying, or both, of that which offends, disturbs, incites, or tends to incite, a number of people gathered in the same area. In other words, it is conduct of such a nature as to affect the peace and quiet of persons actually present who may witness the conduct or hear the language and who may be disturbed or provoked to resentment thereby. Nevertheless, the statute, in either its \u201cdoing\u201d or \u201csaying\u201d proscriptions, may not punish acts or spoken words, although vulgar and offensive, which are protected by the first and fourteenth amendments. Implicit in \u00a7 123 is the prohibition against a person wilfully acting in a disorderly manner by making loud and unseemly noises or by profanely cursing, swearing or using obscene language. The State has the power to punish obscene expression, but to be obscene such expression must be, in some significant way, erotic, so as to conjure up such psychic stimulation in anyone likely to be confronted with it. And the State is free to ban the simple use, \u201cwithout a demonstration of additional justifying circumstances, of so-called \u2018fighting words\u2019, those personally abusive epithets which, when addressed to an ordinary citizen, are, as a matter of common knowledge, inherently likely to provoke violent reaction.\u201d Thus the obscene language prohibited means obscene in the constitutional sense and the profanely cursing or swearing prohibited means \u201cfighting words.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Whether the loud and unseemly noises prohibitions are within the ambit of protected expression depends on the nature and content of them, a question to be determined on the facts of the particular case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">We also note, as per our decision in <em>In re Nawrocki, </em>15 Md.App. 252, 258, 289. A.2d 846 (1972), that disorderly conduct within the statute\u2019s meaning \u201crequires the actual presence of other persons who \u2018may witness\u2019 the conduct or hear the language and who \u2018may be disturbed or provoked to resentment thereby.\u2019 \u201d Also, the carnival unquestionably falls within the meaning of \u201cpublic resort or amusement.\u201d <em>See Drews v. State, </em>224 Md. 186, 191, 167 A.2d 341 (1961) (public resort or amusement includes amusement parks).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">For the sake of clarity, we divide the Briggs incident into three phases: the time before the officers arrived at the dicing table during which Briggs cursed loudly and engaged in rough behavior; the period during which the officers arrived, repeatedly attempted to get Briggs to move along, and finally escorted Briggs from the premises as he continued to shout and curse; and the episode outside the carnival grounds during which Briggs loudly and bodily resisted arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">With respect to the first episode, we are unable to say that Briggs\u2019s language violated the statute\u2019s \u2018saying\u2019 prong. Although Briggs repeatedly uttered unspecified obscenities while he was standing in the dicing booth, evaluating whether his language invokes the statute\u2019s sanction involves determining if, under the circumstances, his speech was within the ambit of constitutionally protected free expression. Following United States Supreme Court decisions and our own precedent in <em>Reese, </em>we conclude that Briggs\u2019s speech was constitutionally protected. His language was not obscene in the sense of being erotic so as to conjure up psychic stimulation in anyone likely to be confronted with it. <em>See Reese, </em>17 Md.App. at 80, 81, 167 A.2d 341. Neither did it constitute \u2018fighting words,\u2019 which are words that \u201chave a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to whom, individually, the remark is ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>dressed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82, 167 A.2d 341 (quoting <em>Gooding v. Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518, 523, 92 S.Ct. 1103, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972)). Briggs\u2019s remarks were not addressed to any particular individual among the firemen or the onlookers, and his mere use of profane language would not plainly tend to excite others to breach the peace. Briggs\u2019s remarks inside the dicing tent were constitutionally protected speech, and the evidence was legally insufficient to establish that he violated the statute by means of his speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">But the evidence suggests that Briggs\u2019s conduct constituted the \u2018doing\u2019 of that which might offend, disturb, incite, or tend to incite, other people in the area. Briggs shouted, grabbed back the money he lost, and slammed the dice into the table. The carnival was crowded, and some of the patrons were noticeably affected by this: people complained to the firemen, asking them to do something to induce Briggs to desist. So extreme was Briggs\u2019s behavior that the firemen operating the dicing game were moved to seek police assistance in persuading him to leave after their own attempts to discourage his disruptive behavior were unsuccessful. This alone would be sufficient to invoke the statute\u2019s sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Moving to the incident\u2019s second phase, in which the police approached Briggs and asked him to leave the premises, we first examine whether Briggs\u2019s actions were disorderly. The evidence shows that the officers repeatedly attempted to induce Briggs to move on, and his refusal to do so may constitute disorderly behavior: \u201crefusal to obey a proper order of an officer may constitute an offense justifying an arrest, particularly where there is profanity in the presence of others that may justify a breach of the peace.\u201d <em>Sharpe v. State, </em>231 Md. 401, 404, 190 A.2d 628 <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 946, 84 S.Ct. 350, 11 L.Ed.2d 275 (1963).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See also Drews v. State, </em>224 Md. 186, 192, 167 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>A.2d 341 (1961) (\u201cit has been held that failure to obey a policeman\u2019s command to move on when not to do so may endanger the public peace, amounts to disorderly conduct.\u201d). In light of the circumstances, Briggs\u2019s actions were disorderly once again. The officers told Briggs to leave because his conduct was disruptive to other carnival patrons, some of whom were sufficiently offended by it to complain about it to the firemen: his conduct endangered the public peace. In this context, the officers\u2019 instructions to Briggs telling him to move along were reasonable, and his failure to obey them constituted disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Whether Briggs\u2019s use of profanity towards the officers is constitutionally protected is another matter: as we have discussed, <em>supra, </em>his words were not obscene in the constitutional sense. But they were abusive epithets, directed at particular individuals, and they might have tended to incite disorderly conduct in others.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">We note at the outset that if the officers unlawfully demanded that Briggs depart, his language would be constitutionally protected. The case <em>Diehl v. State, </em>294 Md. 466, 451 A.2d 115 (1982), is instructive on this matter, because it addresses analogous issues with respect to a similar disorderly conduct statute, Md.Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 121, proscribing loud and unseemly noises, and the use of obscene language.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Diehl, </em>the Court of Appeals considered whether a police officer could arrest someone for saying, \u201cFuck you, [Officer].\u201d The court described the development of case law identifying allowable government regulation of speech: fighting words are not constitutionally protected because their \u201cslight social value as a step to truth ... is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474, 451 A.2d 115 (quoting <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 62 S.Ct. 766, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942)). The <em>Diehl </em>court asserted that <em>Chaplinsky </em>\u201cmay be interpreted as holding that fighting words would produce an uncontrollable impulse to violence----\u201d <em>Id. </em>[294 Md.] at 474-75, 451 A.2d 115. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has limited the doctrine by recognizing that \u201cthe use of an offensive expletive does not, by itself, deprive speech of protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 475, 451 A.2d 115. A court must examine the context in which the words were uttered. In <em>Diehl, </em>the defendant addressed the offensive words directly to the police officer, but the court determined that the words were not \u201ca personally abusive epithet hurled to invoke immediate and violent response.\u201d Moreover, the court found that \u201cDiehl\u2019s use of vulgar language does not evolve into a crime simply because persons in the area stopped, looked, and listened.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that \u201cwhere, as here, a person is acting in a lawful manner (a passenger getting out of a stopped car) and is the object of an unlawful police order, it is not usually a criminal violation for such person to verbally protest a police officer\u2019s insistence upon submission to such an order.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">We distinguish <em>Diehl </em>and the case at bar, however, by pointing out that the defendant in <em>Diehl </em>behaved lawfully. In the instant case, Briggs did not act in a lawful manner: the police officers had probable cause to arrest him for disorderly conduct. That they had not yet done that bespeaks their restraint, and does not reflect upon their legal ability to do so. <em>See also Harris v. State, </em>237 Md. 299, 303, 206 A.2d 254 (1965) (\u201cA failure to obey a reasonable and lawful request by a police officer fairly made to prevent a disturbance to the public peace constitutes disorderly conduct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Because police officers are (theoretically) non-inciteable, the content of Briggs\u2019s language at this point was insufficient to give the officers probable cause, even though Briggs was saying, \u201cfuck you, cops\u201d and \u201c[f]uck you, motherfucking cops,\u201d and continued shouting obscenities as the officers escorted him from the carnival. Indeed, these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>comments were directed in particular to the officers and were of the sort that might have a direct tendency to provoke violence from the person to whom the remark was addressed. But that is not the end of the analysis. As the Court of Appeals pointed out in <em>Downs v. State, </em>278 Md. 610, 615, 366 A.2d 41 (1976), \u201c \u2018fighting words\u2019 have been recognized as having some social value and are punishable now not on a \u2018per se\u2019 basis but only when there is a likelihood of imminent disturbance.\u201d None of the evidence suggests, however, that the officers were aroused by his language, and one officer testified, in reply to a query as to whether Briggs\u2019s foul language induced them to arrest him, that \u201c[h]e can\u2019t disturb my peace by law.\u201d <em>See Downs </em>at 618-19, 366 A.2d 41 (court declined to consider profane remark possibly addressed to police officer where the remark did not arouse the officer); <em>see also Lewis v. City of New Orleans, </em>408 U.S. 913, 92 S.Ct. 2499, 33 L.Ed.2d 321 (1972) (remanding case in which defendant called police \u201cGod damned mother fuckers;\u201d Powell, J., concurring, would have considered the words fighting words had they been addressed to one other than a police officer, trained to exercise restraint).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Finally, we turn to the last episode of this unfortunate incident, in which Briggs protested his arrest with continued vulgar language, threats, and physical resistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">As we recently indicated in <em>Barnhard v. State, </em>86 Md. App. 518, 527, 587 A.2d 561 (1991), <em>cert. granted, </em>323 Md. 115, 591 A.2d 506 (1991), there is no question that in Maryland, a person illegally arrested may use any reasonable means, including reasonable force, to escape. But we qualified this by indicating that \u201ceven if the initial stop of [an] appellant was illegal, his subsequent actions must still be examined to determine whether that conduct justified an arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>[86 Md.App.] at 528, 587 A.2d 561 (citing <em>Diehl, supra </em>[294 Md.] at 478-79, 451 A.2d 115, in which the court examined the defendant\u2019s response to an officer\u2019s illegal command to determine whether the subsequent conduct justified an arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Assuming, arguendo, that the police officers unlawfully demanded that Briggs leave, his response to their order constituted disorderly conduct: in addition to physically resisting their efforts to take him into custody, he threatened them, and incited the crowd sufficiently to cause the officers to fear that the crowd would \u2018take him away\u2019 from them. Indeed, this fear prompted one officer to divert his attention from Briggs in order to use his dog to regain control of the crowd.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">The standard of review in deciding an allegation concerning the sufficiency of evidence is whether, \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Employing this standard, we conclude that a rational jury reasonably could have concluded that Briggs was guilty of disorderly conduct. Briggs\u2019s actions at every turn disrupted the carnival, challenged the police, and eventually incited the crowd against the officers. This behavior reasonably prompted the officers to arrest him for disorderly conduct. Because the officers had probable cause to arrest Briggs, his arrest was lawful, and he was not entitled to resist them. Fighting with the officers therefore constituted battery upon them, and resisting arrest. We hold that the evidence was sufficient to support Briggs\u2019s conviction on all counts, and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">II. THE JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Briggs also argues that the trial court committed reversible error when it refused his attorney\u2019s request to instruct the jury on self-defense. The evidence must support a court\u2019s giving advisory instructions, and Briggs contends that the testimony of the State\u2019s witnesses, the defense witnesses, and the circumstances of his arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>generate the requisite support.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He therefore requests that we reverse the trial court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">We disagree. The Court of Appeals in <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 216, 571 A.2d 1251 (1990) explained that a homicide defendant has the initial burden of producing \u201csome evidence\u201d on the issue of self-defense as a predicate to the judge\u2019s issuing a jury instruction on that issue. The court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\"><em>Some evidence </em>is not strictured by the test of a specific standard. It calls for no more than what it says\u2014 \u201csome,\u201d as that word is understood in common, everyday usage. It need not rise to the level of \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d or \u201cclear and convincing\u201d or \u201cpreponderance.\u201d The source of the evidence is immaterial; it may emanate solely from the defendant. It is of no matter that the self-defense claim is overwhelmed by evidence to the contrary. If there is any evidence relied on by the defendant which, if believed, would support his claim that he acted in self-defense, the defendant has met his burden. Then the baton is passed to the State. It must shoulder the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the jury that the defendant did not kill in self-defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-7\"><em>Dykes, </em>319 Md. at 216-17, 571 A.2d 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">We note that the trial court refused to give the instruction on the ground that Briggs\u2019s defense was not that he assaulted the officers and was justified in doing so, but that he did not assault them at all. Briggs\u2019s account supports the judge\u2019s decision: Briggs testified that he was leaving the carnival grounds, got outside the fence and was thrown to the ground, whereupon the officers sprayed him with mace, handcuffed him, and took him away.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Although Briggs argues that he was entitled to the instruction, he does not support this with evidence, and we see nothing in the record that would give rise to a claim of self-defense. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\">. The court in <em>Sharpe </em>did not reach the question whether the defendant\u2019s actions and language constituted disorderly conduct because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the officer had other grounds for probable cause to arrest the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b98-8\">.
