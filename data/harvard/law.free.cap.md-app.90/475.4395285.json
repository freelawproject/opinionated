The information included four counts: (1) attempted first degree rape; (2) attempted second degree rape; (3) attempted sexual offense in the first degree; and (4) attempted sexual offense in the second degree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the same day, the State\u2019s Attorney informed Patrick that he sought a sentence of \u201cImprisonment for Life Without the Possibility of Parole\u201d in the murder case. Judge Cole consolidated both cases for purposes of a motion to suppress hearing and for trial. On December 10, 1990, Patrick filed a demand for bill of particulars in case # 90601C (the murder case). The State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>did not respond until the day of trial. <em>See </em>discussion, <em>infra </em>part V.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Judge Edward D.E. Rollins, Jr., presided over a jury trial during March 18-20, 1990. The jury convicted Patrick of first-degree felony-murder and found him not guilty of first degree premeditated murder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On May 8, 1991, Judge Rollins heard and denied Patrick\u2019s motion for a new trial. Judge Rollins then conducted a sentencing hearing. After hearing the parties\u2019 positions, Judge Rollins sentenced Patrick to the \u201cjurisdiction of the Department of Corrections for the remainder of his natural life without benefit of parole.\u201d The very next day, Patrick appealed to this court. On appeal he raises the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">I. Did the trial court err in its instructions to the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">II. Did the trial court err in admitting into evidence testimony relating to a previous act of misconduct by Appellant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">III. Did the trial court err in refusing to compel the State to disclose to the defense the reports of an expert consulted by the State?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\">IV. Did the trial court err in permitting a forensic chemist called by the State to testify to her conclusion that only one of her findings was \u201csignificant[?J\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-10\">V. Did the trial court err in refusing to require the State to prepare a bill of particulars respecting the alleged sexual offenses?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">Patrick and the victim, thirteen-year-old Earline Renee Brown (Earline), lived in a subsidized housing project located in Port Deposit, Maryland. Patrick knew Earline, in fact, Patrick and Earline\u2019s step-brother Steven Goodwin were best of friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">On the evening of September 1, 1990, Earline\u2019s family noticed that she was missing. Late that night/early the next morning of September 2, searchers located Earline\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>body in a wooded area. Her uncle was the first to sight her body; he immediately called out to the other searchers. Earline\u2019s body rested some fifty feet from the apartment where Patrick lived with his parents and brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Earline\u2019s body was partially clothed when found. According to the assistant medical examiner, the \u201cpathological diagnosis, meaning the summation of injuries, number one, is strangulation; number two, blunt force injury to the head; number three, cutting and stab wounds of torso; number four, contusion of tongue....\u201d He determined the \u201c[c]ause of death was strangulation and blunt force injuries to the head.\u201d There was also evidence of injury to the vaginal area.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Based upon the testimony of witnesses who placed Patrick and Earline in close proximity to each other prior to her death, the police questioned Patrick about Earline\u2019s murder. He gave the police several different versions of what happened.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> His descriptions of the events before Earline\u2019s death closely corresponded to the injuries found upon her body. Furthermore, the forensic chemist for the State determined that bloodstains found on Patrick\u2019s shoes could have come from Earline \u2014 but not Patrick.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>At trial, Patrick took the stand and told the jury that he did not kill Earline; he came across the body when he went into the woods behind his house, but he was \u201ctoo scared\u201d to tell anyone what he had seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Patrick argues that the trial court erred when it instructed the jury on the elements of first degree rape and first degree sexual offense. In addition, he complains because the court refused to instruct the jury on assault and battery and did not allow that charge on the verdict sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Patrick cites to certain pages from the trial transcript wherein the court defines the attempted rape and attempted sexual offense charges. He points out that the court failed to define fully the elements of first degree rape and first degree sexual offense. He is concerned that the jury could have concluded that he \u201cwas guilty of first-degree rape or first-degree sex offense if he had engaged in the aggravating conduct <em>alone: </em>using a weapon, inflicting strangulation, and so on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">The trial court mentioned the aggravating factors that underlie each charge,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but forgot to define the terms rape (first degree) and sexual offense <em>contemporaneously </em>with the relevant instructions. At first glance, Patrick\u2019s contentions appear tenable, but upon closer examination, they cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">The State posits that Patrick <em>failed </em>to object and inform the lower court that it forgot to define the word rape contemporaneously with the first degree attempted rape charge. Furthermore, Patrick did not object to the lower court\u2019s instructions on attempted sexual offenses. Accordingly, our review is governed by Md.Rule 4-325(e).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq5\">Objection. \u2014 No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection. Upon request of any party, the court shall receive objections out of the hearing of the jury. An appellate court, on its own initiative or on the suggestion of a party, may however take cognizance of any <em>plain error </em>in the instructions, material to the rights of the defendant, despite a failure to object.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGZ\">(Emphasis added). <em>Sims v. State, </em>319 Md. 540, 549, <em>573 </em>A.2d 1317 (1990) (\u201cUnless the attorney preserves the point by proper objection after the charge, or has somehow made it crystal clear that there is an ongoing objection to the failure of the court to give the requested instruction, the objection may be lost.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">If the defendant timely objects, the lower court has the opportunity to \u201ccorrect any misstatement of law, clarify an ambiguity, or correct inaccuracies\u201d in its instructions. <em>Leatherwood v. State, </em>49 Md.App. 683, 694-95, 435 A.2d 477 (1981). Patrick had the \u201cduty of stating distinctly at the time the specific grounds of objection.\u201d <em>Brown v. State, </em>203 Md. 126, 129-30, 100 A.2d 7 (1953). He shirked his responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In <em>State v. Foster, </em>263 Md. 388, 397, 283 A.2d 411 <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 908, 92 S.Ct. 1616, 31 L.Ed.2d 818 (1971), the Court of Appeals stated, \u201cIt is a well established rule that when objection is raised to a court\u2019s instruction, attention should not be focused on a particular portion lifted out of context, but rather its adequacy is determined by viewing it as a whole.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In accord with this instruction, although not obliged to do so, we examine the jury instructions in their entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">We have the discretion to recognize, <em>sua sponte, </em>plain error. <em>State v. Daughton, </em>321 Md. 206, 210-11, 582 A.2d 521 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The lower court began its instruction on the rape charge as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">[THE COURT:] Now, first degree rape, I have to give you a definition of what these are for you to be able to consider whether the person attempted to do them. And I might say at this point that the attempt to rape or attempt to rape [sic], the person has to be living when you make the attempt. You can\u2019t rape a dead person. You can\u2019t commit a sexual offense against a dead person. So, part of the proof is that when and if these attempts were made, the victim was alive at the time that the attempts were made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">In order to convict of first degree rape in this case, attempted first degree rape, the State must prove that:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The court went on to list the aggravating factors for first degree attempted rape <em>(e.g., </em>attacker used or displayed a dangerous weapon). Later, while instructing the jury on second degree attempted rape, the court gave a specific definition of rape.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">[THE COURT:] Second degree rape, in order to prove that, attempted second degree rape, and these are all attempts I say, doesn\u2019t mean the actual act takes place, but they have to attempt to have committed it. That\u2019s a common law offense. The State has got to prove the Defendant attempted to have vaginal intercourse with the victim; that the act was committed by force or threat of force; that the act was committed without the consent of the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">Vaginal intercourse means the penetration of the penis into the vagina. The slightest penetration is sufficient and emission of semen is not required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">With this instruction in mind, we disagree with Patrick when he claims that the jury could have concluded that he was guilty of (attempted) first degree rape based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>aggravating conduct alone. There was no reversible error, let alone \u201cplain error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">The information against Patrick listed attempted crimes\u2014 not completed crimes (e.g., rape). The State did not have to prove penetration because, as the trial court stated, \u201cYou can\u2019t rape a dead person.\u201d Moreover, as the State indicates, the presence of force and the absence of consent were undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Even if we considered the trial court\u2019s contemporaneous omission (with the first degree attempted rape instruction) of the definition of the term \u201crape\u201d to be erroneous, it did not create the <em>type </em>of prejudice that precluded Patrick from receiving an impartial trial. <em>Trimble v. State, </em>300 Md. 387, 397, 478 A.2d 1143 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1230, 105 S.Ct. 1231, 84 L.Ed.2d 368 (1985) (\u201cwe shall examine the circumstances at the time of the court\u2019s instructions to determine if the court\u2019s omission was prejudicial\u201d); <em>see State v. Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. 198, 202-03, 411 A.2d 1035 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The <em>State </em>objected to the jury instructions because, among other things, the lower court failed to define the term \u201csexual act.\u201d Patrick did not object to this omission.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">MR. SCARBOROUGH [FOR THE STATE]: I\u2019d like the whole sexual act thing read.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">THE COURT: I didn\u2019t do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">MR. SCARBOROUGH: You just read the first part. There\u2019s the second part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-11\">THE COURT: Okay. I\u2019ll give that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-12\">The court kept its word.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-13\">[THE COURT:] I talk[ed] about first and second degree sexual act. Maybe I better, sexual act means, among other things, cunnilingus, fellatio, analingus, anal intercourse. Sexual act also means the penetration, however slight, by any object into the genital or anal opening of another person\u2019s body, if the penetration can be reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>ably construed as being for the purposes of sexual arousal or gratification or for abuse of either party and if the penetration is not for accepted medical purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The lower court cured its omission by giving supplemental instructions which included the definition of sexual act. Thus, the lower court linked the aggravating conduct for each attempted sexual offense charge with the crux of each offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">We hold that the trial court\u2019s instructions on the attempted sexual offense charges did not amount to error, let alone plain error. <em>England and Edwards v. State, </em>21 Md.App. 412, 427, 320 A.2d 66 (1974) (\u201cIf jury instructions when read as a whole, clearly set forth the applicable law, there is no reversible error.\u201d). <em>See also State v. Daughton, </em>321 Md. 206, 210-11, 582 A.2d 521 (1990); <em>Austin v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 254, 600 A.2d 1142 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">At trial, Patrick took exception to the lower court\u2019s \u201cfailure to instruct the jury on the offenses of assault and battery, and to include them on the verdict sheet.\u201d Mrs. Murray, Patrick\u2019s co-counsel, informed the lower court of the exceptions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">MRS. MURRAY: Next I want to make an exception to the fact that categories for the following crimes are not included on the verdict sheet, that would be assault, battery....... There\u2019s evidence supporting those ... crimes. Assault and battery merge into murder. Every murder includes both an assault and a battery as a character of the actual crime. I think that belongs on the verdict sheet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-12\">Okay. Next I\u2019d like to except that the instructions for assault and also for battery were not given. Those belong in the verdict sheet and they belong in the instructions as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Patrick now argues that the \u201cexception was meritorious, and the [court\u2019s] refusal to place those offenses before the jury was error.\u201d He cites <em>Hagans v. State, </em>316 Md. 429, 559 A.2d 792 (1989), and <em>Hook v. State, </em>315 Md. 25, 553 A.2d 233 (1989), in support of his contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">In <em>Hagans, </em>the Court of Appeals adopted the majority rule on uncharged lesser included offenses. After reviewing other states\u2019 law, the Court chose to follow the principle that \u201ca defendant, charged with a greater offense, can be convicted of an uncharged lesser included offense____\u201d <em>Hagans, </em>316 Md. at 447, 559 A.2d 792.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Ordinarily, the trial court should invoke the doctrine when <em>either </em>side requests or affirmatively agrees to the instruction. <em>Hagans, </em>316 Md. at 455, 559 A.2d 792. The Court of Appeals concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">where the State enters a nolle prosequi as to an uncharged lesser included offense, or where the charging document is drawn so as necessarily to exclude the lesser included offense, it would obviously be inappropriate to submit the lesser included offense to the jury, except to the extent that the defendant desires and is entitled to have it submitted under the principles recently set forth in <em>Hook v. State, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-8\"><em>Hagans, </em>316 Md. at 455, 559 A.2d 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">In <em>Hook v. State, </em>315 Md. 25, 553 A.2d 233 (1989), the Court discussed the harm flowing from the prosecutor\u2019s <em>nol pros </em>of a lesser included crime, which, in effect, left the jury with a Hobson\u2019s choice<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014 convict or acquit. Noting that the United States Supreme Court doctrine dealt with capital cases, the Court of Appeals decided to \u201capply the fairness concept as to lesser included offenses to encompass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>noncapital cases.\u201d <em>Hook, </em>315 Md. at 43, 553 A.2d 233. Accordingly, the Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWT\">[w]hen the defendant is plainly guilty of some offense, and the evidence is legally sufficient for the trier of fact to convict him of either the greater offense or a lesser included offense, it is fundamentally unfair under Maryland common law for the State, over the defendant\u2019s objection, to <em>nol pros </em>the lesser included offense. The same rationale, set forth in detail <em>supra, </em>that supports the Supreme Court rule supports this view. In short, it is simply offensive to fundamental fairness, in such circumstances, to deprive the trier of fact, over the defendant\u2019s objection, of the third option of convicting the defendant of a lesser included offense. And if the trial is before a jury, the defendant is entitled, if he so desires, to have the jury instructed as to the lesser included offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADf\"><em>Hook, </em>315 Md. at 43-44, 553 A.2d 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">We point out that <em>Hagans </em>and <em>Hook </em>involved prosecutorial trial strategy. The prosecutors\u2019 decision to <em>nol pros </em>the lesser charges placed the defendant in a difficult situation. Thus, the Court of Appeals fettered the prosecutors\u2019 broad discretion by subjecting it to the strictures of fundamental fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In the instant case, the strategic scenario is quite different. The State presented all of its charges to the jury. The State did not <em>nol pros </em>any charges in an attempt to apply pressure on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">We agree with Patrick when he contends that \u201cassault and battery were lesser-included offenses of virtually every other crime with which Appellant was charged.\u201d Nevertheless, we do not agree that the lower court\u2019s actions amounted to error.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">In <em>Jackson v. State, </em>322 Md. 117, 586 A.2d 6 (1991), the appellant took a position similar to Patrick\u2019s. The criminal information against Jackson charged him with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute; possession of cocaine; conspiracy to distribute cocaine; conspiracy to possess eo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>caine with the intent to distribute; and conspiracy to possess cocaine. <em>Jackson, </em>322 Md. at 123, 586 A.2d 6. The State, over Jackson\u2019s objection, did not submit the possession counts (lesser included) to the jury. <em>Jackson, </em>322 Md. at 123-24, 586 A.2d 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Jackson, relying on <em>Hook, </em>in part, argued that \u201cif there is legally sufficient evidence for the trier of fact to convict a defendant of the lesser included offense, that offense must go to the jury.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>322 Md. at 127, 586 A.2d 6. The Court of Appeals viewed Jackson\u2019s assertion as a question of evidentiary sufficiency. <em>Jackson, </em>322 Md. at 127, 586 A.2d 6. Apparently, Jackson based his contention upon language from <em>Hook, </em>315 Md. at 43, 553 A.2d 233, quoted in <em>Fairbanks v. State, </em>318 Md. 22, 25, 566 A.2d 764 (1989),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">[w]hen the defendant is plainly guilty of some offense, and the evidence is legally sufficient for the trier of fact to convict him of either the greater offense or a lesser included offense____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">In resolving the issue against Jackson, the <em>Jackson </em>Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">[e]ven when there is evidence that would support a finding of guilt of the lesser included offense, the State is not precluded from entering a nolle prosequi of that offense if, under the particular facts of the case, there exists no rational basis by which the jury could conclude that the defendant is guilty of the lesser included offense but not guilty of the greater offense. Under the facts of this case, there simply was no rational basis upon which the jury could have concluded that Jackson was guilty of possession [the lesser included] but not guilty of possession with intent to distribute [the greater].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-8\"><em>Jackson, </em>322 Md. at 127-28, 586 A.2d 6. The Court cautioned that its \u201cholding is not to be interpreted as reaching beyond ... [the] factual scenario\u201d of the case. <em>Jackson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>322 Md. at 128, 586 A.2d 6.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">We do not seek to extend <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>holding to the case <em>sub judice, </em>rather, we look to that case for the \u201crational basis\u201d test. On the facts before the jury, there was <em>no </em>rational basis upon which it could have concluded that Patrick was guilty of assault and battery (the lesser included) but not the greater charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Patrick\u2019s testimony at trial was factually correct, he would not have been guilty of any crime. He testified that he happened upon Earline\u2019s body by accident. In addition to his description of his activities, Patrick repudiated the statements he gave to the police in which he implicated Eric Davis and Steven Goodwin. The State argues that if the jury chose to believe those accounts, it could have found Patrick guilty as an accomplice. Thus, we concur with the State when it posits, \u201cThere is no reasonable theory, on the facts of this case, which would permit convictions of just assault and battery. Therefore, instructions on those offenses were not required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Patrick asserts that the lower court committed prejudicial error by allowing Stephanie Osborne to testify about Patrick\u2019s prior conduct towards Earline. Osborne was a classmate of Earline\u2019s. During the summer of 1990, prior to Earline\u2019s murder, Osborne spent time at Port Deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">On direct examination, Osborne told the jury what she had heard Patrick say to Earline.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">Q Tell us what you heard Ricky say to Earline.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">A Couple of times I heard him say things like she had a nice body and a nice butt.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Later, Scarborough asked Osborne if she had ever seen Patrick touch Earline.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">MR. SCARBOROUGH: Did you ever see him touch</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Earline?</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">MR. KLENK [PATRICK\u2019S CO-COUNSEL]: Objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">THE COURT: Overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">THE WITNESS: I\u2019ve seen him pinch her butt before.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">BY MR. SCARBOROUGH:</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">Q Pinch her butt?</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">A Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">Q Is that during that summer [of 1990]?</p>\n<p id=\"b517-14\">A Um-hum.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-15\">Patrick goes on to argue that \u201c[f]or a male to \u2018pinch the butt\u2019 of a female is obviously a crime \u2014 a sexual offense and a battery.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He believes that Osborne\u2019s testimony was not probative and depicted him \u201cas a nasty, undisciplined person with a willingness to violate the rights of others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-16\">The State points out that \u201cwhile it may be a sexual offense or battery to pinch someone, it patently is so only where the person pinched does not consent.\u201d <em>Taylor v.

Specifically, he asserts that \u201ca polygraph exam is obviously a \u2018scientific test.\u2019 \u201d Therefore, because Md.Rule 4-263(b)(4) does not require that evidence be admissible before it is discoverable, Patrick claims, in a roundabout way, that the polygraph results would have aided him in preparing for his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">The State, on the other hand, argues that \u201cpolygraph results are of such questionable scientific reliability as to be inadmissible as evidence in criminal cases in Maryland, they cannot be considered scientific tests or experiments for the purposes of Rule 4-263(b)(4).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">The lower court examined the polygraph materials and determined that the State had provided Patrick with all the exculpatory items found therein. Accordingly, the lower <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>court refused to compel the State to provide Patrick with non-exculpatory polygraph material.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">\u2022I\u2019m going to deny your motion for discovery as far as reports of the polygraph exam because they are irrelevant in the case.

For example, tests may be scientific, but the results may be unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Maryland law <em>is </em>settled on whether polygraph results are admissible as evidence \u2014 they are not.

This is to say that they are obtained by the police <em>qua </em>police in their investigation of crime. This kind of information, in its broadest sense, arises out of the analytical or investigative phase of police effort.

State, </em>284 Md. 455, 471, 397 A.2d 606 (1979). The main purpose of Md.Rule 4-263(b)(4) and its predecessors is to aid the defendant in the preparation of his case and to protect him from surprise. <em>Brown v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 523, 528-29, 584 A.2d 164 (1991). The trial court conducted a hearing and determined that the polygraph materials at issue did <em>not </em>contain any exculpatory items. Under the principles enunciated in <em>Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 513-14, 495 A.2d 1 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1093, 106 S.Ct. 868, 88 L.Ed.2d 907 (1986), Patrick (and the State) could not <em>intentionally </em>use any of the polygraph materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In addition, as the Court in <em>State v.

It is well settled, however, that the trial court\u2019s determination is reviewable on appeal, and may be reversed if founded on an error of law or some serious mistake, or if the trial court has clearly abused its discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">In <em>Vandegrift v.

However, after reading that statement in context with her entire testimony, we conclude that the lower court did not abuse its discretion by allowing DuBey to testify to her conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">DuBey\u2019s trial testimony was not as complex as her crime reports (which the trial court admitted into evidence). Du-Bey tested several pieces of evidence and reached conclusions as to each. She explained some of her tests and conclusions to the jury. The only blood test result that matched blood consistent with Earline\u2019s type to Patrick was the PGM test of blood found on Patrick\u2019s sneakers. Thus, DuBey's response, that these results were the only results significant for the case\u2019s purposes, takes on new meaning. DuBey clarified her use of the term \u201csignificant\u201d during a discourse with Mr. Klenk, Patrick\u2019s co-counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">Q Okay. Well, with respect to the first report that you prepared and analyzed all the clothing items that the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s [has] just gone over, the razor knife, were any of the results on any of those items significant with respect to this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">A I\u2019m not sure what you mean by significant.

Yet, he fails to point out that he originally filed a demand for bill of particulars in his murder case (# 90601C), but <em>not </em>in his attempted sexual offenses case (# 90769C). Maryland Rule 4-241 is relevant to this discussion.

You have your objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The Court of Appeals, in <em>McMorris v. State, </em>277 Md. 62, 70 n. 4, 355 A.2d 438 (1976), stated that \u201c[t]he purpose of a bill of particulars is to guard against the taking of an accused by surprise by limiting the scope of the proof.\u201d According to <em>Boozer, </em>304 Md. 98, 113, 497 A.2d 1129 (1985), and article 27, \u00a7 461C(b) of the Code, Patrick <em>was </em>entitled to a bill of particulars that specifically set out the allegations against him.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We use the past tense because Patrick did not timely file his demand for bill of particulars for the rape and sexual offense charges. In fact, he did not file a demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Maryland Rule 4-241(a) provides that the defendant may file a demand for bill of particulars \u201c[w]ithin 15 days after the earlier of the appearance of counsel or the first appearance of the defendant____\u201d We have not been shy to enforce this provision. In <em>Fraidin v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 231, 270-71, 583 A.2d 1065 (1991), we held that a defendant who did not timely file a demand for bill of particulars had no entitlement to one. In that factual scenario (theft), the trial court had the discretion to compel the State to provide a bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"AKt\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Article 27, \u00a7 461C makes the present circumstance different. The Legislature decided that a defendant is entitled to a bill of particulars if the general form of information is used to charge a rape or sexual offense. <em>State v. Mulkey, </em>316 Md. 475, 489, 560 A.2d 24 (1989) (\u201cThis language [\u00a7 4610(b) ] indicates a mandatory, unqualified intent.\u201d). In <em>Mulkey, </em>the lower court granted Mulkey\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment and, thereby, ruled that his demand for bill of particulars was moot. <em>Mulkey, </em>316 Md. at 488, 560 A.2d 24. The indictment against Mulkey charged him with child abuse and multiple sexual offenses. <em>Mulkey, </em>316 Md. at 477-79, 560 A.2d 24. Mulkey, unlike Patrick, \u201cfiled a ... demand for a bill of particulars.\u201d <em>Mulkey, </em>316 Md. at 479, 560 A.2d 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for the trial court to require the State to provide a bill of particulars, and then rule on the motion to dismiss the indictment in light of the information provided. <em>Mulkey, </em>316 Md. at 489-90, 560 A.2d 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Patrick should have followed the dictates of Md.Rule 4-241(a). His failure to follow proper procedure undercuts his position. If we were to ignore Md.Rule 4-241, the efficient administration of justice could run amuck. For instance, as in the present case, the defendant could wait until the day of trial and then make his demand. The State and the courts would be subject to the vagaries of the defendant\u2019s whim. Such a result would be absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Patrick\u2019s error of omission aside, the lack of a bill of particulars did not lead to his \u201csurprise\u201d during trial. The State had provided Patrick with all the relevant facts that it had concerning the manner and cause of Earline\u2019s death. That is why the lower court ruled against Patrick on this point.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">THE COURT: They don\u2019t know any more than you do, if he did it, what his particular acts were because nobody was there. I don\u2019t think they can give you anything more at this point except the witnesses and you already know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>what evidence they do have by way of whatever statements and physical evidence, so I don\u2019t really think there\u2019s anything more they can give you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">THE COURT: You know what\u2019s alleged to have been done to the body. I don\u2019t really think there\u2019s much more they can tell you at this point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The court\u2019s language implies that the State would not have been able to clarify the charges in the information. Regardless of hypothetical situations, Patrick\u2019s failure to file timely a demand for bill of particulars is fatal to his argument. Moreover, the State provided him with the information that it had.
