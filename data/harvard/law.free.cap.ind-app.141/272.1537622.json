Wilson. Said action arises from an automobile-pedestrian collision occurring when appellant was crossing North Belmont Street in Indianapolis at a point in front of her residence. She was struck by an automobile driven by appellee, who was proceeding north on Belmont.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">Trial was had by jury, which returned its general verdict in favor of appellee. The sole assignment of error urged upon this appeal is the overruling of appellant\u2019s timely motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">The specifications of error presented for our consideration are appellee\u2019s instructions numbered 10, 18, 19, 23, and 24, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>which were given by the trial court, and the court\u2019s refusal to give appellant\u2019s instruction number 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Appellee\u2019s instruction number 10 withdrew from the jury\u2019s consideration the following allegation of negligence contained in appellant\u2019s complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">\u201c (e) In failing to turn his automobile to the left to avoid striking the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Although we do not choose to burden this opinion with a summary of the testimony adduced at trial relative to this allegation of negligence, it will suffice to observe that the evidence revealed that the appellee did turn his automobile to the left in an attempt to avoid striking the appellant, and there is no evidence to the contrary. The trial court\u2019s action in refining the issues and removing this allegation from consideration by the jury was, therefore, not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Appellee\u2019s tendered instruction number 18 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">\u201cYou are instructed that where a person is confronted with a sudden emergency not of his own making without sufficient time to determine with certainty the best course to pursue, he is not held to the same accuracy of judgment as would be required of him if he had had time for deliberation. Accordingly, if he exercises such care as an ordinary prudent person would exercise when confronted by a like emergency, he is not liable for an injury which resulted from his conduct, even though another course of conduct would have been more judicious or safer or might even have avoided the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">\u201cSo in this case, if you find that the defendant, Donald G. Wilson, was faced or confronted with a sudden emergency not of his own making and that he then pursued the course that an ordinary prudent person would pursue or follow when confronted by the same emergency, but the collision and accident to the plaintiff, nevertheless, resulted, then the defendant Donald G. Wilson would not be liable, even though you believe that another course of action or conduct than that which he pursued when confronted with the said sudden emergency, would have been more judicious, or safer, or might even have avoided the collision and accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The appellant contends that there is \u201cno evidence that the appellee was confronted with a sudden emergency unless it was one of his own creation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We cannot agree with this contention. The record includes evidence from which the jury could properly have found that the appellant, without any forewarning, walked directly into the path of the appellee\u2019s automobile, which was traveling less than the statutory prima facie speed limit of 30 miles per hour, and that any sudden emergency was occasioned by the actions of the appellant, and was not of the appellee\u2019s own making. Therefore, there was no error in the giving of this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Appellant objected to appellee\u2019s instruction number 19 \u201cfor the reason that it is repetitious of Defendant\u2019s Instruction No. 17, simply telling the Jury that one is not bound to anticipate negligence of another whereas Instruction No. 17 tells the Jury that one has the right to assume that others will not be negligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Appellant\u2019s objection states the difference in subject matter, however slight. Considered together, the instructions present separate, finely spun theories of defense. The instructions are similar, but not identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">We reaffirm the Indiana Supreme Court, holding in <em>Keeshin Motor Express Co. </em>v. <em>Glassman </em>(1942), 219 Ind. 538, 38 N. E. (2d) 847, at p. 553:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6t\">\u201cWhile this court has long recognized the well known principle that frequent and unnecessary repetition of correct statements of law in instructions may be reversible error, it has been reluctant to reverse a judgment solely on that ground . . . (O)nly in exceptional cases, and particularly where from the whole record we cannot fairly say that a correct result was reached, will we attempt to apply the principle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">Considering all the instructions in the instant case, and applying the above stated criterion, we do not believe the giving of appellee\u2019s instruction number 19 is reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>We have examined appellee\u2019s instructions numbered 28 and 24 complained of by appellant, and find that the court did not err in giving them to the jury. One instruction relates to appellant assuming the risk of a \u201cknown danger, if any\u201d and the other deals with appellant \u201csuddenly walking into the path of appellee\u2019s auto, if she did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Appellant does not contend that the instructions given were erroneous statements of the law. Her only complaint is that they were not applicable to the evidence. Again, we have reviewed the evidence, and have found that the instructions given were applicable thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The trial court refused to give appellant\u2019s instruction number 15, which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">\u201cAlthough the plaintiff has the duty to use due care in crossing the street, in determining whether or not plaintiff has used due care you may take into consideration the prior negligence, if any, of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANba\">We believe that, under the evidence before us, this instruction was properly refused. The instruction does not restrict the jury\u2019s consideration to acts of negligence alleged in appellant\u2019s complaint. We believe that standing as it does, without any specific application to the facts of the case, it could have misled the jury. The jury could have construed the instruction to mean that if the appellee was negligent in any prior act, this would absolve any subsequent contributory negligence on the part of the appellant. This is, of course, incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Believing that this cause was fairly tried and a just result reached below, and finding no errors in the giving or refusal of instructions, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A4lW\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">Pfaff, C. J., and Bierly and Smith, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 227 N. E. 2d 462.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
