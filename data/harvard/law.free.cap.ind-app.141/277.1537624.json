After the proper issues were closed, the cause was submitted to a jury for trial. At the conclusion of the Appellant\u2019s evidence, the trial judge, upon the Appellee\u2019s Motion, directed a verdict for the Appellee. It appears that the trial judge rendered judgment upon the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the Appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The Appellant assigns as error the overruling of his motion for a new trial. His motion avers in substance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">(1) The verdict is not sustained by sufficient evidence, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">(2) The verdict was contrary to law, and other specifics tions of alleged error, which we will consider under the foregoing second specification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The Appellant\u2019s complaint in the record and now before us, omitting the caption and signature, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">\u201cComes now the plaintiff, Monon Railroad, by its attorneys and complains of the defendant, and for cause of action states as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">\u201c1. The Plaintiff, Monon Railroad, hereinafter sometimes referred to as \u2018Monon\u2019 is a railroad corporation incorporated and doing business under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Indiana, in and through the Town of Shelby, County of Lake, the State of Indiana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">\u201c2. The defendant, New York Central Railroad Company, hereinafter sometimes referred to as \u2018Central,\u2019 is a railroad corporation incorporated under and by virtue of the laws of the State of New York and doing business in Indiana under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Indiana, and runs through the Town of Shelby, the County of Lake, the State of Indiana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-11\">\u201c3. That the plaintiff and the defendant have heretofore entered into agreements with one another, by their respective corporate predecessors and between themselves as they appear on the said documents as they are referred to below, to-wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-12\">\u201ca. The defendant by its corporate predecessor, the Indiana, Illinois and Iowa Railroad Company, and the plaintiff by its corporate predecessor, the Louisville, New Albany &amp; Chicago Railway Company, entered into an agreement on the 25th day of October, 1882. The subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>of this agreement was the terms under which the defendant\u2019s corporate predecessor was allowed to cross plaintiff\u2019s corporate predecessor\u2019s line of railroad in Shelby, Lake County, State of Indiana. The said agreement is marked \u2018Exhibit A,\u2019 and attached hereto and hereby made a part hereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-4\">\u201cb. The defendant by its corporate predecessor, Indiana, Illinois &amp; Iowa Railroad Company, and the plaintiff by its corporate predecessor, the Chicago, Indianapolis and Louisville Railway Company, entered into a new agreement on the 7th day of July, 1904. The subject of this contract was again the manner in which the defendant\u2019s corporate predecessor was to be allowed to maintain its tracks across plaintiff\u2019s corporate predecessor\u2019s line of railroad in Shelby, Lake County, State of Indiana. Under this agreement, both parties were to share in the cost of erection and maintenance of a depot and other crossing facilities to insure the safety of the crossing and otherwise for the convenience of the parties respectively, the costs of which were to be shared equally between the two parties. Under this agreement both parties were to pay equal proportions of the pay rolls of employees at the joint station and all supplies for the maintenance and operation of the said depot and interlocking plant were to be furnished by the Chicago, Indianapolis and Louiseville (sic) Railway Company, one half of the same to be billed against the Indiana, Illinois &amp; Iowa Railway Company periodically. A copy of the said agreement is attached hereto and hereby made a part hereof and referred to as \u2018Exhibit B\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">\u201cc. The defendant by its corporate predecessor, Chicago, Indiana &amp; Southern Railroad Company and plaintiff by its corporate predecessor, Chicago, Indianapolis and Louisville Railway Company, entered into an agreement on the 18th day of November, 1911, the same being expressly declared by its terms to be supplemental to the agreement of the 7th day of July, 1904. This agreement affirmed the 1904 agreement and declared the same to be still in \u2018full force and effect\u2019 except for the modifications made, none of which affect the said joint station. A copy of the said agreement is attached hereto and hereby made a part hereof and referred to as \u2018Exhibit C\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">\u201cd. The plaintiff by its corporate predecessor, Chicago, Indianapolis &amp; Louisville Railway Company, agreed by letter of December 21, 1918, to Central to assume all the costs and expenses of the joint station at Shelby, Indiana, and to bill half of the same to Central whenever the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>should accrue. A copy of the same is attached hereto and hereby made a part hereof and referred to as \u2018Exhibit D\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-4\">\u201ce. The plaintiff by its corporate predecessor, Chicago, Indianapolis &amp; Louisville Railway Company, subsequently affirmed the said agreement set out in paragraph 3 (d) hereof by letter of January 10, 1922, a copy of which is attached hereto and hereby made a part hereof and marked \u2018Exhibit E\\</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">\u201cf. Central and Monon entered into an agreement dated the 18th day of July, 1961. This agreement modified the interlocking agreement existing at the time of the agreement. The said agreement also expressly recognized the agreements referred to herein as \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019, and \u2018C\u2019 as being in full force and effect. A copy of the same is attached hereto and hereby made a part hereof and referred to as \u2018Exhibit F\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">\u201c4. None of the agreements set out in paragraph 3 herein have modified Central\u2019s obligation to pay for half the joint station costs and expenses of maintenance wages, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">\u201c5. The plaintiff and the defendant shared the costs until October, 1961, during which month Central notified Monon it would, effective November 1, 1961, \u2018no longer bear any portion of the agency expense at Shelby.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">\u201c6. Between November 1, 1961, and October 7, 1964, Monon continued to perate (sic) the said joint station, closing on October 9, 1964, after obtaining permission to do so by action before the Public Service Commission of Indiana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">\u201c7. Between November 1, 1961, and October 7, 1964, Monon held the joint station open and remained ready willing and able to provide depot facilities for any and ail services required or desired by Central. And Monon has at all times performed all of its other duties under the agreements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">\u201c8. Central continued to use the said joint station from and after November 1, 1961, until October 9, 1964, for its railroad purposes in that it maintained operative railroad communications equipment in the said joint station which said equipment was never disconnected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-11\">\u201c9. Central has not paid any bill rendered by Monon for joint station expenses which accrued after November 1, 1961, and which were rendered on a monthly basis within a reasonable time from their accrual for the period between November 1, 1961 and October 9, 1964. Central has, in fact, refused to pay the same upon each billing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>\u201c10. Central has continued to pay all other bills rendered under the agreements referred to as Exhibits \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019, \u2018C\u2019, \u2018D\u2019, \u2018E\u2019, and \u2018F\u2019 and continued to use the rail crossings and protection thereof which is covered by the said agreements also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-4\">\u201c11. Central is indebted to Monon for and on account of the facts herein set out in that Monon has provided a joint facility and Central has used the same and refused to pay its portion pertaining to the maintenance and expenses of the joint station at Shelby, Lake County, State of Indiana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">\u201c12. The amount for which Central is indebted to Monon, as hereinafter set out in \u2018Exhibit G\u2019, which is hereby made a part hereof, the same being schedule of the bills rendered by Monon to Central for the period between November 1, 1961 and October 9, 1964, is Ten Thousand Five Hundred Twelve and 86/100 Dollars ($10,512.86).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">\u201cWHEREFORE, the plaintiff prays that it be given judgment against the defendant in the amount of Ten Thousand Five Hundred Twelve and 86/100 Dollars ($10,512.86) and all and other relief proper in the premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The Appellee\u2019s Answer, omitting the caption and signature reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">\u201cComes now defendant, New York Central Railroad Company, by its attorneys, and for answer to plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges and states as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">\u201c1.

E. 2d, 96, 99; West\u2019s Indiana Law Practice (1967), Sec. 1768, p. 528 and authorities cited; West\u2019s Indiana Law Encyclopedia, Vol. 1, <em>Appeals, </em>Sec. 175, p. 665, and authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>However, the appellant may, and does assert that the verdict was contrary to law and it thus presents that question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>whether the Appellant was entitled, under the evidence and the law applicable thereto, to the relief which was denied it by the directed verdict. <em>Hinds, Executor of Estate of Sickels, Deceased, </em>v. <em>McNair, et al., </em>(1955), 235 Ind. 34, 41, 129 N.

E. 2d, 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">This brings us to the pertinent question presented to us by this appeal: Did the trial judge err in sustaining the Motion for a peremptory instruction in favor of the Appellee, at the close of the Appellant\u2019s evidence? If that action was erroneous, the cause should be reversed. Otherwise, we must affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AX0\">The general rule of law applicable stating when a trial court may properly give a trial jury a peremptory instruction to find for the defendant is found in the case of <em>Whitaker, Admr. of the Estate of Sayler, deceased, </em>v. <em>Borntrager </em>(1954), 233 Ind. 678, 680, 122 N.

S. 834.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">It appears from the record now before us that the issue below and what we are called upon to decide is: Did the Appellant plead and offer evidence of probative value, proving or tending to prove a cause of action against the Appellee so as to make a prima facie case to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In reviewing the evidence in the record it reveals, in substance, that the parties herein entered into a contract in July, 1904, and that the contract was altered and changed by the parties, said change to become effective on January 1, 1919; thereafter the parties continued under the contract until October, 1961, at which time the New York Central Railroad Company notified the Monon Railroad that effective November 1, 1961, New York Central would no longer bear any portion of the agency expense at Shelby, Indiana. The evidence also shows that after November 1, 1961, the New York Central Railroad Company no longer used the facilities of the Monon Railroad and did not pay any sum to the Monon Railroad after said date. Monon Railroad closed the station on October 9, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"AJi\">There being no conflict in the evidence, we are of the opinion that under the law applicable to contracts in our state, a contract which contains no specific termination date is terminable by the parties thereto at will. See West\u2019s Indiana Law Encyclopedia, <em>Contracts, </em>Vol. 6, Sec. 164, p. 209, wherein we find the following statement: \u201cA contract containing no specific termination date is terminable at will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The Appellant is in error in inferring that a contract without a specific termination date is perpetual. In the case of <em>Grand Lodge Hall Assn. I. O. O. F. et al., </em>v. <em>Moore, Auditor, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>et al., </em>(1946), 224 Ind. 575, 70 N. E. 2d, 19, beginning on page 583, we find the following applicable statement of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-4\">\u201cFrom this premise the argument is made that because the exemption contained in Sec. 9 is not limited in time it therefore must also be deemed to be perpetual. Against this view, is the principle that a contract containing no specific termination date is terminable at will and the further rule that where the parties fix no time for the performance or discharge of obligations created by the contract they are assumed to have had in mind a reasonable time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">We cannot say as a matter of law that the period of time from July, 1904, to November 1, 1961, was not a reasonable period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The following cases also recognize the basic theory of law, although not directly involved, that the termination of a contract which contains no specific time for termination may be terminated by either party at will. <em>Grimm et al., </em>v. <em>Baumgart </em>(1951), 121 Ind. App. 626, 633, 96 N. E. 2d, 915; <em>Int\u2019l Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Lacy </em>(1944), 114 Ind. App. 641, 647, 53 N. E. 2d, 636; <em>Miller Etc. </em>v. <em>Ortman, Etc. et al., </em>(1956), 235 Ind. 641, 136 N. E. 2d 17.</p>\n<p id=\"ANz\">It appears from the Appellant\u2019s brief that it is attempting to raise new issues before this court that were not before the trial court. Such new issues present nothing for our consideration. See West\u2019s Indiana Law Encyclopedia, Vol. 2, <em>Appeals, </em>Sec. 497, p. 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">It is affirmatively apparent from the Appellant\u2019s complaint, hereinbefore set out, that the Appellee was liable to the Appellant for the continued use of the Shelby station from the tim\u00e9 of the termination of the contract until the Appellant closed the station in 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">We have reviewed and considered the evidence in the record most carefully and we find nothing in the testimony or evidence quoted or referred to by the Appellant which sustains the material and pertinent allegations of its complaint. There appears no evidence whatsoever, nor any reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>inference, in support of said allegation contained in Appellant\u2019s rhetorical paragraph No. 8; as a matter of fact, the Appellant admitted this in oral argument.
