If the court give judgment of freedom, it must be of unqualified freedom, and the intention of the testator is defeated; for it was clearly his intention, that the petitioner should not be free, unless the terms imposed on him by the bequest could be legally and faithfully complied with.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-11\">5.

The statement briefly represents <em>Charles\u2019s </em>right to freedom under the will of his deceased master, <em>John W. Beard, </em>and points to and sets out the particular clause by which he claims it. What is the true meaning of the testator in this clause seems <em>to </em>have been the sole question submitted to that court, and can alone have our attention in revising their decision. We concur with the Judges in thinking that <em>John W. Beard </em>intended that <em>Charles </em>should be a free man on the first day of January, 1827; it could not have been his intention that the condition mentioned, should have been performed by <em>Charles </em>precedent to that day, as the acts to be done consist of payments to be made by him annually, as long as he may live.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Considered as a condition to be performed subsequent <em>to </em>freedom, it presents a question upon which we need not give an opinion, as it is one in which the executor can have no interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">The subject of assets insisted on in the argument, is not before us, and we shall express no opinion, in relation to it. If it deeply concerns the executor, we can-only say, that he has had ample time to understand his situation as to assets, and to take legal steps for his security.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">We affirm the judgement of <em>Anne Arundel </em>County Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
