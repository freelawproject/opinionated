This bond was given to the State, and no authority is given for its being put in suit for the use of an individual. Suppose there is a judgment given in this case, how are the other creditors to proceed? Can each of them bring a <em>scire facias </em>on this judgment; or must suits be brought on the bond for the use of each creditor? One judgment on the bond absorbs it. Where bonds are directed to be given to the. State, a remedy is prescribed for suits being brought on them for the use of any individual who may be damnified\u2014Such as on the bonds of sheriffs, executors, and administrators, &amp;c. But there is no general law on the subject, as in <em>Pennsylvania. </em>3 <em>Yeates, </em>345. <em>Corporation of Washington vs. </em>Young, 10 <em>Wheat. </em>406. By the act of 1805, <em>ch. </em>110, <em>sec. </em>11, the bond is directed to be given as a security for those creditors only, by whom the insolvent is imprisoned, 1807,ch. 150,sec. <em>3. </em>1808, <em>ch. 71,sec. 2. </em>1816,<em>ch.221,sec. 2. </em>1821, <em>ch. </em>250. <em>Commonwealth vs. Hatch, 5 Mass.

The condition of the bond in question is for the benefit of all the creditors of the insolvent. Ought it to be otherwise ? As to the objection to the verdict, it is now too late to object to it. The issue was found by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>jury in favour of the plaintiff, hut it is incorrectly stated by the clerk. So far as the issue is as to the not filing allegations, it was an immaterial issue; for the creditors were not bound to file allegations until the insolvent appeared. <em>I Chitty\u2019s Plead. </em>634. <em>2 Tidd\u2019s Pr. </em>813, 814. The verdict ascertains the debt. .What ought to be the damages? They must be to the amount of the debt due to the creditor for whose use the action is brought. But it may be said that the bond was not forfeited, there being no allegations filed. The debtor must have appeared according to the condition of his bond, and in his plea in this suit he should have averred that fact. 5 <em>Bac.

There was no issue joined whether the insolvent debtor appeared or not. In this case, a motion in arrest of judgment would have prevailed; and if so, advantage may be taken of it on this appeal. There should have been proof that permission was given to <em>Costello to </em>sue on the bond, as the defendant\u2019s prayer to the court was a general one, that the plaintiff could not recover. Here is a judgment, and it is a bar to any other action on the same bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-6\">Morrow <em>vs. </em>The State, use of Israel\u2014Appeal from <em>Baltimore </em>County Court.

The defendant pleaded general performance, to which, there was a replication stating that the said <em>Ireton, </em>on the 4.th of May, 1821, made application to the Commissioners of Insolvent Debtors for the city and. county of Baltimore, for a discharge under the insolvent laws of this State; that the Commissioners then ordered that the said <em>Ireton </em>should be discharged, and they did then appoint and fix the 2d of July, 1821, for <em>the </em>appearance <em>of Ire-</em>ion, before them at, &amp;c. to answer such interrogatories as should be propounded to him by any of his creditors; and also did then appoint and fix the first-Saturday of September tferm then next, of <em>Baltimore </em>County Court, then to answer, such allegations and interrogatories, as the creditors of the said <em>Ireton, </em>or any of them might file against him, and to continue in court until duly discharged. That <em>Beale Israel, </em>being one of the creditors of <em>Ireton, </em>to a large amount, to wit, in the sum of $500, did file with the Commissioners of Insolvent Debtors for the city and county of <em>Baltimore, </em>before the said second\u2019 of July, 1821, to wit, on the first of July, 1821, certain interrogatories to be answered by the said <em>Ireton. </em>That the said <em>Ireton </em>never did appear before the said Commissioners on the second of July, as aforesaid, or on any other day; and also that the said <em>Ireton </em>never appeared before <em>Baltimore </em>County Court, but absented himself therefrom, to deceive and defraud his creditors. Of all which premises the defendant, afterwards, &amp;c. had notice. And the said <em>Beale Israel, </em>at whose instance and for whose use this suit is instituted, was, by reason of the premises, prevented from suing and holding to bail the said <em>Ireton, </em>and bath never since been able to arrest the said Ireton, and hath by occasion of the premises, wholly lost his claim as aforesaid, on the said <em>Ireton; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>and this, &amp;c. The defendant rejoined to the replication that the said <em>Ireton </em>did appear before the said Commissioners on the said second of July, 1821, and that he also appeared before <em>Baltimore </em>County Court, and did not absent himself therefrom to deceive and defraud his creditors.

At the trial the plaintiff gave in evidence the application of <em>Hugh </em>Ireton, for the benefit of the insolvent laws of this State, and all the papers connected therewith; and also the docket entries of the Commissioners, in his case. The report of the Commissioners of Insolvent Debtors, for the city and county of Baltimore, dated the 22d of September, 1821, slated the following proceedings had before them, viz. the petition of <em>Hugh Ireton </em>of the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>praying for the benefit of the insolvent laws, dated the 4th of May, 1821. A schedule of his property, real, personal and mixed, excluding the necessary wearing apparel and bedding of himself and his family, amounting (being household and kitchen furniture,) to $40. A list stating that there were no debts due to him. A list of his creditors, and among others <em>Beale Israel, </em>$41 66. The whole amount of his debts as stated, being $224 03. All of which was sworn to by the petitioner. Proof of the necessary residence of <em>Ireton </em>in the State, and that he was in custody, &amp;c. The Commissioners then appointed and fixed the 2d of July then next, for the personal appearance of <em>Ireton </em>before them, at &amp;c. \u201cto answer such interrogatories as maybe propounded to him by any of his creditors;\u201d and they also appointed and fixed the first Saturday in the next September term of <em>Baltimore </em>County Court, for the final appearance of the said insolvent before the said court, \u201cto answer such allegations as may be made against him by his creditors, or any of them, and for the final hearing of his said application.\u201d The bond entered into to the <em>State of Maryland, </em>by <em>Hugh Ireton </em>and <em>William Morrow, </em>on the 4th of May, 1821, in the penalty of $500, and conditioned for the personal appearance of <em>Ireton </em>before the Commissioners, and before <em>Baltimore </em>County Court, on the respective days before mentioned. Also the bond entered into by <em>Thomas Power </em>with <em>William Morrow, </em>as his surety, to the <em>State of Maryland, </em>on the 4th of May,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>1821, in the penalty of $500, reciting that the said <em>Power </em>had been appointed by the Commissioners, provisional trustee to take possession, for the benefit of the creditors of <em>Ireton, </em>of all his property, &amp;c. and conditioned that <em>Power well </em>and faithfully perform the said trust, &amp;c. Also a deed of conveyance, dated the 4th of May, 1821, executed by <em>Ireton </em>to <em>Power, the </em>provisional trustee, conveying all his property, &amp;c. The certificate of <em>Power, </em>the provisional trustee, that he had received <em>from Ireton </em>all his property, &amp;c. Then follows the personal discharge of <em>Ireton, </em>granted to him by the Commissioners. Certain interrogatories-were then stated to have been propounded to <em>Ireton </em>on the part of <em>Beale Israel, </em>to which, answers were given by <em>Ireton, </em>and sworn to by him, on the 11th of July, 1821. The Commissioners then further reported to <em>Baltimore </em>County Court, \u201c that having diligently inquired and examined into the nature and circumstances of the said application, it appears upon such examination, that the said <em>Ireton </em>hath not complied with the terms and conditions of the said insolvent laws,\u201d &amp;c. Whereupon it was considered and adjudged by <em>Baltimore </em>County Court, on the 22d of September, 1821, that the said <em>Ireton </em>was not entitled to the benefit of the acts of Assembly for the relief of insolvent debtors; and that, therefore, the prayer of the said petitioner ought not to be granted. The docket entries of the Commissioners on <em>Ireton\u2019s </em>petition, given in evidence as before mentioned, show that \u201cthe petition was filed on the 4th of May, 1821\u201d\u2014\u201c <em>Thomas Power </em>was appointed provisional trustee\u201d\u2014that \u201c the petitioner was to appear before the Commissioners, to answer interrogatories on the 2d July, 1821, and to appear before <em>Baltimore </em>County Court on the first Saturday of September term, 1821, for final discharge.

The defendant then prayed the court to direct the jury upon the foregoing evidence, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. Which direction the court [Archer, Ch.

No bond to the <em>Slate </em>is valid, unless given pursuant to some act of Assembly. <em>Owings vs. </em>Norwood, <em>2 Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>108, <em>(note.) </em>The bond to be given by a trustee, under the act of 1805, <em>ch. </em>110, sec. 4, is expiessly required to be given to the <em>State. </em>But the bond required by the <em>eleventh section </em>to be given by the insolvent debtor for his appearance, &amp;c. is not required to be so given\u2014it is not said to whom the bond is to be given. By the act of November, 1788, <em>ch. </em>17, <em>sec. </em>5, the trustee of an insolvent debtor was required to give bond to the State. By the act of 1791, <em>ch. </em>73, <em>sec. </em>3, the trustee to give bond to such person as the Chancellor should direct; and tho <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Chancellor directed such bonds to be given to the Attorney General. The same provision is contained in the act. of 1792, <em>ch. </em>67, <em>sec. </em>3. By the <em>tenth section </em>of that act, an imprisoned debtor, if required by the Chancellor, was to give bond: but it is not said to whom such bond was to be given. The practice, seems to have been that the Chancellor directed the bond to be given to the sheriff of the county in which the debtor resided. Similar provisions are contained in the acts of 1793, <em>ch. </em>68, <em>sec. </em>3, 10. 1794, <em>ch. </em>72, sec. 3, 10. 1795, <em>ch. </em>82, <em>sec. </em>3, 10. 1796, <em>ch. </em>70, <em>sec. </em>4, 11. By the act of 1797, <em>ch. </em>82, <em>sec. </em>7, the bonds of the debtors are to be given to the trustees. The act of 1797, <em>ch. </em>97, sec. 4,11, contains the same-provisions as the act of 1796, <em>ch. </em>70, sec. 4,11, &amp;c. Similar provisions are also contained in the acts of 1798, <em>ch. </em>64, sec. 4,11, and 1799, <em>ch. </em>88, <em>sec. </em>4,11. By the act of 1804, <em>ch. </em>110, sec. 4, trustees were required to give bonds to the <em>State. </em>By the <em>eleventh section o\u00ed </em>that act, imprisoned debtors, if required by the County Court, .&amp;c. are to give bonds with security, for their appearance, &amp;c\u201e \u00a1but it is not said to whom such bonds were to be given. The act of 1805, <em>ch. </em>110, sec. 4, 11, has the same provisions. The same expressions will <em>be </em>found in the act of 1808, <em>ch. </em>71, sec. 2. We come now to the act of 1816, <em>ch. </em>221, sec. 2, whereby the Commissioners of Insolvent Debtors for the city and county of <em>Baltimore, </em>are required to take a bond for the petitioner\u2019s appearance, &amp;c. \u201c with security to be by them approved.\u201d From all the preceding, it will be seen that there is no provision of law which authorises the giving of a bond by a petition for the benefit of the insolvent laws, to the <em>State of Maryland. </em>The \u2022bond of a trustee of an insolvent debtor is expressly provided to be <em>for the use of the creditors </em>of the insolvent, whereas the bond sto be given by the debtor is not provided to be <em>for such use. </em>No suit can be maintained on a public bond, unless the law provides that persons damnified may bring suit on any such bond. 'This was the argument in <em>M'Mechen vs. The Mayor, &amp;c. of Baltimore, </em>3 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>534.

The bond being given that the insolvent debtor shall appear, &amp;c. cannot be for the benefit of the creditors, if he does not appear. At all events, the debtor failing to appear cannot subject the surety to the payment of all the debts due to creditors. In an action on a bond with a collateral condition to secure third parties, there ought to be some evidence of damage; or else, why should the plaintiff be permitted to sue? What interest has this creditor in this bond, (his name not appearing in it,) except because he is damnified by the non-appearance of his debtor ? He ought, to have given some slight evidence of injury sustained by the forfeit of the bond. It would be a violent presumption, <em>without </em>evidence and against evidence, to presume that he is damnified to the whole amount of his debt. And not he only, but ail the other creditors. So that the surety of an insolvent debtor is to be overwhelmed, because, to relieve his friend from imprisonment, he is his surety for his appearance. He may be, and no doubt, universally, sureties become so, because they know their principal is worth nothing or little, and, therefore, they can be very slightly injured by the forfeiture of the appearance. There is nothing in the law analogous to this doctrine. For with regard to special bail, or rather sureties in a bail bond, the presumption is, that the debtor is able to pay the debt, from which he absconds. But it is otherwise with respect to insolvent debtors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-6\">3. But suppose the presumption not to be so in ordinary cases. In this case evidence was offered and rejected, to show actually that the principal had nothing, and, therefore, the creditor could have recovered nothing. All that could be done was to <em>imprison </em>him. This would be no satisfaction of the debt, but merely a <em>penalty </em>for fraud. Under our insolvent laws, imprisonment is no satisfaction for debts. It is used to coerce debtors to give up their property, and as a punishment for fraud. Here the proof is, that the debtor had given up all his property, <em>of course} </em>all that could be done would be to imprison him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>4. If there was such a privity between this creditor and the obligors in the bond, that being forfeited, he could sue on it. Still if he was not actually damnified, he was only entitled to nominal damages. By the act of <em>1821, ch. 250, </em>provision is made for the enlargement of the time for the appearance of the debtor, without requiring a new bond, and without the consent of the creditors. What then becomes of the old bond? 5 <em>Johns. Rep. 42. 9. Johns. Rep. 300. 10 Johns. Rep. 563. 2 Johns. Rep. 205.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-6\">Meredith, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-7\">This suit was brought in the name of the state, for the use of one of the creditors of an insolvent, against his surety, in- a bond given for the appearance of the debtor, in pursuance of the act of 1816, <em>chap. 221, sec. 2.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-8\">In the argument on the part of the appellant, it was made a question whether there could <em>be </em>any recovery on the bond in this case, since there is no specific provision in any part of the law referred to for taking bonds of this description in the name of the State; and it is upon this question alone that the counsel for the appellee, will detain the court. It is certainly true, that the act in question does not designate the obligee in these bonds. After providing for the appointment of the provisional trustee, the section above cited, proceeds to direct, \u201c that the Commissioners shall take bond, with security, to be by them approved, for the appearance of such insolvent, to answer such interrogatories as may be propounded to him by any of his creditors, or such allegations as may be filed against him, within the time hereinafter mentioned.\u201d But, in the similar provision, which is to be found in the acts of 1805, <em>ch. </em>110, sec. 11; 1807, <em>ch. 150, </em>sec. 3; 1808, <em>ch. </em>71, <em>sec. </em>2; and 1817, ch. 183, sec. 1, there is no more particular designation of the obligee, than in the act of 1816; and yet the invariable practice has been from the passage of the first general insolvent law in 1805, to the present period, to take the appearance bonds of insolvent debtors in the name of the State, and the legality of doing so, it is believed, has never before been questioned. A construction, therefore, thus given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>by the courts throughout the State, and uniformly acted upon for upwards of twenty years, in the innumerable cases which have arisen under the insolvent law, should not be disturbed but for the strongest and most unanswerable reasons. Where the interpretation of a law is doubtful, the exposition' given to it immediately after its passage, when the intention of the Legislature is more certainly ascertained than at a later period, is entitled to great consideration, and generally is deemed decisive. <em>Contempor\u00e1nea expositio est fortissima in lege. </em>6 <em>Bac. Jib. </em>385. Again, it is a rule in the construction of statutes that such an interpretation ought to be given as will prevent the object of the law from being defeated. 15 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>358. If the objection to the bond in this case is a valid one, it is manifest that the provision which the Legislature intended for the .security of creditors is rendered wholly inoperative. For if the bond cannot be rightly taken in the name of the State, because it is not so specifically directed, it cannot for precisely the same reason be taken in the name of any other obligee. And thus creditors are left without any security whatever, and the intention of the Legislature, which is obviously to substitute the appearance bond in the place of special bail, is completely frustrated. Legislative intention is often resorted to, to explain the meaning of laws. 15 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>358. <em>That </em>intention may be collected from other provisions in the same law, and looking to the provision with regard to the trustees bond, which is expressly directed to be taken in the name of the State by the act of 1805, it would seem that the Legislature must have intended that the appearance bond should also be given to the State, or they would have otherwise directed. Why should the one be taken in the name of the State and not the other ? They are both for the security of creditors; the Slate, is not interested, but selected merely as a safe and permanent trustee for their benefit. Having once mentioned the form of a bond, it was not thought necessary to repeat it. And it may be remarked, that in the act of 1808, <em>eh. </em>71, sec. 3, where both the trustees bond, and the appearance bond are mentioned, there is no specific direction as to either, with regard to the obligee; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>yet it will scarcely be doubted, that a trustees\u2019 bond is under this law, which is the last upon the subject, properly and legally given in the name of the State. If, however, the bond in this case is not considered as being authorised by the act of 1816, in connexion with the preceding insolvent laws, the appellee insists that it is still a good bond at common law, and that the State ought to be regarded as a trustee for the creditors, for whose benefit it was intended. This principle will be found to have been repeatedly settled in <em>England </em>and this country. The court, however, is particularly referred to. <em>2 </em>Strange, 1137. 12 <em>Mass.

This third case was an appeal from <em>Frederick </em>County Court, and also an action of debt on a writing obligatory entered into on the 24th of June, 1818, by the defendant, (now appellant,) with <em>David Wagner </em>and <em>John Gilbert </em>as his sureties, to the State in the penalty of $1000, and conditioned for the appearance of the defendant in <em>Frederick </em>County Court on the first Monday of November then next, to answer the.allegations of his creditors according to the provisions of an act of Assembly, entitled, \u201c an act for the relief of sundry insolvent debtors, passed at November session, 1805, and the supplements thereto,\u201d and shall not depart the said court without the leave thereof. The defendant pleaded.\u20141. That the action ought not to be maintained, &amp;c. because no creditor or creditors of the defendant at any time from the time of the making the said writing obligatory to the time of the commencement of this suit, made any allegation or allegations in <em>Frederick </em>County Court against the defendant, according to the provisions of the act, entitled, &amp;c. or the supplements thereto, or any of them; and this he is ready to verify, &amp;c. 2. That the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>action ought not to be maintained for the use of <em>George Keiler, </em>because the said <em>Keiler </em>did not, at any time from the making of the writing obligatory aforesaid, to the commencement of this suit, make any allegation or allegations in <em>Frederick </em>County Court against the defendant, according to the provisions of the act of Assembly, entitled, &amp;c. or of the supplements thereto, or any of them; and this be is ready to verify, &amp;c. <em>3. </em>That the defendant did make his personal appearance in <em>Frederick </em>County Court on the first Monday of November next ensuing, the date of the said writing obligatory, to answer the allegations of his creditors, according to the provisions of the act, &amp;c. and did not depart the said court without the leave thereof; and this he is ready to verify, &amp;.c. To the first and second pleas there were general demurrers. To the third plea, a replication that the defendant did not make his personal appearance, &amp;c. And that <em>George Keiler </em>was a creditor of the defendant to the amount of $61 96. Issue tendered and joined. The County Court ruled good the demurrers to the first and second pleas. Yerdict on the issue to the replication to the third plea for the plaintiff. Judgment on the verdict, and the defendant appealed to this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-5\">The cause was argued before Buchanan, Ch J. and Earle, Archer and Dorsey, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b251-6\"><em>Taney </em>(Attorney General of Maryland,) and Ross, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-7\">The act for the relief of insolvent debtors, 1805, <em>eh. </em>110, and its several supplements, have for their object, the relief of insolvent debtors who comply with the provisions of those acts. The bond required by those acts (vide the act of 1807, <em>ch. </em>150, <em>sec. 3,) </em>manifestly shews that the condition of the bond was, to answer allegations if filed, but not to make the debtor and his securities answerable to creditors who had no allegations to make against the debtor. If the insolvent was a delinquent, and against whom the creditors thought they had a right to complain, <em>and did complain in the form of allegations, </em>then the condition of the bond was forfeited by the non-attendance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>the insolvent debtor. As no allegations were filed in this case, it is proof that the insolvent debtor fully complied with the provisions of the insolvent laws; for it was not necessary, to enable the creditors to file allegations, that the insolvent debtor should be present.' ' The condition of his bond was, to answer the allegations of his creditors, but if they have no allegations to make, or if they had, and made none, how can they derive a right for the non-performance of a condition, the breach of which was attended with no loss to them, nor invaded any of their statutory rights? To enable the creditors to recover on the insolvent debtors\u2019 bond, they must show they filed allegations against the petitioning debtor, and that he did not personally appear to answer those allegations as the condition of his bond required him to do.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b252-5\"><em>Pigman, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9l\">By the argument of the appellant\u2019s counsel, it appears that the appellant contends that he is not liable to any creditor on bis insolvent bond, as no allegations were filed against him. Now it is evident it was the intention of the act of Assembly, that the <em>appearance </em>of the insolvent should <em>precede </em>the <em>filing allegations. </em>The allegations are pleadings and could not be filed so as to call on Cfiamber<em>lain </em>to join issue until he was in court. The proper authority discharged him out of custody upon his bond to <em>appear to answer </em>allegations, evidently to come into court first, to enable the creditors to file allegations. If the words of the act of Assembly are particularly attended to, this will appear clearly to be the proper construction; and this construction the court below gave the words of the act of Assembly. It appears in the record that <em>Chamberlain </em>did not appear; of course, the condition of his bond was broken.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b252-6\">Earle, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A17\">delivered the opinion of the court, in the three preceding cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">We propose to give a condensed view of these cases, and to decide them together. For although their pleadings are a little variant from each other, they have all originated in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>kind of cause of action, and the principal questions presented by them on the argument arc the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">They are suits upon obligations given by insolvents to the State, conditioned to appear at certain times and places, to answer the interrogatories and allegations of their creditors, to be filed against them, which in each court were decided adversely to the obligors.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The first and chief question, arising out of them is a consideration whether actions can bo maintained on these obligations, inasmuch as they have been taken in the name of the <em>State of </em>Maryland, and no express authority is given by law so to take them. *</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The act of 1805, c/t. 110, is the first general insolvent law enacted, in this State, to which there have been many supplements; and since then various insolvent acts to suit the situation of the city and county of Baltimore, have been passed. All have been examined by the court, as well as some in favour of individuals, before and since 1805. In none of those acts is there any specific provision for taking these bonds of the insolvents in the name of the State, although by the act of 1805, aud several other acts, the courts, judges and commissioners, are to take of the imprisoned debtors, at the time of their discharge, bonds conditioned for their appearance to answer the allegations of their creditors, in penalties to be prescribed, and with security to be approved of by them. Notwithstanding the manner of taking these bonds, is no where specifically directed; we are assured, upon full inquiry, that they have been invariably passed to the <em>State of Maryland, </em>for more than twenty years past, whether taken by the courts, the judges, or the Commissioners of Insolvent Debtors for the city and county of <em>Baltimore. </em>What has produced this uniformity, it is not easy to say, unless it has been brought about by implicitly following the example of the courts and judges, upon whom it first devolved to execute these acts of Assembly. As no person was designated, in whose name the bonds were to be given, it is probable the courts and judges were prompted to the course pursued by the consideration, that the law in this particular could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>executed, without an obligee was supplied by them, and by reflecting, that for permanency and convenience, none could be selected, more suitable than the State itself, to which all official bonds were given, and other kinds of bonds, where a multiplicity of persons are concerned. And it may be, that they were conducted to this resolution, by reasoning upon the supposed intention of the Legislature, that these bonds should be taken in the name of the State, from the fourth section of the act of 1805, <em>ch. </em>110, which directs the trustees of insolvents to give bond to the State, Whatever may have led to the practice, its consistency fully establishes the cotemporaneous construction of the first act, in this system of laws, and we\u201ethink it has too long obtained, to be at this time shaken and disturbed. And we further think, that to promote the execution of similar legislative provisions, it may be well received as a settled rule ' for the government of our courts of justice, that obligations in which many persons are interested, be taken in the name of the <em>State of Maryland, </em>whenever the law is silent in naming the obligees to whom they are to be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Another question insisted on by the appellants in the argument of this cause is, whether the appellees could sue these bonds for their use, there being no provision in any of the insolvent acts, to enable them thus to sue. This point we consider settled in this court, by the cases of <em>McMechen vs. The Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>use of <em>A. Storey, </em>and <em>McMechen vs. The Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>use of Hollingsworth, <em>&amp; Williams, 2 Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>41, and 3 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>534. They were suits on an auctioneer\u2019s bond, taken under an ordinance of the city, which did not authorise any person, in particular, to sue it. They were nevertheless sustained, and the judgment of the County Court therein, affirmed by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">A still further question was moved on the argument of this case, by the appellant\u2019s counsel. They contended, that if those obligations were liable to be sued by the appellees, nothing could be recovered by them but nominal damages. Upon this subject, we are of opinion, there is very little room for doubt. In directing these bonds to be taken, the Legislature must have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>had in view the interest of the creditors of the insolvents, and not merely to authorise them to sue, to run the insolvents and their securities, to useless costs. To give them additional security for their debts, by obliging tlie insolvents to enter into stipulations, in nature of bail bonds, was the object; and the amount of their individual demands, we should think, must be the measure of the damages to be recovered by them respectively. These cases were partly argued upon notes, which were not filed until the close of the last term, and could not have been earlier disposed of by us. They appear to have been properly decided in every respect, by the County Courts, and we affirm their judgments, concurring with them in the opinions expressed on the exceptions, in the two first, and on the demurrers in the last case.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">judgments affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
