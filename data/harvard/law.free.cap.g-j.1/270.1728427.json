To enable him to do so, he referred the cause to the auditor, to\"state an account in conformity to his views, from the proceedings, and proofs then in the cause, or from such other proofs, as might be adduced by theparties, which they were respectively authorised to introduce upon notice, before a given day. In this state of the cause, an appeal was taken ; and upon a motion to dismiss it, held, that the order in question did not so settle, or materially affect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>all, or any of the rights, or interests in controversy, as to make it a decretal order, from which an appeal would lie;\u2014that it was a mere preparative, to the decision of the cause, and not <em>decretal; </em>and that it was only from what the Chancellor had done, that is, adjudged, or decreed, and\u2019not from what he intends to do, that an appeal would lie.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b277-5\">A, by deed, conveyed certain real and pci\u2019sonal chattels to I, upon the proviso, that if I, his executors, &amp;c. should absolutely omit, neglect and refuse to pay certain creditors of A, recited in the deed, their just demands, then the deed should ho void. This property came to the hands of I, and after his death, passed to his administrators and the, other defendants claiming under him, and them. Upon a bill filed by the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of A, praying that the property may be accounted for, and togotber with the rents and profits delivered up, it appeared that some part of the chattels real was still in the hands of I\u2019s representatives, some claimed by those who had purchased with a reference to the original conveyance, and the residue by those who offered no proof of being purchasers for value without notice. The Chancellor decreed that the deed would be considered a mortgage, and\u2019 nothing having occurred to destroy its redeemable quality\u2014but one of A\u2019s creditors having been paid, directed the auditor to state an account, in which I\u2019s representatives must be charged with the value of the whole of the personal chattels, and interest thereon, from the date of the deed from A to I; and with the rents and profits of the real chattels from the same date, and until the time when they passed into the hands of the other defendants ; who were responsible during the time they respectively had possession. And that I\u2019s representativos would he held liable for all rents, and profits, which the other defendants should fail, or he unable to pay, giving them credit for the debt paid.

Hence, it is, that, in a Court of Equity particularly, an executor or administrator, who is there considered as a trustee for the creditors, legatees, and next of kin of the deceased, is expected and required to preserve the property of the deceased apart from his own, and by itself to give it, as is said, an ear mark, that it may be always known and readily traced to any one, into whose hands it may happen to fall: and if he does so the court will do every thing that can be done to protect and assist him. 3 <em>Mer. </em>42, <em>Salk. </em>306.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-6\">According to our provincial tes.timentary system, an administrator <em>de bonis non </em>might, under certain circumstances, have had his predecessor cited before the commissary and compelled to account. 1715, <em>eh. </em>39, <em>sec. </em>3. <em>Hep.

For, it is expressly declared by out- present law, that the authority conferred, by letters of administration tie <em>bonis </em>non, shall be to administer all things described in the act as assets, <em>not converted into </em>money, <em>and not distributed or </em>delivered, <em>or retained by the former executor or </em>administrator, <em>under the direction of the Orphan\u2019s </em>Court, 1798, <em>Mo. </em>101, <em>eh. </em>14, <em>sec. 2.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-5\">IJcncc, it follows, that this plaintiff is incompetent to demand, in the representative character, in which he sues, any thing, but those goods, chattels and credits, which his letters authorise him to administer; that is, the chattels real and personal properly of his intestate, which remain undisposed of by either of the previous administrators, <em>John ox Mary; </em>or which have been, and continue to be held unaccounted for by any one, as trustee or agent of the late <em>JJnthony </em>Hook, his intestate. The statements and allegations of these very obscure original and amended bills, must, therefore, be taken subject to the limited rights of the representative character of this plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-6\">It appears, from the pleadings, in this cause, that some of the next of kin, and distributees of the late <em>Jlnthony Hook, </em>under an impression, that the chattels real of the deceased, had vested absolutely in them, have disposed of, or attempted to make a final disposition of the whole, as if such chattels had been immediately cast into their hands by the. mere operation of law: iii like manner as the real estate of an intestate, is at once cast upon his heirs. If these next of kin acquired, at once, by the act of the law alone, a legal right to these chattels real, by virtue of which they might, either concurrently or independently of the administrator, dispose of them, then, as the joint or independent holders of the property in controversy, they ought to be made parties to this bill; and if they have acquired such a legal right, and have actually disposed of these chattels, then, it is no less evident, that all claim against these defendants is, so far, entirely at an end. In these points of view the allegations of the bill, in rela\u00fcon to these next of kin, of the intestate, present some important preliminary enquiries.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>The real estate of an intestate, devolves at once and entirely, upon his heirs, by the .mere act of the law itself. But his personal property is, by the law itself, cast upon no one; nor does the legal ownership of it vest, immediately, in any person. Because, such legal title can only vest in an administrator; who alone, is considered as the legal representative of the intestate, as to' his chattels real, and personal estate. In the interval of time, between the death of the intestate and the granting of administration, the legal right to such personal property is in suspense, or in the keeping of the law, and vested in no one. During' that interval, there is no person who can sue or be sued for it; and, hence, it has been held, that a person who had, after the death of the intestate, obtained possession of his personal property, could not have it quieted or matured into a right, by the lapse, of any length of time, even as much as forty years uninterrupted' possession, before the granting of letters of administration; because, the statute of limitations could not be allowed to operate at all, until the legal title was vested in some one; and there w\u00e1s a person lawfully clothed, with a capacity to sue for, hold and dispose of such property, 4 <em>Bac. Mr. </em>479, <em>Salk. </em>421.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\">Our statute of distributions, like that of England, 3 <em>Bac. Mr. </em>72, directs the goods, chattels and credits of those, who die intestate, to be committed to an administrator, whose powers and duties are prescribed. He has a vested interest in the personal estate of the deceased, 1 <em>P.

In the construction of this statute, .it has been held, that although the creditors- of the deceased are the first and special objects of its regard; yet,, that the next of kin, among whom the <em>surplus </em>is to be distributed, take an interest which vests in them, by operation of law immediately. It is considered as a species of <em>chose in action </em>of am indefinite value: ip nature of a present debt, of an unascertained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>amount payable at a future day, 3 <em>Mod. </em>59. 1 <em>Show. 2, 25. 2 Show. </em>407. <em>Pre.

This interest vests in those who are the next of kin of the deceased at the time of his death: not, however, in exclusion of a posthumous child;. who is regarded as a then living though unborndistributee, and therefore, should any of them die before the distribution of the <em>surplus </em>is actually made, his share will not be sunk into the estate -of the intestate: but go to his own legal representatives in like manner as his other personal property, <em>Pep.

And every one who takes possession of personal property of an intestate, after his decease, may be sued at law by a creditor as an executor <em>de son </em>tort, and charged accordingly; and in equity, he will be considered as a trustee, and held accountable to the administrator, no matter how long he may have had possession, before the administration was granted. <em>2 Rand. Rep. </em>397. <em>2 Pesan.. 232. </em>The utility and necessity of having all the personal estate of a deceased, placed in the hands of an administrator, and the principle of law that neither a creditor, nor a distributee of an intestate could obtain any right to the personal estate of the deceased in any other manner, than from an administrator, has been very strongly recognized by the legislature more than a century past.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-7\">By the act of 1719, <em>ch. </em>14, sec. 7, it is declared, that many widows, or others having the deceased\u2019s effects in their hands, <em>and right to the administration thereofy </em>designedly suffer other persons to administer, whose mouths are'easily stopped, with part of the estate\u2019s being delivered to them, and bring only such part of the appraisement to the great dishonour of the deceased, and deceit of the living; for prevention whereof, as well as of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>frequent tedious suits, for the detecting such concealments, it is enacted, that the court may, in a summary way, cite such persons before it, and examine, and decide on the matter. Here the distributees, the widow and others, having a right to the administration, who are the next of kin, are specially designated, and it is expressly declared, that they shall mot retain, or hold any of the personal estate of the deceased: and if they do conceal any of it, they are made liable in a summary way as wrong doers. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-5\">If the law were otherwise; and if each creditor, and every one next of kin, were allowed to help himself, to what he thought his due; to seize upon, and, in any manner by his own act alone, acquire a legal right to the personal property of the intestate; the greatest confusion would ensue, and the most monstrous frauds might be perpetrated; no letters of administration would be taken out, in any case; but on the death of every one who had left any personal estate, worth contending for, a disorderly scramble would take place;. and those residents at a distance, infants, and all others who were unable to take care of their own interests, would be op\u00e9nly and wantonly defrauded, as this venerable act declares, \u201c to the great dishonour of the dead and deceit of the living.\u201d Such a course could not he tolerated in any shape or.for an instant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-6\">Hence, the indispensable necessity in all cases of a regular administration, and of compelling all, as well creditors, as next of kin, to resort for the payment of their claims and distributive portions, to, an administrator. In'this case, it is not pretended, that these next-of kin of <em>Anthony </em>Hook, obtained any thing, any right .whatever from his administrators; consequently, having derived-no right from either of the administrators; and none having been cast upon them by mere operation of law: they never had the power, in any manner, legally to dispose of any of the personal estate of the deceased; or to do any act which could at all affect the rights of the present plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-7\">Leave was asked and obtained on the 7th of February, 1823, to make <em>James Hook, </em>the son of the late <em>John </em>Hook, a defendant; who, on the same day, filed his answer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>amended bill; and in a kind of amended or duplicate bill, filed on the 23d of July, 1824, <em>James Hook, </em>is once incidentally spoken of as a defendant; no process was ever prayed against him; but by an agreement, filed on the 4th of November, 18,26, he is admitted to be a party defendant. This person is no otherwise noticed in the proceedings; no charge, whatever, has been made against him; nor does it appear that he can, in any degree, be made liable for any part of the subject in controversy ; either in his individual capacity, or as heir, or next of kin of his father, the late <em>John </em>Hook, or of his grandfather the late <em>Anthony Hook. </em>The presence of this defendant, <em>James </em>Hook, it appears to be in no way necessary; and, therefore, I shall, for the present, take no farther notice of him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-5\">The bills, through a considerable portion of them, seem to consider the next of kin and distributees: or, as it calls them, in relation to these chattels, <em>the heirs of </em>the late <em>Anthony Hook, </em>to be in some way or other parties to this suit: but they have neither been made plaintiffs, nor defendants as such; and therefore, all that has been said, or proved about them, and their agreements, must be rejected as mere surplusage, and entirely foreign to the matter now under consideration. <em>William Mc-Mechen, </em>a defendant, says, he answers \u201c the bill of complaint of <em>James JYeale </em>and others, representatives of <em>Anthony Hook, </em>deceased:\u201d and in the body of his' answer, he says, \u201cduring all which time several of the complainants resided in the neighbourhood of the said land:\u201d others of the answers seem to have an eye to some other complainants, besides <em>JVeale. </em>These respondents appear, in this respect, to have turned their attention to some of the irrelevant circumstances related in tiie bill, without sufficiently regarding its substance. But all such expressions and allusions, in the answers, must, in like manner, be rejected as surplusage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-6\">So much as to the excrescences, the foreign matter, and mere careless verbiage of the bill, and some of the answers. But, before we can proceed to consider the merits of the case, it will be necessary to ascertain from these pleadings, as accurately as practicable, what is the matter as to which the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>are at <em>issue; </em>and what part of the allegations of each had been admitted, taken for true, or is to be sustained or combatted by proof. In relation to these matters it will be necessary to explain, recollect, and apply some of the general rules in relation to answers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-4\">The <em>first </em>of these general rules, which have a bearing upon this case is, that where the general replication is put in, and the parties proceed to a hearing, all the allegations of the answers, which are responsive to the bill, shall be taken for true; unless they are disproved by two witnesses, or by one witness, with pregnant circumstances. The answer to this extent is considered as evidence, and conclusive, unless disproved; even although the defendant may have a direct and palpable interest in establishing the truth of what he advances. 3 <em>Wheat. </em>521. An answer is only so far responsive as it answers to a material statement, or charge in the bill, as to which, a disclosure is sought; and which is the subject of parol proof; but no further. Where a deed, or instrument of writing is necessary to establish any right, and the bill enquires for the evidence of such right, the answer, unaccompanied and unsupported by such deed qr writing, will be no evidence, although it should directly respond to the bill; because the answer is only in the nature of parol evidence; and in such case, evidence of a higher grade is required by law. <em>5 Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>381.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-5\">But where the bill asks for,the production of evidence, which from the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s case, he has a right to claim, that may be necessary and useful to him in other cases beside the one then under consideration; an answer to such a bill is not responsive, which merely asserts the facts without saying any thing of the evidence of its existence, or the means of obtaining it. And, where a defendant, by his answer, asserts a right affirmatively in opposition to the plaintiff\u2019s demand, he must establish it by proof; or the assertion will be disregarded: for\u00bf a defendant cannot be permitted to swear himself into a title to the plaintiff\u2019s estate. 1 <em>Wash. 225. </em>1 <em>Mun. </em>395. <em>2 John, C. Rep. </em>87. <em>2 Ev. Path. </em>157. But where an administrator is called upon to answer certain matters, which appear to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>have rested exclusively within the knowledge of his intestate, it will be sufficient that he swears as he is informed and believes; <em>Carnan, Ex\u2019rs vs. Vcmsanfs administrators, </em>1807, <em>J\\l.

If the answer be in any respect evasive, or insufficient, the plaintiff' may except to it; and thus extract from his opponent a full and perfect answer. But to this general rule there is a modification, the nature and bearing of which may be sufficiently illustrated by one or two instances: a defendant to a bill of discovery, answered a portion of it, and as to all the other matters therein set forth, he answered and said, that he had no other knowledge of them, than what he had obtained confidentially as counsel; and therefore declined answering further: this answer was deemed sufficient; and again a defendant answered as to part, and as to the residue relied upon the statute of limitations: this answer was also held to be sufficient. In such cases, a part of the answer performs the office of a plea; and the defendant thus makes defence to the whole case, by a disclosure of all the facts so far as he is bound <em>so to respond; </em>and for the residue, by presenting such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>equitable bar to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, as is a sufficient excuse for not answering <em>in the manner required by the bill. </em>The exact compass of this <em>modification </em>of the rule, that if a defendant submits to answer at dll, he must answer <em>fully, </em>remains yet to be adjusted. <em>2 Mad.

Much has been said upon the subject; but as the eases in relation to this \u201c distracted <em>point,'n </em>as it has been called, have no bearing upon the case now under consideration, they have been thus generally noticed merely to prevent misapprehension.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-5\">A <em>fourth </em>general rule, is one which grows out of the <em>third </em>rule, that exacts a full answer: and requires to be attentively considered in this case: it is, that where the defendant fails to answer any of the material allegations of the bill, such unanswered allegations shall, at the hearing, be taken to be true, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Thus were the bill demands the delivery of two pieces of property, and the answer makes defence as to one, but is totally silent as to the other. In such case according to this rule, the bill may \"be taken <em>pro confesso </em>for that, as to which the answer is silent; and the plaintiff may obtain a decree accordingly. The propriety of this rule has, however, been questioned; and therefore it stands in need of all the support it can derive from authority, reason, and analogy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-6\">If, upon exceptions, the answer is held to be insufficient, the defendant will be ordered to answer more fully: and if he fails to do so, in England, sequestration will go against his estate.

'In this state, obedience to the order directing a more perfect answer, upon exceptions being sustained, is usually enforced by attachment; but, as in England, on the defendant\u2019s failing to answer as ordered; and the process of attachment failing to coerce an answer, as required, the whole bill may be taken <em>pro confesso. </em>3 <em>Ves. </em>372 209; so, where the defendant had answered, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>plaintiff then amended his bill, introducing new matter, die is entitled to an answer to such new matter; because, an amended bill is a part of the original bill, and the defendant\u2019s answer thereto is a part of his original answer; and consequently, the defendant Is as much bound to answer the amended bill, as to answer each portion of the original bill itself.

In such case, a plea of the statute of limitations must be supported by an answer, denying such partial payments and recent acknowledgments; for, otherwise, those circumstances, not being denied by the plea, would be taken for true, if not denied by way of answer; and would show, that the case had been taken out of the statute. 2 <em>Scho.

The consequence of the first, in England, is, that the defendant may be outlawed; and in this State, in many cases, is, that an attachment may go against his estate. The consequence of the second default, or the defendant not putting in any plea at all, is, that the plaintiff may have a judgment by <em>nil elicit. </em>The plea is called, at common law, the answer of the defendant: and, if he fails to answer, judgment is awarded against him on the ground, that he has thus tacitly admitted, or confessed the case of the plaintiff, and left him nothing to litigate of to prove. So, in equity, after an appearance, the taking a bill <em>pro eonfesso, </em>where no answer has been put in, or no sufficient answer, after exceptions have been sustained, is analogous to the taking the declaration for true, where the defendant has put in no plea at all, or it has been held insufficient on demurrer. 2 <em>Jltk. </em>21.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-6\">It is a rule at common law, that every plea must answer the whole declaration, or at least every material part of it, which goes to constitute the gist of the action. \u25a0 But, the defendant may fail, or purposely decline to plead, or answer to every part of the declaration: in which case the plaintiff may join issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>on the plea, and take his judgment for the unanswered part as by <em>nil dicit. </em>And we are told, that it is frequently judicious to plead only to part, or to admit a part of the cause of action in order to save the costs of the trial of such matter: for, nothing can be tried, that is not put in issue; and the defendant, by declining to answer a part, deprives the plaintiff of the power to burthen him with the costs and expense of proving that, on a trial, which he has not denied, and put in issue. 1 <em>Chit.

So, in equity, where the defendant fails, or declines answering any material part of the plaintiff\u2019s bill, as to which he seeks, and may obtain relief, it. amounts to a tacit admission of so much: and, such part of the bill may, therefore, be taken <em>pro confesso: </em>and, if the declining to answer a part of the cause of action may, from any motives, be judicious at common law, certainly a defendant in Chancery may be induced for like reasons to pursue a similar course; since no costs, or expense, can be allowed in Chancery, any more than at law, for the proof and trial of any matter not put in issue. <em>2 P.

But, where the Legislature have prescribed rules of proceeding for the court itself; and cases occur within the <em>spirit, </em>but not within the <em>letter </em>of them, the Chancellor feels himself, not merely invited, for the preservation of harmony, but becomes sensible of a duty to conform, upon the ground, that equity is bound to follow the law in <em>spirit </em>and in <em>principle.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-6\">In equity, the consequences of a default before appearance, when pursued to the utmost, seldom enabled the plaintiff to obtain the precise relief he was in quest of; because, there could be no adjudication upon his case, applying the remedy, as specific performance, or the like, exactly to suit it, until the defendant had appeared, and the allegations of the bill had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>taken for true or established; The English courts, evidently under a strong-\u2019sense of.the necessity of their being some better mode of attaining justice, than by a sequestration of the defendant\u2019s estate, have carried the doctrine, in relation to substituted and constructive summons, full as far as was within the compass of judicial power; further than it ever was in this State-; and yet, short of the point of manifest and general utility. In the year 1718, the Legislature partially interposed, and by the act of 5 <em>Geo., 2, ch. 25, </em>provided the means of enabling a plaintiff to proceed against a defendant, who had not entered his appearance, and -have his bill taken <em>pro confesso; </em>which could not be done in equity until then. <em>2 Aik. 23. </em>This statute was introduced and used in this state, <em>Kil.

So too, where a person appears and departs without answering, after which process has gone against him to sequestration, there also the bill is taken <em>pro confesso; </em>because, it is presumed to be true when he has appeared and departs in despite of the court, and withstands all its process without answering. <em>For. Rom. </em>36. But, these modes of having a bill taken <em>pro </em>confesso, having been deemed in many respects too oppressive, or unnecessarily tedious, 1 <em>John. C. Rep. </em>8, more easy and expeditious modes have been provided by the acts of 1785, <em>ch. </em>72, <em>sec. </em>20. 1779, <em>ch. </em>79, <em>sec. 2, </em>9; and 1820, <em>ch. </em>161, <em>sec. </em>1. By these acts, if a defendant, who has appeared, fails to demur, plead, or answer, according to the rules of court, within a limited time, the hill may be taken <em>pro confesso.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-5\">At law, where the nature and amount of the plaintiff\u2019s demand may be distinctly ascertained from the declaration, as in debt assumpsit, upon a promissory note, or the like, the judgment by <em>nil elicit, </em>is final; but in actions for the recovery of damages only, it is not so; because the amount claimed is uncertain; and, therefore, an enquiry must be made, and proof heard as to the quantum which the plaintiff is entitled to recover. Suits in equity are susceptible, in some degree, of a similar classification; and, hence it is, that several of our acts of Assembly, which allow the bill to be taken <em>pro </em>confesso, go on to declare that the Chancellor may, <em>in his discretion, </em>order a commission to issue for the plaintiff to examine witnesses to prove the allegations of his bill; or the plaintiff may himself he examined on oath. But in some of these acts such a provision ivas omitted; and hence, by the act of 1799, <em>ch. </em>79, <em>sec. </em>5, it is said to appear unreasonable, that, in any case whatever, the Chancellor should be directed absolutely to take the hill or hare allegations of a suitor <em>pro confesso ; </em>and, therefore, enacts that, in all such cases, it shall be at the <em>discretion </em>of the Chancellor, either to take the bill <em>pro con</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number><em>fesso, </em>or to direct a commission for taking depositions <em>exparle: </em>which law, as amended by the act of 1818, <em>ch. </em>193, <em>sec. </em>6,5, has enabled the Chancellor to call <em>for proofs </em>and explanations in all cases which appear to require it. *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-5\">These, then, are the legislative rules in regard to the <em>whole </em>bill, where no answer at all is put in. But not one of these acts of Assembly which seem to have provided, with such an infinite deal of care and solicitude, for all the various causes and modes of neglecting or failing to answer the <em>whole bill, </em>do, in \u00e1ny manner, speak of, or allude to the case of a neglect or refusal to answer a distinct or material <em>part </em>only of the bill: where an answer is made to all the rest. The act of 1795, <em>ch. </em>88, <em>sec. </em>1, says, the bill may be taken <em>pro confesso, </em>and the Chancellor shall proceed to decree in the same manner, as if the defendant had admitted by his answer the facts stated in the bill; and in case the defendant has been summoned, or has appeared, and fails to answer, he must be ordered to do so, by an appointed day; or an interlocutory decree may be entered on the default, and a commission issued <em>exparte: </em>but, in every case the consequence of the default is, that the bill may be taken <em>pro confesso.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-6\">Hence it appears to be clear, that these legislative rules which, according to their letter, are only applicable to the case where there is no answer at all, must, in <em>spirit and principle, </em>be alike applicable to the case where the answer only cover\u2019s a <em>part </em>of the material allegations, and is totally and absolutely silent as to the residue of the bill; and, consequently, according to the principle and spirit of these legislative rules, the unanswered part of the bill must, on the hearing, be taken to be true; otherwise, there would be a manifest inconsistency in the course of the court: and although a party might have a right to relief in Chancery, and be entitled to an answer- to every allegation in bis bill, necessary to sustain his claim to relief: if the defendant failed or refused, to answer them all, he might have his bill taken <em>pro </em>confesso; yet, if he failed or refused to answer a part of those allegations for such part unanswered, he must pursue a different course. But the reason and principle being the same,, the rule must be the same in both cases. If the <em>whole bill </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>left unanswered, it may be taken for true: and if a <em>part </em>only be left unanswered, that <em>part </em>must, in like manner, be taken for true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-5\">These acts of Assembly of ours, allowing a bill to be taken <em>pro confesso </em>on the defendants default in not answering all of them, authorise the Chancellor in such case to pass a final decree at once, if he deems it unnecessary to issue a commis] sion. The decree by default, in all such cases, is as complete\u2019 ly final and absolute, as a judgment by default in an action of debt at common law. The course of the English court of Chancery is, in some respects, different. There, when the plaintiff obtains a decree by default, a provisional clause is superadded, that such decree is to be binding on the defendant, unless being served with process, he shall, within \u00e1 limited time, shew cause to the contrary. And this decree, being <em>sub modo </em>only, is emphatically a decree <em>nisi; </em>which cannot be, nor ever is considered as final, until the party has been served with process, and it has been made absolute by the court itself, 1 <em>Harr. Pr. Ch. </em>625. Redes, <em>Tr. </em>195.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-6\">This, it seems, has long been the established practice of the courts of Chancery of <em>Virginia; </em>so, that where a defendant has not answered the bill, it is held to be error to enter a final decree against him, taking the bill <em>pro </em>confesso, without the previous service of a decree nisi: 3 <em>Mun. </em>83. 2 <em>Hen. Mun. </em>19. And it has also been held in that Slate, that, were some of the allegations of the bill were not answered, the plaintiff might either except to the answer as insufficient, or move to have the unanswered part of the bill taken <em>pro confesso. </em>But, if he does neither, it must'be proved, that he shall not, on the trial, avail himself of any implied admission by the defendant: for, where the defendant does not answer at all, the plaintiff cannot take his bill for confessed, without an order of court to that effect, and having it served on the defendant; and this is the only evidence of his admission: of course, if this mode of proceeding as to the confession of the whole bill be correct, it must be equally correct, as to the confession of any part; 2 <em>Hen. </em>and <em>Man, </em>17, 19. 2 <em>Mun.

The party is allowed to pursue the same course to have his bill, either <em>wholly </em>or <em>partially </em>taken <em>pro </em>confesso, according to the .extent of the defendant\u2019s default. In this State no decree, <em>nisi, </em>is ever entered and served on a defendant who has not answered: but an absolute decree may be entered at once, as soon as. h\u00e9 can be fixed with the default; which can be at any time after the limited period 'for answering has elapsed, or when he has elected to make, and has actually filed his answer to the bill. The principle and reason of the rule, in <em>Virginia </em>and in <em>Maryland, </em>are the same in relation to a partial answer. The courts in each State, follow the spirit <em>of </em>the established, or legislative rule, which directs the mode of proceeding, in case the defendant puts in no answer at all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-5\">The plaintiff is entitled to an answer to each allegation of his bill, which he may require; either because he cannot prove the facts, or to aid his proof, or to avoid expense: and if the plaintiff conceives the answer to be insufficient to the charges in the bill, he may except to it; which has been compared toa demurrer at law, for want of form. The sole object of exceptions is, to extract from the defendant a more full and perfect disclosure, for the benefit of the plaintiff. They are never meant, nor intended, nor are they calculated to benefit the defendant, or to put him upon his guard in any respect whatever. The plaintiff may, if he chooses, waive his right to except: and it is always most judicious to do so, where his proofs are ample and <em>at hand; </em>and the character or conduct of the defendant indicates that he is not altogether trust worthy upon oath: for in such case, he will attain his object much sooner and better, by \u25a0 taking the answer at once, as he can get it, arid proceeding directly to collect proofs, without loss of time, than by stopping to take exceptions, This is the case where the answer is <em>an evasive, imper-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number><em>feet response; </em>but yet such a one as goes to the whole bill, and by which each of its allegations is denied and may be put in issue. But to what end, or for what purpose, where no explanation or discovery is sought for by an allegation, should the plaintiff by exceptions call for an answer to it; where it is impliedly, and tacitly admitted by not being answered. In such case, both parties would be delayed and troubled, and the defendant put to much expense without any object whatever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-5\">The general replication puts in issue <em>only the denial or avoidance of the </em>answer, <em>nothing more; </em>and neither party is allowed, nor can be called on, to adduce proof respecting any matter not put in issue. The unanswered part of the bill therefore must be admitted, since it cannot be, according to a correct and orderly course of proceeding, proved at the hearing. But if the unanswered allegations of a bill were required to be proved, or to be rejected altogether at the hearing, then the defendant would be allowed to take advantage of his own laches: and a want of frankness and simplicity, altogether unbecoming a court of equity, would be tolerated and encouraged: and the plaintiff would be driven to except, in all such cases, merely to extract from the defendant, cither a general denial, or an express, instead of a tacit disclaimer or confession; when, in truth, it might have been the intention of the defendant, as it is fair to infer it was, to concede the unanswered allegation, for the express purpose of avoiding the costs and expense of an answer, of exceptions, and of proofs, by letting a decree by default go for so much as he had left unanswered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-6\">In ancient times, when the defendant used only to set forth his own case, in the answer, without answering every clause of the bill, it was the practice for him to add, at the end of the answer, a general travers, without that, that the matters set forth in the bill are true, &amp;c. But, where the whole bill, and every clause in it, has been fully answered, the adding of a general traverse is rather impertinent than otherwise; and, if issue is taken, upon its general traverse, it is a denial only of every thing not answered before by the answer. 2 <em>P. Will. </em>87. But, there is no case, in which this general traverse has ever been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>relied upon, as an answer. If it ever had been so considered, it must have occurred, in some of the numerous cases of exceptions to answers, to have insisted on it as such; yet nothing of the kind appears. The whole range of adjudged cases shew, that the extent and compass as well as the sufficiency of the answer, as whether it is as frank as it ought to be, or whether it covers the whole, or only a part of the bill, are to be ascertained from the body of the answer itself: and not from the formal introduction, or the formal general traverse or conclusion of it. But, in this case the usual general traverse, denying the truth of all the unanswered allegations of the bill, has not been added by the way of conclusion to any of the answers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-4\">In the case of <em>Hopkins vs. Stump, et. al. 2 Harr. and Johns. </em>301, <em>Chancellor Hanson </em>says, \u201cit would seem likewise, that the complainant misunderstood the Chancellor in another particular.

No! If interrogatories stated in a bill are not answered, the complainant has a right to except to the answer, and if the interrogatories are proper,.the defendant will be compelled to answer plainly, fully and explicitly.

The estate conveyed to <em>John Hook, </em>was to be null and void, on his failing to pay and satisfy the enumerated creditors of <em>Anthony Hook. </em>It is, in fact, a conveyance, by <em>Anthony, </em>of certain property to <em>John: </em>upon condition that he should advance a certain sum of money for the use of <em>Anthony. </em>This proviso', with the recital, gives to the whole the shape and character of a pledge or mortgage, from <em>Anthony </em>to <em>John. </em>It was intended to indemnity <em>John, </em>for money advanced by him to the use of his father : and all <em>John </em>can claim, by virtue of this deed, is indemnity and reimbursement for any money so by him advanced. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>the ordinary cases of a mortgage, the grantor is the actual debt- or of the grantee: and it is stipulated that the estate conveyed, shall be absolute, if the grantor fails to pay at the appointed ' time. In this case, the grantee undertakes to substitute himself in the, place, of the creditors of the grantor, or to satisfy those claims: and if he fails to do so, then it is stipulated that the estate conveyed, shall <em>be </em>void. The object of the grantor, in both cases, is the payment of his debts; and, in both, security is the object of the grantee. That security, in equity, extends no further than complete reimbursement. The payment of the whole principal and interest due, and no more. 9 <em>Wheat. </em>495. There is no clause in this indenture authorising <em>John Hook </em>to sell the property, and to apply the proceeds of the payment of the claims of the enumerated creditors: and even if there were, it would not have destroyed the redeemable quality of this mortgage, or the resulting use arising out of the nature of this deed. 3 <em>Harr, fy Johns. </em>106. In this case it is alleged, that the late <em>John Hook, </em>and his representatives, have altogether failed to pay the enumerated debts, iu compliance with the stipulations of the deed. If so, <em>Anthony Hook </em>had, and his representative now has, a right to a return of this property, with its profits: or, at least, to redeem it on the payment of so much as has been advanced by <em>John Hook, </em>or his representatives.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-4\">It has been urged, that there is not the least room to deduce, from this deed, any thing like an implied or resulting use to <em>Anthony Hook, </em>and his representatives: because, it is declared to have been made, not only for a valuable consideration, as the payment of debts, and also of five shillings; but likewise for a good consideration, as the natural love and affection from the father to the son.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-5\">The doctrine of a resulting use, first introduced the notion that there must be a consideration expressed in the deed; or, otherwise, nothing could pass\u2014but it would result to the grantor. It is certain, however, that the rule in relation to trusts, by implication, or operation of -law, is by no means so large as to extend to every mere voluntary conveyance; and, consequently, if this deed stood alone, upon the valuable consideration of five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>shillings, and upon the good one of natural love and aflection, or upon either of them, unconnected with other circumstances, there could he no doubt of its validity, as an absolute, and eflectual conveyance, from <em>Anthony </em>to <em>John. 2 Aik. 256. But, when </em>other matters are necessarily brought into view, or form a part of the contract, then it is no less clear, that the mere express consideration of five shillings, even with the superadded expressions, \u201cand of other valuable considerations,\u201d or of natural love and affection, will not prevent the deduction of a trust by implication or operation of law. 1 Fes.

We cannot turn aside from clauses, so very striking and efficient, as the recital of the cause of its having been made, and the proviso wherein it is said, if that consideration alone be not complied with, the whole shall be a nullity. If these matters could be entirely passed over, the argument against a resulting trust would be exceedingly strong, if not altogether irresistible. But, looking to the recital, and the proviso, if is perfectly manifest, that the sole object of the deed was to secure the payment of certain creditors of <em>Anthony Ilook. </em>If they were not paid, the whole deed, utterly regardless of the consideration of'five shillings, and of natural love and aflection, was declared to be void. The payment of the creditors was, then, that consideration alone upon which the conveyance was to stand or fall. This, is the real extent of the consideration, no more; and to this extent, and no further, the late <em>Anthony Hook </em>parted with his right and interest in this property: consequently, in the value of this property, beyond that of the aggregate amount of the specified debts, there is an implied or resulting use, remaining or vested in <em>Anthony Ilook, </em>the grantor, and his representatives.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-6\">But, there is an express saving in the statute of frauds, of trusts by implication or operation of law; nor does the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>affect trust of mere personalty. 10 <em>Mod. </em>404. 3 <em>Bro.

She, before her marriage with Hagthorp, obtained letters of administration on the personal estate of her late husband, <em>John Hook, </em>and it is in that character only, that they are now brought here as defendants. They say, in relation to the enumerated creditors of the late <em>JLnthony </em>Hook, \u201cthat the said <em>John Hook </em>paid the said sums of money, set out in the assignment, so far as the creditors applied for payment of the same:\u201d and again, \u201cthat the said <em>John Hook </em>accordingly paid the debts particularly mentioned therein, (that is in the deed) as these defendants believe and charge.\u201d It is too late now to inquire whether this answer is as frank and unexceptionable as it ought to have been or not. The only question at this stage of the proceedings, is, whether it be such a response to the bill as constitutes a sufficient defence, if uncontradicted by proof; or whether, as is often said on motions to dissolve injunctions, the answer has sworn away the equity of the bill?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-7\">The first of these sentences cannot be considered as a distinct answer to any extent; either, that the debts have, or have not been paid: and the second of them amounts to no more than a declaration of a belief that they have been paid. Where the nature of the transaction, charged in the bill, is such a one as must have been altogether within the knowledge of the intestate, the administrator may answer as he is informed and verily believes; but, the answer of an administrator must always be taken, as well with a reference to the reasons given for his belief, as to the nature of the subject of which he speaks. This, however, is a broad assertion of a belief, without giving any reasons for it; or its appearing, or being alleged, that the matter was exclusively within the knowledge of their intestate. In these particulars this answer is not so responsive to the bill as to constitute an available defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>But, according to the bill and the deed, which is made a part of the bill, <em>John Hook </em>undertook to pay certain debts due from <em>Atithony Hook. </em>The answer to this charge must, then, from the nature of things, be such a one as would furnish evidence available to <em>Anthony </em>or his representative: it is that, the bill seeks. For, by the deed, <em>Anthony </em>was to be protected from the claims of his creditors; and upon <em>John\u2019s </em>affording that protection his title rested. In effect the bill asks, not only whether the debts have been paid, or not; but more, it requires the evidences of their payment to be produced, as a means whereby Anthony, and his representatives, may be protected against those claims; and such evidence, in addition to any thing that might be said in the answrer, is also necessary, because it constitutes an affirmative part of that title set up by <em>John Hook\u2019s </em>representatives, in opposition to the plaintiff\u2019s claim; and must therefore be supported by indifferent testimony. All the claims of the enumerated creditors which have not been paid, it is most likely have been long since barred by the statute of limitations; but <em>that </em>is a protection which the law itself gave to <em>Anthony. </em>He is entitled, by the terms of his deed, to be furnished by <em>John </em>with the <em>evidence </em>of their being satisfied, as the means of his protection in <em>that form. </em>This answer, therefore, is not for these reasons also, so responsive to the hill as to afford the defendants an adequate defence. On adverting to the proofs and exhibits, it appears that <em>John Moale\u2019s </em>is the only one of the specified claims that has been satisfied; and none others are to be allowed as paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-5\">I lay out of this case the testimony of <em>Henry Burman, </em>who, as the husband of one of the distributees of <em>Anthony Hook, </em>has an interest in establishing the facts to which he testifies, and is, therefore, incompetent. All the other witnesses are competent. From the copy of the unexecuted bond, the declarations of <em>Bishop Carroll, </em>and the other occurrences and proceedings in the <em>Orphans\u2019 Court </em>found amoung the proofs, it appears to have been perfectly well understood between <em>Anthony </em>and <em>John, </em>during their lives, that Jo/\u00a1\u00bb held, as the trustee of <em>Anthony, </em>according; to the terms of the deed: and it appears, that the repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>sentatives of <em>John </em>always admitted, that they held under the deed; and yet, except the claim of <em>John MoaWs, </em>it does not appear, that they ever undertook to shew, that any of the claims of the enumerated creditors had been satisfied. It lay upon <em>John </em>and his representatives to shew, that those claims were paid; and they have not done so, and the truth is therefore that, <em>exceptMoale\u2019s </em>claim, none of them have been satisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-5\">The. answer of <em>Hagthorp </em>and wife, after some preliminary notices of several allegations in the bill, and those responses, as to the payment of the enumerated debts, passes on to a long history of the saj'ings, actings, and doings of sundry of the next of ' kin of the late <em>Jlnthony </em>Hook, in relation to the ten acre lot; as to all of which, for the reasons already assigned, it will be unnecessary to say any thing further. The hill specially charges, that <em>Hagthorp </em>and wife, by a deed dated on the <em>23d day of December, </em>1819, leased, orassigned, apart of the lot on <em>Miceana street, </em>to <em>Matthew Bennett. </em>Of these special allegations, these defendants take no notice; but say, that the late <em>Jlnthony Hook, </em>by an indenture dated on the <em>8th day of May, </em>1797, conveyed the lot on <em>JLliceana street, </em>to the late <em>John Hook. </em>This is an allegation in avoidance of the bill, and certainly required to be supported by proof. But their is not evefi an exhibit, nor one tittle of proof in relation to it. This pait of the answer, therefore, passes for nothing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-6\">As to all the allegations of the bill, in relation to the negroes, and other moveable property mentioned in the deed, this answer is absolutely and totally silent\u2014it says nothing: and, consequently, as to so much the bill must, according to the rules that have been laid down, be taken pro <em>confesso.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-7\">Upon the whole, then, and from what has been said, it follows that the defendant, <em>Hagthorp </em>and wife, as the legal representatives of the late trustee, <em>John Hook, mil </em>be decreed to deliver up to the plaintiff, all the property mentioned in the deed; orto pay the value of so much as they may have converted, or fail to deliver, together with the profits thereof, or the interest on the value; except certain allowances, and those parts wherewith the other defendants may be charged, as I shall now proceed to enquire and determine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>All the other defendants deduce their title, either directly rpr indirectly, from <em>Hagthorp </em>and wife, except <em>Nathaniel Chittenden, </em>who traces his claim from the late <em>John Hook. </em>But all allege, that they are purchasers for a valuable consideration, without notice. There is no principle of equity better settled, than that such a purchaser will not be disturbed by this court. On the other hand, it is equally well settled, that he who purchases with a knowledge of the trust, becomes himself the trustee, and stands in the place of the vendor, under whom he thus claims, subject to all his liabilities. Yet a person having himself notice, who purchases of one who had not notice, may protect himself by the want of notice in his vendor; nor shall a purchaser without notice, or a previous purchaser with notice, be affected by the notice of his vendor: and where a purchaser cannot make title, but by a deed, which leads him to a knowledge of the fact; and <em>mow </em>especially <em>where the deed, by </em>virtue of which he takes, recites, or directly refers to that instrument in which the trust is declared, or from which it arises, he shall be deemed cognizant of the fact, and a purchaser with notice.

No acts, or circumstances appear to have occurred to destroy the redeemable quality of that deed. <em>Hagthorp </em>and wife, as administrators of the late <em>John Hook, </em>have succeeded to his character of trustee, and the defendants who all claim under them, except <em>Nathanw iel Chittenden, </em>who derives his claim from the late <em>John Hook, </em>as purchasers with notice for so much as they hold, stand charged with the same trusts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-8\">The whole of the property mentioned in the bill has bee* continually in the possession of the late <em>John Hook, </em>anb those who have succeeded to, and claim under him, ever since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>year 1797. They have protected it, relieved it from burthens and charges, and have placed upon some parts of it lasting improvements. It now, therefore, only remains to apply the rules of equity in relation to these matters, and to direct how the accounts shall he stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-5\">If a mortgagee, without the assent of the mortgagor, assigns the mortgaged estate to an insolvent person who he puts into possession, he will he held answerable for the rents and profits received both before and after the assignment; upon the principle, of its being a wilful breach of trust, to transfer the property to another, which, as trustee, he had \u00f1o right thus to dispose of, to the prejudice of the mortgagor. <em>Pow. Mort. </em>948. 2 <em>Fonb. </em>179. A trustee is, in no case, to be charged with imaginary values, but only with what he actually receives: and the same rule applies to a mortgagee, in possession, who is regarded as a trustee. But no default must be imputed to him; for in all such cases, he will be charged with what he might have made, hut for his default. The annual value is that which the premises are actually worth nett, according to a fair estimate, clear of all necessary charges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-6\">Under the head of just allowances, it has long been tbe course of the court to allow a trustee, or mortgagee in possession, for all necessary expenses incurred for the defence, relief, protection and repairs of the estate: such as costs of suit, and fees for taking opinions and procuring directions necessary for the due execution of the trusts, 10 <em>Fes. </em>184, taxes, paving contributions, ground rent, and sums expended in necessary repairs. <em>Pow. Mort. </em>956, <em>n. 2 P. Will. </em>455. It has been also said and I think with justice, that where a mortgagee, thinking himself absolutely entitled, had expended considerable sums in repairs and lasting improvements, he should he allowed the value of them. <em>Pow. Mort. </em>956, <em>n. </em>And in a modern case, the value of new buildings, erected by the mortgagee, was allowed, 4 <em>Fes. </em>482, and a liberal allowance for the improved value of slaves while in the possession of the mortgagee, was directed to be made. <em>Ross vs. Worrall, </em>1 <em>Wash. </em>14. The grounds of these decisions appear to be, that a mortgagee in possession, is the legal holder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>of the estate; which the mortgagor may at any time redeem and so prevent him from making any repairs or improvements, and if the mortgagee has been long in the possession, claiming adversely, and suffered to treat the estate at his own, and the mortgagor stands by and permits lasting improvements to be made, he shall pay for them. <em>5 Harr. 8f Johns. </em>147. 4 <em>John.

For such allowances are made upon the ground, that the improvements do, in fact, pass into the hands of the plaintiff as a new acquisition. And they can only be a new acquisition to him, to the extent of their value at the time, he recovers or obtains possession of them; and therefore their value at that time is to be allowed, and nothing more. 3 <em>Rob. Adm. Rep. </em>101. It is also necessary to observe that in charging rents and profits,,the estimate must not include any profits which arise exclusively from such improvements; for, if they were to be embraced by the estimate, the occupier would, in fact, be paying for the profits of that which was his own; and the plaintiff would be allowed to derive the benefit from a new acquisition before the court had awarded it to him. Therefore, the estimate of rents and profits must be made, in exclusion of such as appears to have arisen from the occupying claimant\u2019s own expenditure in improvements. 1 <em>John. C.

The appellee sought to recover certain leasehold and personal property, with the rents and profits arising therefrom. The right to such recovery being resisted by the defendants, and much testimony in relation thereto, being taken under commissions issued for that purpose; after the case had been argued, the Chancellor, in his explanatory or introductory remarks to what he was then about to order, discusses at great length many rules and principles of equity and a great variety of facts, all of which he considers clearly in favour of the appellee, and announces his intention at some future time to decree accordingly: and to enable him to do so, he passed the following order, viz: (See the \u25a0order ante, p. 307.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">From this proceeding of the Chancellor, the present appeal has been prosecuted; and the only question submitted to our consideration is, does this order so settle or materially affect all or any of the rights or interests in controversy between the parties, as to make it a decretal order from which an appeal would liejagreeably to the provisions of the acts of Assembly of 1785, <em>ch. </em>72, and 1818, <em>\u2018ch. </em>193 ? We are clearly of opinion that it does not To ascertain what has been decided by the \u2022Chancellor, we must look to the order itself. If its expressions be explicit, unequivocal, we need search no further for its import; but must give it that interpretation which it bears upon its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>face. If its construction be ambiguous; then, as the best key to its exposition, we must refer to the introductory remarks of the Chancellor upon which it was founded. In the present order there is no doubt, no ambiguity; and its operation cannot be enlarged by the prefatory observations with which it is connected. Indeed, they are in perfect accordance with its literal, obvious meaning; and demonstrate, that all which the Chancellor designed to adjudicate, was, that the auditor should state certain accounts indispensable to the determination of the questions in litigation. Such an order is a mere preparative to the decisions of the cause; and not <em>decretal. </em>Tis true the Chancellor, in considering this case, has discussed all the matters both of law and fact, which he deemed in any wise involved in the decree, eventually to be pronounced; and has distinctly declared what he <em>intends </em>to decree. But <em>his.intentions </em>form no ground for an appeal: he may abandon or change them <em>ad libitum, </em>; until carried into effect, no injury can result from them. It is only, from what he has done, and not from what he <em>intends to do, </em>that an appeal will lie. All that he has done is to direct an audit: every disputed right and interest of the parties remains undetermined; and is, by the express declaration of the Chancellor, to be settled by his future decree. Until such decree be passed, upon application a commission to take furth\u00e9r testimony might issue, an unquestionable title to the relief prayed for might be made out. If we now sustain the jurisdiction we are called on to exercise, and, in accordance with the appellants views, dismiss the appellees bill of complaint: we deprive him of all such opportunity of strengthening his claims for relief; we in fact become a court of original not of appellate judicature. We usurp the authority of the Chancellor, and reverse decrees which he never did make, and perhaps never would have made. Such .a proceeding is utterly inconsistent with the character and attributes of a Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">But reasoning upon this subject is unnecessary : the question is put to rest by the authority of <em>Snowden et al vs. Dorsey et al. </em>6 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>114: a case not distinguishable from that now before us. There the Chancellor upon a bill filed for the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>veyance of land, ordered an account to be taken of the rents and profits; and in the statement of his views introductive of that order pronounced his opinion Jas here) that the complainants claim to relief had been established. Yet, upon an appeal from such order, after argument, and a thorough examination of the practice and decisions upon the subject, this court dismissed the appeal, as being prematurely taken to an order, not decretal.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">It was urged in the argument of the appellants counsel, that the right of appeal in this case was fully established by the doctrine settled in <em>Thompson vs. M'Kim, </em>6 <em>Harr. Johns. </em>302, But the cases are in no wise analogous. There, as is justly observed by the Chancellor, to warrant the issuing of the order, the facts must be \u201ceither admitted or so established as tobe open to no further controversy at any subsequent stage of the proceedings; and the party making the motion for such order must shew that he has an interest in the money called in; and that he who holds it in his possession, has no equitable right or title to it whatever.\u201d Here to justify the order for an audit, no such conclusive establishment of facts is indispensably necessary. There material and irreparable injury was done by the order, let the subsequent decree of the Chancellor be what it might, or although no future decree be ever made. Here no material injury is-infiicted on the appellants unless followed by a decree; and that decree too against them. Here the order is not decretal or final as to the rights or interests of the appellants. There the order is not only_decretal, but in effect final upon the rights and interests of the appellants, and needed not the aid of any future decree or order upon the subject. <em>Ex natura </em>rei, the granting the order to bring the money into court, adjudicated on every right and interest which the appellant claimed. <em>In no </em>future order or decree was it necessary to name or even refer to him; as to all subsequent proceedings, he was no longer a necessary party in court. All that remained to be done in the cause was, an order for the distribution, among the creditors of <em>Heyland </em>of the money brought into court.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Strong efforts were made in the argument to distinguish this case from that of <em>Snowden et al. vs. Dorsey et al. </em>founded upon an expression in the courts opinion, in <em>Thompson vs. </em>M'Kim, stating that the order passed in <em>Snowden et al. vs. Dorsey et al. </em>\u201cbore no impress of the Chancellor\u2019s judicial opinion upon the merits of the case.\u201d The order, it was contended, in the case at bar, did hear such an impress. But the weight of the argument rests upon a misconception of this expression of the court. They did not mean to say, that the introductory remarks to the order in <em>Snowden et al. vs. Dorsey et al. </em>bore no impress of the Chancellor\u2019s opinion upon the merits of the case; because the reverse is most palpably the fact: it does hear the impress of his opinion: hut not of his \u201cjudicial opinion.\u201d The impress of the Chancellor\u2019s \u201cjudicial opinion,\u201d in the sense in which the court have used it, being synonymous with, what he has adjudged or decreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Appeal dismissed, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
