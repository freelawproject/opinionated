For that the description of the lands in the said writs and returns is uncertain, and consequently the executions are void. <em>2. </em>Because the description of thelands in the return of the <em>fi.fa. </em>which was first sued out in this cause, upon which return, the <em>v.e. </em>is predicated, is uncertain, and the writ aforesaid consequently void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>This motion was overruled by the County Court, and a second <em>habere facias </em>ordered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-5\">The defendant <em>Clarke </em>appealed to the Court of Appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b452-6\">The'cause was argued before Buchanan, Ch.

That the <em>fieri facias </em>was void for uncertainty, and that the court erred in adjudging a second writ of possession to be issued. <em>2. </em>The court erred, because the act of Assembly upon which the writ of <em>habere facias possessionem </em>issued, was not in force, when the levy under the <em>fieri facias </em>was made, nor when the writ of <em>venditioni exponas </em>issued, and it would be giving an <em>ex post facto </em>operation to the law to make it applicable to cases of property already taken in execution. 3. Because the sale was made after the return day of the writ of <em>venditioni exponas. </em>On the 1st point they referred to <em>Underhill vs. </em>Devereaux, <em>2 Saund. </em>69, <em>a (note 2.)

Johnson, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-10\">The sale took place on the 17th of June, 1826, and the writ of <em>habere facias possessionem, </em>under the act of 1825, <em>ch. </em>103, was moved for, and ordered at April term, 1827, returnable to October term, 1827. The act of 1825 gives the party one entire term, and four days of the succeeding term, to show cause against the issuing of the <em>habere facias. </em>This time expired before the writ was ordered.- The act of 1825 says nothing about the time the issuing of the writ under which the sale -is made. If the <em>sale </em>is made <em>after </em>the passage of the law, the purchaser is entitled to his <em>habere, </em>by the express terms of the statute; although the writ under which it may be effected is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>sued previously. On the <em>first </em>point, they contended, that the <em>fieri facias, </em>and their return thereto, the several writs of <em>venditioni exponas, </em>and their returns, should he connected together, and so considered they present a perfect levy and sale, and the lands sold are sufficiently described. In <em>Thomas vs. Turvey, </em>1 <em>Harr. and Gill, </em>435, one of the schedules described the land correctly, and it was adjudged sufficient to cure the defects of the rest. It is the sale and not. the return which transfers the title, 6 <em>Harr. and Johns. 182. </em>The return is only useful as evidence of the sale, and may be dispensed with if there be a note or memorandum in writing\u2014the sheriff may correct his return if he aslc leave to do so in due time, <em>Berry vs. Griffith, 2 Harr. and Gill, </em>337. But it is too late now to move to set aside the return to the <em>fieri facias, </em>if it is defective\u2014the application should have been made immediately upon its return, or at all events upon the return of the first <em>venditioni exponas. Dand vs. Barnes, </em>1 <em>Serg. and Low, </em>291. (6 <em>Taunt.) Fletcher vs. Wells, Ib. 352. </em>(6 <em>Taunt. </em>191.) Four years intervened between the issuing of the <em>fieri facias </em>and the <em>venditioni exponas </em>under which the sale was made, and eighteen months between the sale and the present motion. The County Court at April term, 1827, by ordering the <em>habere, </em>adjudged the sale and returns valid, it was therefore too late at the ensuing October term to bring the same question before them, they could not interfere with a judgment pronounced by them at a preceding term. <em>Jacob L. D. </em>tit. <em>term, </em>212. <em>Munnikuysen vs. Dorsett, 2 Harr. and Gill, 374.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b453-5\">Martin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW1\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">After recapitulating the facts as set out in the commencement of the report of this case, the Judge proceeded to state, that from these proceedings <em>Clarke </em>has appealed and contends, 1st. That the writs of <em>fieri facias and venditioni exponas </em>and the returns made to them are void for uncertainty; and 2dly. If they are sufficient, <em>Belmear </em>was not entitled to the writ of <em>habere facias possessionem </em>under the act of 1825, as the lands were in execution prior to the passage of that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>The description of the property contained in the schedule returned by the sheriff to the <em>fieri facias </em>was, <em>\u201cpart </em>of Burgess\u2019 Delight, part of <em>Clarke\u2019s Fancy, </em>and part of <em>Hickory Thicket, </em>supposed to contain 275 acres.\u201d . Did the case rest upon this return alone, we should not consider it open for discussion. It has-been solemnly determined by many adjudications bf this court, that such a return is not sufficient, that it would be quashed on motion, and. would be unavailable in an ejectment to prove title in the plaintiff. <em>Williamson vs. Perkins, </em>1 <em>Harr. and Johns. </em>449. <em>Hammond vs. Norris, 2 Harr. and Johns. </em>147. <em>Fitzhugh vs. Hellen, </em>3 <em>Harr. and Johns. </em>206. <em>Fenwick vs. Floyd, </em>1 <em>Harr. and Gill, </em>172. <em>Thomas vs. Turvey, 2 Harr. and Gill, </em>435.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">But it does not rest upon thjs return alone; the sheriff having returned he h\u00e1d not sold the lands under the <em>fieri facias </em>for want of time,- a <em>venditioni exponas </em>was issued, commanding him to sell the-lands before taken by him, under the <em>fieri </em>facias,\u2014to this <em>venditioni </em>he makes a special return, stating in substance, that.he had sold the lands before taken in execution, under the <em>fieri facias, </em>gives a description of those lands by metes and bounds, and that <em>Francis Belmear </em>became the purchaser for $500, which sum had been paid by him. The question then arises, whether the purchaser is not entitled to the benefit of <em>both </em>those returns to shew the description of the lands he had purchased under.them? ' This was a judicial sale, and the purchaser claims title under the whole proceedings, embracing both writs and returns. The <em>fieri facias </em>is the .effective writ in these cases, it not only authorises the sheriff to seize, but to sell, very different is the office of a <em>venditioni exponas. </em>That confers no new power to the sheriff; it does not authorise him to do any act, that he might not have done under the <em>fieri facias. </em>It is only a mandatory writ, and directs him to carry the <em>fieri facias </em>into effect, by selling the lands taken in execution under it, and when the lands are' sold, the return to the <em>venditioni </em>relates to, and in legal effect-, becomes part of the return to the <em>fieri facias. </em>\u2018 Suppose in this case the sheriff had sold the lands under the <em>fieri facias </em>without the aid of a <em>venditioni exponas, </em>and. had returned that he had sold the lands in the schedule mention<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>ed, which lands were contained within certain metes and bounds set out in the return to the sale, can there be a doubt that the return thus correctly describing the lands would not be sufficient, to give certainty to those mentioned in the schedule ? If then the description in the schedule might be corrected by the return to the sale, if made immediately under the <em>fieri </em>facias, it cannot be perceived why it should not be received for that purpose, when made to a <em>venditioni exponas, </em>whose only office is auxiliary to the <em>fieri facias </em>and to carry it into effect. The purchaser claims title under the united effect, of both those writs, and if certainty is the object to be attained, he has a right to resort to the whole judicial proceedings, under which his title accrued to ascertain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">It has been contended that the description of the lands in the return to the <em>venditioni exponas </em>is not sufficiently certain, to ascertain the location of them. That they might have been described with more accuracy cannot be doubted, but we think there is sufficient certainty, to enable the party to make a true location of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The second objection to the proceedings of the court, that these lands were taken in execution prior to the act of 1825, <em>eh. </em>103, cannot avail the appellant. The right of the party to obtain a writ of <em>habere facias possessionem </em>under that act, does not relate to the time the execution was issued, but to the time when the lands were sold, and it appears from the record, the lands in this case were sold on the 17th day of June, 1826, long after the passage of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
