We affirm and reject the People\u2019s argument that defendant received adequate assistance where trial counsel failed to conduct an appropriate investigation of records critical to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"AJS\">A. Defendant\u2019s Interrogation and Inculpatory Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">New York City Police Department detectives suspected defendant of the November 24, 1999 shooting and murder of Marvin Thompson. Upon defendant\u2019s voluntary appearance at the police station two days after the shooting, detectives immediately arrested and placed defendant in a windowless interrogation room. Prior to the interrogation, defendant\u2019s mother, who had gone to the station with him, informed the detectives that defendant had been hospitalized for mental illness as a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Detectives proceeded to interrogate defendant over the next 6V2 hours.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the course of the interrogation, defendant made three statements. His first statement, made within the first 30 minutes of the interrogation, asserted his innocence and that he was at his girlfriend\u2019s home when the shooting occurred. The officers then left defendant alone for several hours. When they returned to resume their questioning, defendant appeared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>tired and upset and explained to the detectives he felt overwhelmed. At 12:50 a.m. the detectives recorded defendant\u2019s second statement, that he had killed the victim because he had reached into his coat pocket as if to pull out a gun to shoot defendant. At approximately 2:00 a.m., defendant made a third statement repeating he had shot the victim when he saw him reach in his pocket for what he thought was a gun. He made this statement in the presence of an Assistant District Attorney who had joined the interrogation and asked defendant questions about the shooting,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> including if the gun he used was an automatic or a revolver, to which defendant replied \u201cI think revolver. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AxH\">B. Trial Counsel\u2019s Pretrial Motions</p>\n<p id=\"AOV\">In early 2000, trial counsel moved for a psychiatric examination pursuant to CPL article 730. Two reports from psychiatric experts concluded defendant was fit to stand trial, but also noted he has a learning disability and certain mental health issues. Specifically, both psychiatric experts separately noted that defendant demonstrated a mild impairment of concentration and memory and was previously evaluated for auditory hallucinations. They both noted that defendant\u2019s intelligence was in the low average range. Supreme Court eventually found defendant fit to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">At the psychological evaluation hearing, trial counsel also announced his intention to present his client\u2019s psychiatric records to an expert in order to challenge the voluntariness of the admissions. The court issued judicial subpoenas for those records.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Months later, by early 2001, trial counsel had neither sought to execute the subpoenas nor otherwise reviewed these or other documents related to defendant\u2019s mental illness or condition. Nevertheless, without supporting witnesses and relying solely on the existing CPL article 730 report, trial counsel moved to suppress the incriminating statements based on involuntariness. Supreme Court denied the motion, concluding that the CPL article 730 report did not support the defense claim that defendant was unable to knowingly and voluntarily waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights due to mental illness. The court specifically noted the failure to produce defendant\u2019s psychiatric records.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>After another nine months, trial counsel belatedly moved under CPL 250.10 for permission to serve and file late notice of intent to proffer psychiatric evidence. In response, the People objected and requested by motion in limine a ruling precluding trial counsel from raising any psychiatric or psychological issues during the trial. Supreme Court denied defendant\u2019s motion, predicating its denial on trial counsel\u2019s failure to proffer a reasonable explanation for the notification delay, and the failure to produce the aforementioned records in support of the motion. The court observed that the medical records \u201cwere never delivered to the Police Department\u201d and were never seen by trial counsel. The court then observed that \u201cwe don\u2019t know what the abnormality is and we don\u2019t have any records and we don\u2019t have any consultation report to go on.\u201d The court ultimately found that trial counsel was \u201cjust fishing\u201d for any useful information. Supreme Court granted the People\u2019s motion, holding that CPL 250.10 notice \u201cis required in all sorts of different situations, including situations where . . . the defense might wish to call a lay person to testify about psychiatric difficulties.\u201d In response to trial counsel\u2019s assertions at the hearing that he intended to present defendant\u2019s mental health history through testimony of defendant\u2019s mother but \u201cnot in an expert format,\u201d the court ruled that defendant\u2019s mother could give \u201cnon-expert\u201d testimony, if relevant to the issue in the case, provided that she did not allude \u201cto psychiatric records or the contents thereof,\u201d or otherwise give \u201cthe patina of psychological expertise\u201d to her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">C. Trial and Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">At the trial, the People\u2019s case consisted of testimony from a witness who saw the shooter running from the scene and who called 911 to report the incident; testimony from the detective who collected bullet casings from the crime scene; testimony from a medical examiner who reviewed the autopsy records describing the victim\u2019s wounds; testimony of the police officer who arrested, interrogated, and obtained defendant\u2019s inculpatory statements; and the submission into evidence of the defendant\u2019s statements. However, other than defendant\u2019s statements to the police, no other evidence directly connected defendant with the murder. The 911 caller\u2019s description of the perpetrator did not match defendant\u2019s ethnicity or attire, and the ballistic evidence recovered from the scene of the crime did not link defendant to the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Trial counsel called one witness, defendant\u2019s mother, who testified that her son attended special education classes as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>child, was committed to the Bronx Children\u2019s Psychiatric Center as a teen, and receives Social Security disability benefits as an adult. However, the court\u2019s limiting instruction precluded trial counsel from asking the mother about defendant\u2019s psychiatric history, mental issues, and the basis for his receipt of government benefits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">After several requests to review the evidence and for a clarification on <em>Miranda, </em>the jury found defendant guilty of murder in the second degree. The court sentenced him to 25 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">D. Defendant\u2019s Motion to Vacate the Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Defendant obtained new counsel who moved to vacate the conviction pursuant to CPL 440.10, arguing that defendant\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective based on several enumerated failures and errors. The motion raised trial counsel\u2019s failure to provide timely notice pursuant to CPL 250.10, to present evidence of defendant\u2019s psychiatric history, to obtain defendant\u2019s psychiatric records, to consult an expert to explain the relationship between defendant\u2019s psychiatric history and the voluntariness and reliability of his statements, and trial counsel\u2019s ignorance of the law regarding the CPL 250.10 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">At the hearing, trial counsel testified about his representation of defendant, and explained his decision to not obtain defendant\u2019s records. He stated that while he initially intended to obtain defendant\u2019s psychiatric records to show that defendant\u2019s inculpatory statements were involuntary, he did not pursue this approach because of defendant\u2019s objections. He testified that defendant said he was innocent, and \u201cshut [him] down\u201d from pursuing a psychiatric defense. According to trial counsel, defendant \u201cdid not want to be portrayed as someone suffering from a psychiatric mental illness.\u201d He said he believed that defendant did not want to \u201cend up in a mental institution.\u201d He further stated that it was his understanding that defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t want psychiatric mumbo jumbo, whatever you want to call it, because he felt it would paint him in a bad way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">Trial counsel explained that he then decided to present defendant\u2019s mental capacity without the records and as a result decided to forgo obtaining them. Trial counsel claimed that he \u201cstood to gain nothing by getting those records . . . unless [he] was headed towards [putting on] a psychiatric defense.\u201d Counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>further claimed: \u201cAnd my feeling is and has been, and I\u2019ve done it in many cases, is that you\u2019re better off. . . without having so many experts on the witness stand and getting bogged up in that, and just giving the jury a good gut feeling.\u201d Thus, trial counsel sought to secure his client\u2019s acquittal by demonstrating to the jury that his client was \u201cnot playing with a full deck\u201d and arguing on summation that the police took advantage of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Trial counsel said he intended to convince the jury that defendant\u2019s will was overborne by the police due to his mental history and the affects of the interrogation. According to trial counsel, he wanted to \u201cbuild\u201d this idea \u201cin the minds of the jury\u201d by demonstrating that defendant \u201chad no work history,\u201d \u201cwas on SSI,\u201d \u201chad a grade school education at the most,\u201d \u201cwas in special ed,\u201d \u201chad some hospitalizations,\u201d and was someone \u201cwhose mind could be played with.\u201d Trial counsel sought to have this history introduced by defendant\u2019s mother, who would discuss her son\u2019s educational, institutional, and occupational history.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">At the hearing, trial counsel admitted that he developed this defense approach without the full benefit of defendant\u2019s psychiatric and government records. He stated that he never saw defendant\u2019s psychiatric records or Social Security Administration records, and that he did not know the diagnosis contained in those records. Trial counsel also admitted that he did not get the records because he believed that he would have to turn them over to the People, even if he never introduced them at trial or presented a formal psychiatric defense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">\u201cAnd you know, yes, the strategy was born in the blind without those [records], but I felt that number one, if I have the records, I got to turn them over. Number two, I don\u2019t gain anything by having those records. The fact that he was\u2014his history is what it was should have been good enough.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">In an attempt to explain his late filed CPL 250.10 motion, trial counsel stated that he initially declined to file a CPL 250.10 application because he believed at the time that no such application was required where an attorney seeks to present psychiatric evidence through a layperson. Concerned that he might have made an error, he decided to submit a late motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Supreme Court denied the motion to vacate, holding that trial counsel pursued a legitimate trial strategy, despite the seemingly insurmountable obstacles posed by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>E. Appellate Division Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">On appeal, the Appellate Division reversed the denial of the motion to vacate and remanded the matter for a new trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The majority held that trial counsel\u2019s failure to obtain and review the psychiatric records deprived defendant of meaningful representation under federal and state law. As relevant here, the majority determined that trial counsel misapprehended the law pertaining to criminal discovery, and further held that his failure to review the relevant records could not be deemed a reasonable trial strategy. The dissent argued that trial counsel\u2019s conduct was not so egregious and prejudicial as to deprive defendant of the right to a fair trial because trial counsel\u2019s decision not to obtain the psychiatric records was a reasonable and legitimate trial strategy. The People appeal to this Court by permission of a dissenting Justice of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The right to effective assistance of counsel in a criminal matter is guaranteed by the Federal and State Constitutions <em>(see </em>US Const 6th Amend; NY Const, art I, \u00a7 6). In determining whether a defendant has been deprived of effective assistance, a <em>court must examine </em>whether \u201cthe evidence, the law, and the circumstances of a particular case, viewed in totality and as of the time of the representation, reveal that the attorney provided meaningful representation\u201d <em>(People v Baldi, </em>54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Essential to any representation, and to the attorney\u2019s consideration of the best course of action on behalf of the client, is the attorney\u2019s investigation of the law, the facts, and the issues that are relevant to the case <em>(see Strickland v Washington, </em>466 US 668, 690-691 [1984]). An attorney\u2019s strategy is shaped in significant part by the results of the investigation stage of the representation. Thus, \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s right to representation does entitle him to have counsel conduct appropriate investigations, both factual and legal, to determine if matters of defense can be developed, and to allow himself time for reflection and preparation for trial\u201d <em>(People v Bennett, </em>29 NY2d 462, 466 [1972] [internal quotation marks omitted]; <em>see also People v Droz, </em>39 NY2d 457, 462 [1976] [\u201cit is elementary that the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>to effective representation includes the right to assistance by an attorney who has taken the time to review and prepare both the law and the facts relevant to the defense\u201d]).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The People argue that trial counsel made a reasonable choice not to use defendant\u2019s psychiatric records even though trial counsel had elected to portray defendant as a person with mental problems that made him vulnerable to police interrogation tactics. The People further assert that trial counsel strategically chose not to obtain the documents in order to prevent the People from obtaining certain information concerning defendant\u2019s purportedly violent tendencies. More specifically, the People claim that trial counsel\u2019s approach to the case was based on his assessment of the options available to him after defendant had precluded him from presenting a psychiatric defense. Under these circumstances, the People argue, trial counsel made a proper choice to introduce critical aspects of defendant\u2019s mental state through the mother rather than the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The record reveals that trial counsel sought to build a defense based on defendant\u2019s mental weakness undermining the voluntariness of his admissions of guilt. Despite the focus on defendant\u2019s mental abilities, trial counsel chose to forgo any investigation of the critical documents concerning defendant\u2019s mental condition, and instead, sought to present this defense through the testimony of defendant\u2019s mother, an obviously biased witness. Regardless of whether the decision to present defendant\u2019s condition through his mother\u2019s testimony was a valid strategy, it was, as trial counsel admitted at the post-conviction hearing, a \u201cstrategy\u201d \u201cborn in the blind\u201d\u2014one he admittedly pursued without benefit of the contents of defendant\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>This is not simply a case of a failed trial strategy <em>(see Baldi, </em>54 NY2d at 146 [\u201ctrial tactics which terminate unsuccessfully do not automatically indicate ineffectiveness\u201d]). Rather, this is a case of a lawyer\u2019s failure to pursue the minimal investigation required under the circumstances. Given that the People\u2019s case rested almost entirely on defendant\u2019s inculpatory statements, trial counsel\u2019s ability to undermine the voluntariness of those statements was crucial. The strategy to present defendant\u2019s mental capacity and susceptibility to police interrogation could only be fully developed after counsel\u2019s investigation of the facts and law, which required review of records that would reveal and explain defendant\u2019s mental illness history, and defendant\u2019s diagnosis supporting his receipt of federal Supplemental Security Income benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The People\u2019s argument that the contested records would not have helped the defense, regardless of trial counsel\u2019s choices, misconstrues the central issue in this case. The issue is not whether trial counsel\u2019s choice to have certain documents excluded from the record constitutes a legitimate trial strategy, but whether the failure to secure and review crucial documents, that would have undeniably provided valuable information to assist counsel in developing a strategy during the pretrial investigation phase of a criminal case, constitutes meaningful representation as a matter of law. The utter failure to obtain these documents constituted denial of effective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Trial counsel did not fully investigate the case and did not collect the type of information that a lawyer would need in order to determine the best course of action for his or her client. It simply cannot be said that a total failure to investigate the facts of a case, or review pertinent records, constitutes a trial strategy resulting in meaningful representation. There is simply no legitimate explanation for this purported strategy <em>(see generally People v Benevento, </em>91 NY2d 708, 712 [1998]; <em>see also People v Caban, </em>5 NY3d 143, 152 [2005]; <em>People v Rivera, </em>71 NY2d 705, 709 [1988]). At a bare minimum, trial counsel should have obtained and reviewed the relevant records, and, after considering the pertinent information contained in the records, considered the contents of those records and pursued a strategy informed by both the available evidence and defendant\u2019s concerns. This failure seriously compromised defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial <em>(see generally People v Hobot, </em>84 NY2d 1021, 1022 [1995]). Based on the foregoing, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-11\">. A police officer read defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights and recorded defendant\u2019s waiver of those rights prior to the first interview <em>(Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436 [1966]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-8\">. The Assistant District Attorney re-Mirandized defendant on the record before asking him any questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\">. The two inculpatory statements were inconsistent and contradicted the evidence which established that the victim was not wearing a coat and the gun used in the shooting was not a revolver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b430-10\">. The court also instructed the jury during the charge that \u201cthere [was] no evidence concerning any psychological or psychiatric issues.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b432-9\">. Based on its ruling on the motion to vacate, the Appellate Division dismissed, as academic, defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b433-7\">. The American Bar Association has set forth standards articulating this duty to investigate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">\u201cDefense counsel should conduct a prompt investigation of the circumstances of the case and explore all avenues leading to facts relevant to the merits of the case and the penalty in the event of conviction. The investigation should include efforts to secure information in the possession of the prosecution and law enforcement authorities. The duty to investigate exists regardless of the accused\u2019s admissions or statements to defense counsel of facts constituting guilt or the accused\u2019s stated desire to plead guilty\u201d (American Bar Association, ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Prosecution Function and Defense Function, standard 4-4.1 at 181 [3d ed 1993], available at http://www.americanbar.org/ content/dam/aba/publications/criminal _justice_standards/ prosecution_defense_function.authcheckdam.pdf [accessed May 21, 2013]).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Smith, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"ABL\">I agree with the majority that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, in that he should have subpoenaed defendant\u2019s psychiatric records, and examined them, before trial. As it turns out, however, if the records had been available they would have been worse than useless to defendant\u2014they would have hurt his case. Since a claim of ineffective assistance requires not only a showing of deficient performance, but also a showing that counsel\u2019s errors prejudiced defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial <em>(People v Stultz, </em>2 NY3d 277, 283-284 [2004]; <em>People v Benevento, </em>91 NY2d 708, 713-714 [1998]), I conclude that ineffectiveness has not been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">As the majority opinion explains, the case against defendant rested heavily on his confession, and the essence of his defense at trial was that the confession was false. This was not a hopeless defense. The confession was short on detail and some of the details, as the majority opinion points out, were incorrect <em>(see </em>majority op at 342 n 3). Defense counsel sought to bolster his attack on the confession by showing that defendant was a mentally limited and disturbed man, vulnerable to manipulation by the police who interrogated him. To this end, counsel elicited the following testimony from defendant\u2019s mother:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">\u201cQ And was he in any particular educational program during his schooling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">\u201cQ What was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">\u201cA Special Education. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-10\">\u201cQ How far did he get in school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-11\">\u201cA Eight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-12\">\u201cQ And where did he go or what did he do after eighth grade?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-13\">\u201cA After eighth grade he was in a hospital for five months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-14\">\u201cQ And do you know the name of the hospital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-15\">\u201cA The Bronx Children\u2019s Psychiatric Center.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-16\">\u201cQ And between the time that he got out of that particular hospital until the time of his arrest, did George have a work history?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>\u201cA No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">\u201cQ How did he support himself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">\u201cA SSI.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">\u201cQ Is that Social Security Disability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">\u201cA Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">The gist of defendant\u2019s argument here is that, because of his counsel\u2019s failings, he did not have more and better evidence than this\u2014specifically, he did not have the records of his psychiatric history. In theory those records could have shown, or provided an expert with a basis for opining, that he was, for example, submissive to authority, or easily misled and confused, or perhaps even that he had a history of admitting to things he did not do. Counsel certainly should have subpoenaed the records, looked for such evidence and preserved his right to offer it at trial, and I offer no excuse for his failure to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">But the records of defendant\u2019s stay when he was 15 years old at the Bronx Children\u2019s Psychiatric Center, which were finally obtained by successor counsel and presented on a motion pursuant to CPL article 440 to vacate the judgment of conviction, do not say what defense counsel would have wanted them to say. They do show that he had learning difficulties (as the jury, knowing that he had been in special education and that his schooling ended in eighth grade, presumably inferred) and that his IQ was low. An expert retained by defendant for his posttrial motion prepared a report dwelling on these facts, and others that the expert thought might predispose defendant to making a false confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">The records also contained, however, facts that the defense expert understandably did not dwell on. They showed that defendant\u2019s psychiatric problems included violent\u2014indeed, homicidal\u2014impulses and fantasies. A doctor who interviewed him found a \u201cstrong streak of paranoia,\u201d and added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-12\">\u201cHe feels that people were against him at school and didn\u2019t treat him with the respect that he deserved and therefore he had to carry a gun and act very tough in order to demand respect. He says that he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to beat people up in order to get the respect he deserves.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">Later in the same examination, the doctor noted: \u201cWhat he would like to do in the future is to join the army and travel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>around the world and kill people. He says that would be quite enjoyable and exciting.\u201d Eight days later, the doctor assessed the adolescent defendant by saying: \u201cGeorge\u2019s weak superego certainly will allow him to kill somebody with no remorse if he felt appropriately aggrieved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">It hardly seems necessary to argue that these psychiatric records would not have improved defendant\u2019s chances of acquittal. Indeed, his counsel, though perhaps more through luck than skill, achieved what seems the best of all possible worlds from his point of view: the jury knew that defendant had psychiatric problems requiring hospitalization, but never found out what those problems were. As it happens, the jury convicted defendant anyway, but it is hard to imagine a trial that gave him a better chance of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">In arguing that he was indeed prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to obtain and offer psychiatric evidence, defendant suggests that he would have been allowed to offer at trial the favorable parts of the records, and exclude all reference to the unfavorable parts. I think that highly unlikely; such a trial would not have been the fair one to which defendant was entitled, but one decidedly unfair to the People. I do not recommend to the counsel who represents defendant on his retrial the strategy of relying on part of the psychiatric records, in the hope that the jury will never find out about the rest. To pursue that strategy would be to invite an ineffective assistance claim much better, in my judgment, than the one the Court upholds today.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Chief Judge Lippmajnt and Judges Graffeo, Read and Pigott concur with Judge Rivera; Judge Smith dissents in an opinion; Judge Abdus-Saiaam taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
