By legislative design the severe abuse statute applies to very few cases. <em>(Matter of Leon K.

The Commissioner of the New York City Administration for Children\u2019s Services did not submit evidence of diligent efforts to reunite appellant with his children and under the statutory scheme could not have been excused from such efforts. <em>(Matter of Borkowski v Borkowski, </em>38 AD2d 752; <em>Loeb v Loeb, </em>14 AD2d 270; <em>Matter of Leon K.

III. Appellant Antoine N. was erroneously found to have acted with depraved indifference to Jayquan\u2019s life. <em>(People v Suarez, </em>6 NY3d 202; <em>People v Best, </em>85 NY2d 826; <em>People v Poplis, </em>30 NY2d 85; <em>People v Goodridge, </em>251 AD2d 85.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b125-5\"><em>Michael A.

The Appellate Division erred in the first appeal in remanding the case for a hearing on diligent efforts, where a finding that diligent efforts were made or excused is not required for a severe abuse finding under Family Court Act \u00a7 1051 (e).

Second, a showing of diligent efforts to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship is not prerequisite to a finding of severe abuse under Family Court Act \u00a7 1051 (e) where the factfinder determines that such efforts would be detrimental to the best interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">On February 23, 2007, the Commissioner of the New York City Administration for Children\u2019s Services (the Commissioner or ACS) filed related petitions under article 10 of the Family Court Act against Antoine N. and Ronnelle B. with respect to the four children who resided with them: five-month-old Jayquan N., five-year-old Justin N., five-year-old Diamonaysia B., and two-year-old Dashawn W. Antoine and Ronnelle are Jayquan\u2019s parents, while Antoine is Justin\u2019s father and Ronnelle is the mother of Diamonaysia and Dashawn. ACS had carried out an emergency removal pursuant to Family Court Act \u00a7 1024 the previous day, after social workers at Bellevue Hospital Center reported suspected child abuse to the Statewide Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The petitions in these child protective proceedings alleged that Jayquan, whom Antoine brought to Bellevue on the evening of February 21, 2007\u2014hours after he claimed that the baby screamed in a way unlike ever before\u2014had been admitted with a \u201cshifted and fractured collar-bone with swelling\u201d; and that, upon further examination, hospital personnel discovered four partially healed fractured ribs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petitions also asserted that Antoine \u201cinflict[ed] excessive corporal punishment\u201d on Justin by hitting him with a \u201cblack wire,\u201d thereby causing \u201cexcessive welts to his body\u201d; and that Ronnelle failed to intervene to protect him. The Commissioner sought orders determining, upon clear and convincing evidence, that these four children were severely or repeatedly abused, and, upon a preponderance of the evidence, that they were abused and/or neglected.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">At the ensuing fact-finding hearing, ACS called Dr. Lori L\u00e9gano, who examined Jayquan at Bellevue on February 22, 2007, acting as a consultant with a child protection team; Dr. L\u00e9gano was qualified as an expert in pediatrics and child abuse. She testified that the fracture of Jayquan\u2019s left collarbone (or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>clavicle) was sustained within less than a week before his admission to the hospital, and that the most likely cause was a direct blow to the shoulder. Because of the level of force required to inflict this injury, Dr. L\u00e9gano rejected Antoine\u2019s explanation\u2014 that two-year-old Dashawn pulled Jayquan\u2019s arms while he sat in his \u201cbouncy chair\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the day before Antoine took Jayquan to the hospital\u2014as medically implausible. According to Dr. L\u00e9gano, a two year old could not have generated enough force to separate Jayquan\u2019s clavicle by pulling on his arms. For the same reason, she discounted the notion, suggested by Antoine\u2019s attorney, that Jayquan may have broken his collarbone when one of the other children hit him, or fell against him while he sat in the bouncy chair, thereby somehow propelling him onto the floor. Dr. L\u00e9gano ruled out birth trauma as the cause of Jayquan\u2019s fractured collarbone because his medical records disclosed an unremarkable delivery and the break was so fresh; and based on Jayquan\u2019s medical records and the results of blood and other tests, she eliminated other possible causative factors (e.g., insufficient vitamin D, malnourishment, low bone density). Dr. L\u00e9gano testified that a clavicle fracture was not life-threatening and would heal on its own without any treatment, but Jayquan would experience discomfort in the meantime unless he kept his shoulder \u201ctotally still.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">As for Jayquan\u2019s four broken ribs, Dr. L\u00e9gano testified that \u201ca lot of force\u201d would have been required to cause these injuries. Further, the fractures were all on the baby\u2019s left side, rather than bilateral, as would be expected if one of the other children stood or stamped on Jayquan while he lay on the floor, which Antoine\u2019s attorney speculated may have happened. In the absence of a major trauma such as a car accident, Dr. L\u00e9gano viewed Jayquan\u2019s broken ribs as most likely an \u201cinflicted injury\u201d caused by \u201cdirect force to the middle of the chest,\u201d or \u201cblunt trauma to the side of the chest\u201d; she added that, given the pliability of an infant\u2019s ribs, fractures are a classic sign of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>child abuse, almost always caused by an intentional act. Her observation of callus formation caused Dr. L\u00e9gano to conclude that Jayquan had sustained these injuries between two weeks and several months before his admission to the hospital. She opined that Jayquan\u2019s discomfort should have been noticeable because as his chest expanded with each breath, the broken edges of the ribs would rub together, causing virtually continuous pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">An ACS caseworker, who interviewed each member of the family, testified that Antoine and Ronnelle surmised that Jayquan must have broken his ribs in mid-December 2006 when he and two-year-old Dashawn were playing on a bed with their maternal grandfather, and Dashawn either hit or kicked Jayquan. The caseworker, who also physically examined each of the children for signs of abuse, observed \u201cblack linear marks . . . too many to count\u201d on Justin\u2019s chest, stomach, inner thigh and buttocks. Antoine conceded that he had lashed the child with an electrical cord, which he justified as punishment meted out after discovering Justin and Diamonaysia, both five years old, doing \u201cadult things.\u201d The caseworker added that when she tried to comfort Dashawn as he was crying, he yelled at her, \u201cGet out of my face . . . [bjefore I get my belt,\u201d which Diamonaysia explained Antoine said \u201call the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Antoine did not testify at the hearing or call any witnesses. Family Court took judicial notice of a finding of abuse against Antoine in 1994 relating to his infant son, Antoine, Jr. In a fact-finding decision and order entered on April 11, 1994, Family Court found that then four-month-old Antoine, Jr. sustained bilateral subdural hematomas in his brain, four fractured ribs on his left side and a fractured wrist and skull; that Antoine and the infant\u2019s mother provided no satisfactory or convincing explanation for these injuries; and that the brain injuries were so serious that it was unknown whether Antoine, Jr. would fully recover or, instead, suffer from mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, Family Court determined that Antoine and Ronnelle abused Jayquan \u201cin that[,] while in the care of [Antoine and Ronnelle, the] child sustained fractures of the clavicle and of the left 4-7 ribs . . . [and Antoine and Ronnelle] have not offered any credible explanation for any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>these injuries\u201d;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that they neglected<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and derivatively abused Justin, and derivatively abused and neglected Dashawn and Diamonaysia.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While finding that Jayquan sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>\u201c[s]erious physical injury, . . . protracted, painful, [and] horrible injuries,\u201d Family Court nonetheless dismissed the petition insofar as it alleged severe abuse against Antoine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge believed that, in view of our decision in <em>People v Suarez </em>(6 NY3d 202 [2005]), severe abuse under Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b <em>(8) </em>(a) (i)\u2014which requires a finding that Antoine acted \u201cunder circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life\u201d\u2014 could almost never be established unless an eyewitness testified to the manner in which the harm was inflicted. Supported by the Attorney for the Children, ACS appealed from Family Court\u2019s dismissal of the claim of severe abuse; Antoine did not cross-appeal the judge\u2019s findings of serious physical injury and abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">In May 2010, the Appellate Division reversed (73 AD3d 574 [1st Dept 2010]). The court first held that Family Court was not constrained by <em>Suarez </em>because \u201cSocial Services Law \u00a7 384-b (8) (a) encompasses conduct which is either intentional or reckless, unlike Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 (1) and (2), which, pursuant to <em>Suarez, </em>are almost always mutually exclusive\u201d; and \u201c[i]n any event, <em>Suarez </em>recognized that in cases involving abused children, conduct evincing depraved indifference to human life may be present in a one-on-one situation\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 574).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The Appellate Division then found that \u201cthe baby sustained . . . serious physical injuries while in the care of [Antoine], and the parents failed to provide an adequate explanation\u201d; and noted that Family Court \u201cwas entitled to draw the strongest negative inference against the father based on his failure to testify in the proceedings\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 575). As a result, \u201cfather\u2019s conduct directed at the infant was sufficient to demonstrate depraved indifference to the child\u2019s life\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Citing Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (8) (a) (i) and (iv), the Court then noted that, \u201cdue to [Family Court\u2019s] misinterpretation of <em>Suarez, </em>it never reached the issue of whether [ACS] exercised diligent efforts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>strengthen the parental relationship\u201d; and therefore remanded for the lower court to decide \u201cif [ACS] exerted such efforts or whether such efforts are excused, since a finding of severe abuse is admissible in a subsequent proceeding to terminate parental rights\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Upon remand, Family Court determined that diligent efforts should be excused because they would be \u201cdetrimental to the best interests of the child(ren).\u201d In support of this finding, the judge cited Antoine\u2019s 1994 abuse adjudication, remarking that \u201cwe come now to . . . a time approximately 14 years later, when [Antoine] has again displayed egregious conduct towards a child [u]nder circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to the [child\u2019s] life and health.\u201d According to Family Court, the earlier incident, in combination with the events leading to these petitions, demonstrated that the \u201cprognosis for change in [Antoine\u2019s] indifferent behavior is poor.\u201d The judge therefore found that \u201cefforts to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship would be detrimental to the best interests of [Jayquan] as they would consign him to a further protracted stay in foster care, thereby depriving him of permanency and of a normal, healthy and safe life, with virtually no likelihood of ultimate reunification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Antoine appealed Family Court\u2019s order excusing diligent efforts and, at the same time, moved for leave to appeal to us. After we dismissed his motion upon the ground that simultaneous appeals do not lie (16 NY3d 767 [2011]), the Appellate Division affirmed (91 AD3d 505 [1st Dept 2012]). In that court\u2019s view,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">\u201cFamily Court properly determined, in light of [the] prior determination that there was clear and convincing evidence that the child . . . was \u2018severely abused[,]\u2019 . . . that such \u2018[aggravated circumstances\u2019 (Family Ct Act \u00a7 1012 [j]) excused ACS from exercising diligent efforts to reunite the father with the child because such efforts would be detrimental to the best interests of the child and are unlikely to be successful in the foreseeable future\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 506).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The Appellate Division rejected the \u201cfather\u2019s attempt to characterize the Family Court\u2019s proceedings conducted pursuant to [the remand] as a wholly distinct and separate hearing,\u201d concluding instead that they were merely a \u201ccontinuation of the prior fact-finding hearing\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">We granted Antoine leave to appeal (19 NY3d 804 [2012]), and now affirm, although for slightly different reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">At the conclusion of the fact-finding phase in an article 10 proceeding, Family Court may,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">\u201c[i]n addition to a finding of abuse, . . . enter <em>a finding of severe abuse ... as defined in [Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (8) (a)], </em>which shall be admissible in a proceeding to terminate parental rights pursuant to [Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b]. If the court makes such additional finding of severe abuse . . . , the court shall state the grounds for its determination, which <em>shall be based upon clear and convincing </em>evidence\u201d (Family Ct Act \u00a7 1051 [e] [emphases added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Section 384-b (8) (a) of the Social Services Law, in turn, specifies that \u201c[flor the purposes of this section [384-b],\u201d which governs termination of parental rights, a child is \u201cseverely abused\u201d if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">\u201c(i) the child has been found to be an abused child as a result of <em>reckless or intentional acts of the parent committed under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life, </em>which result in serious physical injury to the child as defined in [Penal Law \u00a7 10.00 (10)] ;[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">\u201c(ii) the child has been found to be [a sexually abused child]; provided, however, the [parent] must have committed or knowingly allowed to be committed [1 of 11 enumerated felony sex offenses] . . . ; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-10\">\u201c(iii) [the child\u2019s parent has been convicted of certain felony offenses under the Penal Law,(<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>) and] the victim or intended victim was the child or another child of the parent or another child for whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>care such parent is or has been legally responsible; or . . . the parent of such child has been convicted under the law in any other jurisdiction of an offense which includes all of the essential elements [of these crimes]; <em>and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">\u201c(iv) <em>the agency has made diligent efforts </em>to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship, including efforts to rehabilitate the respondent, when such efforts will not be detrimental to the best interests of the child, and such efforts have been unsuccessful and are unlikely to be successful in the foreseeable future.

Antoine, by contrast, considers \u201cdepraved indifference\u201d to require the same showing under both statutes. The facts in this case, he argues, \u201cthough disquieting and unpleasant, simply do not rise to the level of depraved indifference\u201d discussed in <em>Suarez </em>and other cases in the progression of decisions culminating in <em>People v Feingold </em>(7 NY3d 288 [2006] [recounting the evolution of the Court\u2019s depraved indifference jurisprudence]; <em>see also Policano v Herbert, </em>7 NY3d 588 [2006] [same]). In <em>Feingold, </em>we held that depraved indifference denotes a culpable mental state beyond mere recklessness, and explicitly overruled <em>People v Register </em>(60 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>NY2d 270 [1983]). <em>Register </em>had stood for the proposition that depraved indifference was \u201cneither the <em>mens rea </em>nor the <em>actus </em>reus\u201d of a crime, but rather referred to \u201cthe factual setting in which the [defendant\u2019s] risk creating conduct must occur\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 276) so that \u201cthe focus of the offense [was] upon an objective assessment of the degree of risk presented by defendant\u2019s reckless conduct\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 277; <em>see also Policano, </em>7 NY3d at 599-600).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Under the Penal Law, a person acts \u201cintentionally\u201d when \u201chis conscious objective\u201d is to cause a proscribed result (for example, death) or engage in conduct described by a statute (Penal Law \u00a7 15.05 [1]); and a person acts \u201crecklessly\u201d with respect to a proscribed result or a circumstance described by a statute \u201cwhen he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 15.05 [3]). And \u201cdepraved indifference\u201d bespeaks a state of mind reflecting \u201ca depraved kind of wantonness: for example, shooting into a crowd, placing a time bomb in a public place, or opening the door of the lions\u2019 cage in the zoo\u201d <em>(Feingold, </em>7 NY3d at 293 [internal quotation marks omitted]). It is \u201cbest understood as an utter disregard for the value of human life\u2014a willingness to act not because one intends harm, but because one simply doesn\u2019t care whether grievous harm results or not[, and which reflects] wickedness, evil or inhumanity, as manifested by brutal, heinous and despicable acts\u201d <em>(Suarez, </em>6 NY3d at 214). The Penal Law establishes crimes that are mutually exclusive, depending on these distinctions of culpable state of mind; specifically, second-degree intentional murder (Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 [1] [mens rea of intent to kill]), as contrasted with second-degree depraved indifference murder (Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 [2] [mens rea of recklessness plus mens rea of depraved indifference]), as contrasted with second-degree manslaughter (Penal Law \u00a7 125.15 [mens rea of recklessness]).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The same cannot be said of the child protective statutes. Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (8) (a) (i) provides that a child can be found to be severely abused \u201cas a result of reckless <em>or </em>intentional <em>acts </em>of the parent committed under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life\u201d (emphases added). Under the Penal Law, however, a crime requiring proof of an intent to kill can never be committed with depraved indifference <em>(see Policano, </em>7 NY3d at 600 [\u201c(I)t has never been permissible in New York for a jury to convict a defendant of depraved indifference murder where the evidence produced at trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>indicated that if the defendant committed homicide at all, he committed it with the conscious objective of killing the victim\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)]). Additionally, \u201c[a] defendant may be convicted of depraved indifference murder when but a single person is endangered in only a few rare circumstances\u201d (Suarez, 6 NY3d at 212), whereas acts of child abuse necessarily involve one-on-one violence. In short, our depraved indifference jurisprudence under the Penal Law has no bearing on whether a child is severely abused within the meaning of Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (8) (a) (i). For purposes of that statute \u201ccircumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life\u201d refers to the risk intentionally or recklessly posed to the child by the parent\u2019s abusive conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Here, Antoine beat or struck a baby\u2014an especially vulnerable victim because so tiny, defenseless and unformed. And Dr. Legano\u2019s testimony about the age of Jayquan\u2019s injuries established that Antoine must have attacked him on at least two different occasions, separated by at least two weeks. Further, Antoine had to have been aware of the life-threatening risks he created when he applied brute force to Jayquan\u2019s chest and shoulder. After all, he knew that devastating injuries ensued when he brutalized his then four-month-old namesake, Antoine, Jr. While this prior instance of abuse was too remote in time to support a finding of repeated abuse, it reflects Antoine\u2019s utter disregard for Jayquan\u2019s life, health and well-being. Additionally, Antoine neglected to summon medical aid for Jayquan\u2019s fractured ribs, even though the baby would have to have experienced and displayed continuous pain and distress; and he delayed seeking medical care for Jayquan on February 21, 2007 from 11:00 a.m., when he claimed to have first noticed the baby\u2019s suffering, until the early evening hours.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finally, Antoine offered unbelievable explanations for Jayquan\u2019s injuries to medical personnel and social workers, and he did not testify at the fact-finding hearing <em>(see Matter of Nassau County Dept. of Social Servs. v Denise J., </em>87 NY2d 73, 79 [1995] [where the mother did not testify in a child protective proceeding, we noted that \u201c(a) trier of fact may draw the strongest inference that the opposing evidence permits\u201d]). Thus, there is record support for the Appellate Division\u2019s finding, based on clear and convincing evidence, that Antoine, acting under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life, severely abused Jayquan.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Diligent Efforts</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">At no time did ACS make \u201cdiligent efforts to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship, including efforts to rehabilitate\u201d Antoine (see Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b [8] [a] [iv]). This is undisputed. What the parties instead contest is whether this omission was permissible in light of Family Court Act \u00a7\u00a7 1051 (e), 1039-b and 1012 (j). The Attorney for the Children, joined by ACS, urges that a showing of diligent efforts is not required for a finding of severe abuse under Family Court Act \u00a7 1051 (e), while Antoine naturally insists otherwise. But Antoine also maintains that diligent efforts are incapable of being excused under Family Court Act \u00a7\u00a7 1039-b and 1012 (j) on the basis of severe abuse. So for very different reasons leading to diametrically opposite practical outcomes, the Attorney for the Children and Antoine both take the position that the Appellate Division erred when, in the first appeal, it remanded this case to Family Court for a finding as to whether diligent efforts were made or excused. The Attorney for the Children argues in the alternative, though, that Family Court was permitted to and properly excused diligent efforts pursuant to Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (8) (a) (iv) itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Section 1039-b (a) of the Family Court Act states that \u201c[i]n conjunction with, or at any time subsequent to, the filing of a[n abuse or neglect] petition . . . , the [presentment agency] may file a motion upon notice requesting a finding that reasonable efforts to return the child to his or her home are no longer required.\u201d The statute further provides that reasonable efforts \u201cshall not be required\u201d when \u201cthe parent of such child has subjected the child to <em>aggravated circumstances, as defined in\u201d </em>Family Court Act \u00a7 1012 (j) (Family Court Act \u00a7 1039-b [b] [1] [emphasis added]).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Family Court Act \u00a7 1012 (j) defines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\u201caggravated circumstances\u201d to include \u201cwhere a child has been either <em>severely or repeatedly abused, </em>as defined in\u201d Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (8) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">First, Antoine takes as a given that Family Court Act \u00a7\u00a7 1039-b and 1012 (j) provide the only way for a presentment agency to sidestep diligent efforts. Then he reasons\u2014in \u201c[a]n almost Talmudic exercise in statutory application, following the trail of FCA \u00a7 1051 (e) to Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (8) to FCA \u00a7 1039-b to FCA \u00a7 1012 (j)\u201d\u2014that a finding of severe abuse pursuant to Family Court Act \u00a7 1051 (e) can never serve as an \u201caggravated circumstance\u201d excusing \u201creasonable efforts to return the child to his or her home\u201d pursuant to Family Court Act \u00a7\u00a7 1039-b (a), (b) (1) and 1012 (j) because Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (8) (a) requires diligent efforts as a prerequisite to a finding of severe abuse. Antoine asserts that his analysis is not circular and does not render Family Court Act \u00a7 1039-b (b) (1) meaningless because a court might have previously determined, as also provided for in subparagraph (iv) of section 384-b (8) (a), that reasonable efforts were not required to return a severely abused child to his or her family on the basis of one of the grounds enumerated in Family Court Act \u00a7 1039-b (b) (2)-(6) <em>(see </em>n 10, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The Attorney for the Children points out that the legislature in 1999 adopted Family Court Act \u00a7 1039-b and amended Family Court Act \u00a7 1051 (e) and Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (8) (a) to implement the Federal Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA). ASEA clarified when states must engage in reasonable efforts to bring parents and an abused or neglected child back together, and when these efforts could or should be excused or discontinued. To address the \u201cuncertainty about the reasonable efforts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>standard [that] sometimes delays State action in making children available for adoption,\u201d Congress therefore \u201cpermitted] the State[s] to bypass\u201d the \u201creasonable efforts criterion\u201d in cases where a parent subjected a child to \u201caggravated circumstances\u201d as defined under state law, and to \u201cmove expeditiously to terminate parental rights and make [these abused and neglected children] available for adoption\u201d (HR Rep No. 105-77, 105th Cong, 1st Sess at 7-8, reprinted in 1997 US Code Cong &amp; Admin News at 2739, 2739-2740; <em>see also Marino S., </em>100 NY2d at 369-370 [\u201cThe effect of a finding of aggravated circumstances under the Family Court Act\u2014like the effect of a finding of severe abuse under the Social Services Law (severe abuse itself constitutes an aggravated circumstance)\u2014is to dispense with the requirement that an agency responsible for having placed the children in foster care or seeking to terminate parental rights exercise diligent or reasonable efforts to reunite the (parent[s]) with the children\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The Attorney for the Children objects that Antoine\u2019s view of the interplay of the Family Court Act and the Social Services Law, which negates severe abuse as an independent basis under Family Court Act \u00a7 1039-b (b) (1) for excusing reasonable efforts, runs counter to ASFA\u2019s express purpose \u201cto expedite permanency for children who suffer . . . the \u2018aggravated circumstance\u2019 of severe abuse.\u201d Seeking to harmonize the statutes in a way faithful to ASFA\u2019s goals and New York\u2019s concomitant statutory scheme, she maintains that the legislature, \u201cwhen referencing the definition of \u2018severe abuse\u2019 in Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (8) (a) in Family Court Act \u00a7\u00a7 1012 (j) and 1051 (e), intended <em>to borrow only the abusive acts described in [subparagraphs] (i) through (Hi) </em>of Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (8) (a), and not the diligent efforts showing of [subparagraph] (iv)\u201d (emphasis added). This approach \u201ccompletely resolves the circularity and incongruity\u201d created by Antoine\u2019s interpretation of the statutes \u201cand fully accords with the purpose of ASFA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Finally, the Attorney for the Children advances the alternative position that if subparagraph (iv) of Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (8) (a) is, in fact, incorporated into article 10\u2019s definition of severe abuse, as Antoine argues, then Family Court is authorized to excuse diligent efforts upon a finding that they would be detrimental to the child\u2019s best interests. We agree. First, we conclude that Family Court Act \u00a7\u00a7 1051 (e) and 1012 (j) necessarily import Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (8) (a) <em>in its entirety. </em>We simply cannot read subparagraph (iv) out of the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>severe abuse incorporated in these provisions when the legislature did not choose to create such an exclusion, as it easily might have. Second, Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (8) (a) (iv) clearly states that Family Court may excuse diligent efforts when they are found to be detrimental to the best interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">To recapitulate, Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (8) (a) defines a child as \u201cseverely abused\u201d if the victim of depraved indifference abuse <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 384-b [8] [a] [i]), <em>or </em>felony sex offense abuse <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 384-b [8] [a] [ii]), <em>or </em>other felony offense abuse <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 384-b [8] [a] [iii]), <em>and</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\"><em>\u201cthe agency has made diligent efforts </em>to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship, including efforts to rehabilitate the respondent, <em>when such efforts will not be detrimental to the best interests of the child, </em>and such efforts <em>have been unsuccessful and are unlikely to be successful </em>in the foreseeable future. <em>Where a court has previously determined </em>in accordance with this chapter or the family court act <em>that reasonable efforts to make it possible for the child to return safely to his or her home are not required, the agency shall not be required to demonstrate diligent efforts </em>as set forth in this section\u201d <em>{id. </em>\u00a7 384-b [8] [a] [iv] [emphases added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Thus, for a court to find severe abuse under Family Court Act \u00a7 1051 (e), the presentment agency must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the parent committed an abusive act specified in subparagraphs (i), (ii) <em>or </em>(iii) of section 384-b (8) (a); <em>and </em>diligent efforts to reunite the family were not made because detrimental to the child\u2019s best interests; <em>or </em>such efforts were made but were unsuccessful and unlikely to succeed in the near term; <em>or </em>such efforts were not required because a court had previously determined that reasonable efforts to reunite the family were unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The Attorney for the Children is surely correct that the legislature adopted Family Court Act \u00a7 1039-b to \u201cexpedite permanency planning for abused children by enabling the agency to obtain an immediate determination\u2014during the underlying abuse proceeding\u2014of whether it must exercise diligent efforts, without first having to expend considerable effort . . . until a ruling [could] finally be sought in the subsequent termination proceeding\u201d <em>(see Marino S., </em>100 NY2d at 371). The proposition that the legislature \u201cborrowed\u201d only the abusive acts described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>in Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (8) (a) (i)-(iii) when referring to section 384-b (8) (a) in Family Court Act \u00a7\u00a7 1051 (e) and 1012 (j) is thus intuitively appealing. Perhaps this is what the legislature meant to do. The statutory language, however, does not admit of this interpretation. In sum, both Antoine and the Attorney for the Children weave complex interpretive skeins to justify their preferred outcomes. Each asks us to disregard section 384-b (8) (a) (iv) in the context of child protective proceedings, either wholly (the Attorney for the Children) or in part (Antoine). We opt instead for a straightforward reading of Family Court Act \u00a7\u00a7 1051 (e) and 1012 (j) and Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (8) (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Finally, Family Court in this case properly found that diligent efforts to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship would be detrimental to Jayquan\u2019s best interests, in accordance with Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (8) (a) (iv). The judge determined that, in light of Antoine\u2019s abuse of Antoine, Jr., followed by his severe abuse of Jayquan some 14 years later, there was little prospect that Antoine\u2019s \u201cchronic, long-standing\u201d violent behavior would improve anytime soon, if ever, and it was not in Jayquan\u2019s best interests to languish in foster care in the meantime.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">We have considered Antoine\u2019s other arguments and consider them to be without merit. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Smith, Pigott and Rivera concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-9\">.
