We conclude that they are and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">In the early morning hours of November 22, 2008, defendant Patrick Asaro was driving his vehicle with four passengers on a rural two-lane road in Orange County. He suddenly stopped his car, revved the engine and quickly accelerated to speeds far in excess of the posted limit of 55 miles per hour. Ignoring an urgent plea from one of his passengers to slow down, he crossed the double yellow line and struck an oncoming car head-on, instantly killing the driver and injuring the passenger in the other vehicle. All four passengers in defendant\u2019s car sustained injuries. As a result, defendant was indicted for manslaughter in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 125.15 [1]), criminally negligent homicide (Penal Law \u00a7 125.10), four counts of assault in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 120.05 [4]), four counts of assault in the third degree (Penal Law \u00a7 120.00 [2], [3]), reckless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>endangerment in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 120.20), reckless driving (Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1212) and driving while ability impaired (Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1192 [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">At trial, Andrew Adamczyk testified that several hours before the accident he held a party at his parents\u2019 house located in the Town of Mount Hope along Guymard Turnpike, a two-lane unlit highway with a speed limit of 55 miles per hour. There was a sharp bend in the road near the home. At one point that evening, he watched defendant\u2019s 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer speed by his house, turn around and enter his driveway. When defendant exited his car, he asked Adamczyk whether he liked the modifications he had made to the exhaust and air intake systems\u2014adjustments designed to make the vehicle louder and faster. In response, Adamczyk admonished defendant not to drive by his house at such a dangerously high rate of speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">At the party, 10 to 15 guests were drinking vodka and beer. Kyle Ligenzowski testified that he and defendant drank two shots of vodka together and played \u201cbeer pong\u201d as teammates. Other partygoers likewise saw defendant drinking vodka and participating in beer pong. Two witnesses testified that defendant appeared to be intoxicated. After defendant had been at the party for a few hours, Ligenzowski told him that two people\u2014 Jorge Ortiz and Michael Nazario\u2014needed a lift to the party from the nearby train station in Middletown. Defendant agreed to pick them up and he, Ligenzowski and Therasa Lazaro left the party a little after midnight. After picking up the two individuals, defendant stopped at a gas station to purchase more beer and headed back to the party. Ligenzowski, Ortiz and Nazario each drank beer and smoked marijuana while riding in the back seat. Lazaro was seated in the front passenger seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Suddenly, defendant brought his car to a halt in the middle of the road even though there was no reason to stop. He revved the engine, shifted into gear and accelerated quickly. Ligenzowski and Nazario knew that defendant was speeding because they could hear the car loudly accelerating and felt themselves being pushed back into the seat. Ortiz leaned forward to look at the speedometer and saw that the needle was pointing at 130 miles per hour. Ligenzowski testified that he screamed at defendant to slow down but defendant did not respond. Nazario heard Ligenzowski exclaim to defendant to \u201cslow down, we\u2019re about to make the turn.\u201d Ligenzowski\u2019s ominous warning was the last thing anybody in the car could recall before the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>The physical evidence established that defendant\u2019s vehicle crossed the double yellow line as it approached the curve by Adamczyk\u2019s house and entered the opposite lane of traffic, where it collided head-on into a car driven by Brian Stevens. The impact killed Stevens instantly and seriously injured Lindsey Ernst, who had been in the passenger seat of the car. Meanwhile, Ligenzowski was ejected from defendant\u2019s car, which had careened off the road and rolled over. Ligenzowski, Lazaro, Ortiz and Nazario all sustained serious injuries. The guests at Adamczyk\u2019s party heard the crash, called 911 and came out to help the survivors. When Adamczyk reached defendant, he heard defendant say \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I only had a few.\u201d The crash victims were all taken to a hospital where a blood sample of defendant was drawn at 2:41 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">A forensic toxicologist testified that she conducted tests on defendant\u2019s blood sample for the presence of alcohol and drugs. The test was negative for alcohol but confirmed the presence of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol\u2014the active ingredient in marijuana. A confirmatory test of a separate blood sample by another lab, however, did not detect marijuana in the blood. The toxicologist explained that the negative test may have resulted from the breakdown that occurred between the time the sample was taken and the time the confirmatory test was conducted, about a month and a half later. Although the test did not detect alcohol in defendant\u2019s system, the toxicologist explained that the average person can metabolize one drink, or a blood alcohol content (BAG) of .02, in a given hour. As a result, a person could consume alcohol for a period of time, until 11:30 p.m., and register a BAG of .00 by 2:41 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">A state police expert in the field of collision reconstruction examined the crash site, observing yaw marks crossing the double yellow line from the lane in which defendant\u2019s vehicle had been traveling into the lane where Stevens had been driving. He identified skid marks that ran from the point of impact toward the final resting position of defendant\u2019s car. There were no skid marks suggesting that either car had braked prior to the collision. Based on all the evidence at the scene, the expert concluded that defendant had crossed the double yellow line heading into the curve, causing the accident. In addition, he testified that the calculations he performed to estimate the speed of defendant\u2019s car at the point of impact led him to conclude that defendant was driving at a minimum of 94 miles per hour. On cross-examination, he admitted that the handwritten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>notes he had used to make the speed computations were lost while he was on medical leave and he could not replicate the math. As a result of the lost <em>Rosario </em>material, the trial court gave the jury an adverse inference charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">At the close of the People\u2019s case, defendant moved to dismiss the second-degree manslaughter and second-degree assault counts on the ground that the evidence failed to establish the requisite mental state of recklessness. The trial court denied the motion and the jury convicted defendant of second-degree manslaughter, four counts of second-degree assault, two counts of third-degree assault, second-degree reckless endangerment and reckless driving. The jury acquitted defendant of driving while ability impaired. Defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate term of 3 to 10 years on the manslaughter count to run concurrently with determinate terms of three years on the second-degree assault counts and one year on the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The Appellate Division affirmed (94 AD3d 773 [2d Dept 2012]), and a Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal (19 NY3d 1101 [2012]).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Defendant argues that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain the second-degree manslaughter and second-degree assault convictions. In particular, he asserts that he did not act with the requisite mens rea of recklessness. Rather, he maintains that, at most, he was criminally negligent and the counts therefore should be reduced to criminally negligent homicide and third-degree assault. The People counter that the proof was legally sufficient to prove defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">It is well settled that a \u201cverdict is legally sufficient when, viewing the facts in a light most favorable to the People, there is a valid line of reasoning and permissible inferences from which a rational jury could have found the elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d <em>(People v Danielson, </em>9 NY3d 342, 349 [2007] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]). A sufficiency inquiry obligates a court \u201cto marshal competent facts most favorable to the People and determine whether, as a matter of law, a jury could logically conclude that the People sustained its burden of proof\u2019 <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">A person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree under Penal Law \u00a7 125.15 (1) when he \u201crecklessly causes the death of another person.\u201d Similarly, a person commits assault in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>second degree when he \u201crecklessly causes serious physical injury to another person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 120.05 [4]). The Penal Law defines \u201crecklessly\u201d in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">\u201cA person acts recklessly with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-6\">The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 15.05 [3]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">The mental states of recklessness and criminal negligence share many similarities. Both require that there be a \u201csubstantial and unjustifiable risk\u201d that death or injury will occur; that the defendant engage in some blameworthy conduct contributing to that risk; and that the defendant\u2019s conduct amount to a \u201cgross deviation\u201d from how a reasonable person would act <em>(compare </em>Penal Law \u00a7 15.05 [3] [Recklessly] <em>with </em>Penal Law \u00a7 15.05 [4] [Criminal Negligence]). The only distinction between the two mental states is that recklessness requires that the defendant be \u201caware of\u201d and \u201cconsciously disregard\u201d the risk while criminal negligence is met when the defendant negligently fails to perceive the risk (see <em>People v Boutin, </em>75 NY2d 692, 696 [1990] [explaining that \u201cthe necessary underlying conduct, exclusive of the mental element, is the same\u201d (internal quotation marks, emphasis, brackets and citation omitted)]; <em>People v Montanez, </em>41 NY2d 53, 56 [1976] [\u201cThe defendant\u2019s awareness of the risk determines the degree of culpability\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\"> In the context of automobile accidents involving speeding, we have held that the culpable risk-creating conduct necessary to support a finding of recklessness or criminal negligence generally requires \u201csome additional affirmative act\u201d aside from \u201cdriving faster than the posted speed limit\u201d <em>(People v Cabrera, </em>10 NY3d 370, 377 [2008]). Here, there was ample proof that defendant did more than merely drive faster than the legal limit\u2014 indeed, there was eyewitness testimony that he was traveling at more than double the posted speed limit of 55 miles per hour. Moreover, before the collision, defendant stopped his vehicle in the middle of the unlit road and revved the engine. He then hit the gas pedal and accelerated to an extremely high rate of speed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>before crossing the double line into oncoming traffic. Viewed in the light most favorable to the People, the evidence showed that defendant used a public road as his personal drag strip to showcase the capabilities of his modified sports car. Although the jury acquitted defendant of driving while ability impaired (by alcohol), there was evidence that he had been drinking and smoking marijuana that evening (see <em>People v Loughlin, </em>76 NY2d 804, 807 [1990]). The evidence therefore demonstrated that defendant engaged in conduct exhibiting \u201cthe kind of seriously blameworthy carelessness whose seriousness would he apparent to anyone who shares the community\u2019s general sense of right and wrong\u201d (Cabrera, 10 NY3d at 377 [internal quotation marks, brackets and citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Furthermore, the proof was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that defendant acted recklessly\u2014by consciously disregarding the risk he created\u2014as opposed to negligently failing to perceive that risk. Defendant was familiar with the curve in the road near Adamczyk\u2019s house, having driven by there on a number of prior occasions, and he had been warned twice about speeding into that very section of the road. When defendant first arrived at the party, Adamczyk told defendant in no uncertain terms not to speed by his driveway again. Later, just before the collision, Ligenzowski pleaded with defendant to slow down because they were \u201cabout to make the turn.\u201d Taken together, \u201cthere was sufficient proof for the jury to find that defendant was aware of and consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his actions would cause the death of another\u201d (Pe<em>ople v Heinsohn, </em>61 NY2d 855, 856 [1984]). Consequently, defendant\u2019s convictions for second-degree manslaughter and second-degree assault are supported by legally sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Defendant further contends that he is entitled to a new trial due to evidentiary errors. He claims that the trial court erred by giving an adverse inference charge as opposed to striking that portion of the accident reconstruction expert\u2019s testimony addressing the speed of defendant\u2019s car based on the missing <em>Rosario </em>notes. Belatedly, he asserts that the expert\u2019s testimony regarding the car\u2019s minimum speed was unreliable and should have been stricken because the expert could not produce or replicate the calculations by which he made his speed computations. At trial, however, defendant took a different posture\u2014he asked the trial court to strike all of the expert\u2019s testimony, which included a substantial amount of proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>unrelated to the missing handwritten mathematical notes. Defendant did not, as he does now, single out the testimony pertaining to speed. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by denying defendant\u2019s request to strike the entirety of the expert\u2019s testimony <em>(see People v Martinez, </em>71 NY2d 937, 940 [1988]).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">We have considered defendant\u2019s remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Read, Smith, Pigott, Rivera and Abdus-Salaam concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
