The 2008 consolidated mortgage was recorded pursuant to the 2008 amended commitment and not pursuant to the 2007 commitment. II. The 2008 consolidated mortgage is not a building loan mortgage under Lien Law \u00a7 22 because it was not made pursuant to a building loan contract providing for future advances and expressly requiring use of mortgage proceeds for improvements to real property. <em>(Alden State Bank v Sunrise Bldrs., Inc., </em>48 AD3d 1162; <em>Pawling Sav.

The complex consists of several properties interconnected by pedestrian bridges: the hotel, built in 1924 and closed in 2004, and its separate garage (the hotel property); a 15-story tower constructed in the early 1980s as an addition to the hotel (the tower building); and a building formerly housing a major department store, vacant since the early 1990s (the Addis building). The lender for the redevelopment and numerous mechanic\u2019s lienors dispute the priority of their respective claims to the foreclosure sale proceeds from the auction of the tower building, a matter governed by Lien Law \u00a7 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">In September 2005, defendant GML Tower, LLC (GML Tower) purchased the tower building for $7 million, and GML Syracuse LLC (GML Syracuse) and GML Addis LLC (GML Addis) bought the other two parcels making up the hotel complex for an additional $2.75 million. The predecessor of a now-defunct Illinois-based bank loaned the GML entities $7 million for acquisition of these properties, as evidenced by a promissory note and secured by the purchase-money mortgage in that amount, both dated September 7, 2005. The mortgage, recorded in the Onondaga County Clerk\u2019s office on September 8, 2005, encumbered all three parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">On March 29, 2007, Perfect Provident Fund Ltd., the predecessor of plaintiff Altshuler Shaham Provident Funds, Ltd. (collectively, Altshuler) entered into a \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d (the 2007 loan agreement or the agreement) with GML Tower and its parent company, Ameris Holdings, Inc. (Ameris), whereby Altshuler agreed to loan them $10 million, bifurcated into tranches of $5.5 and $4.5 million. The entire principal amount of the loan was due and payable, with accrued interest at 12% per annum, on March 29, 2010. To secure payment of the amounts owing to Altshuler under the agreement, GML Tower and Ameris undertook to grant Altshuler a \u201cfirst ranking senior [l]ien, mortgage, pledge, charge and security interest\u201d (which the agreement referred to collectively as the security interest) in, among other collateral, the property and improvements made thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">The loan proceeds were to be deposited in a trust account as of the date of the agreement\u2019s execution and delivery (i.e., Mar. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>29, 2007), and released by the trustee on the closing date, April 30, 2007, \u201cfor immediate repayment\u201d to the Illinois-based bank of the outstanding principal amount of the original $7 million dollar acquisition financing (the $5.5 million tranche); and for deposit into another dedicated bank account (the restricted account) to be \u201cheld . . . and disbursed, used and applied solely to finance\u201d improvements of the tower building, based upon constmction progress as determined by an inspector appointed by Altshuler (the $4.5 million tranche). The 2007 loan agreement seems to have contemplated redevelopment of the tower building into residential condominiums and commercial space.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">When the transaction did not close on April 30, 2007, Altshuler entered into a \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d (the MOU) with GML Tower and Ameris \u201c[i]n connection with\u201d the agreement. The MOU, dated May 1, 2007, set closing dates for the $5.5 million and $4.5 million tranches of May 1 and May 15, 2007, respectively. The first of the two tranches timely closed, resulting in transfer of $5.5 million from the trust account to the Illinois-based bank on May 2, 2007. By an \u201cAssignment of Note and Mortgage,\u201d executed April 19, 2007, the bank assigned the September 7, 2005 promissory note and mortgage to Altshuler. Altshuler recorded this instrument in the Onondaga County Clerk\u2019s office on May 3, 2007, along with a \u201cMortgage Extension and Modification Agreement,\u201d dated April 30, 2007, which established $5.5 million as the maximum principal indebtedness secured by the mortgage covering the hotel complex (the 2007 mortgage).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The parties failed to close on the $4.5 million tranche in accordance with the MOU. Instead, on six separate occasions from May 24, 2007 though February 21, 2008, the trustee released monies totaling $2.5 million from the trust account to GML Tower, pursuant to the parties\u2019 joint instructions and advance letters. These disbursements were personally guaranteed by Ameris\u2019s principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Then on March 4, 2008, GML Tower and Ameris entered into \u201cAmendment No. 1\u201d (the 2008 amendment or the amendment) of the 2007 loan agreement with Altshuler. The 2008 amendment changed the improvements to be built and the terms and conditions of the release to GML Tower and Ameris of the remaining funds held in the trust account (defined as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>remaining loan proceeds in the principal sum of $2 million plus accrued interest and less certain outstanding fees and expenses); and provided for the delivery of additional collateral to Altshuler as security for the $10 million loan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To these ends, the 2008 amendment called for construction of residential and commercial rental units in the tower building rather than condominiums; added the Addis building as collateral; and eliminated the restricted account, providing instead for the trustee to release the remaining funds to GML Tower on March 6, 2008, the new closing date, as an unrestricted lump sum. With the disbursement of these funds, the existing promissory note was canceled and replaced and restated by a replacement note (the 2008 note), the guaranties covering the $2.5 million were rescinded, and Ameris\u2019s principal gave a new personal guaranty in the principal sum of $250,000. Additionally, the lien of the mortgage was apparently released with respect to the hotel property owned by GML Syracuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Concomitantly, GML Tower and GML Addis entered into a \u201cMortgage Increase, Modification, and Spreader Agreement\u201d (the 2008 mortgage) with Altshuler on March 4, 2008. The 2008 mortgage extended the reach of the 2007 mortgage to cover the Addis building in addition to the tower building, and increased the principal amount secured from $5.5 to $10 million. The 2008 mortgage was recorded in the Onondaga County Clerk\u2019s office on March 7, 2008. To provide Altshuler with additional collateral, GML Tower and GML Addis also executed an \u201cAssignment of Leases and Rents\u201d with respect to the tower and Addis buildings, dated March 4, 2008 and recorded in the Onondaga County Clerk\u2019s office on March 7, 2008 (the 2008 assignment).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">On December 4, 2008, Altshuler commenced this foreclosure action against Ameris, GML Tower and GML Addis,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and other defendants, including The Hayner Hoyt Corporation (Hayner), Syracuse Merit Electric (Merit) and the Pike Company, Inc. (Pike) (collectively, the mechanic\u2019s lienors). Hayner, Merit and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Pike began work on the tower building on July 16, 2007, January 20, 2008 and September 4, 2007, respectively; and filed notices of mechanic\u2019s liens on October 31, 2008, December 3, 2008, and September 18, 2009, respectively. Altshuler alleged that GML Tower and Ameris were in default under the terms of the 2007 loan agreement, as modified by the 2008 amendment, and the 2008 note, and that GML Tower and GML Addis were in default under the terms of the 2008 mortgage and the 2008 assignment because mechanic\u2019s liens totaling more than $3,755 million had been filed against the tower building, and because they failed to pay real property taxes on the tower and Addis buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Altshuler sought foreclosure of both buildings and recoupment of the full amount of its $10 million loan, together with interest and late charges, and first priority to the proceeds of the foreclosure sales of the two properties. The mechanic\u2019s lienors, for their part, moved or cross-moved for summary judgment, seeking an order that their liens were superior to the 2008 mortgage that Altshuler sought to foreclose. The mechanic\u2019s lienors also contested the priority of liens as amongst themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">In a decision dated May 17, 2010, Supreme Court observed that the parties acknowledged that Lien Law \u00a7 22 subordinates a building loan mortgage made pursuant to an unfiled building loan contract to subsequently filed mechanic\u2019s liens, but disputed whether the 2007 loan agreement was a building loan contract <em>(see </em>28 Misc 3d 475, 478 [Sup Ct, Onondaga County 2010]). The judge ultimately concluded that it was: the loan agreement was made between a lender and an owner of real property; GML Tower and Ameris made an express promise to <em>construct </em>improvements <em>to </em>the property; Altshuler agreed to make periodic advances of $4.5 million to fund these improvements; Altshuler was to be informed of construction progress; and the $10 million loan was to be secured by a mortgage on real property, and \u201ceven label[ed] itself a \u2018construction loan transaction[ ]\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at 479-480).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">The judge additionally rejected Altshuler\u2019s alternative argument that it was at least entitled to priority with respect to the $5.5 million used to refinance the tower building\u2019s acquisition. She concluded that the entire $10 million mortgage was subordinate to the subsequently filed mechanic\u2019s liens, relying on <em>Atlantic Bank of N.Y. v Forrest House Holding Co. </em>(234 AD2d 491, 492 [2d Dept 1996]), and declining to follow <em>Yankee Bank </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number><em>for Fin. &amp; Sav., FSB v Task Assoc., Inc. </em>(731 F Supp 64, 71 n 2 [ND NY 1990]).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Accordingly, Supreme Court granted Hayner\u2019s motion and Merit\u2019s and Pike\u2019s cross motions to the extent they argued their mechanic\u2019s liens were superior to Altshuler\u2019s mortgage. The judge further agreed with Merit that its lien was superior to Hayner\u2019s under Lien Law \u00a7 56 \u201cbecause it was a subcontractor to [Hayner] as general contractor\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 482); and turned down Pike\u2019s argument that \u201cits lien [was] superior to all others pursuant to section 13 [of the Lien Law] because it performed labor\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Altshuler appealed Supreme Court\u2019s ensuing order, entered May 20, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">On April 29, 2011, the Appellate Division affirmed \u201cfor reasons stated in the decision at Supreme Court\u201d (83 AD3d 1563, 1563 [4th Dept 2011]). The Court did not address Altshuler\u2019s argument that the 2007 loan agreement was merely \u201ca preliminary agreement that expired before the mortgage at issue was filed\u201d because this contention was \u201craised for the first time on appeal and could have been obviated or cured by factual showings or legal countersteps in Supreme Court\u201d <em>(id. </em>[internal quotation marks omitted]).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On July 1, 2011, the same panel denied Altshuler\u2019s motion for leave to appeal to us (86 AD3d 934 [4th Dept 2011]).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">On October 26, 2011, Supreme Court issued an agreed-upon \u201cFinal Order for Judgment of Foreclosure and Sale,\u201d which awarded Altshuler a judgment of $10 million; dismissed Altshuler\u2019s causes of action seeking a declaration that its mortgage enjoyed first priority; set out the priority and amounts of the mechanic\u2019s liens; ordered sale of the tower and Addis buildings;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and directed the referee to file his report afterwards. The order also stayed the foreclosure sale of the tower building pending disposition of Altshuler\u2019s appeal. Since Altshuler contested only the priority of rights to the proceeds from the sale, however, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>declined to apply the exception to the finality rule for irreparable injury, and dismissed Altshuler\u2019s appeal on February 9, 2012 (18 NY3d 892 [2012]); on May 3, 2012, we denied reargument (19 NY3d 837 [2012]). In the meantime, Supreme Court, by order signed March 29, 2012, vacated the stay of enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The tower building was sold at public auction on June 6, 2012 for $1,396,633.82, and Supreme Court confirmed the referee\u2019s report on July 12, 2012. Hayner was the purchaser.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Altshuler then again sought leave to appeal, which we granted on October 23, 2012 (19 NY3d 814 [2012]).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Section 22 of the Lien Law requires that a building loan contract, with or without the sale of land and before or simultaneously with the recording of a building loan mortgage made pursuant to it, must be filed in the clerk\u2019s office of the county where land subject to the contract is located, along with a borrower\u2019s affidavit stating the consideration paid or to be paid for the loan, any expenses incurred or to be incurred in connection with the loan, and the net sum available for the construction project. Section 22 also mandates the filing of any subsequent modifications of a building loan contract within 10 days after their execution. Failure to comply with these filing requirements changes the ordinary priority of liens, with a properly filed mechanic\u2019s lien taking priority over the interests of the parties to the contract.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, a construction lender must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>file the building loan contract in order to achieve lien priority, or, put the opposite way, the statute imposes a so-called \u201csubordination penalty\u201d on a lender who does not do this. We have said that the legislature enacted section 22 to permit contractors on construction projects \u201cto learn exactly what sum the loan in fact made available to the owner of the real estate for the project\u201d <em>(Nanuet Natl. Bank v Eckerson </em>Terrace, 47 NY2d 243, 247 [1979] [holding that section 22 subjects a lender\u2019s interest to the subordination penalty when the lender knowingly files a materially false borrower\u2019s statement]).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Section 2 (13) of the Lien Law, defines a \u201cbuilding loan contract\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">\u201ca contract whereby a . . . \u2018lender,\u2019 in consideration of the express promise of an owner to make an improvement[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] upon real property, agrees to make advances to or for the account of such owner to be secured by a mortgage on such real property, whether such advances represent moneys to be loaned or represent moneys to be paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">And a \u201cbuilding loan mortgage\u201d is \u201ca mortgage made pursuant to a building loan contract . . . including] an agreement wherein and whereby a building loan mortgage is consolidated with existing mortgages so as to constitute one lien upon the mortgaged property\u201d (Lien Law \u00a7 2 [14]).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The 2007 loan agreement is a building loan contract as defined under section 2 (13) of the Lien Law: the agreement called for transfer of $4.5 of the $10 million deposited by Altshuler into the trust account to a dedicated bank account of GML Tower/Ameris (the restricted account), to be \u201creleased if, when and as required to finance and pay [for] the construction of\u2019 the improvements to the tower building, \u201csubject to the terms and conditions of\u2019 the construction plans, and these loan proceeds were to be secured by a mortgage. Because the 2007 loan agreement was a building loan contract, Lien Law \u00a7 22 obligated Altshuler to file the agreement in the Onondaga County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Clerk\u2019s office prior to the recording of any mortgage made pursuant thereto, or suffer loss of lien priority. Altshuler never filed the 2007 loan agreement; it recorded the 2007 mortgage on May 3, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Altshuler counters that the 2007 mortgage was not recorded \u201cpursuant [ ]to\u201d the 2007 loan agreement as required by Lien Law \u00a7 22; however, the recorded mortgage states that it is \u201cto secure . . . payment and/or performance of all indebtedness and obligations of [GML Tower] and/or Ameris described in the [2007 loan agreement].\u201d Additionally, the 2007 loan agreement directed that Altshuler\u2019s security interest in the property be \u201cperfected and duly recorded\u201d in Onondaga County, and the agreement defined a security interest to include a mortgage. In short, the 2007 mortgage was made pursuant to the unfiled agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Next, the 2008 amendment is explicitly labeled an \u201camendment\u201d to the 2007 loan agreement, designed to \u201camend the terms and conditions for release of the [Remaining [flunds\u201d to GML Tower and Ameris, and to \u201crevise\u201d the improvement plans in the agreement to fit the new plan to construct rental apartments rather than condominiums. In fact, the 2008 amendment is not a stand-alone document; it is essentially a compilation of edits of various provisions in the 2007 loan agreement, and must be read together with that earlier document in order to be intelligible. Altshuler never filed the 2008 amendment. This was another violation of section 22, which specifies that modifications of building loan contracts must be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Altshuler contends, though, that assuming the 2007 loan agreement is a building loan contract (and we have now held that it is), the 2008 amendment converted the agreement into a standard loan contract, and the 2008 mortgage was recorded pursuant to the amendment, not the agreement. But even if Altshuler is correct that the 2007 loan agreement, as modified by the 2008 amendment, was no longer a building loan contract as defined by Lien Law \u00a7 2 (13)\u2014a question we need not and do not decide\u2014it does not follow that Altshuler was relieved of the obligation to file the amendment. Lien Law \u00a7 22 does not state that modifications to a building loan contract must be filed <em>only </em>so long as the contract, as modified, remains a building loan contract within the meaning of the Lien Law. This makes sense, given that the reason for public filing is to allow any interested contractors, subcontractors and material suppliers to discover the level of financing available for construction so that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>might guide their actions accordingly (see <em>Nanuet, </em>47 NY2d at 247). Further, if the 2007 loan agreement had been filed, as it should have been, Altshuler\u2019s failure to file the 2008 amendment clearly would have violated the statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Altshuler should not benefit from an earlier violation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Finally, we consider whether Altshuler is entitled to priority with respect to the $5.5 million of the loan proceeds used to refinance the existing mortgage, which covered the tower building, the Addis building, and the hotel property. Before this litigation, the <em>Atlantic Bank </em>and <em>Yankee Bank </em>courts considered whether a subordination penalty applies to funds loaned in a building loan contract for financing the purchase of the property on which the improvements are to be made. They reached opposite conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>In <em>Atlantic Bank, </em>a foreclosure action, the plaintiff bank sought summary judgment against the mechanic\u2019s lienor defendants on the ground that its recorded mortgage had priority, at least to the extent of the $2.2 million loan given by it to the borrower for land acquisition. Applying a liberal interpretation, the Appellate Division took inclusion of the phrase \u201ceither with or without the sale of land\u201d in section 22 to \u201cimpl[y] that if a lender fails to comply with the requirements of the Lien Law, <em>its entire mortgage, including that part securing loan proceeds advanced for the purchase of the property, </em>would become subordinate to any subsequently filed mechanic\u2019s liens\u201d (234 AD2d at 492 [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\"><em>Yankee Bank </em>was a foreclosure action that was removed to federal court when the Federal Home Loan Bank Board found the plaintiff bank to be insolvent and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver. The FDIC was consequently effectively substituted for the bank as plaintiff. The subject of the litigation was another building in Syracuse, New York, and the issue before the District Court Judge was the priority of rights to the foreclosure sale proceeds as between the FDIC and the mechanic\u2019s lienor defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The Judge first decided that New York law supplied the rule of decision. In this particular case, the building loan contract between the bank and the developers allowed the bank to advance up to $610,000 for the acquisition of the building, and provided that no additional funds would be released until the developers obtained a surety payment bond. The bank, however, advanced funds beyond $610,000 without the required bond being in place. The mechanic\u2019s lienor defendants argued that this was an unfiled modification of the contract in violation of Lien Law \u00a7 22. The Judge agreed, and so held that the bank\u2019s mortgage would be subordinated to the defendants\u2019 interests. He then turned his attention to the question of the degree of subordination.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The building loan contract apparently earmarked this first advance of $610,000 for acquisition of the building, and the parties do not seem to have disputed that money loaned for this purpose was not subject to the subordination penalty. In this regard, the Judge observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">\u201c[b]y definition a \u2018building loan contract\u2019 and \u2018building loan mortgage\u2019 only operate with respect to money lent for <em>improvements </em>on real property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Therefore, the proceeds from the loan which were lent for the purchase of the property are not subject to the subordination penalty of Lien Law \u00a7 22\u201d (731 F Supp at 71 n 2 [citation omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">In fact, though, the amount of the loan proceeds expended to buy the building was only approximately $250,000. As a result, the dispute between the FDIC and the mechanic\u2019s lienor defendants centered on whether the FDIC had a first priority lien in the foreclosure sale proceeds for $610,000, or the lesser amount actually expended toward purchase of the building. The Judge ruled that the FDIC would enjoy first priority in an amount equivalent to what was actually spent (to be determined by the magistrate)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> rather than the full $610,000 in the first advance, and the mechanic\u2019s lienor defendants would be paid any foreclosure sale proceeds beyond this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">This result is consistent with the language of Lien Law \u00a7\u00a7 22 and 2 (3), (13) and (14), and does not contravene the statute\u2019s purpose, to give contractors and material suppliers notice of how much money a building loan makes available for construction. Section 22 does not state that the <em>entire </em>interest of each party to an unfiled building loan contract is subject to a later-filed notice of lien, and we do not infer such a limitation from the phrase \u201ceither with or without the sale of land,\u201d as did the <em>Atlantic Bank </em>court. As the <em>Yankee Bank </em>court pointed out, the subordination penalty logically applies only to funds loaned to pay for improvements. Here, the 2007 loan agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>allocated $5.5 million of the loan proceeds to pay off the existing purchase-money mortgage. This tranche closed before any monies were advanced for construction, and the 2007 mortgage in this amount was recorded before any contractor began work on the project. The 2008 mortgage, which Altshuler foreclosed in this litigation, simply extended the reach of and increased the principal amount secured by the 2007 mortgage. We therefore conclude that $5.5 million of the loan proceeds, secured by the 2007 and 2008 mortgages, was not subject to the subordination penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Accordingly, the judgment appealed from and the order of the Appellate Division brought up for review should be modified, without costs, in accordance with this opinion and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-9\">.

These GML entities and Ameris eventually defaulted in this litigation, as did another defendant, Ameris\u2019s principal, who had given his personal guaranty for $250,000 when Altshuler transferred the loan proceeds remaining in the trust account (roughly $2 million) to GML Tower and Ameris on March 6, 2008 pursuant to the 2008 amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b447-7\">.

The Court of Appeals, by contrast, generally lacks power to review unpreserved issues even where the Appellate Division has chosen to do so <em>(see Brown v City of New York, </em>60 NY2d 893, 894 [1983]; <em>see also Hecker v State of New York, </em>20 NY3d 1087, 1087 [2013]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b447-8\">.

Although section 22 states that <em>\u201cany </em>subsequent modification\u201d (emphasis added) to a building loan contract must be filed, this language, which also appeared in section 22\u2019s predecessor statute, former Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law \u00a7 21, has always been interpreted to mean any \u201cmaterial\u201d subsequent modification (see <em>Pennsylvania Steel Co. v Title Guar. &amp; Trust Co., </em>193 NY 37, 42 [1908], <em>rearg denied </em>193 NY 682 [1908]). The Appellate Divisions have set out a test for determining when a modification qualifies as material (see <em>HNC Realty Co. v Bay View Towers Apts., </em>64 AD2d 417, 426 [2d Dept 1978] [\u201ca modification of a building loan contract is \u2018material\u2019 if it (1) alters the rights and liabilities otherwise existing between the parties to the agreement or (2) enlarges, restricts or impairs the rights of any third-party beneficiary\u201d]; <em>Howard Sav. Bank v Lefcon Partnership, </em>209 AD2d 473, 475 [2d Dept 1994] [same]). In the absence of precedent from our court, the federal courts have applied the <em>HNC Realty </em>test (see <em>Yankee Bank, </em>731 F Supp at 70 [holding that unfiled modification was material because it restricted or impaired the rights of a third-party beneficiary]; <em>In re Lynch III Props. Corp., </em>125 BR 857, 861 [Bankr ED NY 1991] [holding that the unfiled modification was \u201cnot a material modification . . . within the meaning of section 22 of the New York Lien Law\u201d because \u201c(t)he rights of the mechanics\u2019 lienors, even if they would be third-party beneficiaries, have not been restricted or impaired and they retain all of the rights that exist under the filed Building Loan Agreements\u201d]; <em>but see In re Admiral\u2019s Walk, Inc., </em>134 BR 105, 121 [Bankr WD NY 1991] [criticizing <em>HNC Realty, </em>and suggesting that the underlying facts in cases considering the materiality of a modification have never shown that \u201calteration of rights as between the lender and borrower is . . . alone sufficient to warrant subordination\u2014there must also be some element of impairment of rights of section 22 beneficiaries in order that a modification be so \u2018material\u2019 or \u2018essential\u2019 as to warrant its fifing, on penalty of subordination\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">We do not need to address the proper test for materiality on this appeal. By arguing that the 2008 amendment transformed the fundamental character of the 2007 loan agreement, Altshuler effectively concedes that the amendment worked a material modification under any conceivable test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b453-6\">. The dissent opines that the subordination penalty will \u201clikely . . . prove difficult to enforce\u201d if loan proceeds for property acquisition are excluded from its scope, commenting that \u201cit may be difficult to discern precisely what proportion of a loan was earmarked for acquisition expenses and what portion was actually expended for that purpose,\u201d pointing to the referral to the magistrate in <em>Yankee Bank </em>as an example (dissenting op at 372). First, there does not seem to have been much dispute in <em>Yankee Bank </em>over how much of the loan was actually applied to the building\u2019s purchase price (there was a deed filed in the county clerk\u2019s office, after all). Rather, the record was apparently incomplete on this score because the magistrate had concluded that the rights of the mechanic\u2019s lienor defendants were to be determined with reference to the amount committed by the loan agreement toward acquisition rather than the amount actually spent for that purpose. In this case there is no difference between the amount of the loan \u201cearmarked\u201d and \u201cactually expended\u201d to refinance the loan made to acquire the three properties making up the hotel complex\u2014i.e., $5.5 million. This is probably by far the more common situation. In any event, given that the amount \u201cearmarked\u201d and the amount \u201cactually expended\u201d are identical in this case, we need not resolve and express no opinion as to which would be properly excluded from the scope of the subordination penalty in a case, like <em>Yankee Bank, </em>where there is a difference.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b454-6\">Graffeo, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part).</author>\n<p id=\"A5u\">I join that part of the majority opinion determining that the 2007 Loan Agreement was a building loan contract within the meaning of Lien Law \u00a7 22. However, because I read the plain language of the subordination penalty in this statute to apply to the lender\u2019s \u201cinterest... in the real property\u201d\u2014the total mortgage and not just the portion attributable to construction funds\u2014I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that $5.5 million of the loan proceeds was not subject to the subordination penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">As the majority explains, Lien Law \u00a7 22 establishes a recording requirement relating to a \u201cbuilding loan contract\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">\u201cA <em>building loan contract either with or without the sale of land, and any modification thereof, must </em>be in writing and duly acknowledged, and must contain a true statement under oath, verified by the borrower, showing the consideration paid, or to be paid, for the loan described therein, and showing all other expenses, if any, incurred, or to be incurred in connection therewith, and the net sum available to the borrower for the improvement, and, on or before the date of recording the building loan mortgage made pursuant thereto, to <em>be filed in the office of the clerk of the county in which any part of the land is situated, </em>except that any subsequent modification of any such building loan contract so filed must be filed within ten days after the execution of any such modification\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>As a consequence of the failure to comply with the recording requirement, Lien Law \u00a7 22 imposes what has come to be known as the subordination penalty, providing that if the building loan contract is \u201cnot so filed the interest of each party to such contract in the real property affected thereby, is subject to the lien and claim of a person who shall thereafter file a notice of lien under this chapter.\u201d In other words, even though a lender\u2019s mortgage might have been recorded first, if it was issued pursuant to a building loan contract that was not properly recorded, the lender\u2019s mortgage loses its first-in-time priority and becomes subordinate to subsequently-recorded mechanic\u2019s liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">The recording requirement is intended to benefit contractors, laborers and material suppliers who work on construction projects. Its purpose is \u201cto readily enable a contractor to learn exactly what sum the loan in fact made available to the owner of the real estate for the project\u201d <em>(Nanuet Natl. Bank v Eckerson Terrace, </em>47 NY2d 243, 247 [1979] [inclusion of false information in building loan contract that was recorded triggered subordination penalty]; <em>see also Howard Sav. Bank v Lefcon Partnership, </em>209 AD2d 473, 476 [2d Dept 1994], <em>lv dismissed </em>86 NY2d 837 [1995]), and to preclude lenders and owners from entering into \u201csecret agreements\u201d in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Plaintiff lender argues\u2014and the majority accepts\u2014that Lien Law \u00a7 22 does not require that the subordination penalty apply to the entire mortgage but covers only the portion relating to the advancement of construction funds. It further asserts that, since the purpose of the statute is to protect contractors, laborers and material suppliers, it makes no sense to preclude a lender from claiming priority with respect to the portion of the loan that had nothing to do with construction but related to the initial acquisition of the property. In my view, this argument should be rejected because the plain language of the statute directs that the full mortgage interest\u2014not just the part securing the funds used for construction purposes\u2014is subject to the subordination penalty, as two New York courts had held before the Appellate Division reached the same conclusion in this case <em>(see Atlantic Bank of N.Y. v Forrest House Holding Co., </em>234 AD2d 491 [2d Dept 1996]; <em>HNC Realty Co. v Golan Hgts. Devs., </em>79 Misc 2d 696 [Sup Ct 1974]).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Critically, Lien Law \u00a7 22 begins by indicating that the statute applies to \u201c[a] building loan contract <em>either with or without the sale of land,\u201d </em>thereby contemplating building loan agreements in which money is loaned both to purchase the property and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>construct improvements. Thus, just because some of the funds disbursed relate to the acquisition of the real property to be improved (or, in this case, the refinance of a mortgage previously used to acquire the real property to be improved), this does not prevent a loan agreement that otherwise meets the building loan contract criteria from being subject to the recording rule (as the majority also concludes). It is therefore clear that the legislature understood that there would be contracts like the one here where acquisition funds and construction monies would be addressed in a single loan secured by a mortgage. Nonetheless the subordination penalty that appears later in the statute does not include any language indicating an intent to exclude that portion of a mortgage securing acquisition funds from its scope. Rather, it provides, in broad terms, that <em>\u201cthe interest of each party to such contract in the real property affected thereby, </em>is subject to the lien and claim of a person\u201d who later files a mechanic\u2019s lien (Lien Law \u00a7 22 [emphasis added]). It is the \u201cinterest\u201d of the lender \u201cin the real property\u201d that is subordinated to later-filed mechanic\u2019s liens\u2014 and the lender\u2019s interest in the real property is reflected in the entire mortgage, not merely a portion of it. As the Appellate Division explained in <em>Atlantic Bank,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">\u201cif a lender fails to comply with the requirements of the Lien Law, its entire mortgage, including that part securing loan proceeds advanced for the purchase of the property, would become subordinate to any subsequently filed mechanic\u2019s liens. This interpretation is consistent with the overriding concern that the lender is the party responsible for compliance and that the threat of the loss of priority is an effective deterrent against a lender shirking this responsibility ... To the extent that this outcome may be harsh, it must be understood that we are here dealing not with equitable redress, but with a statutorily imposed penalty\u201d <em>(Atlantic Bank, </em>234 AD2d at 492 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In arguing to the contrary, the lender relies on <em>Yankee Bank for Fin. &amp; Sav., FSB v Task Assoc., Inc. </em>(731 F Supp 64 [ND NY 1990]), a federal district court decision that was issued before the Appellate Division decided <em>Atlantic Bank. </em>Although the majority finds this case to be persuasive, I believe that reliance is misplaced. First, as the majority acknowledges, in <em>Yankee </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number><em>Bank </em>neither party asserted that funds used for acquisition of the building were subject to the subordination penalty so the court was not confronted with the precise issue presented here. Second, without addressing the plain language in the subordination penalty, the District Court held in summary fashion that the lender retained its first priority interest in the foreclosure sale proceeds \u201conly up to that amount actually expended toward the purchase of the . . . building,\u201d with the remainder of its interest subordinated to the mechanic\u2019s lienors (731 F Supp at 71-72). It is evident from a footnote that, rather than interpreting the subordination penalty itself, the court considered only the definitions of \u201cbuilding loan contract\u201d and \u201cbuilding loan mortgage.\u201d Noting (erroneously, in my view) that these definitions relate only to monies advanced for improvements on property, the court reasoned that \u201cthe proceeds from the loan which were lent for the purchase of the property [were] not subject to the subordination penalty\u201d (731 F Supp at 71 n 2). But I believe that the Lien Law takes a more encompassing view. Section 22 makes clear that the subordination penalty applies to a building loan contract, regardless of whether it involves the sale of land, and then indicates it is the lender\u2019s <em>interest in the real property </em>that is subordinated. The lender\u2019s interest in the property is the total mortgage, not just the portion that correlates to the loan of construction funds. I therefore prefer the better-reasoned New York precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Since the statutory language warrants a finding that the entire mortgage is subordinated when a building loan contract is not recorded, both Supreme Court and the Appellate Division properly concluded in this case that the lender\u2019s $10 million mortgage was subordinate to the mechanic\u2019s liens. Although this appears to wipe out any recovery for the lender, the legislature adopted this statutory penalty to dissuade lenders from engaging in the very conduct that occurred here: failing to comply with the building loan contract recording requirement. Here, none of the agreements relating to this loan were recorded: not the Loan Agreement, the Memorandum of Understanding nor Amendment No. 1, which was executed contemporaneously with the 2008 mortgage. And timely filing of documents and amendments is particularly necessary in cases such as this where aspects of the loan fail to close on time and material terms are amended while the project is ongoing\u2014facts that can raise red flags to interested contractors, laborers and material suppliers if revealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>I believe that the rule the majority has fashioned is antithetical to the purpose of the penalty and is likely to prove difficult to enforce. The subordination penalty is triggered when a lender fails to record a building loan contract or amendments thereto, or when information in filed agreements proves to be false. The burden it imposes on lenders is minimal\u2014the statutory requirement is met merely by filing the pertinent documents in the county clerk\u2019s office. One of the purposes behind the recording requirement is to make future contractors, laborers and material suppliers aware of the funds available for construction so that, prior to working on a project, they can make knowledgeable decisions concerning the amount of labor or materials to expend and the type of payment and security terms to demand. When acquisition funds are part of the loan, this necessarily diminishes the amount available to fund improvements on the real property. But if contractors are unaware of the extent to which the loan covers acquisition costs due to the failure to file a building loan contract, they may expend more labor and materials, and on different terms, than would have been the case had they been provided with the accurate information that the statute requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Moreover, if documents are not timely filed prior to the recording of the mortgage, resulting in the terms of the loan not being reflected in the public record, courts will be left to reconstruct the loan agreement between the lender and the building owner after the fact during a foreclosure action or other litigation when there may be disputes concerning the scope of the contract and the intent and effect of various written and oral modifications. This problem is apparent here where the lender\u2019s view concerning the terms of the arrangement\u2014 whether certain documents were superceded or remained in effect\u2014has evolved over the course of litigation and where the defaulting borrower did not participate and clarify the record. The bottom line is that, after a deal has gone south, it may be difficult to discern precisely what proportion of a loan was earmarked for acquisition expenses and what portion was actually expended for that purpose (a dispute of that kind apparently arose in <em>Yankee </em>Bank)\u2014and the courts, as well as the contractors, laborers and material suppliers will be at the mercy of the parties to the loan to resolve the controversy. Timely recording of the proper documents when the loan occurs and prior to the filing of the mortgage obviates this problem. Of course, the subordination penalty will only come into play when that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>has not happened and I fear that the rule the majority adopts today will add to the confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">For all of these reasons, I conclude that the majority\u2019s bifurcation rule unnecessarily complicates the application of the subordination penalty which, as constructed by the legislature, should be straightforward and require nothing more than giving the lender\u2019s mortgage the priority it would have had if it had been recorded after the mechanic\u2019s liens. The legislature appears to have made a considered decision that as between the lender, who could have protected its investment in full merely by timely recording its documents, and the contractors, laborers and material suppliers, who were inappropriately kept in the dark, it is the lender who should bear the loss. It is not for the courts to disturb that decision by creating a limitation on the subordination penalty that does not appear anywhere in the statute. Because the majority does so, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion to the extent that it holds that $5.5 million of the loan proceeds was not subject to the subordination penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Smith, Pigott and Rivera concur with Judge Read; Judge Graffeo dissents in part in an opinion; Judge Abdus-Salaam taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Judgment appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review modified, without costs, in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
