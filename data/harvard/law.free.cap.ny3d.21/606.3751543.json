It obtained from defendant a \u201cnamed perils\u201d policy of property insurance, covering \u201cdirect physical loss ... or damage . . . caused by or resulting from\u201d any of 14 kinds of events. The only peril relevant here is described in the policy as: \u201cVandalism, meaning willful and malicious damage to, or destruction of, the described property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">Armory Plaza, Inc., the owner of the lot next to plaintiffs building, decided to build a new building that would include an underground parking garage. It hired contractors to do the excavation. According to plaintiff, the excavation caused cracks in the walls and foundations of plaintiffs building; the cracks became more pronounced, the building began to settle, and plaintiff feared the building would collapse. Plaintiff complained to the New York City Department of Buildings, which issued a series of violations and \u201cstop work\u201d orders. Plaintiff alleges that the violations resulted in guilty pleas or defaults and fines totaling more than $36,000, but that the stop work orders were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>ignored and the contractors kept working. Plaintiff obtained a temporary restraining order from Supreme Court, directing Armory and its contractors \u201cto cease all construction and/or excavation work.\u201d This order too, plaintiff says, was ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Plaintiff made a claim under its policy which defendant rejected, and plaintiff brought suit in Supreme Court. The case was removed to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, which granted summary judgment for defendant, holding that the alleged conduct of Armory and its contractors was not \u201cvandalism\u201d within the meaning of the policy <em>(Georgitsi Realty, LLC v Penn-Star Ins. Co., </em>2011 WL 4804873, 2011 US Dist LEXIS 116854 [ED NY, Aug. 30, 2011, No. 08-CV-4462 (DLI)(RML)] [Report and Recommendation of Magistrate Judge]; <em>Georgitsi Realty, LLC v Penn-Star Ins. Co., </em>2011 WL 4889251, 2011 US Dist LEXIS 114800 [ED NY, Sept. 30, 2011, No. 08-CV-4462 (DLI)(RML)] [adopting Report and Recommendation]). Plaintiff appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which certified to us the following two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">\u201cFor purposes of construing a property insurance policy covering acts of vandalism, may malicious damage be found to result from an act not directed specifically at the covered property?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">\u201cIf so, what state of mind is required?\u201d <em>(Georgitsi Realty, LLC v Penn-Star Ins. Co., </em>702 F3d 152, 159 [2d Cir 2012]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">We answer the first question yes, and answer the second by saying that the state of mind is the same that would be required to award punitive damages against the alleged vandal: such a conscious and deliberate disregard of the interests of others that the conduct in question may be called willful or wanton.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">On the question of whether an act may be called \u201cvandalism\u201d when it was not directed specifically at the damaged property, the authorities, though sparse, support an affirmative answer, and our own analysis of the question leads us to the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">Our Court has not, apparently, ever addressed the meaning of \u201cvandalism\u201d in an insurance policy. The most relevant New York case is an Appellate Division decision, <em>Cresthill Indus. v Providence Washington Ins. Co. </em>(53 AD2d 488 [2d Dept 1976]). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>The plaintiff in that case had leased part of the ground floor of a warehouse and stored its property there. \u201c[P]ersons described ... as \u2018perpetrators\u2019 apparently broke into the unoccupied third floor of the warehouse, uncoupled the pipes carrying water to the bathroom fixture, carried away the fixtures and left the water running from the severed connections\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 490). The water flowed down to the first floor and damaged plaintiffs property. The damage was held to be covered by an insurance policy applicable to \u201c[v]andalism and malicious mischief, meaning only willful and malicious damage to or destruction of the property covered hereunder\u201d <em>(id.), </em>even though the \u201cperpetrators\u201d did not direct their acts at the plaintiffs property, and presumably never knew that the plaintiff or its property existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">A case closer to this one on its facts is the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in <em>Louisville &amp; Jefferson County Metro. Sewer Dist. v Travelers Ins. Co. </em>(753 F2d 533 [6th Cir 1985]). There, the alleged vandal was one Distler, the owner of a recycling firm that had a contract to store toxic waste. Distler decided to save money by \u201cstoring\u201d the waste in a public sewer. The sewer itself was not property covered under the plaintiff\u2019s insurance policy, but the waste flowed to a sewage treatment plant that was covered. The plaintiff was allowed to recover the damage to the plant under a policy insuring against \u201cvandalism and malicious mischief, meaning only direct loss by willful and malicious damage to or destruction of property\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 534). Distler obviously was not directing his activities at the sewage treatment plant, but that did not prevent recovery. <em>(See also Cole v Country Mut. Ins. Co., 5 </em>Ill App 3d 335, 282 NE2d 216 [1972].)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\"><em>Cresthill </em>and <em>Louisville, </em>insofar as they relate to the Second Circuit\u2019s first question, seem to us indistinguishable from the present case. Defendant relies on <em>Fanberg Realty Corp. v Travelers Cos. </em>(117 AD2d 582 [2d Dept 1986]), but the brief opinion in that case gives it little help. <em>Fanberg </em>did involve vandalism coverage, and damage caused by contractors working on an adjacent building, but it contains no explanation of why the damage was not covered. It may be that the court found the activity of the alleged vandals not to be \u201cmalicious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">We agree with the holdings of the <em>Cresthill </em>and <em>Louisville </em>courts. We see no reason why the term \u201cvandalism\u201d should be limited to acts \u201cdirected specifically at the covered property.\u201d Vandalism, as the term is ordinarily understood, need not imply a specific intent to accomplish any particular result; vandals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>may act simply out of a love of excitement, or an unfocused desire to do harm, or (as in <em>Cresthill, Louisville, </em>and in the present case) out of a desire to enrich oneself without caring about the consequences to others. Nor does it seem relevant that the alleged act of vandalism here\u2014as in <em>Cresthill </em>and Louisville\u2014 did not bring the alleged vandals in direct contact with the covered property. Where damage naturally and foreseeably results from an act of vandalism, a vandalism clause in an insurance policy should cover it.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">It is true that, in some cases of alleged vandalism not directed at particular property, the term does not intuitively seem to fit. Thus, while the acts of the \u201cperpetrators\u201d in <em>Cresthill </em>seem like prototypical acts of vandalism, those in <em>Louisville </em>and the present case do not. The word vandalism, which derives from the sack of Rome by the original Vandals in 455 AD <em>(see </em>IV Edward Gibbon, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire at 246-248 [Folio Society 1986]), more readily brings to mind people who smash and loot than business owners who seek their own profit in disregard of the injury they do to the property of others. We conclude, however, that there is no principled distinction between the two. An excavator who is paid to dig a hole, and does so in conscious disregard of likely damage to the building next door, is, for these purposes, not essentially different from an irresponsible youth who might dig a hole on the same property, with the same effect, whether in search of buried treasure or just for fun.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">We answer yes to the Second Circuit\u2019s first question.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">In common speech, and by the express terms of the policy in suit, vandalism is \u201cmalicious\u201d damage to property. The Second Circuit\u2019s second question asks, in essence, what state of mind amounts to \u201cmalice\u201d for these purposes. We answer by adopting, insofar as it relates to property damage, the formulation we have used in reviewing awards of punitive damages. Conduct is \u201cmalicious\u201d for these purposes when it reflects \u201csuch a conscious and deliberate disregard of the interests of others that [it] may be called wilful or wanton\u201d <em>(Marinaccio v Town of Clarence, </em>20 NY3d 506, 511 [2013], quoting <em>Dupree v Giugliano, </em>20 NY3d 921, 924 [2012]; <em>see also Prozeralik v Capital Cities Communications, </em>82 NY2d 466, 479 [1993]; <em>Carvel Corp. v Noonan, </em>350 F3d 6, 24 [2d Cir 2003]; Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts \u00a7 2 at 9 [5th ed 1984]). This familiar test, we believe, will serve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>to distinguish between acts that may fairly be called vandalism and ordinary tortious conduct. Insurance against vandalism should not be converted into something approaching general coverage for property damage. Insureds who want broader coverage should obtain it and pay an appropriate premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Accordingly, the certified questions should be answered as stated in this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b698-6\">Abdus-Salaam, J. (dissenting in part).</author>\n<p id=\"A8e\">\u201c[Yjandalism is defined as the destruction of property generally, and the same must be willful and malicious\u201d (11 Steven Plitt et al., Couch on Insurance 3d \u00a7 155:92). With this definition in mind, I agree with the majority that an act may constitute \u201cvandalism\u201d within the meaning of an insurance policy even though the act was not directed specifically at the covered property; thus, the first certified question should be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Malice is an essential ingredient of vandalism, as the majority recognizes, but its definition of the necessary \u201cmalicious\u201d state of mind omits a critical component: intent to damage property. Willful and malicious damage to property is the very essence of vandalism, and a vandal\u2019s malicious state of mind cannot be separated from his or her intent to damage or destroy property. Put differently, a perpetrator who acts maliciously but without the intent to damage property does not commit an act of vandalism, as that term is traditionally understood <em>(see id.; </em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 1383 [11th ed 2008]; <em>see also </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary [9th ed 2009], vandalism). In those circumstances, the perpetrator engages in some other malicious act, perhaps one where malice may be proved by showing that the perpetrator evinced \u201csuch a conscious and deliberate disregard of the interests of others that [his or her conduct] may be called wilful or wanton\u201d (majority op at 611 [internal quotations marks omitted]). In the context of insurance coverage for vandalism, however, such a showing should not suffice without evidence that the vandal intended to damage or destroy property, be it the covered property or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Accordingly, I would hold that, to recover under a policy insuring against a loss caused by vandalism, the insured must prove that the damage was caused by a malicious act intended to damage property, even if not the insured\u2019s specific property. Such an evidentiary requirement would better confine vandalism coverage to the bounds contracted for by the parties to an insurance contract, and prevent coverage from extending to willful and malicious acts not properly categorized as vandalism because property damage was not the actor\u2019s primary intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Chief Judge Lippmajnt and Judges Graffeo, Read, Pigott and Rivera concur; Judge Abdus-Salaam dissents in part in an opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Following certification of questions by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and acceptance of the questions by this Court pursuant to section 500.27 of this Court\u2019s Rules of Practice, and after hearing argument by counsel for the parties and consideration of the briefs and the record submitted, certified questions answered in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
