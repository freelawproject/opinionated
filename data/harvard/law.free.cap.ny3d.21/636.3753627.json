The plain language in Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 15 (7) expressly permits apportionment in death benefit claims. <em>(Matter of Belmonte v Snashall, 2 </em>NY3d 560; <em>Matter of De Mayo v Rensselaer Polytech Inst., </em>74 NY2d 459; <em>Matter of Krausa v Totales Debevoise Corp., </em>84 AD3d 1545; <em>Montclair v Ramsdell, </em>107 US 147; <em>United States v Menasche, </em>348 US 528; <em>Williams v Taylor, </em>529 US 362; <em>Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. of City of N.Y. v City of New York, </em>41 NY2d 205; <em>Matter of Bliss v Bliss, </em>66 NY2d 382; <em>Matter of Schwab v Emporium Forestry Co., </em>167 App Div 614; <em>Matter of State Indus.

The apportionment test requires that the prior condition, whether work-related or not, constitute a \u201cdisability in a compensation sense.\u201d <em>(Matter of Krebs v Town of Ithaca, </em>293 AD2d 883, 100 NY2d 501; <em>Matter of Carbonaro v Chinatown Sea Food, </em>55 AD2d 756; <em>Matter of Altobelli v Allinger Temporary Servs., Inc., </em>70 AD3d 1083; <em>Matter of Moore v St. Peter\u2019s Hosp., </em>18 AD3d 1001; <em>Matter of Bruno v Kelly Temp Serv., </em>301 AD2d 730; <em>Matter of Ricci v Riegel &amp; Sons, </em>278 AD2d 673; <em>Matter of Brown v Harden Furniture, </em>34 AD3d 1028; <em>Matter of Bremner v New Venture Gear, </em>31 AD3d 848; <em>Matter of Webb v Cooper Crouse Hinds Co., </em>62 AD3d 57.)

The Appellate Division\u2019s reliance on <em>Matter of Webb v Cooper Crouse Hinds Co. </em>(62 AD3d 57 [2009]) fails to recognize and explain that it had applied the apportionment test in death benefit claims in prior cases. <em>(Matter of Ricci v Riegel &amp; Sons, </em>278 AD2d 673; <em>Matter of Brown v Harden Furniture, </em>34 AD3d 1028.) IV The <em>Webb </em>decision is erroneous as a matter of law because all three grounds provided to deny apportionment are specious and insufficient to extinguish the statutory authority of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>\u00a7 15 (7). <em>(Matter of Webb v Cooper Crouse Hinds Co., </em>62 AD3d 57; <em>Matter of Reagin v Collins, </em>52 AD2d 1010; <em>Matter of Salerno v Board of Educ., Utica City School Dist., </em>35 AD2d 764; <em>Matter of Zechmann v Canisteo Volunteer Fire Dept., </em>85 NY2d 747; <em>Commissioners of State Ins.

At issue on this appeal is whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>apportionment of death benefits between work-related and non-work-related causes\u2014i.e., mandates the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board (the Board) to factor out non-work-related causes of death when making the award. We hold that the statute does not contemplate such apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">In 1993, Antonio Hroncich (Hroncich) was diagnosed with asbestosis and asbestos-related pleural disease resulting from his employment as a plumber\u2019s helper and mechanic at the Consolidated Edison Company of N.Y., Inc. (Con Ed), where he worked from January 6, 1958 until his retirement on February 28, 1993 at the age of 61. The Board subsequently classified Hroncich as permanently partially disabled as of June 4, 1993. Hroncich\u2019s average weekly wages for the prior year were $900, and he was found to have suffered a loss in earning capacity of 37%, or $333 per week. In view of the nature of Hroncich\u2019s disability (a non-schedule permanent partial disability), his compensation benefits were calculated as two thirds of his reduced earning capacity, or $222 per week <em>(see </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 15 [3] [w]).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">In 1999 Hroncich was diagnosed with thyroid cancer, unrelated to his work at Con Ed. The thyroid cancer eventually progressed to Hroncich\u2019s lungs, and he was admitted to the hospital on an emergency basis on August 1, 2007. He died on September 2, 2007.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On October 30, 2007, Hroncich\u2019s widow, Gaudenzia (claimant), filed a claim with the Board for death benefits from Con Ed, which is a self-insured employer. Con Ed\u2019s third-party administrator, Sedgwick Claims Management Services, Inc., controverted the claim, questioning causation and noting the absence of prima facie medical evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">In deposition testimony subsequently submitted to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law Judge (WCLJ), claimant\u2019s expert, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>physician certified as an internist and a specialist in pulmonary medicine, testified that Hroncich died of respiratory failure, and \u201cif he didn\u2019t have the asbestosis[,] he would have eventually died of the . . . thyroid [cancer,] but he would have lived probably a little bit longer.\u201d When asked to opine as to the cause of Hroncich\u2019s death within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, the expert attributed 20% to the work-related pulmonary disease and 80% to thyroid cancer. He called this \u201can estimate\u201d that was, in his view, \u201ca valid one,\u201d although he acknowledged, on cross-examination, that \u201c[i]t could be 75/25\u201d or, when pressed, even \u201c85/15 or 90/10.\u201d In essence, then, what the expert said is that Hroncich\u2019s thyroid cancer, once it invaded his lungs, triggered inevitable death that likely occurred earlier than it would have otherwise because his lungs were compromised by preexisting occupational lung diseases.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Con Ed did not submit any medical evidence to the WCLJ. But Con Ed argued that Hroncich\u2019s asbestosis and asbestos-related pleural disease played no role in his death because when he was diagnosed with these maladies in 1993 and 1994, his pulmonary function was normal; no subsequent pulmonary function testing was performed, and so the record lacked evidence of weakened lungs; and claimant\u2019s expert \u201ccould not state that [Hroncich] would have lived even one minute longer had he not been diagnosed with the work-related [diseases].\u201d In the event causation was nonetheless found, Con Ed took the position that the award should recognize the overwhelming role of the non-work-related cause of Hroncich\u2019s death; namely, thyroid cancer. Conceding that the law regarding apportionment in this context was \u201cunsettled,\u201d Con Ed nonetheless urged that a reduced award was \u201cwarranted\u201d by the minimal and speculative contribution of work-related pulmonary diseases to Hroncich\u2019s demise.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">In a decision filed May 6, 2009, the WCLJ found that Hroncich\u2019s death was \u201ccausally related to his established occupational lung disease,\u201d crediting claimant\u2019s expert. And citing <em>Matter of Webb v Cooper Crouse Hinds Co. </em>(62 AD3d 57 [3d Dept 2009]), the WCLJ rejected apportionment. In <em>Webb, </em>which was handed down only a few months before the WCLJ\u2019s decision, the Appellate Division endorsed the Board\u2019s view, expressed in its decision in <em>Buffalo Forge Co. </em>(2005 WL 1794390, *2-5, 2005 NY Wrk Comp LEXIS 6235, *4-14 [WCB No. 8020 5320, July 25, 2005]), that \u201capportionment is not available between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>work-related and non-work-related causes of death\u201d when determining death benefits (62 AD3d at 60).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Although Hroncich\u2019s average weekly wages at the time of the compensable injury<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in 1993 were $900, the statutory maximum for a death occurring after July 1, 2007 is $750 <em>(see </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 16 [5]). The percentage used to calculate death benefits depends upon the identity and number of survivors entitled to payment, as well as date of death. Here, the award was calculated at two thirds of the maximum weekly wages, or $500.25, because Hroncich was survived by his spouse and no dependent children, and he died after January 1, 1978 <em>(see </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 16 [1-c]). The award was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>then reduced by $90.69 to reflect the required offset for claimant\u2019s survivors insurance benefits under Social Security <em>(see id.). </em>Accordingly, by notice of decision filed January 26, 2010, the WCLJ made a continuing award to claimant in the amount of $409.31 per week.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">In a decision filed December 18, 2009, the Board affirmed the WCLJ\u2019s decision. In particular, the Board approved the WCLJ\u2019s reliance on <em>Webb, </em>remarking that \u201c[t]here is no apportionment of causation in a consequential death claim so long as the underlying compensable condition is a cause of death.\u201d Con Ed sought review in the Appellate Division, Third Department, which is vested with exclusive jurisdiction to review Board decisions <em>(see </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 23).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">By decision dated January 19, 2012, the Appellate Division affirmed, ruling that \u201cinasmuch as the record concededly contains substantial evidence supporting the Board\u2019s determination that decedent\u2019s occupational illness contributed to his death,[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] claimant is entitled to death benefits without apportionment\u201d (91 AD3d 1134, 1134 [3d Dept 2012]). The court observed that in <em>Webb </em>it had \u201cexplicitly [held] that apportionment is not available between work-related and non-work-related causes of death\u201d <em>(id. </em>[internal quotation marks and citation omitted]). Moreover, the Appellate Division was \u201cnot persuaded by . . . arguments urging [it] to re-examine and overrule <em>Webb,\u201d </em>cautioning, as it also had in <em>Webb, </em>\u201cthat to the extent prior cases may contain language that could be read to suggest that apportionment may be appropriate under certain circumstances, those cases should not be followed\u201d <em>(id.). </em>On September 6, 2012, we granted Con Ed leave to appeal (19 NY3d 810 [2012]). We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">Con Ed relies on Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 15 (7), and, secondarily, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 10 to argue for apportionment of death benefits between work-related and non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>work-related causes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Without apportionment, Con Ed maintains, a deceased employee\u2019s survivors receive a \u201cwindfall\u201d at the employer\u2019s expense, which is contrary to the \u201cplain language and legislative intent expressed in Section 15 (7) [and] the fundamental principle embedded in the [statute], expressed [also] in Section 10, that liability be apportioned in proportion to causation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Section 15, captioned \u201cSchedule in case of disability,\u201d governs compensation benefits for employees disabled in the course of employment. Section 15 (7), in turn, applies to a particular category of injured employees\u2014i.e., previously disabled employees who suffer a subsequent work-related injury. This provision states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">\u201cPrevious disability.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] The fact that an employee has suffered previous disability or received compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>therefor shall not preclude him from compensation for a later injury nor preclude compensation for death resulting therefrom; but in determining compensation for the later injury or death his average weekly wages shall be such sum as will reasonably represent his earning capacity at the time of the later injury, provided, however, that an employee who is suffering from a previous disability shall not receive compensation for a later injury in excess of the compensation allowed for such injury when considered by itself and not in conjunction with the previous disability except as hereinafter provided in [Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 15 (8); i.e., the Special Fund]\u201d (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 15 [7]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Thus, the three clauses in section 15 (7) specify that (1) a previous disability does not disqualify an employee from receiving compensation benefits for a later work-related injury, or disqualify his survivors from receiving a death benefit where the later injury results in the employee\u2019s demise; (2) the measure of compensation or death benefits in this situation is the employee\u2019s earning capacity at the time of the later work-related injury, which would necessarily reflect any diminished earning capacity due to the previous disability; and (3) generally, the employee shall not receive compensation benefits in excess of those allowed for the later work-related injury considered by itself, which insures that the award is based solely on the diminished earning capacity attributable to the later injury rather than from all disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">In short, the only death benefits that section 15 (7) mentions are keyed to the situation where death results from a later work-related injury to an employee suffering at the time from a previous disability. But this is not the case here: Hroncich did not suffer from a previous disability at the time of his <em>only </em>work-related injury, the disablement on June 4, 1993. And in any event, section 15 (7) says nothing about apportionment of death benefits between work-related and non-work-related causes of death. Con Ed hangs its hat on the second clause in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>section 15 (7), which states that earning capacity at the time of a later work-related injury resulting in death constitutes the average weekly wages. But this requirement cannot apply to this case because, again, Hroncich did not suffer a later work-related injury. Section 15 (7) is simply not implicated where, as here, an employee does not suffer a disability in a compensation sense prior to a work-related injury or disablement.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Con Ed also looks to Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 10, captioned \u201cLiability for compensation,\u201d for support; specifically, that statute\u2019s direction that \u201c[e]very employer subject to [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law] shall . . . secure compensation to his employees and pay or provide compensation for their disability or death from injury arising out of and in the course of the employment without regard to fault as a cause of the injury\u201d (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 10 [1]). Con Ed\u2019s point, as we understand it, is that by stating that employers must compensate employees for employment-related disability or death, this provision implicitly endorses apportionment by suggesting that non-work-related causes should be factored out of any award. This reads quite a bit into what appears to be simply a general statement of the principle underlying workers\u2019 compensation\u2014 i.e., every employer is responsible for insuring its employees against losses from injuries or death occurring in the course and scope of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 16, which governs eligibility for and the amount of death benefits, provides that \u201c[i]f the injury causes death, the compensation shall be known as a death benefit and shall be payable in the amount and to or for the benefit of\u201d certain listed survivors (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 16). Concomitantly, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 39, which authorizes death benefits for employees suffering from an occupational disease, the type of injury for which Hroncich received compensation benefits, states that \u201c[i]f an employee . . . dies and his . . . death is caused by one of the diseases mentioned in [Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 3 (2)], ... his dependents shall be entitled to compensation . . . for his death in accordance with the provisions of articles two [Compensation] and three [Occupational Diseases] of this chapter.\u201d And a claim for death benefits by an employee\u2019s survivors is entirely separate from the employee\u2019s claim for compensation benefits (see <em>Matter of Zechmann v Canisteo Volunteer Fire Dept., </em>85 NY2d 747, 753 [1995]).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Importantly, there is no language in section 16 to suggest that the Board should apportion death benefits to work-related and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>non-work-related causes when fashioning an award. Presumably, if the legislature had wanted this to be the case, it would have said so. Instead, however, the legislature made employers joint-and-several insurers of their injured employees\u2019 lives, subject to a prescribed schedule of payments. The death benefit is not about replacing lost wages, but rather compensates for a life lost at least partly because of work-related injury or disease <em>(see e.g. </em>Bill Jacket, L 1990, ch 296 [authorizing $50,000 in death benefits to non-dependent survivors]).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Of course, it is also true that when the legislature first enacted the operative language of section 16 in the early twentieth century, it essentially intended to ameliorate the condition of survivors of workers killed in industrial accidents, something that unfortunately happened with some frequency at the time. These lawmakers may not have had in mind a situation where death benefits become payable for a death caused, in every practical sense, by a non-work-related disease manifest many years beyond the usual retirement age, as happened here. And Con Ed argues that it is unreasonable for an employer to be responsible for paying the entire award under these circumstances. But the fact that section 15 incorporates certain apportionment principles for determining compensation (wage replacement) benefits, which, by their nature, are linked to loss of earning capacity, does not provide a basis for us to interpret section 16 to require apportionment of death benefits in the absence of any language in that provision even arguably commanding this result. As the Board points out, to the extent section 16 is thereby unduly harsh on employers, Con Ed\u2019s plea for redress is properly made to the legislature, not the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-9\">. Hroncich received $222 per week in workers\u2019 compensation until the date of his death because permanent partial disability wage replacement benefits were lifetime benefits at the time of his disablement. As amended in 2007, however, section 15 (3) (w) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law now limits these benefits, with duration depending upon the injury\u2019s severity; for example, compensation payable for a permanent partial disability may not exceed 275 weeks in cases, like Hroncich\u2019s, where the loss of wage-earning capacity is greater than 30 but not more than 40 percent <em>(see </em>L 2007, ch 6, \u00a74).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b726-10\">.

The claimant in <em>Webb </em>was found to have a permanent partial disability, apportioned 75% to an occupational lung disease and 25% to noncompensable causes. The Board determined that the claimant\u2019s subsequent death was causally related to the lung disease, and the Appellate Division held that substantial evidence supported this finding. The court then went on to reject the employer\u2019s argument that the claimant\u2019s death benefits should be apportioned in the same manner as his lifetime benefits\u2014i.e., 75% to his occupational disease and 25% to unrelated causes. In so ruling, the Appellate Division relied on the inherent difference between compensation and death benefits, and the absence of any indication in Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 16 that death benefits were to be apportioned in the same manner as compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The court further acknowledged in <em>Webb </em>that certain dictum in <em>Matter of Rados v Woodlawn Water Supply Dist. </em>(31 AD2d 879, 880 [3d Dept 1969] [i.e., \u201cthe fact that the first and last (heart) attacks were the only compensable accidents would not automatically prevent apportionment also against the nonoccupational injuries\u201d]), was susceptible to being read \u201cto suggest that. . . apportionment [between work-related and non-work-related causes of death] may be appropriate under certain circumstances,\u201d and added that \u201c[t]o the extent that [Radios] sets forth a rule that is contrary to our decision herein, it should no longer be followed\u201d <em>(Webb, </em>62 AD3d at 60 n). The Board itself explained in <em>Buffalo Forge </em>that it had approved apportionment between compensable and noncompensable causes of death a few times in reliance on the <em>Rados </em>dictum, but ultimately concluded there was no statutory or case law authority to support this practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b728-7\">. For purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, \u201cinjury\u201d and \u201cpersonal injury\u201d mean \u201conly accidental injuries arising out of and in the course of employment and such disease or infection as may naturally and unavoidably result therefrom\u201d (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 2 [7]). Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 2 (15) defines an \u201coccupational disease\u201d as \u201ca disease resulting from the nature of employment and contracted therein,\u201d and section 3 (2) (l)-(30) lists occupational diseases. Both asbestosis and asbestos-related pleural disease are considered occupational diseases where they arise from the distinctive nature of the occupation. Disablement from an occupational disease is treated as the happening of an accident within the meaning of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law <em>(see </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 38; <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 39).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b729-9\">. In addition to weekly death benefits, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 16 provides for funeral expenses <em>(see </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 16 [1]). In this case, the WCLJ, by notice of decision filed April 19, 2010, awarded claimant funeral expenses in the amount of $6,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b729-10\">.

Respondent Special Disability Fund, Special Funds Conservation Committee (the Special Fund) and amicus City of New York (the City) likewise argue that Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 15 (7) explicitly provides for apportionment of death benefits. The City is the largest self insurer of workers\u2019 compensation benefits in the State of New York. The Special Fund is liable for reimbursement of Con Ed for death benefits paid to claimant exceeding the statutory retention period, or 104 weeks in view of Hroncich\u2019s date of disablement of June 4, 1993 (see Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 15 [8] [ee]). The 2007 reforms to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law phase out the Special Fund, closing it down to claims for an injury or illness with a date of accident or disablement on or after July 1, 2007, and disallowing written or evidentiary submissions made after July 1, 2010 in support of pending reimbursement claims (see L 2007, ch 6, \u00a7 76, amending Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 15 [8] [h]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b730-8\">.

(concurring).</author>\n<p id=\"Ab_\">I agree with my colleagues that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law statute, by its plain terms, does not provide for an apportionment of death benefits between work-related and non-worked-related causes. And while I also agree that Con Ed\u2019s challenge to the finding of causation was not preserved for our review <em>(see </em>majority op at 643 n 6), had that issue been preserved, I would find that the statute also does not permit an apportionment to support the claim that the death was causally related to the work-related injury. Thus, in my view, the claimant is not entitled to death benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 16 provides for an award of compensation for death benefits if the work-related injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number><em>\u201ccauses death\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The term \u201cdeath\u201d is defined by statute as follows: \u201c \u2018Death\u2019 when mentioned as a basis for the right to compensation means only death resulting from <em>such injury\u201d </em>(Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 2 [8] [emphasis added]). Appellate courts have concluded that this means the decedent\u2019s work-related injury \u201cneed not be the sole or even the most direct cause of death, provided that the claimant demonstrates that the compensable illness [or injury] was <em>a contributing factor </em>in the decedent\u2019s demise\u201d <em>(Matter of Imbriani v Berkar Knitting Mills, </em>277 AD2d 727, 730 [3d Dept 2000] [emphasis added]; <em>see also Matter of Brown v Clifton Recycling, </em>1 AD3d 735 [3d Dept 2003]). This Court has yet to consider whether the appellate courts\u2019 interpretation of the statute is correct and if so, how far it should be taken, i.e. whether a work-related injury that is only a minor \u201ccontributing factor\u201d to the decedent\u2019s death is compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">A review of the case law, including this one, puts that question into serious doubt. Under a broad reading of the appellate courts\u2019 precedent, <em>any </em>tangential work-related injury or disease that contributes in <em>any way </em>to the death <em>may </em>result in a death benefit. This leads to two problems. First, it lends itself to arbitrary determinations as to whether a particular death has a \u201ccausally related\u201d antecedent. Second, there is no statutory basis for allowing \u201capportionment\u201d in Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 16 with respect to the cause of death, and at the same time denying apportionment when fashioning an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Here, there is no dispute that the direct and primary cause of the decedent\u2019s death was thyroid cancer, a condition totally \u201cunrelated to his work at Con Ed\u201d (majority op at 640). The work-related injury may have hastened the decedent\u2019s death, but that\u2019s all. The statute doesn\u2019t provide for an award in such a case. No apportionment should mean just that\u2014as to both the cause and, as the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board argues here, the award of benefits. The legislature didn\u2019t write the statute that way; why should the courts rewrite it?</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Judges Graffeo, Smith, Pigott, Rivera and Abdus-Salaam concur with Judge Read; Judge Pigott in a separate concurring opinion in which Judge Smith concurs; Chief Judge Lippman taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
