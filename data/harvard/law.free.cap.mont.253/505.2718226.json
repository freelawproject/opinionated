On August 15, 1991, the District Court dissolved her marriage, distributed the marital estate, and assigned all marital debts to Daniel, including all attorney fees. The District Court provided for the custody and support of the children, and awarded Bonita maintenance of $350 per month, plus payment of tuition and expenses for the next five years or until she completed her degree program and obtained full-time employment. On September 5, 1991, pursuant to Dan\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration, the District Court entered Amended Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and a Final Decree. The Amended Findings increased the temporary maintenance to a specific award of $600, deleted the provision for payment of \u201cfees and educational expenses,\u201d and deleted reference to maintenance for up to five years. From that judgment, Dan appeals. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>The issues are:</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">1. Did the District Court err when it adopted Bonita\u2019s plan of joint custody?</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">2. Did the District Court err when it awarded Bonita $600 per month for maintenance?</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">3. Did the District Court err when it divided the marital property and debt?</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">4. Did the District Court err when it granted Bonita\u2019s request for attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Daniel and Bonita Tahija were married on July 19, 1980. Their marriage was dissolved on August 15, 1991. Both are 37 years old. They have two children, whose ages at the time of the dissolution were six and eight. Bonita has a high school education, but was unemployed outside the home during most of the marriage. She is currently unemployed and living in subsidized housing with the two children. Dan earns $41,460 a year as an accountant at Montana Power. Dan and Bonita received $4000 each from the sale of their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">In its amended findings of fact and conclusions of law, the District Court adopted a joint custody plan, awarded $607 per month to Bonita for child support, and required Dan to maintain health insurance coverage for the children. It assigned the marital debt of $7308 to Dan, divided the marital property equally, and awarded temporary maintenance in the amount of $600 per month to Bonita.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">Did the District Court err when it adopted Bonita\u2019s plan of joint custody?</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">\u201cOn appeal, this Corut will not disturb a visitation schedule ordered by the District Court when it is supported by substantial credible evidence.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of B.H.J. </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 461, 463, 760 P.2d 753, 754. Dan contends that no evidence supports the District Corut\u2019s Finding of Fact No. 15 which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-13\">The following plan for the promotion of the joint custody agreement and visitation schedule, has been adopted, and <em>accepted by the parties, </em>as being in the best interests of the minor children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbT\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-16\">The trial transcript confirms that both parties believed at the hearing that a joint custody plan could be agreed upon. However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>parties proposed findings of fact, and the record, indicate that a plan was not agreed upon. The District Court adopted Bonita\u2019s proposed plan which varies from Dan\u2019s proposed plan by providing less visitation than Dan requested. While the District Court erred in finding that the visitation plan was adopted and accepted by both parties, its adoption of Bonita\u2019s proposed plan was within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Dan cites no authority for his contention that the court must state reasons for adopting one proposed plan over another. Rule 52(a), M.R.Civ.R, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">The court may require any party to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law for the court\u2019s consideration and the court may adopt any such proposed findings or conclusions so long as they are supported by the evidence and law of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Dan contends that the findings were entered without regard to \u201cmany of the basic issues raised by him, without reading his proposed Findings or in direct contravention of the evidence.\u201d The standard of review for the adoption of a party\u2019s proposed findings is the same as findings prepared by the court. <em>In re Marriage of Jacobson </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 458, 743 P.2d 1025. \u201cError occurs only when the proposed findings are relied upon to the exclusion of proper consideration of the facts and the failure to exercise independent judgment.\u201d <em>Jacobson, </em>743 P.2d at 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Dan did not object to the custody plan in his motion for reconsideration. In fact, Dan stated in his brief supporting the motion for reconsideration that he had no objection to the arrangement for custody which had been in effect since the parties separated on an informal basis. Failure to object may have led the District Court to believe that Dan found the court\u2019s previous plan acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">At the hearing, Dan recognized that Bonita\u2019s plan varied from his proposed plan, but acknowledged that he has had no trouble with access to the children, and that a mutual agreement on visitation could occur without the court imposing its schedule. In addition, at the hearing the parties acknowledged that the visitation plan was a formula plan and was not set in stone. The court also noted that if the parties could not work out a plan it would set a plan. The plan itself recognizes that the schedule is flexible.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">We conclude that the lower court did address the issues raised by Dan in his motion for reconsideration. The District Court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence, and are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">Dan also contends that adoption of the plan has reduced his access to his children by several weeks per year and is contrary to the best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>interests of the children. While it is true that the adopted plan did not grant the additional weeks of visitation that Dan requested, the plan is still reasonable and within the District Court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">This Court has held that a visitation schedule providing visitation on alternate weekends, alternate holidays, one evening per week, and two weeks in the summer is reasonable. <em>In re Marriage of Alt </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 327, 708 P.2d 258. Here, the District Court\u2019s visitation schedule is more generous than the one approved in that case, and Dan has failed to show that the adopted visitation schedule is unreasonable. The joint custody plan is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Did the District Court err when it awarded Bonita $600 per month for maintenance?</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Maintenance is within the broad discretion of the District Court and may not be set aside unless the court\u2019s clear err constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>See In re Marriage of Schenk </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 310, 692 P.2d 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Under \u00a7 40-4-203(1), MCA, a court may award maintenance only if it finds that the spouse seeking maintenance \u201c(a) lacks sufficient property to provide for his reasonable needs; and (b) is unable to support himself through appropriate employment....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">Section 40-4-203(2), MCA, provides that determining an award\u2019s amount and length entails considering all relevant facts, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">(a) the financial resources of the party seeking maintenance, including marital property apportioned to him, and his ability to meet his needs independently, including the extent to which a provision for support of a child living with the party includes a sum for that party as custodian;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-11\">(b) the time necessary to acquire sufficient education or training to enable the party seeking maintenance to find appropriate employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-12\">(c) the standard of living established during the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-13\">(d) the duration of the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-14\">(e) the age and the physical and emotional condition of the spouse seeking maintenance; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-15\">(f) the ability of the spouse from whom maintenance is sought to meet his needs while meeting those of the spouse seeking maintenance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-16\">The District Court concluded that $600 per month maintenance is \u201cappropriate given that [Bonita] lacks sufficient property to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>for her reasonable needs and is currently unable to support herself through appropriate employment while caring for her minor children.\u201d Apart from the proceeds from the sale of the home, all the property Bonita received was non-income producing. <em>See Marriage of Edwards </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 512, 699 P.2d 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">This Court has held that \u201cappropriate employment\u201d must be determined with relation to the standard of living achieved by the parties during the marriage. <em>In re Marriage of Madson </em>(1978), 180 Mont. 220, 224-25, 590 P.2d 110, 112. The District Court found that the parties enjoyed a high standard of living. Additionally, the District Court found that Dan \u201chas a substantially higher expectation of acquiring future income from present employment when compared to [Bonita\u2019s] present opportunity to acquire future income.\u201d Regardless of whether they enjoyed a high or \u201ccomfortable\u201d standard of living, as Dan contends, it is apparent that Bonita is in need of temporary maintenance so that she may acquire an education which will enable her to find appropriate employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Dan asserts that the District Court ignored \u00a7 40-4-203(2)(f), MCA, requiring consideration of the obligor spouse\u2019s ability to meet his own needs and pay maintenance. We stated in <em>In re Cole </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 352, 358, 763 P.2d 39, 43, that the husband\u2019s ability to pay is not a deciding factor in determining the propriety of a maintenance award. While it is an element, it is not always the determining factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">However, the District Court properly considered Dan\u2019s ability to pay. Dan\u2019s take home pay, minus monthly expenses, maintenance, and child support leaves him with a small monthly surplus. This does not include a calculation of how maintenance payments will benefit Dan for income tax purposes. Thus, the District Court did not \u201cfail utterly to consider Dan\u2019s ability to pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">A review of the record confirms that the District Court\u2019s order of $600 maintenance per month is supported by substantial credible evidence and by proper consideration of the statutory factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Additionally, Dan maintains that there is no evidence in the record to support an award for five years when Bonita only requested four years. While we find that evidence in the record supports temporary maintenance for five years as ordered in the District Court\u2019s initial findings of fact and conclusions of law on August 15,1991, it appears that the District Court\u2019s amended findings of fact and conclusions of law set no specific time period for temporary maintenance. Therefore, we remand this case to the District Court for the purpose of establishing a specific period for temporary maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>in.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Did the District Court err when it divided the marital property and debt?</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The standard of review for division of marital property is whether the District Court abused its discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Skinner </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 299, 304, 783 P.2d 1350, 1353.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Dan was ordered to pay marital debts in the amount of $7308. He contends that proceeds from the sale of the parties\u2019 home should have been applied to satisfy that debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The District Court\u2019s consideration of those statutory factors provided for in \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA, is illustrated in the following portion of its memorandum explaining its amended order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">The award of maintenance and division of assets in this matter are properly considered together, maintenance of $600.00 per month and an award of an equitable division of the property has been made. The Court is fully aware that the assets of the marriage have been divided equally while the debts of the marriage are to be the sole responsibility of the Respondent. The proportion of the division of the marital estate in this instance recognizes the Respondent\u2019s greater earning capacity and opportunity to acquire future income and assets. Section 40-4-202, M.C.A., requires the Court to consider the opportunity of the parties for future acquisition of capital assets and income. \u201cOpportunity\u201d is a broad word that includes the capacity of the parties to earn future income ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-9\">It is also the opinion of this Court that Petitioner has made significant and substantial contributions to the property acquired during marriage in her capacity as housewife and mother and that <em>the temporary award of maintenance is in lieu of a larger portion of the marital estate. </em>It is also noted that Petitioner\u2019s contributions as a homemaker have been a substantial factor in facilitating the maintenance of the home. [Italics added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">After reviewing the record we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in the division of the property and debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">Did the District Court err when it granted Bonita\u2019s request for attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b533-13\">Abuse of discretion is the standard of review for an award of attorney fees. <em>Jacobson, </em>743 P.2d at 1029. Section 40-4-110, MCA, allows a court to award reasonable attorney fees \u201cafter considering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>the financial resources of both parties.\u201d The District Court properly considered the financial resources and burdens of both parties when it determined that Bonita was entitled to attorney fees. We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it awarded attorney fees to Bonita.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Finally, Dan contends, and Bonita agrees, that his contributions to the Montana Power Benefit Accounts which were made prior to the parties\u2019 marriage should not have been divided as part of the marital estate. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">We affirm the judgment of the District Court with the exception of its allocation of the benefit accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">This case is remanded to the District Court for determination of the proper division of the benefit accounts, determination of the maximum duration of maintenance, and the entry of judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b534-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES WEBER, HUNT and McDonough concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
