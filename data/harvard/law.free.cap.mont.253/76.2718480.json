Welch suffered a compensable injury arising out of the course and scope of his employment on April 27, 1989. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-17\">The sole issue is whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in concluding that claimant sustained a compensable injury pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-18\">Glenn E. Welch (Welch) was employed as a driller by American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Mine Services, Inc. at a mine near Nye, Montana. His job required using heavy power drills to bore holes for mining purposes and, during some shifts, extensive walking and standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\">State and federal regulations require mine employees such as Welch to wear either steel-toed or metatarsal safety boots. A steel-toed safety boot has a steel or fiberglass cap which covers just the toes. A metatarsal boot has a steel or fiberglass toe covering which extends over the top of the foot and leather uppers which cover the ankles.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Sometime before April 27, 1989, Welch requested a new pair of steel-toed safety boots from American Mine Services, which provides free boots to its mine workers. The boots which arrived April 27,1989, were the metatarsal type. Welch wore them to work that day. He states that the boots were a snug fit, but he expected them to loosen up with wear. Throughout his twenty-five year career working in the mines, Welch had broken in many new boots, finding that normally they loosened up within a few hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Toward the end of an active shift on April 27, 1989, Welch noticed that his feet were beginning to get sore and his new boots were still a snug fit. Upon removing his boots at the end of the shift, Welch noticed red sores the size of a thumbnail on both the third and fourth toes of his right foot. The sores were open and draining.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Welch had difficulty sleeping the night of April 27 because of burning and pain in his foot. He treated the sores numerous times with alcohol and later with Neosporine, an antifungal antibiotic. They continued to drain throughout the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Welch again attempted to wear the new boots to work the next day, but his foot was extremely sore so he wore his old work boots which were looser and roomier and did not irritate his toes. Welch worked an entire shift on April 28, and thereafter was laid off due to a reduction in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Welch sought medical attention for his foot on May 1, 1989 when he called his family physician, Dr. Robert Flaherty. Dr. Flaherty was unable to see him until May 5, at which time Welch explained that he had worn new boots a week previously that rubbed his toes.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">During this visit, Welch informed Dr. Flaherty that he had been soaking his foot and trying to reduce the amount of time he spent on his feet. Dr. Flaherty asked Welch if he had diabetes. After Welch replied in the negative, Dr. Flaherty diagnosed Welch\u2019s condition as an \u201cabscess and cellulitis of the right fourth toe.\u201d The doctor then prescribed further soakings and an antibiotic. In his deposition, Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Flaherty opined that Welch\u2019s toe became infected after the new boots rubbed the skin off his toes.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Dr. Flaherty examined and treated Welch on May 8, 10, and 12, 1989; on May 15, 1989, Welch was admitted to Bozeman Deaconess Hospital. At this time, Dr. Flaherty referred Welch to Dr. Lowell Anderson, an orthopedic surgeon, because he thought the bone of Welch\u2019s right foot might be affected. During Welch\u2019s stay at Deaconess, his right fourth toe was amputated. Dr. Anderson\u2019s post-surgery diagnosis was deep foot infection probably complicated by diabetes. Welch was released, but was hospitalized again in March of 1990 because of abscess and infection to the foot. Welch was hospitalized subsequently in October of 1990 and March of 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Old Republic, American Mine Services\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation carrier, accepted Welch\u2019s claim under the Montana Occupational Disease Act and paid him disability benefits thereunder. On May 14, 1991, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court considered Welch\u2019s claim that his injury arose out of the course and scope of his employment with American Mine Services, Inc. and was not an occupational disease. In its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Judgment dated August 21, 1991, the court found Welch\u2019s condition to be compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act of 1987. Old Republic Insurance and American Mine Services appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in concluding that claimant sustained a compensable injury pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA (1987). Because this case involves an issue of law, we will review the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to see if it is legally correct. <em>Stuker v. State Comp. Mutual Ins. Fund </em>(Mont. 1991), [251 Mont. 96,] 822 P.2d 105, 48 St.Rep. 1071; <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 803 P.2d 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Section 39-71-119, MCA (1987), is the statute at issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">(1) \u201cInjury\u2019 or \u201cinjured\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">(a) internal or external physical harm to the body;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-10\">(b) damage to prosthetic devices or appliances, except for damage to eyeglasses, contact lenses, dentures, or hearing aids; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-11\">(c) death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-12\">(2) An injury is caused by an accident. An accident is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-13\">(a) an unexpected traumatic incident or unusual strain;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-14\">(b) identifiable by time and place of occurrence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-15\">(c) identifiable by member or part of the body affected; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>(d) caused by a specific event on a single day or during a single work shift.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-3\">(3) \u201cInjury\u201d or \u201cinjured\u201d does not mean a physical or mental condition arising from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-4\">(a) emotional or mental stress; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">(b) a nonphysical stimulus or activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">(4) \u201cInjury\u201d or \u201cinjured\u201d does not include a disease that is not caused by an accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">(5) A cardiovascular, pulmonary, respiratory, or other disease, cerebrovascular accident, or myocardial infection suffered by a worker is an injury only if the accident is the primary cause of the physical harm in relation to other factors contributing to the physical harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">A compensable injury must meet all three definitional requirements contained in \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA (1987): there must be an \u201cinjury\u201d and an \u201caccident,\u201d and the injury must be \u201ccaused by\u201d the accident. Old Republic contends that these requirements are not met, asserting primarily that Welch\u2019s deep foot infection took nineteen days to develop, was not unexpected, and was the end result of a number of factors including his diabetes. Old Republic\u2019s approach, focusing as it does on Welch\u2019s diabetes rather than on the initial incident which led to the deep foot infection, is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">The well-established rule in Montana is that an employer takes an employee subject to the employee\u2019s physical condition at the time of employment. <em>Shepard v. Midland Foods, Inc. </em>(1983), 205 Mont. 146, 666 P.2d 758; <em>Schumacher v. Empire Steel Manufacturing Co. and Employers Mutual Liability Insurance Co. </em>(1977), 175 Mont. 411, 574 P.2d 987. With this principle as a starting premise, \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA (1987), can be considered in a clear and straightforward manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">The parties agree that physical harm occurred to Welch\u2019s foot. Old Republic contends, however, that Welch\u2019s physical condition arose from the \u201cnonphysical stimulus\u201d of his diabetes; therefore, according to the appellant, \u00a7 39-71-119(3)(b), MCA (1987), prevents the condition from constituting an injury. This argument ignores the fact, undisputed on the record before us, that the sores on Welch\u2019s foot initially arose from the physical stimulus of ill-fitting boots. The requirement for an injury under \u00a7 39-71-119(1), MCA (1987), is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">Section 39-71-119, MCA (1987), also requires that an accident occur. Old Republic contends that three of the four statutory requirements for an accident are not met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Section 39-71-119(2)(b), MCA (1987), requires that an accident be identifiable by time and place of occurrence. Old Republic argues that Welch\u2019s condition does not meet this requirement because it took nineteen days for the infection to develop to a point requiring hospitalization. The record reveals, however, that Dr. Flaherty and Old Republic\u2019s expert witness agree that the infection which developed in Welch\u2019s foot initially was caused by Welch\u2019s new boots rubbing sores dining his work shift of April 27, 1989. We conclude that the initial incident which ultimately led to Welch\u2019s severe infection occurred during unidentifiable time, the April 27,1989 shift, and at an identifiable place, the underground mine near Nye, Montana. Thus, \u00a7 39-71-119(2)(b), MCA (1987), is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Similarly, Old Republic next contends that Welch\u2019s condition was the culmination of such factors as his diabetes, vascular calcification and diabetic neuropathy. Arguing that the condition is similar to those of claimants in <em>Wear v. Buttrey Foods, Inc. </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 477, 764 P.2d 139; <em>McMahon v. Anaconda Co. </em>(1984), 208 Mont. 482, 678 P.2d 661; and <em>Whittington v. Ramsey Construction Co. and Fabrication </em>(1987), 229 Mont. 115, 744 P.2d 1251, Old Republic asserts that the time definiteness required by \u00a7 39-71-119(2)(d), MCA (1987), is not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The physical conditions in the cases relied on by Old Republic were brought about by many years of repetitious activity or exposure to pollutants; as a result, we held that they lacked the time definiteness required. The facts before us are not analogous. Here, an initial and identifiable incident of physical harm occurred on April 27, 1989, when Welch\u2019s ill-fitting boots rubbed sores on his foot. As discussed previously, Old Republic\u2019s focus on complications subsequent to that initial incident is misplaced. The initial incident was a \u201cspecific event ... during a single work shift\u201d as required by \u00a7 39-71-119(2)(d), MCA (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Finally, \u00a7 39-71-119(2)(a), MCA (1987), requires that an accident be an unexpected and traumatic incident or unusual strain. Old Republic argues that Welch\u2019s deep foot infection was to be expected because he was a diabetic.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The common meaning of \u201cunexpected\u201d is \u201cunlooked for, unforeseen, surprising.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary </em>(1971). We note that the 1987 amendments to \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA, retain the word \u201cunexpected\u201d from the pre-1987 definition of injury. In <em>Bremer v. Buerkle </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 495, 727 P.2d 529, we affirmed the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s decision that a worker\u2019s allergic contact der<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>matitis constituted an injury because it met the \u201cunexpected\u201d requirement of the statute. In <em>Bremer, </em>the claimant had been working with the same chemicals for nine years without sustaining any allergic reaction. We concluded that, despite this ongoing contact, the chemical contact which occurred on one day unexpectedly stimulated his immune system and led to an allergic reaction. In a similar fashion, Welch had experienced no problems in breaking in new safety boots during his many years of working in mines. Despite this twenty-five year history, the new boots he wore on April 27, 1989, rubbed sores on his foot which became infected. We conclude that the incident was unexpected under \u00a7 39-71-119(2)(a), MCA (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Old Republic also contends that the use of the word \u201ctraumatic\u201d necessitates the presence of force or violence, neither of which is present under the facts of this case. <em>Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary </em>(1971) defines \u201ctrauma\u201d as \u201can injury or wound to a living body caused by the application of external force or violence.\u201d Old Republic\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Robert Nielson, when asked during his deposition whether Welch\u2019s blisters could be considered a trauma, responded: \u201cSure.\u201d Dr. Nielsen continued to refer to the rubbing of Welch\u2019s toes as a trauma to the foot. We conclude that the rubbing of the ill-fitting boots was a traumatic incident under \u00a7 39-71-119(2)(a), MCA (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Welch sustained an injury and an accident under \u00a7 39-71-119(1) and (2), MCA (1987). The only remaining question is whether the accident \u201ccaused\u201d the injury, as also required by \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Arguing against this causal link, Old Republic asserts that under \u00a7 39-71-119(4), MCA (1987), Welch\u2019s diabetes is a disease that is not caused by an accident. Old Republic is correct; however, Welch\u2019s diabetes is not at issue here. The diabetes predated the injury to Welch\u2019s foot on April 27,1989. While the diabetes apparently resulted in more severe complications from the initial incident than would have been experienced by a nondiabetic, the initial incident constitutes an injury under \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Similarly, Old Republic presents a somewhat convoluted argument that Welch\u2019s diabetes is an \u201cother disease\u201d under \u00a7 39-71-119(5), MCA(1987), which does not constitute an injury. Old Republic asserts that the initial abrasions were not the primary cause of Welch\u2019s physical harm in relation to other factors which produced the deep foot infection. We considered the meaning of \u201cprimary cause\u201d under \u00a7 39-71-119(5), MCA (1987), in <em>Gaumer v. State Compensation In</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number><em>surance Fund </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 414, 795 P.2d 77. In <em>Gaumer, </em>the claimant had a history of respiratory ailments prior to her work-related accident involving toxins in the work place. We found that claimant\u2019s condition was compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-4\">[T]he drastic change in the claimant\u2019s medical condition was primarily caused by the accident in the work place where she was exposed to chemical toxins or allergens, it was not merely the progressive result of her pre-existing respiratory ailments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avo\"><em>Gaumer, </em>243 Mont. at 420, 795 P.2d at 80-81. Likewise, the significant change in Welch\u2019s physical condition was primarily caused by the injury and accident which occurred when his ill-fitting safety boots rubbed abrasions on his foot. While the diabetes may have exacerbated the ultimate severity of the original injury, Welch\u2019s medical condition was not merely the progressive result of his pre-existing diabetes.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Old Republic makes a final argument, without supporting authority, that the 1987 amendments to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act were intended to substantially restrict the definitions of \u201cinjury\u201d and \u201caccident.\u201d Because the plain meaning of the words used in the statute is determinative in this case, consideration of the legislative history is inappropriate. <em>State ex rel. Roberts v. PSC </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 242, 790 P.2d 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">We conclude that the rubbing of sores on Welch\u2019s toes meets the statutory requirements for an injury and an accident, and that the accident caused the injury. We hold that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not err in concluding that claimant sustained a compensable injury pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b106-8\">JUSTICES HUNT, McDONOUGH, TRIEWEILER and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
