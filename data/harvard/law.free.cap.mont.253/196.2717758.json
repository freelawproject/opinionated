On August 16, 1988, Dr. Lovitt performed a lumbosacral fusion at the LS-S1 level of Garcia\u2019s spine. Garcia has not returned to work since July 18,1988. It is undisputed that Garcia has a long history of back problems. The State Fund first refused but then accepted Garcia\u2019s claim and made payments under the reservation of rights in \u00a7 39-71-608, MCA. After an investigation was completed, it terminated the claimant\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Garcia filed a petition with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court contesting the termination of benefits. A trial was held on March 4, 1991. The hearing examiner executed a proposed judgment on August 8, 1991. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge adopted the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and proposed judgment of the hearing examiner. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Our standard for reviewing a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court is to determine if there is substantial evidence to support the findings and conclusions of that court. Where there is substantial evidence to support the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, this Court cannot overturn the decision. <em>Coles v. Seven Eleven Stores </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 343, 347, 704 P.2d 1048, 1050; <em>Wood v. Consolidated Freightways </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 26, 28, 808 P.2d 502, 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found that Garcia began suffering from low back pain in the mid-1970\u2019s. She was eventually diagnosed with degenerative disk disease, which is a wear and tear process that occurs with aging. On June 10, 1986, Garcia was seen by Dr. Teal for a gradual increase in pain over the past decade. She was treated with medication, physical therapy and exercise. On October 26, 1987, she began seeing Dr. Lovitt. On June 17, 1988, Garcia and Dr. Lovitt discussed the possibility of surgery. On July 18, 1988, the day of the injury, Garcia saw Dr. Lovitt. They again discussed the possibility of surgery. Dr. Lovitt considered Garcia\u2019s July 18,1988 visit as a flare-up in her continuing symptoms. As noted above, Garcia underwent surgery on August 16, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, in its conclusions of law, found that Garcia was within the course and scope of her employment on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>July 18, 1988, when she suffered an injury as defined in \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA (1987). This statute provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-4\">39-71-119. Injury and accident defined. (1) \u201cInjury\u2019 or \u201cinjured\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">(a) internal or external physical harm to the body;...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">(2) An injury is caused by an accident. An accident is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">(a) an unexpected traumatic incident or unusual strain;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">(b) identifiable by time and place of occurrence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\">(c) identifiable by member or part of the body affected; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">(d) caused by a specific event on a single day or during a single work shift...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court concluded the definition of injury retains the pre-1987 requirement of \u201can unexpected traumatic accident\u201d or \u201cunusual strain.\u201d <em>Gaumer v. State Compensation Fund </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 414, 795 P.2d 77. The court also found that the fact that an employee is suffering from or afflicted with preexisting disease or disability does not preclude compensation if the disease or disability is aggravated or accelerated by an industrial accident. <em>Birnie v. U.S. Gypsum, Co. </em>(1958), 134 Mont. 39, 328 P.2d 133; <em>Rumsey v. Cardinal Petroleum </em>(1975), 166 Mont. 17, 530 P.2d 433; <em>Shepard v. Midland Foods, Inc. </em>(1983), 205 Mont. 146, 666 P.2d 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">However, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found that \u201ccompensable injury\u2019 and \u201cdisability\u2019 were two separate considerations. <em>Hall v. Cigna Insurance Co., </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 484, 812 P.2d 1262. <em>In Hall, </em>the claimant sustained several separate injuries over a period of years while employed with different employers and while doing separate activities. Hall alleged right knee, left ankle, and back pain were attributable to injuries sustained while working for ARCO. <em>Hall </em>at 488, 812 P.2d at 1264. We held that Hall did not demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that his current medical condition was attributable to his employment with ARCO. <em>Hall </em>at 489, 812 P.2d at 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court concluded that the entitlement to disability benefits must be supported by a preponderance of the medical evidence. The burden of proof is on the claimant to prove the work-related incident as a contributory cause to her disability. <em>Gierke v. Associated Indemnity Corporation </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 446, 454, 730 P.2d 1143, 1148. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found, and the medical record bears out, that Garcia and Dr. Lovitt discussed surgery prior to July 18,1988. On July 18,1988, Dr. Lovitt noted the same continuing symptoms. The plaintiff did not present any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>evidence to support her position that her surgery or disability was causally related to the July 18, 1988 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Garcia argues that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court violated her right to due process and equal protection of the law. The basis of the argument is that, in holding Garcia was not entitled to any benefits beyond the amount paid, the court exceeded the issue of whether or not Garcia was injured. Therefore, Garcia was deprived of her right to notice and opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">One of the issues presented by the parties to the hearing examiner was whether Garcia suffered a compensable industrial injury arising out of and/in the course of her employment. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found in Garcia\u2019s favor on that issue. In Garcia\u2019s complaint and in her contention number one of the pretrial order, Garcia claimed she was entitled to continued temporary total disability payments from the insurer. Thus, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not exceed the scope of the issues in concluding Garcia was not entitled to benefits beyond the amount paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Garcia argues that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, in holding she was not entitled to any benefits beyond the amount paid, denied her due process. The essence of her argument is that she was without notice that the disability issue would be tried. However, as stated above, Garcia\u2019s first contention in the pretrial order was that of whether or not she was entitled to temporary total disability payments. Evidence that Garcia\u2019s disability was not related to her injury was presented by the depositions of Dr. Lovitt and Garcia approximately one month before the hearing. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court made a finding on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The dissent argues that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court exceeded its jurisdiction by deciding issues not raised by the parties. The hearings examiner approved a pretrial order which was signed by the parties. He noted at the hearing that the order would govern the proceedings. ARM 24.5.318 governs pretrial practice before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court and provides for the pretrial conference and order. The order set forth the uncontested facts, the issues to be determined, and both parties\u2019 contentions. The relevant portions are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">E. Statement of Issues to be Determined by the Court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-10\">1. Whether Petitioner suffered a compensable industrial in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>jury arising out of/and in the course of her employment on or about July 18, 1988 ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-3\">F. Petitioner\u2019s Contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-4\">1. Petitioner has been, and continues to be, temporarily totally disabled as a result of the incident of July 18, 1988 ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">G. Defendant\u2019s Contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">2. Claimant has a long history of back problems. Her surgery and back problems are related to her history of back problems not to anything that occurred on or about July 18, 1988. Likewise, the medical records reflect that claimant decided to have surgery on her back prior to the time of her alleged injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Further, the depositions of Dr. Lovitt and Garcia were submitted to the hearings examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">One of the purposes of the pretrial order is to specify the legal theories and contentions of fact upon which the parties are proceeding. A pretrial conference is held to promote organization and management of the case. We must balance here the integrity of the order and the adaptability of the proceedings. <em>Case v. Abrams </em>(10th Cir. 1965), 352 F.2d 193.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">Unlike pleadings, usually based on information and belief, the pre-trial order defining the issues is the result of discovery in which, as this order recites ... both parties know the testimony of the other\u2019s witnesses. The pre-trial order supersedes the pleadings and becomes the governing pattern of the lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">Case, at 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">The question before us is whether the pretrial order can be construed to include the issue of whether Garcia was entitled to compensation beyond the amount paid. The trial court has wide discretion in matters of pretrial practice. See <em>Moore v. Sylvania Electronic Products, Inc. </em>(3rd Cir. 1972), 454 F.2d 81, <em>Ely </em>v. <em>Reading Co. </em>(3rd Cir. 1970), 424 F.2d 758, and <em>Davis v. Duplantis </em>(5th Cir. 1971), 448 F.2d 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">As stated by the Eighth Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-13\">We are satisfied that the trial court properly interpreted the issues raised by the pleadings. In any event the appellant by the pre-trial order was fully advised of the presence in the case of the oral contract of insurance issue, and is in no position to claim that it was misled as to the issues to be tried.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-14\"><em>American Surety Company of New York v. Williford </em>(8th Cir. 1957), 243 F.2d 494, 497. We find that Garcia was advised by the pretrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>order of the presence of the disability issue, and cannot claim surprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">In its findings of fact, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found that Dr. Lovitt had not been requested to prepare an impairment rating and could not state a date that Garcia could have reached maximum healing following surgery. Garcia contends that the issue of maximum healing and a subsequent impairment evaluation was not before the court and should not have been decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Even though Garcia contests the court\u2019s finding on Dr. Lovitt\u2019s testimony regarding the impairment rating and maximum healing, she argues that she was deprived of the right to a determination on the issue of maximum healing and an impairment rating, denying her due process. Garcia argues that a determination of maximum healing is mandatory. Garcia relies on <em>Wood v. Consolidated Freightways </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 26, 808 P.2d 502 for the proposition that a determination of maximum healing is mandatory. However, <em>Wood </em>involved the question of whether the claimant was permanently partially disabled or totally disabled after receiving a work related injury. Not whether he was disabled from a work-related injury. We conclude under these facts such a determination was not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude substantial credible evidence existed to support the findings and conclusions of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b224-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICE HARRISON, GRAY and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b224-10\">JUSTICE HUNT</author>\n<p id=\"Ak5\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">I dissent. The majority\u2019s opinion denies Garcia the opportunity to present evidence relating to the extent of her disability. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court exceeded its jurisdiction by deciding issues not raised by the parties. The issue before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court was whether Garcia suffered a compensable industrial injury arising out of her scope of employment on July 18, 1988. The court properly ruled that Garcia met the requirements of an \u201cinjury\u201d as defined in \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA (1987). The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, however, went one step further and ruled that her injury on July 18, 1988, did not result in any disability which entitled her to compensation beyond the amount paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Garcia did not receive any notice or have any opportunity to present evidence relating to the extent of her disability. Garcia\u2019s attorney only presented a case on whether she suffered a compensable industrial injury. The fact that the issue was phrased in terms of \u201ccompensable injury\u201d did not notify Garcia that the extent of compensation was an issue. As a result, there was no evidence relating to Garcia\u2019s \u201cmaximum healing\u201d which is necessary for her to continue receiving temporary total disability benefits. Section 39-71-701(4), MCA. The State Fund was allowed to stop paying Garcia benefits without a determination that she had achieved \u201cmaximum healing.\u201d Moreover, an impairment rating cannot be obtained until Garcia reaches \u201cmaximum healing.\u201d The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court decided the issue without any evidence presented by Garcia relating to her physical impairment, or its affect on her earning capacity, because she did not have notice that the issue would be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">I would reverse and remand to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to allow Garcia to present evidence relating to the extent of her disability.</p>\n<judges id=\"b225-5\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER concurs in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
