Goettle appeals a sentence and judgment of the Eighteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Judicial District, Gallatin County, which denied his motion for a new trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The issue is whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying Goettle\u2019s motion for a new trial based on a comment made by the prosecution during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">On June 25,1991, a jury found Goettle guilty of criminal endangerment and criminal mischief in connection with an incident that involved two gun shots fired at the Alpine Sinclair Station in Bozeman, Montana. On July 3, 1991, Goettle moved the District Court for a new trial based on a comment made by the deputy county attorney during closing argument. This comment called attention to the fact that Goettle\u2019s wife did not testify in support of his alibi defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In a sentence and judgment dated August 12, 1991, the District Court denied Goettle\u2019s motion for a new trial. From this sentence and judgment, Goettle appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Goettle\u2019s motion for a new trial based on a comment made by the prosecution during closing argument?</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">In closing argument to the jury, a deputy county attorney made the following comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">Now, there is something that I wondered about here. And that is, that we were told in the defense\u2019s opening statement that Pam Goettle, the defendant\u2019s wife, was going to testify and we would hear from her as to what went on. But that didn\u2019t happen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIE\">Goettle\u2019s counsel objected to this comment as improper and the District Court sustained the objection. Goettle\u2019s counsel then moved that the comment be stricken and the District Court granted this motion. Later, the District Court issued the jury a curative instruction regarding the comment. Following the trial, Goettle moved for and the District Court denied Goettle a new trial based on this comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">Goettle argues that this comment was improper and cannot be considered harmless error. The State argues that this comment was an invited and appropriate response to the lack of evidentiary support to Goettle\u2019s alibi defense and did not deprive him of a fair and impartial trial. Alternatively, the State argues that even if the comment was improper, it was harmless error in light of the strong case presented by the State against Goettle.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">Section 46-16-702, MCA, provides that a district court may grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>a new trial to a criminal defendant if required in the interest of justice. The granting or denial of a new trial rests within the sound discretion of the trial corut and should not be disturbed on appeal unless an abuse of discretion is shown. <em>State v. Goodwin </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 1, 17, 813 P.2d 953, 963 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Following a review of the record, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Goettle\u2019s motion for a new trial. In the absence of any reference to Goettle\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony, the comment that she failed to testify does not appear damaging to Goettle. Furthermore, any prejudice caused to Goettle from this comment was rendered harmless through the District Court\u2019s actions of sustaining Goettle\u2019s objection, granting Goettle\u2019s motion to strike, and issuing a curative instruction to the jury. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s sentence and judgment dated August 12, 1991.</p>\n<judges id=\"b135-5\">JUSTICES HARRISON, GRAY, TRIEWEILER, McDONOUGH, HUNT and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
