Defendant, Stephen Crist (Crist) appeals from a ruling of the District Court allowing evidence of \u2018other acts\u2019 to be admitted under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid. Subsequently, a jury found Crist guilty of sexually assaulting 9 year old B.L. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-16\">The issues for our review are:</p>\n<p id=\"b465-17\">I. Did the District Court err by admitting \u2018other acts\u2019 evidence to be presented to the jury through the testimony of Kathy Lamb?</p>\n<p id=\"b465-18\">II. Did the District Court err by denying Crist\u2019s request for psychological evaluation of the complaining witnesses by a qualified expert of Crist\u2019s choosing?</p>\n<p id=\"b465-19\">Crist was charged with three counts of sexual assault. In the first count he was charged for sexual contact without consent for touching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>9 year old B.L. on the chest and in the vaginal area with his hand. Count two alleged that Crist sexually assaulted B.C., Crist\u2019s 8 year old son, by fondling his penis. Count three alleged Crist sexually assaulted J.L., a 14 year old baby sitter, by fondling her breasts.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The State, pursuant to the requirements of <em>State v. Just </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 262, 602 P.2d 957, filed a \u201cNotice of Intent to Introduce Evidence of Other Acts\u201d seeking to admit alleged incidents of sexual assault upon Kathy Lamb (Lamb). The notice provided that the State would seek to introduce evidence of\u2018other acts\u2019:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">for the purpose of proving motive, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, absence of mistake or accident, or any other permissible factor such as consciousness of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The State further provided that the evidence of \u201cother acts\u201d expected to be presented consisted of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">On or about the fall of 1984 the defendant touched the breast and legs of Kathy Lamb, d/o/b July 24, 1971, on approximately twelve different occasions. One time he showed her a pornographic magazine and on another occasion he gave her an alcoholic beverage and joked that he would get her drunk and then \u201ctake advantage\u201d of her. Later the same night he tried to get her to dress in a nightgown. The touching all occurred when she was in bed and he entered the bedroom and reached under her covers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The court allowed the evidence to be introduced and at trial Lamb testified to each of the prior acts as listed above. However, Lamb did not recall defendant having touched her breasts but did testify that on three or four occasions (rather than the 12 described in the notice) Crist had come into the room where she was sleeping (with B.L.), put his hand under her covers and rubbed her upper leg. Crist was only found guilty of the charges involving B.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-10\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">The general Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., must be strictly enforced, except where clearly justified and exceptions to the rule must be carefully limited. <em>Just, </em>184 Mont. at 271-272, 602 P.2d at 962, citing <em>State v. Tiedemann </em>(1961), 139 Mont. 237, 242-243, 362 P.2d 529, 531. We have developed four substantive criterion for the admission of evidence of other acts or crimes. <em>State v. Just </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 262, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>602 P.2d 957; <em>State v. Matt </em>(1991), 814 P.2d 521, 48 St. Rep. 614. The so called \u201cModified Just Rule\u201d requires that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\">1) there is a similarity between the crime charged and the previous crime, act or wrong;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">2) the other crime, act or wrong must not be remote in time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">3) the evidence of other acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity with such character; but may be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">4) a determination that the probative value of the evidence is not substantially outweighed by the prejudice to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">When reviewing evidentiary rulings, this Court will determine if the District Court misused or abused its discretion. <em>Steer Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 803 P.2d 601. Absent a showing of abuse of discretion, the District Court\u2019s determination will not be overturned. <em>State v. Oman </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 260, 264, 707 P.2d 1117, 1119-20. On review, we will apply the <em>Just </em>criterion to the facts of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">The first requirement of the Modified Just Rule is that there be a similarity between the crime charged and the prior act. Here the crime charged was the perpetration of sexual assaults upon an 8, 9 and 14 year old child. In <em>State v. Tecca </em>(1986), 220 Mont. 168, 714 P.2d 136, we held that a prior act need not be identical to the offense committed but that there must be a sufficient similarity. In <em>Tecca, </em>the crime charged was the sexual assault of an 11 year old who was sleeping in the defendant\u2019s house. We determined that evidence of other children who had awakened in defendant\u2019s house to find defendant sitting next to their bed in his underwear bore sufficient similarity to the crime charged to uphold its admission. On the basis of <em>Tecca, </em>we refuse to adopt Crist\u2019s argument that a prior act in order to be admissible in a sexual assault case must involve actual \u201ctouching\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">In <em>State v. Long </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 502, 726 P.2d 1364, we determined that defendant\u2019s having \u201crubbed\u201d the clothed bottom of a 5 year old was sufficiently similar to the crime charged of pulling down the pants of two four year old children and rubbing their vaginas. We noted that sexual abuse of children takes subtle forms and deferred to the perceptions of the trier of fact to properly admit the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">In the instant case, Lamb testified that Crist assaulted her late at night in the same bed in which Crist assaulted B.L. Lamb testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>that Crist rubbed the inside and outside of her thighs in an attempt to \u201cmove his hand up.\u201d We conclude that this act is sufficiently similar to the assault perpetrated on B.L. to uphold its admission. See also <em>State v. Gilpin </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 56, 756 P.2d 445. We now apply Lamb\u2019s testimony, regarding Crist\u2019s touching her, to the remaining <em>Just </em>criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Whether \u201cother acts\u201d evidence is too remote is directed to the discretion of the District Court to determine whether a remoteness is so great that the proffered evidence has no value. Here, the acts about which Lamb testified appear to have occurred approximately four years prior to the act against B.L. We have refused to establish an arbitrary time limit for admitting prior acts. <em>Tecca, </em>220 Mont. at 173; <em>State v. Medina </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 25, 30, 798 P.2d 1032, 1036. In similar cases we have determined that remoteness does not bar admission where the intervening period of time is three and one half years, <em>State v. Stroud </em>(1984), 210 Mont. 58, 71, 683 P.2d 459, 466; five years, <em>State v. Eiler </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 38, 48, 762 P.2d 210, 217; and nine years where there has been a \u201ccontinuing pattern of similar conduct.\u201d <em>Tecca, </em>220 Mont. at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">We conclude that Lamb\u2019s testimony is not too remote and that the District Court acted within its discretion by allowing its admission. Furthermore, we conclude that Lamb\u2019s testimony regarding Crist\u2019s touching her tends to establish Crist\u2019s intent to commit sexual acts with minors, and therefore satisfies the third prong of the <em>Just </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The fourth prong of the <em>Just </em>test requires that the probative value of the evidence is not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice to the defendant. We have clarified that unfair prejudice occurs when the evidence is offered to \u201chorrify, evoke sympathy or increase a desire to punish and whose probative value is slight.\u201d <em>State v. Paulson </em>(1991), 817 P.2d 1137, 1144, 48 St.Rep. 838, 841. We again conclude the District Court acted within its discretion and uphold the admission of Lamb\u2019s testimony regarding Crist\u2019s touching her.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The remaining acts to which Lamb testified, we conclude, fail to reach the requisite standard of sufficient similarity. Showing Lamb a pornographic magazine, teasing her about getting her drunk and \u201ctaking advantage of her,\u201d and attempting to get her to dress in a nightgown are innuendos too broad to meet the standard of similarity. We cannot say that these incidents are similar to the actual assaults with which Crist is charged. The record is void of Crist having ever acted similarly towards any of the alleged victims. Not inconsistent with <em>Long, </em>we continue to recognize that sexual abuse of children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>takes subtle forms. However, the \u2018other acts\u2019 admitted in the instant case cannot all be properly characterized as sexual abuse. These acts are, however, evidence of character. These innuendos would tend to distract the trier of fact from the main question of what actually happened on the occasions charged. Therefore, we conclude, with the exception of Crist\u2019s touching Lamb while she was in bed, Lamb\u2019s testimony lacks the requisite similarity to the crime charged and therefore fails the first prong of the <em>Just </em>test and is inadmissible character evidence. The District Court is reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Because we reverse, we need not address Crist\u2019s claim that the State failed to provide proper notice of which purpose the State intended to introduce the \u201cother acts\u201d evidence. However, we reiterate our previous holding that the purposes listed in Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., may not be listed in \u201cshotgun\u201d fashion but instead the notice must provide the specific purpose upon which a party intends to offer \u201cother acts\u201d evidence. See <em>State v. Croteau </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 403, 812 P.2d 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Lastly, we turn to Crist\u2019s request to have the District Court compel a psychological evaluation of B.L. by an expert of his choosing. Contrary to Crist\u2019s contentions, no legal authority exists in Montana to compel a victim in a sexual assault case to be examined by a defendant\u2019s psychologist. <em>State v. Liddell </em>(1984), 211 Mont. 180, 685 P.2d 918. We addressed this issue in <em>State v. Gilpin </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 56, 756 P.2d 445, wherein we held:</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The defendant cannot force psychological evaluation of a child</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">victim of sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">We are not persuaded by Crist\u2019s constitutional arguments that he is being denied his right to reciprocal discovery. We decline to hold that denial of a request to compel a psychological examination of a child sexual assault victim jeopardizes defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. We hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying Crist\u2019s request to compel psychological evaluation of B.L.</p>\n<judges id=\"b469-9\">JUSTICES GRAY, TRIEWEILER and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b469-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE</author>\n<p id=\"Abi\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion reversing the conviction of Stephen Dale Crist. Crist was found guilty on March 26, 1991, by a Missoula County jury of sexual assault upon a nine-year-old girl, B.L., committed between November 15, 1989, and January 31, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>The majority opinion approves the admissibility of prior act testimony given at the trial by K.L., sister of B.L., that Crist sexually assaulted her in 1984 when K.L. was thirteen years old. Crist was not charged with this assault. I agree with the majority opinion\u2019s holding that this testimony of a prior act was admissible and that the requirements of the \u201cmodified Just rule\u201d with relation to this prior act had been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The majority opinion, however, reverses the conviction based upon testimony of K.L., that she was subjected to three other prior acts of Crist.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">It must be noted that the three other prior acts, which the majority holds to be inadmissible and reversible error, all occurred within a short span of time before the prior act of sexual assault by Crist upon K.L. which the majority held to be admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The testimony of K.L. relating to these three other prior acts, taken from the trial transcript of the direct testimony of K.L., is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1A\">Q. Were there any other incidents involving the Defendant that you can recall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">A. Yeah, I went over to the house one night, and I was sitting there and on the floor watching TV, and I don\u2019t remember how this started, but Steve said something like \u2014 yeah, right in front of Collette he said, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m going to \u2014\u201d I\u2019m stumped. I can\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">He goes, \u201cI\u2019m going to get her drunk and take advantage of her,\u201d and Collette was sitting right there, and they just kind of laughed about it, and they go, \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to bed now,\u201d and I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">And I was just watching TV. So Steve came back out a few minutes later, and he brought this nightgown out, and he goes, \u201cCome here,\u201d and he grabs me and takes me into the bathroom, and he said, \u201cPut this on,\u201d and I went, \u201cNo.\u201d Then he walked out and he got mad, and that was the end of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">Q. Did anything else happen, either before or after this, involving the Defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">A. What do you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-12\">Q. Did he ever pick you up at Sentinel High School or Hellgate High School?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-14\">Q. Can you explain to the jury about that incident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-15\">A. Well, I was at work, and I was at Human Resources, and I called up because I wanted to spend the day with [B.L.], my sister. So I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>called up, and I said, \u201cWell, Steve, will you bring me over so I can see [B.L.]?\u201d And he said, \u201cSure.\u201d He said, \u201cThere\u2019s something I want you to do, and I will pay you for it.\u201d And I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d He goes, \u2018Well, I will meet you at Hellgate.\u201d I did [sic], \u201cOkay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\">So he picked me up at Hellgate, and when I got in the truck, I go, Well, what was it you wanted me to do?\u201d He goes, \u201cI\u2019ll just tell you later,\u201d and I go, \u201cWhat, clean the house, clean dishes, some sewing?\u201d And he goes, \u201cNo,\u201d and I go \u201cUm.\u201d So he said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when we get back to the house,\u201d and I go, \u201cOkay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">So when we get back to the house, he was cleaning out the camper, either to go camping or just got back, and after that he goes, Well, why don\u2019t you come in here and sit and talk to me,\u201d and I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">Q. In where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">A. In the camper \u2014 because we never had any problems before this. We had always gotten along okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">Q. So this incident with the camper was before he touched you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">A. This was before anything started. And so we were sitting in the camper just talking and everything. He said, \u201cI want to show you something,\u201d and he said, \u201cI will be right back.\u201d So he went in the house, came back in the camper, and he threw a magazine that was covered up on the table, and he went back in and he goes, \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d And so I uncovered it, and it was like a Penthouse or something like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-10\">Q. Then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-11\">A. He came back in and he goes, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d [I] go, \u201cWhat do you mean, what do I think?\u201d And I went, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d So I went in and kissed my sister and I left.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">The majority opinion holds that the testimony of K.L. as to the three other prior acts fails to reach the requisite standard of sufficient similarity and is only evidence of Crist\u2019s character. I disagree with this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">The showing of a pornographic magazine to K.L., then a thirteen-year-old girl, stating that he was \u201cgoing to get her [K.L.] drunk and take advantage of her\u201d and telling her to take her clothes off and put on a nightgown are indeed subtle forms of grooming a child for an act of sexual abuse. The sexual assault to which K.L. testified Crist subjected her followed very closely after his three other acts grooming K.L. for the sexual assault that followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">If, as the majority opinion holds, the actual sexual assault upon K.L. is admissible as a prior act of Crist, then certainly these other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>three prior acts are also admissible as a grooming of K.L. for the sexual assault upon her, and cannot be held as not similar. These acts of grooming of K.L. are not only similar to the actual sexual assault committed upon her but are a prelude and inextricably a part of Crist\u2019s plan and sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Crist cannot complain that the admission of the testimony concerning the other three prior acts prejudiced him. He was charged in Count Two with sexual abuse against B.C., an eight-year-old boy, and the jury found him not guilty on this count. In Count Three, Crist was charged with sexual assault upon J.S., a fourteen-year-old girl, and the jury hung on this charge \u2014 eight for guilty and four for innocent. Count Three was thereafter dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">I would affirm the jury conviction and sentence imposed by the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
