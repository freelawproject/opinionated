Appellant and Defendant, Brien Panasuk (Panasuk) challenges the jurisdiction of the City Court of Billings to hear and determine criminal public nuisance charges brought under \u00a7\u00a7 45-8-lll(l)(a) and (b), MCA. The District Court held that the City Court did have jurisdiction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The sole issue for our review is whether or not the City Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine criminal public nuisance charges for violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-8-lll(l)(a) and (b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">The City of Billings filed, in City Court, four complaints; one alleging that Panasuk violated \u00a7 45-8-lll(l)(a), MCA, and three alleging violation of \u00a7 45-8-lll(l)(b), MCA. Panasuk operates an after hours club that caters to under age patrons. The charges allege Panasuk knowingly maintained an area, the parking lot adjacent to his club, where persons gathered for the purpose of engaging in unlawful conduct. Unlawful conduct cited in the complaints include: shootings, a stabbing, disturbances, curfew violations, criminal mischief, criminal misdemeanors, numerous open container violations and misdemeanor possession of liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The City Court concluded that it had jurisdiction and subsequently imposed fines on each of the complaints. In addition, the City Court sentenced Panasuk to six months in the county jail which was suspended on conditions. Panasuk appealed to the District Court challenging the City Court\u2019s jurisdiction over the matter. The District Court upheld the City Court\u2019s jurisdiction, relying on \u00a7 3-11-102, MCA, which grants the City Court jurisdiction over misdemeanors.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">Section 45-8-111, MCA, the section under which Panasuk was charged, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">45-8-111. Public nuisance. (1) \u201cPublic nuisance\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-12\">(a) a condition which endangers safety or health, is offensive to the senses, or obstructs the free use of property so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property by an entire community or neighborhood or by any considerable number of persons;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>(b) any premises where persons gather for the purpose of engaging in unlawful conduct; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-4\">(6) A person convicted of maintaining a public nuisance shall be fined not to exceed $500 or imprisoned in the county jail for a term not to exceed 6 months, or both. Each day of such conduct constitutes a separate offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The penalty imposed in sub-section 6 makes violation of \u00a7 45-8-111, MCA, a misdemeanor. See \u00a7 45-2-101(36), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Section 46-2-203, MCA, provides the City Court criminal jurisdiction as authorized by \u00a7 3-11-102, MCA. Section 3-11-102(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">3-11-102. Concurrent jurisdiction. (1) The city court has concurrent jurisdiction with the justice\u2019s court of all misdemeanors and proceedings mentioned and provided for under chapter 10, part 3, of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Chapter 10, part 3, of this title, as referenced above, includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-9\">3-10-303. Criminal jurisdiction. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-10\">(1) jurisdiction of all misdemeanors punishable by a fine not exceeding $500 or imprisonment not exceeding 6 months or both such fine and imprisonment: ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">Following these statutes, it is clear that City Court has jurisdiction over criminal misdemeanor charges. Furthermore, it is clear that violation of \u00a7 45-8-111, MCA, the section under which Panasuk was charged, is a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">Panasuk contends that \u00a7 3-10-301(l)(b), MCA, precludes a city court from hearing actions involving the title to, or possession of real property. Panasuk cites several statutory provisions as demonstrating the legislative policy that matters involving title to or possession of real property are beyond the jurisdiction of non-record courts. \u00a7 25-31-102, MCA, \u00a7 3-10-301, MCA, Rule 4(B)(1)(c), M.R.Civ.P. Furthermore, Panasuk argues that under \u00a7 45-8-112, MCA, any action to abate a nuisance must be brought in the name of the state and because abatement is a form of injunctive relief, the district court has exclusive jurisdiction. Citing \u00a7 3-10-301(l)(h), MCA. Finally, Panasuk argues that the exclusive remedies for public nuisance, both civil and criminal, are found in \u00a7 27-30-202, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-13\">27-30-202. Remedies for public nuisances. (1) The remedies against a public nuisance are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-14\">(a) indictment or information;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-15\">(b) a civil action; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-16\">(c) abatement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>(2) The remedy by indictment or information is regulated by Titles 45 and 46.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Panasuk contends that under the guidelines of the foregoing statute, a criminal prosecution for public nuisance cannot be commenced by a complaint, but only by indictment or information. The instant prosecution was commenced by a complaint filed in the City Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Panasuk\u2019s arguments fail for several reasons. First, the argument that the City Court is precluded from hearing cases involving title to or possession of real property is premised on an action to abate the nuisance. The charges levied in the instant case were filed under \u00a7 45-8-111(1), MCA, and were criminal charges where the judgment was a fine and a suspended jail term. We do not have a case that involves title to or possession of real property. Furthermore, the sections cited by Panasuk all regard the civil jurisdiction of the City Court. The instant case involves the question of the City Court\u2019s jurisdiction over a criminal matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Panasuk\u2019s second argument is premised on belief that \u00a7 27-30-202, MCA, provides the \u201cexclusive\u201d remedies for public nuisance. Because the statute provides that an action against public nuisance may be commenced by information or indictment, Panasuk argues that an action for public nuisance may not be filed by complaint and must be filed in District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">In construing individual sections of the Code, the Code should be considered in its entirety to determine the effect of any one section. <em>State v. Bush </em>(1974), 164 Mont. 81, 518 P.2d 1406. We note that \u00a7 27-30-202, MCA, was enacted and has remained unchanged since 1895. In subsequent years the legislature enacted the above cited statutes regarding a city court\u2019s jurisdiction over misdemeanors as well as \u00a7 45-8-111, MCA, the criminal public nuisance statute. Furthermore, in 1967, the legislature enacted a statute that <em>requires </em>all prosecutions brought in City Court be commenced by a sworn complaint. \u00a7 46-17-101, MCA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">In the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted. Where there are several provisions or particulars, such a construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA. Panasuk\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 27-30-202, MCA, is problematic. Section 27-30-202, MCA, provides for \u201cthe remedies against public nuisance\u201d. It does not explicitly provide that the listed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>remedies are exclusive. Panasuk\u2019s interpretation requires that we insert the word \u201cexclusive\u201d into the statute despite its absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Panasuk\u2019s interpretation also results in creating a direct contradiction between \u00a7 27-30-202, MCA, and statutes subsequently enacted. Sections 3-11-102 and 3-10-303, MCA, provide the City Court jurisdiction over the instant case while Panasuk\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 27-30-202, MCA, would preclude such jurisdiction. Therefore, we decline to adopt Panasuk\u2019s argument that \u00a7 27-30-202, MCA, provides the exclusive remedies for public nuisance and that the City was required to file its action by information or indictment in District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">We conclude the City Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine charges for violation of \u00a7 45-8-111, MCA. The District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b429-6\">JUSTICES HARRISON, HUNT, TRIEWEILER and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
