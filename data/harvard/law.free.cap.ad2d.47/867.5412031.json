On the facts in the record, possession of a weapon as a misdemeanor was a lesser inclusory count of murder. There was no proof of possession independent of the crime of murder. A conviction upon the higher offense is deemed a dismissal of the lesser offense submitted to the jury. CPL 300.40 (subd 3, par [b]) and the People so concede. Concur \u2014 Stevens, P.
