Erie County Court et al., Respondents.</parties>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AhJ\">Application unanimously granted, without costs, in accordance with the following memorandum: In this article 78 proceeding petitioner seeks an order prohibiting County Court and City Court from reconsidering the merits of City Court\u2019s order, which the District Attorney did not appeal,t granting petitioner a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>and resentencing petitioner with respect to earlier convictions for the purposes of appeal, and further seeks an order compelling County Court to entertain \u25a0p\u00e9titioner\u2019S appeal from the earlier convictions. Where the District Attorney has not appealed from an order granting a defendant a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>and resentencing defendant with respect to an earlier conviction for the purposes of appeal, the propriety of that order cannot be reviewed upon defendant\u2019s subsequent appeal from the conviction <em>(People </em>v. <em>Auth, </em>43 A D 2d 790; <em>People </em>V. <em>Jackson, </em>36 A D 2d 1008). Thus County Court\u2019s use of petitioner\u2019s appeal from the reentered 1969 convictions as a vehicle for reviewing City Court\u2019s order of resentencing, which had not been appealed by the District, Attorney, was an unlawful use of the proceeding, and an article 78 proceeding in the nature of prohibition therefore lies <em>(Matter of People </em>v. <em>King, </em>36 N Y 2d \u2014). Similarly, since City Court\u2019s order directing further hearings on the issues previously determined by it in the <em>coram nobis </em>proceeding was based upon County Court\u2019s order, it too is subject to the extraordinary remedy of prohibition. County Court, having mo authority to review the merits of the <em>coram nobis </em>proceeding, must entertain petitioner\u2019s appeal from th\u00e9 earlier convictions. (Article 78 proceeding to prohibit enforcement of order.) Present \u2014 Marsh, P. J., Cardamone, Mahoney, Del Yecchio and Witmer/JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
