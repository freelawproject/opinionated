Morgan appeals from the March 24, 2017 Judgment Entry of the Ashland County Court of Common Pleas. Appellee is the state of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This case arose on April 2, 2016 around 4:00 a.m. when the Ashland Police Department (A.P.D.) received a call about a man yelling, screaming, and running down the middle of the road in the area of Cottage and West Fourth Street. While en route, a second call came in from a Taco Bell restaurant in the same area. An employee reported that a man walked up to the drive-through window and told workers he had been attacked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Inferring the two incidents were related, Sgt. Bloodheart of the A.P.D. responded to the Taco Bell parking lot and encountered appellant, who said he had been asleep nearby at 606 \u00bd Cottage Street, his sister's house, when he was awoken by a \"flurry of punches\" and he fled the house. Appellant said he was living at his sister's residence. Bloodheart observed appellant to be highly paranoid and agitated. Appellant didn't know who attacked him and Bloodheart observed no physical injuries or other evidence corroborating the tale of the attack. Based upon his training and experience, Bloodheart believed appellant was under the influence of illegal drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Officers brought appellant back to his sister's house and knocked on the door. When no one answered, appellant purportedly told officers he lived there and they could go in. Once inside, officers made contact with appellant's sister and her boyfriend. The boyfriend testified at the suppression hearing that he gave police permission to search the house. In the bedroom used by appellant, police found syringes, a razor blade with white residue on it, cotton swabs, and small Ziploc baggies. Inside a cologne box, they found a glass pipe containing white residue. Appellant admitted the syringes were his and said he used them to inject heroin. He denied use of methamphetamine and said his agitated behavior was due to anxiety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellant was charged by indictment with one count of aggravated drug possession [methamphetamine] pursuant to R.C. 2925.11(A), a felony of the fifth degree [Count I]; one count of possession of drug abuse instruments pursuant to R.C. 2925.12(A), a misdemeanor of the second degree [Count II]; and one count of illegal use or possession of drug paraphernalia pursuant to R.C. 2925.14(C)(1), a misdemeanor of the fourth degree [Count III].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant was arrested on the indictment on July 26, 2016. He remained incarcerated throughout these proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} At a bond hearing on July 27, 2016, the trial court determined appellant was indigent and appointed trial counsel. Appellant was arraigned on July 29, 2016, and entered counseled pleas of not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Defense trial counsel filed a demand for discovery on August 11, 2016, and appellee entered a \"Discovery Certification\" on August 18, 2016, followed by a \"Supplemental Certification\" on August 22, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Defense trial counsel filed a motion to suppress on September 16, 2016. Also on that date, the parties filed a \"Joint Pretrial Statement\" noting a trial date of October 18, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On October 11, 2016, the trial court entered a judgment entry scheduling a hearing on appellant's motion to suppress on December 2, 2016, and vacating the trial date of October 18, noting \"* * * speedy trial time in this case is tolled from the date of the filing of the Motion to Suppress pending a decision on the Defendant's Motion to Suppress.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On October 25, 2016, defense trial counsel filed a motion for bond reduction. Also on that date, defense trial counsel\n   filed a demand for specific discovery, citing the \"Ashland Police Division 911 CAD report/dispatch report and recording of radio traffic beginning April 2, 2016 upon the time of the call to law enforcement (approximately 04:04 hours) until the Defendant's arrest (approximately 05:55 hours),\" and a request for bill of particulars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On October 26, 2016, appellant filed a number of pro se motions, including an \"Addendum to Discovery and Motion for Bill of Particulars\"; a \"Motion to Modify Bail (Hearing Requested) (Addendum)\"; a \"Request for Notice of Intent to Use Evidence\"; an \"Addendum for Motion to Suppress Evidence and Return Seized Property\"; and a \"Motion to Preserve Video/Audio Evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Also on October 26, 2016, appellee filed an objection to appellant's motion to reduce bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On October 31, 2016, appellee filed a response in opposition to appellant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On November 4, 2016, appellee filed a \"Supplemental Discovery # 2 Certification\" and a bill of particulars. The discovery certification cites \"Exhibits E-F.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On November 7, 2016, appellant filed a number of pro se motions, including a \"Motion to Appoint Co-Council (sic),\" a \"Motion to Compel (Procure Legal Material),\" a \"Motion to Dismiss,\" and a \"Motion to Compel (Exculpatory Evidence/Issuance of Subpoena).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 17} On November 28, 2016, appellant filed two pro se motions, an \"Elucidative Record to Support Excessive Tolling\" and a \"Motion for Injunction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On December 1, 2016, appellee filed a \"Supplemental Discovery # 3 Certification.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 19} On December 16, 2016, appellee filed a supplemental response in opposition to appellant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Also on December 16, 2016, defense trial counsel filed a post-hearing brief in support of appellant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 21} On December 22, 2016, the trial court entered a judgment entry overruling appellant's pro se motions, noting \"* * * *. The Court cannot take action on pro se correspondences where the Defendant is represented by counsel. The Court further notes that this Defendant has been appointed counsel in this matter. If Defendant seeks action, a proper motion shall be filed on the Defendant's behalf by his appointed defense counsel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 22} On February 13, 2017, appellant sent the trial court an inmate kyte (\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ) moving the court to dismiss the matter because the motion to suppress had not been ruled upon within 120 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 23} On March 3, 2017, defense trial counsel filed a motion to dismiss on the basis of denial of a speedy trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 24} On March 6, 2017, the trial court issued a judgment entry overruling appellant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 25} On March 7, 2017, the trial court issued a judgment entry overruling appellant's motion to dismiss and setting the matter for jury trial on March 22, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 26} On March 15, 2017, appellee filed a \"Supplemental Discovery # 4 Certification,\" a motion in limine, and a notice to defendant pursuant to Rule 404(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 27} On March 16, 2017, appellee filed a \"Supplemental Discovery # 5 Certification.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 28} On March 17, 2017, appellee filed a response to appellant's motion in limine, a \"Supplemental Discovery # 6 Certification\" and a \"Supplemental Discovery # 7 Certification.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 29} On March 20, 2017, defense trial counsel filed a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law as to appellant's motion to suppress and motion to dismiss. Also on that date, defense trial counsel filed a demand for specific discovery, citing \"[t]he recording made in the Ashland County Jail on April 2, 2016 between [appellant] and Sergeant Bloodheart,\" and a motion in limine regarding evidence of appellant's prison numbers and heroin use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 30} On March 21, 2017, appellee filed a \"Supplemental Discovery # 8 Certification.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 31} On March 22, 2017, via judgment entry, the trial court overruled appellant's request for written findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The matter proceeded to trial by jury on March 22, 2017, and appellant was found not guilty upon Count I and guilty upon Counts II and III. The trial court immediately sentenced appellant to a jail term of 90 days upon Count II and 30 days upon Count III with credit for time served. Appellant was ordered to pay fines of $100 each upon Counts II and III plus court costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Appellant now appeals from the trial court's March 24, 2017 judgment entry of conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Appellant raises two assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 35} \"I.

A person charged with a felony must be brought to trial within 270 days unless the right to a speedy trial is waived. R.C. 2945.71(D)(2). Appellant did not waive time. If a person is held in jail in lieu of bond, then each day that the suspect is in custody counts as 3 days. R.C. 2945.71(E). Appellant remained incarcerated throughout the proceedings.

Appellant's trial began on March 22, 2017 [238 days later]. Appellee asserts that a number of tolling events intervened, and appellant agrees that some defense motions tolled speedy-trial time. Upon our consideration of the record, we concur with the parties' acknowledgment that resolution\n   of this issue turns on whether speedy-trial time is tolled against appellant for any of the 168 days it took the trial court to rule on the motion to suppress. (Other arguably tolling events occurred during the procedural history of the case, but those are overlapped by the time period that the motion to suppress remained pending.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Appellant filed his motion to suppress on September 16, 2016; on October 11, 2016, the trial court scheduled the matter for an evidentiary hearing to be held on December 2, 2016; and on October 31, 2016, appellee responded with a motion in opposition. The hearing took place on December 2 with appellant raising a single issue of whether his consent to the search of the bedroom he used at his sister's house was valid. The trial court overruled the motion to suppress on March 6, 2017 via a brief conclusory judgment entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Appellant's motion to suppress tolled the speedy trial clock, but not indefinitely. Motions filed by an accused in a criminal prosecution toll the speedy trial period only to the extent that the delay is reasonable and necessary for the court to rule on the same.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Each case of a claimed speedy-trial violation turns on its unique facts. \"In cases such as these, it is difficult, if not unwise, to establish a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule of what constitutes 'reasonableness' beyond the ninety-day stricture of R.C. 2945.71. Invariably, resolution of such a question depends on the peculiar facts and circumstances of a particular case.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, in the present case, over seven months elapsed between the time appellant filed his motion to suppress and the date the trial court rendered its decision. Nothing appears on the record which would justify this amount of time. We recognize that not all motions made to a trial court lend themselves to prompt disposition.
