Failure to object to jury instructions regarding accomplice liability for murder\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [10] Lee was charged, as a principal, with the murder of Victor Hill, and the State also tried Lee as an accomplice to that murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lee contends that the jury instructions regarding accomplice liability for murder\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   were improper because they did not inform the jury that, in order to find Lee guilty as an accomplice, it must find that those whom he was aiding acted with the knowing or intentional mens rea\n   for murder. In support, he cites the Court of Appeals case\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9042258\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/820/691/#p695\">\n    820 N.E.2d 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 695 (Ind. Ct.

However, that decision was vacated by our Supreme Court, which specifically held that a defendant can be found guilty of murder for intentionally aiding and abetting a principal to kill a victim so long as the principal killed the victim and the defendant knew or intended that the victim would be killed.\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

The \"\n   <em>\n    Spradlin\n   </em>\n   rule\" is necessary because of \"the higher sentence range for attempted murder in combination with the ambiguity involved in the proof of that crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Ramsey v.

Lee maintains that, because the instruction quoting the charging information on murder included the word \"knowingly,\" it erroneously led the jury to believe it could convict him of attempted murder upon a showing that he merely \"knew\" he was acting, regardless of his intent in acting. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [12] Lee is correct that an instruction that informs the jury that a \"knowingly\" mens rea, alone, is sufficient to establish guilt, as a principal, of attempted murder\n   constitutes fundamental error.\n   <em>\n    Spradlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10992908\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/569/948/#p950\">\n    569 N.E.2d at 950-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, the jury instructions as a whole informed the jury that, in order to find Lee guilty of attempted murder, \"it is not enough that [he] engaged in the proscribed conduct,\" i.e., that he acted knowingly. Tr. R. Vol. I at 156. The instruction then states that the jury must find the defendant acted \"with the specific intention of accomplishing the killing\" of another human being.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9453188\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/765/1245/#p1252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The instruction on attempted murder also stated that the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt Lee's \"intent to kill\" the victim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 153.
