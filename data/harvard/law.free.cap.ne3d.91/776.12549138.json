As it appeared we may not have jurisdiction to consider this matter because the order from which they are appealing may not be a final appealable order, we ordered the Starrs to file a memorandum addressing this jurisdictional issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Magistrate's Order, November 1, 2017. In response, the Starrs filed a memorandum in support of jurisdiction which contends that the order affected \"a substantial right\" to intervene in the proceeding. The Starrs concede that grandparents have no legal right of access to their grandchildren, but argue that the Ohio General Assembly has provided statutory\n   procedures that \"impact the role of grandparents\" in neglect and dependency cases and therefore gives grandparents the right to intervene as a party. They also contend that they stood in loco parentis and have a right to be joined as parties to the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 2} We find that the trial court's order did not meet the requirements of R.C. 2505.02 ; it was not final and appealable. A grandparent has no \"substantial right\" to intervene in juvenile custody proceedings. Therefore, the order is not a final, appealable order under R.C. 2505.02(B)(2). The order does not grant or deny a provisional remedy under R.C. 2505.02(B)(4) because the Starrs' motion to intervene was not for any ancillary purpose. Instead, it was filed so that they could directly participate as parties in the underlying custody proceedings and obtain custody of T.S. We lack jurisdiction to address the merits and dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In August 2017, the agency filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Jackson County, Juvenile Division, concerning T.S.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging neglect and dependency and seeking temporary custody, as well as emergency immediate custody. The agency alleged that T.S. lacked adequate parental care because of illegal drug use by T.S.'s parents. The agency alleged that it had discussed with the parents the possibility of relatives to serve as alternative care providers but neither parent identified any relatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The juvenile court granted the agency immediate emergency custody and the child was placed in foster care. An adjudication hearing to determine whether the child was neglected and dependent was set for October 25, 2017. In September 2017, the Starrs filed a motion for temporary and legal custody pursuant to R.C. 2151.353(A)(3), which allows any \"person\" to file a motion requesting legal custody. The Starrs contended that they are T.S.'s maternal grandmother and step-grandfather and have acted in loco parentis for T.S. In addition, the Starrs filed a motion to intervene as parties in the case, claiming that they are entitled to intervene because they, and not foster parents, are the proper persons to have temporary custody over T.S.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On September 29, 2017, the trial court denied the Starrs' motion to intervene. The Starrs' appealed the order denying their motion to intervene on October 23, 2017. The juvenile court docket indicates that no further activity has occurred in the juvenile court since the Starrs filed their appeal. There is no indication that the adjudicatory hearing set for October 25, 2017 occurred, the trial court has issued no further entries or orders, and the Starrs' motion for legal custody is still pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II. LAW AND ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A. Jurisdiction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Ohio law provides that appellate courts have jurisdiction to review only final orders or judgments. Section 3(B)(2), Article IV, Ohio Constitution ; R.C. 2505.02. If an order is not final and appealable, an appellate court has no jurisdiction to review the matter and it must be dismissed. \"An order of a court is a final appealable order only if the requirements\n   of both R.C. 2505.02 and, if applicable, Civ.R. 54(B), are met.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

It provides that the agency could ask the court to issue an \"order that the child be placed in the legal custody of a relative or other interested individual.\" It does not give grandparents a legal right to or a legally protectable interest in custody, and the fact that the court is considering a relative does not make that relative a party to the proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2151.28(B)(1) (After a child is adjudicated a neglected or dependent child, the court must consider whether there are any relatives willing to be temporary custodians. However, the statute explicitly states, \"The court's consideration of a relative for appointment as a temporary custodian does not make that relative a party to the proceedings.\"). The other subsection the Starrs cite is R.C. 2151.415(F), which allows the court or a party to the action to move to modify or terminate a prior dispositional order and request that the child be placed in the legal custody of a relative or other interested individual, among other possible outcomes.

Rather, they sought to intervene so that they could be parties to the underlying juvenile custody proceedings and participate directly in the proceedings, i.e., contest the trial court's dispositional orders and obtain temporary and legal custody of T.S.

The court in\n   <em>\n    In re C.J.\n   </em>\n   did not explain how the appellant's motion to intervene was attendant upon or aided \"another proceeding\" in the underlying custody\n   action.

Additionally, at least one court has distinguished among orders denying intervention in\n   <em>\n    emergency, temporary\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    permanent\n   </em>\n   custody proceedings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Accordingly, we find that the denial of Grandfather's third motion to intervene was a final, appealable order, because the ruling was made during the permanent custody phase of the proceeding. Grandfather's first two motions to intervene were made during the emergency custody and temporary custody phases, respectively, and the denials of these two motions were interlocutory orders; thus, res judicata does not bar our review of the case at hand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    In re N.M.\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 12 (appellate court reviewed the order denying grandfather's motion to intervene before the juvenile court (1) issued a final order awarding permanent custody or (2) ruled on the grandfather's R.C. 2151.353(A)(3) custody motion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Because we find a grandparent has no \"substantial right\" to intervene in a juvenile custody proceeding, we need not make a distinction between the emergency, temporary, and permanent phases of the proceeding for our analysis under R.C. 2505.02(B)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   IV. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 30} A grandparent has no \"substantial right\" to intervene in a juvenile custody proceeding. The Starrs' motion to intervene was not made as part of a provisional remedy as it was not attendant upon or an aid to another proceeding. Therefore, the juvenile court's order does not affect a substantial right and is not a final appealable order under R.C. 2505.02(B)(2) or (4) and we lack jurisdiction over this appeal.\n   <strong>\n    APPEAL DISMISSED. COSTS TO APPELLANT.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 31} The clerk shall serve a copy of this order on all counsel of record and unrepresented parties at their last known\n   addresses by ordinary mail and record service on the docket.\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Abele, J. and McFarland, J.: Concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    A second child was also named in the complaint but this appeal does not concern that child.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The Starrs' motion to intervene cited no legal authority in support of this motion, so we presume they filed it pursuant to Civ.R. 24.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Additionally, the Starrs contend that the order denying their motion to intervene bars them from seeking custody and visitation in their other lawsuits. They argue that they \"may be deemed to have made a collateral attack on this order in their other actions.\" Any potential collateral attack issues that might arise in other cases is too speculative, remote and unripe for our consideration. Moreover, it is irrelevant to our finality analysis under R.C. 2505.02.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
