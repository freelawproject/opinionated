Appellee is the state of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The following facts are adduced from appellee's bill of particulars. Appellant began doing business as Newark Foods, LLC in Licking County, Ohio, and in early 2015, authorities learned the company was dealing in stolen goods for resale purposes and exchanging food stamp benefit cards for cash. During an investigation, confidential informants were sent into the store offering stolen goods for sale or food stamp cards at a deeply discounted rate. Appellant agreed to purchase the food stamp cards in exchange for less than half of the cash value of the cards. Appellant would then use the benefits cards to purchase items from various Licking County stores to stock the shelves at Newark Foods, LLC. Appellant directed employees and associates to engage in similar activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Between April 1, 2015 and May 26, 2015, appellant personally and/or in complicity with employees and associates purchased in excess of $1,000.00 of what store employees believed to be stolen goods for resale within their store. At times, appellant directed individuals on specific items to steal to be re-sold in his store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On June 4, 2015, appellant was charged by indictment with two counts of illegal use of supplemental nutrition or WIC program benefits pursuant to R.C. 2913.46(B), both felonies of the fifth degree, and one count of receiving stolen property pursuant to R.C. 2913.51(A), a felony of the fifth degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On November 24, 2015, appellant appeared before the trial court with counsel and an interpreter and changed his pleas to ones of guilty. The Judgment Entry of appellant's change of plea and sentencing notes that appellant was advised the offenses to which he entered pleas of guilty may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from the United States, and/or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States. The trial court imposed a sentence of three years of community control, including a term of 60 days of local incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On April 22, 2016, appellant filed a motion to withdraw his guilty pleas arguing he received ineffective assistance of counsel because he was not advised of\n   \"mandatory deportation.\" Appellant's motion is accompanied by an affidavit stating his trial counsel spoke to him for 15 minutes before his plea, told him he would not be able to become a citizen as a result of the plea, and said nothing else regarding immigration consequences. Appellant further attested that he is now \"in mandatory detention with ICE and in deportation proceedings,\" and had he been advised of the mandatory deportation, he would not have entered pleas of guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellee responded with a memorandum contra and exhibits including a transcript of the change-of-plea hearing; the evidence that would have been admitted against appellant at trial; and, in a supplement, an affidavit of appellant's trial counsel and a transcript of a hearing in 1997 in which he pled to similar offenses in the state of Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On October 11, 2016, the trial court overruled appellant's motion to withdraw plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellant now appeals from the trial court's Judgment Entry of October 11, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Appellant raises one assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} \"A PLEA THAT IS INVOLUNTARY, UNKNOWING, AND DUE TO THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF COUNSEL MUST BE VACATED.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellant argues he should have been permitted to withdraw his guilty pleas because defense counsel's representation was constitutionally deficient, precluding appellant from entering his plea knowingly because he was not specifically advised deportation is mandatory. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Appellant filed his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1, but we first note the trial court complied with R.C. 2943.031. The Ohio Supreme Court has reiterated its stance that the seriousness of possible effects of convictions on noncitizens requires trial courts to observe \"a substantive statutory right for certain criminal defendants and that * * * right therefore prevails over the general procedural provision of Crim.R. 32.1.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The applicable portions of R.C. 2943.031(A) require a trial court, prior to accepting a plea of guilty to a felony indictment, to address the defendant personally and to provide the following advisement to the defendant that shall be entered in the record of the court, and determine that the defendant understands the advisement: \"If you are not a citizen of the United States, you are hereby advised that conviction of the offense to which you are pleading guilty (or no contest, when applicable) may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The transcript of the change-of-plea hearing filed by appellee indicates that on November 24, 2015, appellant was sworn by the trial court and with the aid of an interpreter, answered questions from the court including whether he is a citizen of the United States, to which he answered no, and the trial court responded, \"* * * [I]f you are not a citizen of the United States, you are hereby advised that the conviction of the offense to which you are pleading guilty may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization\n   pursuant to the law of the United States. * * * *.\" (T. 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Appellant argues defense trial counsel did not properly advise him that his guilty plea would result in mandatory deportation and if he had known this, he would not have entered a guilty plea; defense counsel's ineffective assistance thus precluded him from entering a guilty plea in a knowing, voluntary and intelligent manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Motions to withdraw a plea of guilty based upon the failure to warn of immigration consequences are governed by R.C. 2943.031(D), but in the instant case the trial court gave the required warning. We thus turn to appellant's argument pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1, that he was not properly advised by the trial court or by defense trial counsel that deportation was mandatory upon his convictions. We note appellant avers in his motion to withdraw plea and in his argument here that he is presently held by immigrations authorities without bond, awaiting deportation, but we note the record of the instant case is devoid of any evidence that his alleged mandatory deportation is premised upon the instant convictions. As appellee pointed out in its memorandum contra the motion to withdraw plea, appellant has at least one prior conviction of a similar welfare-fraud related offense in Connecticut from 1997. Appellant further argues upon removal from the United States, \"he will be killed as a result of this plea,\" and we note there is no support for this assertion in the record of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Appellant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea was filed pursuant to Criminal Rule 32.1, stating: \"A motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or no contest may be made only before sentence is imposed; but to correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea.\" The standard upon which the trial court is to review a request for a change of plea after sentence is whether there is a need to correct a manifest injustice.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The affidavit of defense trial counsel offered by appellee offers more information, however, and states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   * * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   6) A copy of the discovery was provided to [appellant].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   7) I had several meetings with [appellant] at my office to discuss the provided discovery and trial strategy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   8) Additionally, [appellant] advised me that he was not a United States citizen but held status as a permanent resident alien.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   9) I advised [appellant] that a guilty plea may have negative consequence[s] on his ability to become a citizen of the United States and may form the basis for deportation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   10) I advised [appellant] that I did not practice immigration law but that I could provide a referral to an immigration attorney if he wished to discuss the matter further.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   11) On the day of [appellant's] plea I thoroughly reviewed the guilty plea form with [appellant] including the possibility that the plea could prevent [appellant] from becoming a United States citizen and could form the basis for deportation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   * * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Unlike trial counsel in the\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   case, therefore, appellant's attorney did not advise him that he would not be deported, but rather his attorney advised him before he entered his plea that his conviction carried a strong likelihood of negative immigration consequences. We find this case comparable to\n   <em>\n    State v. Hrnjak\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist. Summit No. 26554,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-5726\">\n    2013-Ohio-5726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206843578\">\n    2013 WL 6843578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17, in which defense trial counsel advised an appellant he faced likely unspecified immigration consequences:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   While neither counsel nor the trial court used the word \"mandatory\" or explicitly stated that he would definitely be deported, it is clear from the record that Hrnjak was advised that there was a substantial risk of deportation if he pleaded guilty to the charge. It is equally clear from the record that Hrnjak chose to proceed with the plea despite having been told he would likely be deported. This is not a case wherein the defendant was misadvised about the risk of deportation, such as in\n   <em>\n    Padilla,\n   </em>\n   or not advised at all. This is a case wherein the defendant proceeded to change his plea despite being told that he could be deported as a consequence of his conviction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Although appellant was not advised deportation would be mandatory upon conviction, he was aware deportation was a possibility as a consequence of the negotiated plea and a subsequent conviction.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Counsel never advised appellant that no deportation proceeding would result from his guilty pleas; rather, counsel made appellant aware that deportation was a possibility. Based upon this court's review, we find no error with the trial court's determination that counsel's representation did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness.\n   <em>\n    State v.

As Justice Alito recognized in his concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , \"determining whether a particular crime is an 'aggravated felony' * * * is not an easy task. * * * Defense counsel who consults a guidebook on whether a particular crime is an 'aggravated felony' will often find that the answer is not 'easily ascertained.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellant provides no authority for this statement. Appellant entered pleas of guilty to three fifth-degree felonies. The prescribed prison term for a felony of the fifth degree is six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, or twelve months. R.C. 2929.14(A). The definition of an \"aggravated felony\" which subjects an alien to mandatory deportation pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1226(c)(1)(B) includes theft offenses and receipt of stolen property \"for which the term of imprisonment at (\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ) least one year.\" 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(G). The trial court in the instant case overruled the motion to withdraw appellant's guilty plea in part because \"the offenses in this case are not aggravated felonies as defined in 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43) since the term of imprisonment is not\n   <em>\n    at least\n   </em>\n   one year.\" (Emphasis in original), Judgment Entry, 3.
