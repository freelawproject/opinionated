We hold that when identification is an issue in a criminal case and the identifying witness and defendant appear to be of different races, upon request, a party is entitled to a charge on cross-racial identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 16, 2011, a white man in his 20s was walking in Brooklyn when he was approached by a stranger, a short-haired black man. The stranger asked to know the time, and the young man retrieved his cell phone. The stranger snatched the cell phone and fled. The victim gave chase, until the robber pulled out a knife and told him to stay where he was. The victim described his attacker as an African-American man, about six feet tall, weighing about 170 pounds, and wearing a baseball cap and a hooded sweatshirt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ten days later, a white teenager was walking in the same neighborhood of Brooklyn, sending a text message from his cell phone, when a man behind him asked the time. The teenager looked back over his shoulder and observed a stranger, a black man, wearing a winter coat and a hat with flaps that covered his ears and the top of his head. The teenager looked at his cell phone and told the stranger the time. The stranger then grabbed the phone. The teenager did not immediately let go, and the robber stabbed him. The robber then took the phone and fled. Before the victim was taken to the hospital, he described the perpetrator to the police as an African-American man, about 18 years old and approximately six feet, two inches tall, and he gave an estimated weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant Otis Boone, a black man who was short-haired, 19 years old, and 6 feet tall, and weighed about 170 pounds, was suspected of committing the crimes. On March 14, 2011, defendant was placed in two six-person lineups and the victims separately identified him. The teenager was initially unsure whether defendant was his attacker, but identified him after he spoke the words \"What time is it?\" Defendant and the fillers in the lineups all wore hats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Neither cell phone was recovered, and no physical evidence linked defendant to the crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant was charged with two counts of robbery in the first degree and other crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At defendant's jury trial in July 2012, during the charge conference, defense counsel requested that the jury be instructed on cross-racial identification. Supreme Court denied the request, on the basis that there had been no expert testimony or cross-examination concerning \"a lack of reliability of cross-racial identification.\" The trial court gave the jury an expanded charge on eyewitness identification, based on the pertinent Criminal Jury Instruction (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CJI 2d [NY] Identification [One Witness] ), omitting the part of the pattern instruction addressing cross-racial identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The jury found defendant guilty of both robbery counts. On appeal from the judgment of conviction and sentence, defendant argued that Supreme Court denied him a fair trial by refusing to charge the jury on the inaccuracy of cross-racial identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Appellate Division modified the judgment, as to the sentence, and affirmed as modified, holding that Supreme Court had not erred in declining to instruct the jury on cross-racial identification (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265421\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/129/1099/\">\n    129 A.D.3d 1099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265421\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/129/1099/\">\n    11 N.Y.S.3d 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2d Dept.2015] ).

Inaccurate identifications, especially misidentifications by a single eyewitness, play a role in the vast majority of post-conviction DNA-based\n   exonerations in the United States. Indeed, a recent report by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that \"at least one mistaken eyewitness identification was present in almost three-quarters\" of DNA exonerations (Identifying the Culprit: Assessing Eyewitness Identification 11 [2014] ). According to amicus The Innocence Project, about 70% of DNA exonerations nationally involve eyewitness misidentification (Innocence Project, DNA Exonerations in the United States, https://www.innocenceproject.org/dna-exonerations-in-the-united-states [last accessed December 1, 2017], cached at http:// www.nycourts.gov/reporter/webdocs/DNA Exonerations in the United States - Innocence Project.pdf).

Generally, people have significantly greater difficulty accurately identifying members of other races than members of their own race. According to a meta-analysis of 39 psychological studies of the phenomenon, participants were \"1.56 times more likely to falsely identify a novel other-race face when compared with performance on own-race faces\" (C.A. Meissner &amp; J.C. Brigham,\n   <em>\n    Thirty years of investigating the other-race effect in memory for faces: A meta-analytic review\n   </em>\n   , 7 Psychology, Public Policy, and Law 3, 15 [2001] ). The phenomenon is known as the cross-race effect or own-race bias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Our trial level courts have recognized the general scientific acceptance of the cross-race effect (\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

Indeed, in a survey of psychologists with expertise in eyewitness identification, 90% of the experts believed that empirical evidence of the cross-race effect was sufficiently reliable to be presented in court (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   John C. Brigham et al.,\n   <em>\n    The Influence of Race on Eyewitness Memory\n   </em>\n   in Rod C.L. Lindsey et al., Handbook of Eyewitness Psychology 258 [2014], citing S.M. Kassin et al.,\n   <em>\n    On the \"General Acceptance\" of eyewitness testimony research: A new survey of the experts\n   </em>\n   , 56 American Psychologist 405 [2001] ). The phenomenon has been described as \"[o]ne of the best documented examples of face recognition errors\" (S.G. Young et al.,\n   <em>\n    Perception and Motivation in Face Recognition: A Critical Review of Theories of the Cross-Race Effect\n   </em>\n   , 16 Personality &amp; Social Psychology Rev 116, 116 [2012] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   There is, however, a significant disparity between what the psychological research shows and what uninstructed jurors believe. One study showed that only 47% of jurors were familiar with the cross-race effect (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tanja R. Benton et al.,\n   <em>\n    Eyewitness Memory is Still Not Common Sense: Comparing Jurors, Judges and Law Enforcement to Eyewitness Experts\n   </em>\n   , 20 Applied Cognitive Psychology 115 [2006] ). A survey of over 1,000 jurors in Washington, D.C., cited by amicus the American Psychological Association, found that \"[a] large plurality of the survey respondents (48%) thought cross-race and same-race identifications are of equal reliability, and many of the other [survey] respondents\n   either did not know or thought a cross-racial identification would be more reliable (11%). Only 36% of the survey respondents understand that a cross-racial identification may be less reliable\" (Richard S. Schmechel et al.,\n   <em>\n    Beyond the Ken? Testing Jurors' Understanding of Eyewitness Reliability Evidence\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20Jurimetrics%20J.%20177\">\n    46 Jurimetrics J 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200 [2006] ). These findings demonstrate that, while the cross-race effect is a matter of common sense and experience for some jurors, it is by no means a universal belief shared by all. The need for a charge on the cross-race effect is evident. The question becomes how this instruction is best given.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As to each crime of which he was convicted, defendant, who is black, was found guilty entirely on the basis of the testimony of a single white witness identifying defendant as the person who had robbed him. Nevertheless, Supreme Court refused to\n   give the requested charge instructing the jury on the relative inaccuracy of cross-racial identifications. One of Supreme Court's reasons for refusing to give the charge was that such an instruction should not be given if there has been no expert testimony on the subject. We reject this rationale and hold that Supreme Court erred in relying on it. For this reason and because the error was not harmless, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Expert testimony on the cross-race effect is not a precondition of a jury charge on the subject.

Neither the parties nor the amici in this case contend that trial courts have ignored or discounted the \"better practice\" that we urged trial courts to adopt in\n   <em>\n    Whalen\n   </em>\n   in 1983. We assume that, when identification is in issue and an expanded charge on identification is requested, trial courts, exercising their discretion, regularly give an instruction based on the pattern charges CJI 2d (N.Y.) Identification (One Witness) or CJI 2d (N.Y.) Identification (Witness Plus), telling the jury to examine and evaluate the various factors upon which the accuracy of identification depends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Whalen\n   </em>\n   Court stressed its concern with \"[t]he potential for inaccuracy in visual identification evidence\" (\n   <em>\n    Whalen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4390645\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/59/273/\">\n    59 N.Y.2d at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=464%20N.Y.S.2d%20454\">\n    464 N.Y.S.2d 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=451%20N.E.2d%20212\">\n    451 N.E.2d 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and that concern underpins our decision here. Moreover, no charge on cross-racial identification was at issue in\n   <em>\n    Whalen\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Knight.\n   </em>\n   These precedents do not directly conflict with our decision today, and we leave in place their approach to eyewitness identification charges\n   <em>\n    in general\n   </em>\n   : whether to give the charge is discretionary, but it is better practice to grant defendant's request for such a charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In the matter of the cross-race effect, however, the recent developments in the understanding of wrongful convictions and cross-racial eyewitness identifications described above demand a new approach.

Our trial courts are entrusted to employ various safeguards-including pretrial review of identification procedures, expert testimony, and jury instructions-to shield jurors from unreliable evidence and to guide them in assessing the accuracy of an identification. Having presided over the proceedings, and having heard the evidence and the arguments, the trial court is best situated to appropriately assist the jury in assessing the accuracy of an identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We have therefore held that, as with most jury instructions, a defendant's request for a particular charge on eyewitness identification testimony is \"a matter for the Trial Judge's discretion\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

Today, the majority advances a new rule that purports to \"require[ ]\" a cross-racial identification charge upon request, while vaguely suggesting that the trial court retains some undefined discretion to deny the charge where, for instance, identification is not \"at issue\" (majority op. at 535-536, 69 N.Y.S.3d at 223-25, 91 N.E.3d at 1202-04). This illusion of discretion does a disservice to trial judges, who are tasked with implementing the majority's apparently mandatory rule while facing the harsh remedy of automatic error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Under the circumstances of this case, I agree that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant's request for a cross-racial identification charge. I write separately because I would reaffirm, in no uncertain terms, the longstanding principle that the decision to deliver a cross-racial identification charge-like any other identification charge-remains in the sound discretion of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Defendant Otis Boone was charged with two counts of robbery in the first degree based on two separate incidents. The victim of the first robbery alleged that the assailant approached\n   him on the street, grabbed his cell phone, and fled. The victim began chasing the assailant, but stopped when the assailant turned around and wielded a knife. The robbery lasted approximately one minute. Shortly thereafter, the victim canvassed the area with police officers and reviewed approximately two hundred mugshots, but he did not recognize the assailant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The second victim similarly alleged that the assailant approached him on the street and attempted to grab his cell phone. When the victim held onto the phone, the assailant stabbed him in the back and fled. The second robbery lasted less than one minute.

The victim told officers that the individual was not the assailant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The two victims subsequently identified defendant in separate lineups. Defendant was arrested and eventually proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   After the close of the evidence, during the charge conference, defense counsel requested a cross-racial identification charge, noting that \"identifications were made by white males of a black male.\" The trial court declined defendant's request, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \"I am familiar with the [\n   <em>\n    LeGrand\n   </em>\n   ] case and its progeny, but there was no testimony before this jury regarding any cross-racial identification issues.

Accordingly, until today, both\n   <em>\n    Whalen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   remained good law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Proclaiming that cross-racial identification issues nonetheless \"demand[ ] a new approach,\" the majority dictates that trial courts are now \"\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to give, upon request, during final instructions, a jury charge on the cross-race effect\" (majority op. at 526, 535, 69 N.Y.S.3d at 217, 224, 91 N.E.3d at 1196, 1203 [emphasis added] ). But the majority hedges. Seemingly aware of the countless implications accompanying a mandatory charge, the majority provides that trial courts may deny the charge where (1) the identifying witness and defendant do not \"appear to be of different races,\" or (2) the witness's identification of the defendant is not \"at issue\" (majority op. at 535, 69 N.Y.S.3d at 224, 91 N.E.3d at 1203).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   On paper, those purported caveats remain undefined and unexplained. In practice, they are meaningless. As a result, trial courts will now be \"\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to give\" a prescribed \"jury charge on the cross-race effect\" (majority op. at 535, 69 N.Y.S.3d at 224, 91 N.E.3d at 1203 [emphasis added] ), regardless of whether cross-racial identification issues are implicated at trial. Not only is this approach unprecedented-we do not mandate any other charge relating to identification evidence-it inhibits our trial courts in a manner that may frustrate jury deliberations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   With regard to the first exception, the majority states that the charge is required only where the identifying witness and defendant \"appear to be\" of different races, yet instructs that \"\n   <em>\n    the jury\n   </em>\n   should consider whether there is a difference in race between the defendant and the witness who identified the defendant\" (majority op. at 535, 69 N.Y.S.3d at 223-24, 91 N.E.3d at 1202-03 [emphasis added] ). To the extent that determination is for the trial court, the majority gives no guidance to those judges tasked with implementing this new cross-racial assessment. To the extent the majority leaves that determination to the jury, the charge effectively becomes mandatory: it will be required even where, as a factual matter, an identification was not cross-racial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The second, and more vague, threshold determination requires the trial court to consider whether the witness's identification\n   of the defendant is \"at issue.\" To the extent the majority implies that the trial judge may, based on all the facts and circumstances, decide as a threshold matter that identity is not \"at issue\"-and deny the charge on that basis-that is simply discretion by another name, contorted into a \"mandatory\" rule imbued with discretionary exceptions, and carrying\n   the threat of per se error. But the majority provides no clear guidance as to how that threshold determination should be made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In a footnote, the majority borrows language from\n   <em>\n    People v. Boyer\n   </em>\n   , apparently crafting a \"confirmatory identification\" exception where the trial court determines that \"there is no risk of misidentification\" (majority op. at 536 n. 6, 69 N.Y.S.3d at 224 n. 6, 91 N.E.3d at 1203 n. 6, citing People v.

It also overcorrects: the rule requires a cross-racial identification charge to be given even where it is likely to confuse, distract, or mislead the jury. Mandating the charge-even in cases where it is misleading, irrelevant, or otherwise unwarranted-creates a substantial risk of juror confusion and serves only to hinder, rather than aid, the jury's critical factfinding function.

The majority's rule also threatens the viability of expert testimony on the cross-race effect, which is permissible only where the topic is \"beyond the ken of the average juror\" ( People v.

A mandatory rule also spawns retroactivity issues, which carry serious and sweeping implications.

The ABA Criminal Justice Section similarly declined to recommend a \"mandate that judges give a cross-racial jury instruction,\" and instead provided that \"trial judges should have the discretion to give an instruction in certain cases where there is a heightened risk of misidentification\" (ABA Criminal Justice Section Report, at 3, 16 [2008] ). The authors of the Criminal Jury Instructions went even further, noting that a cross-racial identification charge should only be given \"if placed in issue by the evidence\" (see CJI 2d [NY] Identification [One Witness]; CJI 2d [NY] Identification [Witness Plus] ).

Consistent with the trial court's broad discretion over jury instructions, I agree that expert evidence is not required before the court may charge the jury on cross-racial identification issues. While expert testimony may be an appropriate vehicle for educating jurors on the cross-race effect, the decision to admit or exclude expert evidence concerning eyewitness identification issues-like the decision to instruct the jury on those issues-is a discretionary one (\n   <em>\n    People v.

On the one hand, it suggests some undefined discretion in considering a defendant's request for a cross-racial identification charge. But the majority's refusal to define that discretion-or even to use the word-signals a mandatory rule, complete with harsh consequences for the trial judge who does not realize it. That confusion benefits no one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   As a result, the majority's approach will function as it was apparently intended: a mandatory charge.
