The citation proceedings also resulted in an award of sanctions in favor of WMJ and Bradley and against Broaddus; Stanley, LLC (Stanley); and Broaddus's attorney, Bert Zaczek. Broaddus, Stanley, and Zaczek now appeal from the trial court's orders: (1) directing Bradley to turn over certain of its assets to WMJ, (2) granting WMJ's motion for sanctions, and (3) granting Bradley's motion for sanctions. We affirm in part, vacate and remand in part, and dismiss in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 The allegations in the sanctions motions before this court stem from an unrelated lawsuit prosecuted in federal court between Broaddus and Kevin Shields. We summarize the background of that lawsuit to provide necessary context to our disposition of the sanctions motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4\n   <em>\n    The Shields Litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 In May 2008, Broaddus sued Shields (the Shields Litigation), alleging breach of fiduciary duty regarding the sale of Broaddus's interest in Will Partners, LLC. Shields removed the case to federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Shields's response included a counterclaim for indemnification, including attorney fees, based upon the fee-shifting provisions in the Will Partners, LLC, operating agreement. In June 2010, the federal district court granted Shields's motion for summary judgment as to Broaddus's claim, and in September 2010, the court also granted Shields's motion for summary judgment as to his counterclaim for indemnification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 In October 2010, Broaddus established the BNR Revocable Trust (the Revocable Trust), a self-settled spendthrift trust, granting Broaddus the right to: retain all trust income, distribute the trust assets as he wished, and revoke the trust. On December 9, 2010, Stanley was formed, with the Revocable Trust holding a 99% interest and Broaddus's daughter holding the remaining 1%. One week later, the federal district court entered judgment in favor of Shields and against Broaddus for $798,619.16 plus postjudgment interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Shields then issued citations to discover assets on Bradley and two financial institutions: Wintrust Wealth Management Company (Wintrust) and Lake Forest Bank &amp; Trust Company (Lake Forest). Bradley responded that it held approximately $650,000 in cash assets for Broaddus. Both financial institutions responded that they had accounts either directly in Stanley's name or \"FBO [for the benefit of]\" Stanley. Shields also served citations on Stanley, the Revocable Trust, and Broaddus, but none of the three responded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 Shields then filed a motion for turnover, asking the federal district court to direct Stanley, the Revocable Trust, Broaddus, and the two financial institutions to transfer certain assets to Shields to satisfy the judgment. Broaddus responded, arguing in part that, since the funds were in the name of Stanley and not Broaddus, Shields could not recover them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 The district court rejected this argument. It first determined that, upon examining the various factors under section 5 of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (Act) ( 740 ILCS 160/5 (West 2010) ), it was \"clear that Broaddus fraudulently transferred his assets to the Revocable Trust.\" Specifically, the court found that Broaddus's transfer of the assets to the Revocable Trust was a transfer to an insider because Broaddus was the settlor and had complete control over (and received all of) the income and assets of the trust, including those assets he transferred into the trust. In addition, the court found that Broaddus knew that the court would soon impose a large outstanding money judgment against him when he transferred his assets to Stanley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 The district court further concluded that Broaddus created the Revocable Trust and transferred assets to it to hide his assets from Shields, the judgment creditor. It based this conclusion upon a series of e-mail messages that Broaddus had sent to Wintrust, demanding that Wintrust change the title of the accounts so that they were neither in Broaddus's name nor associated with Broaddus's taxpayer identification number. The court also found that Broaddus received no consideration for his transfer of funds to the Revocable Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 The court then found that, since Broaddus owned 99% of Stanley through the Revocable Trust, Shields could reach the assets of Stanley. In addition, the court noted that Broaddus formed Stanley in December 2010, which was \"well after\" the court had granted Shields's summary judgment motion and ordered Broaddus to pay Shields's attorney fees. The court concluded that \"the overwhelming evidence\" was that Broaddus formed Stanley \"in a vain attempt to hide his assets from Shields\" after the entry of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally, the court commented on Broaddus's \"history of dishonesty and disregard for\" the court's prior rulings.

Ill. Jan. 5, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12\n   <em>\n    WMJ's Proceedings Against Broaddus\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 On October 20, 2010, WMJ filed a complaint against Broaddus seeking unpaid legal fees. On July 21, 2011, WMJ obtained a judgment in the amount of $129,538.39 against Broaddus. WMJ began supplementary proceedings by filing a third-party citation to discover assets, which was directed to Bradley, among others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 On May 29, 2012, WMJ filed a motion for turnover, asking the trial court to order Bradley, a real estate investment company, to immediately transfer certain cash assets to WMJ. Attached to WMJ's motion was an affidavit from Sherwin Jarol, a limited partner of Bradley Associates, LP (the LP). Jarol first noted that, in addition to being one of the LP's limited partners, he was also the sole member of the LP's general partner. Jarol further explained that, although Bradley was an \"affiliate\" of the LP, he referred to these entities collectively as \"Bradley Associates.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jarol then stated that, pursuant to statute,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the entities were retaining double the judgment amount (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , $259,076.78) of the cash assets that would otherwise be distributable to Broaddus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 The next day, Zaczek appeared on behalf of Broaddus, and he subsequently appeared on behalf of Stanley. On June 21, 2012, Stanley responded to WMJ's motion. Stanley asserted that it was an adverse claimant, and that \"the monies held in the Bradley &amp; Associates account belong to Stanley,\" but Bradley \"made a mistake and failed to correctly identify the owner of the funds.\" Stanley further informed the court that, although it had received WMJ's motion three weeks earlier, it was unable to obtain the documents supporting its claim. Stanley specifically stated that, \"[i]f given adequate time to subpoena a lawyer in Florida,\" as well as Bradley's employees and other unnamed \"non-parties that hold records,\" Stanley would be able to establish its ownership of the funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16 Stanley's response also included an affidavit in which Broaddus swore that he had transferred money to Bradley to be held in the name of Stanley in furtherance of his estate plan \"[p]rior to December 2010.\" Broaddus further stated that he learned in December 2010 or January 2011 that Bradley had made a mistake regarding the identity of the entity for which it held the money. Although Broaddus instructed Bradley to \"immediately\" correct the error, Bradley failed to do so. Stanley requested a hearing and additional time to conduct discovery to support its adverse claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17 Bradley and WMJ each filed a reply to Stanley's response. Bradley rejected Stanley's claim that Bradley erred regarding the name in which the funds should have been held, pointing out that, since Stanley had not been formed until December 2010, it was impossible for Broaddus to have begun transferring assets to Stanley prior to that date. Bradley attached as an exhibit a copy of Stanley's \"Articles of Organization\" (bearing a filing date of December 9, 2010) from the Division of Corporations of the Florida Department of State. Bradley further noted that, before\n   forming Stanley and before making any transfer request to Bradley, the federal district court entered a judgment against Broaddus in the Shields litigation, and therefore the Act prohibited Broaddus from transferring any assets. Bradley added that the service of a citation upon it precluded it from transferring any of Broaddus's assets. Bradley also argued that Broaddus failed to provide the necessary documentation to effect the transfer. Finally, Bradley noted that the federal court already ruled that Stanley's assets were subject to turnover regardless of Broaddus's asserted purpose in creating Stanley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 18 WMJ's reply argued that Stanley's defenses were barred by collateral estoppel because: (1) the federal court entered judgment against Broaddus and in favor of Shields one month before WMJ sued Broaddus and (2) the federal trial court rejected Broaddus's and Stanley's arguments opposing the citation proceeding in the Shields litigation. WMJ stated that all of the arguments Stanley \"has, or will, make\" against WMJ's citation proceeding had already been made, and rejected, in the Shields litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 19 On September 24, 2012, Stanley filed a petition objecting to the turnover. The petition, signed by Zaczek, was substantially the same as its June 2012 response to WMJ's motion. Stanley noted that the federal court in\n   <em>\n    Shields\n   </em>\n   found that \"Broaddus was using Stanley to shield assets from\" Shields because in part \"Stanley came to exist after [Shields] obtained summary judgment against Broaddus.\" Stanley, however, argued that the federal court's finding \"shed little if any light on whether\" Broaddus was using Stanley to shield his assets from WMJ. Stanley emphasized that, \"a finding that a transfer of assets was fraudulent as to one creditor does not mean that the transfer is fraudulent to all creditors.\" Stanley also repeated its argument that the money held by Bradley belonged to Stanley, but that Bradley did not timely correct its mistake. In addition, the petition included the identical affidavit that Broaddus executed in support of Stanley's June 2012 response. Stanley further asserted that it was \"never given a chance to participate\" in the Shields litigation until after the federal court issued its order. WMJ filed a response opposing Stanley's petition, relying on the same arguments as those in its July 2012 reply. On April 1, 2014, following an evidentiary hearing on WMJ's motion, the trial court issued a written order granting the motion for turnover and denying Stanley's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 20\n   <em>\n    WMJ's and Bradley's Motions for Sanctions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 21 On October 5, 2012, WMJ filed a motion for sanctions against Stanley and Zaczek pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 137 (eff. Feb. 1, 1994). WMJ argued that Stanley's petition was objectively frivolous because it \"admit[ted] that all of the other transfers that were made from Broaddus to Stanley in December 2010 were made with the actual intent to defraud a creditor,\" but that the transfer from Bradley to Stanley was \"different\" because it involved a different creditor. WMJ stated that, pursuant to section 5 of the Act ( 740 ILCS 160/5 (West 2012) ), fraudulent transfers with respect to one creditor are fraudulent as to any subsequent creditor, even if the creditor's claim arose after the fraudulent transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 22 WMJ further argued that Stanley's petition was \"replete\" with factual misrepresentations or omissions. WMJ noted that, although Stanley claimed in its petition that the federal district court order in the Shields litigation was entered without input from Stanley, Stanley had been served with a citation in that litigation in October 2011, well before the federal\n   court's order in January 2012, but Stanley failed to appear and argue against Shields's motion for turnover. WMJ also noted that Stanley was aware of the Shields litigation because Broaddus, the managing member of Stanley, argued on behalf of Stanley's interests when he opposed Shields's motion for turnover by claiming that Shields could not seize Stanley's assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 23 WMJ further claimed that Stanley's argument that its assets were separate from Broaddus's was frivolous because the federal court had already rejected that claim, finding that the Revocable Trust, which owned 99% of Stanley, was a self-settled trust created by Broaddus; Broaddus was entitled to all of the trust income and assets; and Broaddus could revoke or distribute the trust assets. WMJ asked the trial court to award it its reasonable attorney fees and costs related to Stanley's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 24 On February 6, 2013, Bradley filed an amended motion for sanctions against Stanley and Broaddus. Bradley again argued that Broaddus's claim that he had instructed Bradley to transfer various assets from his name into Stanley's before December 2010 was obviously false because Stanley was formed only in December 2010. The amended motion included an affidavit from Bradley's employee, Angela Ford. Ford indicated that, on January 1, 2011, Broaddus sent her an e-mail asking that all of his holdings be \"titled and[/]or altered into Stanley, LLC.\" Ford's affidavit included a copy of that e-mail, as well as her response to it. The response stated that told Broaddus that the transfer could not be completed because of missing information, such as Stanley's federal employer identification number, the mailing address for future distributions, and Stanley's operating agreement and manager name. Ford's affidavit also included a January 22, 2011, e-mail from Broaddus to her, asking that Bradley withhold all quarterly distribution checks until \"Stanley was official.\" Bradley asked the circuit court for sanctions against Stanley and Broaddus in the amount of Bradley's attorney fees and costs related to defending against Stanley's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 25 Stanley's response to WMJ's motion was a combined response and motion to dismiss WMJ's sanctions motion. Stanley only filed a response to Bradley's sanctions motion. Both pleadings, in essence, argued that WMJ and Bradley waived their right to seek sanctions because they both treated the April 1, 2014, turnover order \"as if it were final\" when Bradley tendered funds to WMJ, and WMJ accepted those funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 26 On December 2, 2014, the circuit court issued a written order granting WMJ's motion for sanctions and denying Stanley's motion to dismiss WMJ's motion. The court found that Stanley's petition was frivolous as a matter of law and was brought for the purpose of delay. On April 15, 2015, the court issued an additional written order concerning a petition for fees, which WMJ brought because of the December 2, 2014, sanctions order. The court noted that WMJ's fee petition included its schedule of fees and an affidavit by attorney Michael Bruck detailing his time and work. The order also acknowledged that Stanley and Zaczek demanded an evidentiary hearing, and that they challenged various billing entries. The court denied Stanley's and Zaczek's request for a hearing, finding that it already had all of the relevant information before it and that all parties were provided an opportunity to object and present evidence on the matter. The trial court then awarded attorney fees of $74,578 in favor of WMJ and against Broaddus, Stanley, and Zaczek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 27 On May 18, 2015, the circuit court issued a written order granting Bradley's motion for sanctions. There was no further order, however, awarding a specific amount of money to Bradley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 28 On March 15, 2016, the circuit court denied Stanley and Zaczek's motion to reconsider the various orders. On April 13, 2016, Broaddus, Stanley, and Zaczek (collectively, appellants) filed a notice of appeal seeking review of the following orders: (1) the April 1, 2014, order granting WMJ's motion for turnover and denying Stanley's petition; (2) the December 2, 2014, order granting WMJ's motion for sanctions; (3) the April 15, 2015, order awarding WMJ certain fees and costs as sanctions; (4) the May 18, 2015, order granting Bradley's motion for sanctions; and (5) the March 15, 2016, order denying the motion to reconsider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 29 ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 30\n   <em>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 31 Appellants contend that the circuit court erred in granting: (1) WMJ's motion for turnover regarding certain assets that Bradley held for Broaddus's benefit, (2) WMJ's motion for sanctions, and (3) Bradley's motion for sanctions. WMJ responds that this court does not have jurisdiction to review this appeal because the appeal from the order on the motion for turnover was untimely and the orders on the motions for sanctions were not final and appealable. Bradley agrees with WMJ that the appeal from the motion for turnover is jurisdictionally flawed, but it does not raise a jurisdictional defense regarding the appeal from the order granting Bradley's motion for sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 32 We have a duty to consider whether we have jurisdiction and to dismiss an appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Archer Daniels Midland Co. v.

Appellants contend that the order merely recites the parties' arguments and ends with a ruling without enumerating any findings. While the order is largely written in that style, we disagree that it is insufficient. The order granting WMJ's motion for sanctions and awarding WMJ its attorney fees states that the court agreed with WMJ's arguments that the petition was frivolous from both a legal and a factual perspective and was brought to delay the proceedings. In particular, the order referred to WMJ's observation that, since Stanley's appearance in the case (May 30, 2012, three weeks after being served with WMJ's motion), Stanley never presented evidence from the attorney in Florida that Stanley argued would support its claim that it owned the assets at issue. The order also recounted that, although WMJ's sanctions motion was filed in October 2012, Zaczek did not inform the circuit court until April 2014 that he had a conflict of interest because he was a named party in the sanctions motion that also named his\n   clients, Broaddus and Stanley. No new counsel appeared, however, and Zaczek's response to WMJ's sanctions motion was still filed one day after the August 27, 2014, deadline. In sum, the court provided sufficient detail to discern the basis for its conclusion, a conclusion that was amply supported in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 45 Appellants next claim that the circuit court erred in denying their request for an evidentiary hearing.

There were ample facts in the record to support the court's finding that Stanley's petition was neither well grounded in fact nor warranted by existing law (or a good-faith argument for the modification of it). WMJ's motion for sanctions was based upon Stanley's filing of an objection to WMJ's motion for turnover. WMJ's motion centered upon filings that were already of record in the circuit court and in the Shields litigation in the federal district court. Stanley, through its attorney Zaczek, filed a petition in June 2012 objecting to Bradley turning over any of Broaddus's assets (held by Bradley) to WMJ because Stanley claimed that Bradley erroneously failed to transfer those assets into Stanley's name. Broaddus signed an affidavit, which was attached to the petition, stating that he had asked Bradley to move the assets from his individual name into Stanley's name beginning some time \"prior to\" December 2010. That statement, however, was demonstrably false: public records from the state of Florida clearly indicate that Stanley had not been formed until December 9, 2010. More troubling is the persistence of this misrepresentation. As late as January 2011, Broaddus sent an e-mail to Ford asking that distribution checks be held until Stanley was \"official.\" Although Stanley did not file its petition until nearly a year and a half had passed, this false statement nonetheless figured prominently in its petition. These facts, among others, provided a sufficient basis for the court's finding that the petition was not well grounded in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 47 The petition was also not warranted by existing law or a good-faith argument for the modification of existing law. The petition asserted that WMJ's motion for turnover should be denied merely because Bradley had purportedly failed to honor Broaddus's request to transfer certain of his assets to Stanley. Broaddus's request, however, came at a time when Broaddus knew that he was a judgment creditor (in the Shields litigation) and the federal court had already rejected his attempt to transfer other assets to Stanley because the transfer would be fraudulent under the Act. Section 5(a)(1) of the Act plainly states that \"A transfer made * * * by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor, whether the creditor's claim arose before or after the transfer was made * * *, if the debtor made the transfer * * *: with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   creditor of the debtor.\" (Emphasis added.) 740 ILCS 160/5(a)(1) (West 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 48 The prior transfer of assets to Stanley was found to be fraudulent under the Act, so any subsequent transfer of assets from Bradley to Stanley would also be fraudulent as a matter of law.

We also dismiss the appeal from the order granting Bradley's motion for sanctions because that order did not reduce Bradley's judgment to a specific dollar\n   amount and was therefore not a final and appealable order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 52 Affirmed in part, vacated and remanded in part, and dismissed in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Presiding Justice Hoffman and Justice Connors concurred in the judgment and opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Although two entities are affiliated, the citation respondent-appellee in this case, Bradley Associates, LLC (Bradley), is a different entity from Bradley Associates, LP (the LP).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    See 735 ILCS 5/2-1402(f)(1) (West 2012).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
