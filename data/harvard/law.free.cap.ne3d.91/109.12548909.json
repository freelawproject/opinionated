Plaintiff-appellee is the state of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} At all times relevant, Appellant was employed as a police officer with the\n   Mansfield Police Department. As part of his job responsibilities, Appellant was assigned to traffic enforcement detail, including the STEP detail (Selective Traffic Enforcement Program) as an overtime detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellant was certified in the use of the Law Enforcement Automated Database System (LEADS), and completed recertification tests, scoring high percentages. Appellant testified at trial he ran LEADS searches routinely as part of his traffic enforcement duties. Appellant testified he understood LEADS could not be used for an unlawful purpose or for personal gain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On February 26, 2015, in Case No. 2015CR197, the Richland County Grand Jury indicted Appellant on 17 counts of LEADS violations, 14 counts of dereliction of duty, one count of burglary, one count of trespass, one count of attempted gross sexual imposition, one count of attempted sexual battery, one count of menacing, two counts of tampering with evidence, one count of sexual battery, and one count of public indecency. On July 10, 2015, the Richland County Grand Jury indicted Appellant on one count of menacing by stalking, in violation of R.C. 2903.211(A)(1), in case number 2015 CR 637. On July 24, 2015, the trial court joined 2015 CR 197 with the indictment in 2015 CR 637.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On March 25, 2016, Appellant moved the trial court to dismiss the LEADS violation charges as being unconstitutionally vague. The State filed a response to the motion. Via Judgment Entry of March 31, 2016, the trial court denied Appellant's motion to dismiss the LEADS violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Following a jury trial, Appellant was convicted of 12 counts of unauthorized use of LEADS, in violation of R.C. 2913.04(C), a fifth degree felony (Counts 3, 5, 6, 9-17); 11 counts of dereliction of duty, in violation of R.C. 2921.44(E), a misdemeanor of the second degree (Counts 19, 22-29, 31); one count of tampering with evidence, in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A)(1), a third degree felony (Count 37); and one count of sexual battery, in violation of R.C. 2907.03(A)(1) (Count 39).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant was also convicted of one count of menacing by stalking, in violation of R.C. 2903.211(A)(1), in Case No. 2015 CR 637.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The trial court entered sentence on April 20, 2016, imposing a twelve month prison term on Counts 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17. The trial court found counts 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 31 merged with Appellant's sentence on other counts. The trial court imposed a thirty-six month prison term on count 37 (tampering with evidence), and a 60 month prison term on count 39 (sexual battery). The trial court ordered the sentences on counts 3, 15, 16, 37, 39 and the sentence imposed in case number 2015 CR 637 run consecutively, and the other remaining counts run concurrently. The trial court classified Appellant a Tier III sex offender for his conviction on a sexually oriented offense. Via separate Sentencing Entry in 2015 CR 637, the trial court sentenced Appellant to eighteen months in prison on\n   the conviction for menacing by stalking, to run consecutive to Appellant's sentence in 2015 CR 197, for a total sentence of 12 \u00bd years in prison.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellant appeals, assigning as error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I.

[Citing OAC Ann. 4501:2-10-03(C)(3).] Whether these policies are subject to change does not alter the basic fact that these databases are for law enforcement purpose only and personal use for any reason goes beyond the express consent of the chair of the law enforcement automated data system steering committee and/or the superintendent of the bureau of criminal identification and investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellant was convicted of twelve counts of unauthorized use of the LEADS database, in violation of R.C. 2913.04(C) and (D). In support of his argument the statute is unconstitutionally vague, Appellant cites the testimony of various law enforcement officers at trial as to arbitrary compliance and standards of practice. We note Appellant did not renew the motion to dismiss the charges following the trial court's denial of his motion to dismiss on March 31, 2016. As the trial court overruled Appellant's motion prior to trial, the subsequent trial testimony offered in support of Appellant's argument cannot be considered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Legislative enactments are afforded a strong presumption of constitutionality.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Tr. at 240.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Appellant stated at trial Harding asked him to run her information through LEADS to find out whether her license was suspended.

Appellant did not offer a legitimate law enforcement purpose for the LEADS searches pertaining to Kelly Harding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Count Nine pertains to Edward Walker, and alleges Appellant ran Walker through the system for no law enforcement purpose on July 7, 2013. Walker testified at trial Kelly Harding is his sister, and he had knowledge Appellant would often park outside of his sister's house. He stated he never met Appellant, but was at Harding's house when he showed up, but did not actually meet him. Appellant never issued a citation to Walker, and he never conducted a traffic stop involving Walker. Walker specifically testified he was not stopped by Appellant on July 7, 2013, and was not aware his information had been ran through LEADS. Tr. at 413. Appellant testified at trial he could not remember the reason for the LEADS check of Edward Walker, and did not demonstrate a legitimate law enforcement purpose in rebuttal to the State's evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Count Eleven alleges Appellant ran Mike Napier through the system on\n   February 16, 2014 with no law enforcement purpose. Napier is an officer with the Mansfield Police Department, and was on duty on February 16, 2014, performing standard traffic control. He testified Appellant sent him a picture through his cruiser computer of his past BMV pictures obtained through LEADS. Napier testified it was his understanding the LEADS system could only be used for a reason, \"like when you're getting ready to stop them.\" Tr. at 763.

However, Buhler testified she completed an application with her social security number, driver's license number and date of birth prior to the ride-a-long. Dispatch then verified Buhler did not have any warrants or other citations pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 36} During the February 16, 2015 ride-a-long, Buhler testified Appellant ran Eric Buhler's name through the system. Eric Buhler is Rebecca Buhler's father, and she gave Appellant his information. Appellant claims he was demonstrating to Buhler how the LEADS system worked. Tr. at 670. He then ran Rebecca Buhler through the system, and showed her the LEADS information pertaining to her. Testimony at trial demonstrates the search was not for a legitimate law enforcement purpose. Tr. at 79-93, 136, 152-194. Appellant cannot provide any evidence of any interaction between Buhler and law enforcement warranting a LEADS check.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 37} On April 26, 2014, Rebecca Buhler was working at a bowling alley in Richland County, and observed Appellant working STEP patrol. She approached Appellant and asked him to run her information to see if her license was suspended. Appellant also ran Officers Reed and Webb's information through LEADS, with no law enforcement purpose; rather, to make fun of their pictures. Tr. at 679, 682.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Rebecca Buhler testified Appellant never stopped her for a traffic citation on the dates at issue, her driver's license was not suspended, and she did not have any restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Count Fifteen maintains Appellant ran James Reed through the LEADS system with no law enforcement purpose on April 26, 2014. Reed testified at trial he works for the Mansfield Police Department. Officer Reed stated on March 26, 2014, he was not stopped by Appellant, and Appellant did not have any reason to run him through the LEADS system. Tr. at 724. Appellant cannot provide a valid law enforcement purpose for conducting the search, and testified he does not recall searching Officer Reed. Tr. at 1101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Officer Reed testified the LEADS Manual defines \"administration of criminal justice\" as \"the performance of any of the following activities: Detection, apprehension, detention, pretrial release, post-trial release, prosecution, adjudication, correctional supervision, rehabilitation of accused person or criminal offenders.\" States Exhibit 37; Tr. at 726.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Count Sixteen states Appellant ran Paul Webb through the system, three times, with no law enforcement purpose on April 26, 2014. Webb works for the Mansfield Police Department. Officer Webb testified he is trained in LEADS, and the system must be used for an associated law enforcement reason. Tr. at 703. He testified he did not commit any traffic infraction on April 26, 2014, and was not stopped by Appellant. Officer Webb testified he was on duty and would have been driving a cruiser or riding as a passenger at the time of the LEADS search. Tr. at 705.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Finally, Count Seventeen pertains to Dicky Carver and asserts Appellant ran Carver through the system on June 16, 2014 with no law enforcement purpose. Carver testified at trial he is friends with Kelly Harding. On June 16, 2014 Carver rode his motorcycle to Harding's house. Tr. at 269.

Carver testified Harding expressed concern to him about the location of the cruiser, and Appellant's actions. Carver then called his cousin at the Mansfield Police Department, relaying the concerns. Carver was never stopped by Appellant for a traffic infraction, never received a warning or a ticket, and had no knowledge Appellant ran his name through the LEADS system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The search was conducted one day after Carver had learned of Appellant's alleged harassment of Harding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Appellant cannot provide a valid law enforcement purpose for knowingly gaining access to the LEADS system on the dates and for the searches on which he was convicted. As an officer, Appellant had an obligation to know the rules and procedures relative to the LEADS system. Appellant successfully completed LEADS certification, and scored high on his retesting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Based upon all of the above, Appellant's assignments of error II, IV and V are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Menacing By Stalking\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Appellant was convicted of one count of menacing by stalking, in violation of R.C. 2903.211(A). The statute reads,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (A)(1) No person by engaging in a pattern of conduct shall knowingly cause another person to believe that the offender will cause physical harm to the other person or a family or household member of the other person or cause mental distress to the other person or a family or household member of the other person. In addition to any other basis for the other person's belief that the offender will cause physical harm to the other person or the other person's family or household member or mental distress to the other person or the other person's family or household member, the other person's belief or mental distress may be based on words or conduct of the offender that are directed at or identify a corporation, association, or other organization that employs the other person or to which the other person belongs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Kelly Harding testified at trial Appellant had stopped her for speeding on June 26, 2013. Appellant indicated he would not give Harding a speeding citation, if she provided him with her phone number. Harding gave Appellant her number, and in exchange, Appellant did not\n   cite her or issue her a warning. Appellant immediately called Harding to verify the number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Appellant then began calling Harding and showing up at her home uninvited. Tr at 241-242. Harding stated the visits became more and more frequent, and Appellant would stop \"every time he was on duty.\" Tr. at 240. While on STEP patrol, Appellant routinely parked his cruiser directly across the street from Harding's home. Harding testified other officers did not park in the same location while on the same STEP patrol. Tr. at 244. Harding considered Appellant's behavior inappropriate and it made her feel uncomfortable.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=227%20N.E.2d%20212\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 48} On one occasion, Harding's ex-husband had visited her and Appellant asked her to, \"Make it up to him.\" Tr. at 246.

Tr. at 247-248. Harding admitted she never asked Appellant to stop contacting her, nor did she ever ask Appellant to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 49} On cross-examination, Harding testified she purchased a number of different cell phones, providing Appellant with the number. She stated, if she did not give Appellant her new number, he would \"show up\" at her house, asking why her phone number was not working. Tr. at 253.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 50} On re-direct, Harding testified she was afraid of Appellant, and \"what he was capable of.\" Tr. at 164. Appellant told her friend Dicky Carver of her concerns with Appellant. She told him she was uncomfortable with Appellant's behavior and did not want him to come around. Harding did not ask Appellant to leave when he came over, and she would text him occasionally. However, she stated Appellant was always parked next to her house, and she was afraid of him. Tr. at 264.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 51} R.C. 2903.211(A)(1) /(B)(2) provides that \"[n]o person by engaging in a pattern of conduct shall knowingly cause another person to believe that the offender will cause physical harm to the other person or cause mental distress to the other person.\" \"Knowingly\" is one of the culpable mental states defined in R.C. 2901.22(B) : \"A person acts knowingly, regardless of his purpose, when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature.

Appellant made comments to Harding, pursuing her, and asking her to engage in sexual conduct. The evidence demonstrates Appellant entered Harding's house without permission, badgered her and attempted to engage in physical conduct.

See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Gardner, supra,\n   </em>\n   59 Ohio St.2d [14] at 19, 13 O.O.3d [8] at 11, 391 N.E.2d [337] at 341 [ (1979) ]. Thus, if defense counsel inquires of an alleged rape victim as to whether she has made any prior false accusations of rape, and the victim answers no, the trial court would have the discretion to determine whether and to what extent defense counsel can proceed with cross-examination. However, if the alleged victim answers in the affirmative, the trial court would have to conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   hearing to determine whether sexual activity had been involved. If the trial court determined that the accusations were entirely false (that is, that no sexual activity had been involved) the trial court would then be permitted to exercise its discretion in determining whether to permit defense counsel to proceed with cross-examination of the alleged victim. We therefore hold that where an alleged rape victim\n   admits on cross-examination that she has made a prior false rape accusation, the trial judge shall conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   hearing to ascertain whether sexual activity was involved and, as a result, would be prohibited by R.C. 2907.02(D), or whether the accusation was totally unfounded and therefore could be inquired into on cross-examination pursuant to Evid.R. 608(B).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   But, as noted above, under no circumstances would the defense be permitted to introduce extrinsic evidence. Evid.R. 608(B). The reason for this is that \"a witness may not be impeached by evidence that merely contradicts his testimony on a matter that is collateral and not material to any issue in the trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Byomin v.

CORRAL: Yes, Your Honor. We have a record from the institution that she was charged with a violation for making a false report of sexual assault. She did plead guilty to that violation. There's a notation in here that she admitted to fabricating the allegation. We understand that we can't get into whether or not sexual contact occurred, and we have no interest in getting into that. Rape shield protects that, and we respect that boundary. But I do believe or think we should be permitted to inquire as to whether this false allegation actually occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   THE COURT: I did some research on this prior, because I knew this was going to be an issue. What I found was there's a couple cases,\n   <em>\n    State v. Cheney\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    State v. Boggs\n   </em>\n   , and Evidence Rule 608 B. Evidence Rule 608 B and the case law I found says the defense can ask about a prior false allegation of rape, or something like that, but they would be stuck with the answer if the victim denied it. So if the victim said, I never made a false allegation, you're not going to be able to bring in extrinsic evidence of it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   If she does admit it and says yes, I did make a false allegation, the Court's supposed to determine if any sexual activity actually did occur. Because if there was sexual activity, again, we've got rape shield law that would block that. But if there was no sexual activity at all, then I think she can be crossed on it, but no extrinsic evidence can be introduced. So in other words, you ask the question, but you can't use the RIB information to support it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   So what's going to have to happen is we're going to have to talk to her outside the presence of the jury. We're going to have to ask her if she ever had made it. Again, if she denies it, I believe you're stuck with that answer. If she says, yes, I made a false sexual-made a false allegation, then we need to know if there was any sexual activity that occurred\n   at all. If the answer is no, she just made it up, then you can cross on it. But, again, you can't bring in extrinsic evidence to prove that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   THE COURT: Krystal, go ahead and have a seat. I'm Judge Brent Robinson. Before you testify, there's a couple things I have to ask you to make a ruling on whether or not you can be asked some questions when you're testifying. There's a question about whether or not you ever made a false allegation. I think this relates to when you were in prison, whether you ever made a false allegation that some sexual activity happened with you and another inmate. So the question will be, did you-have you made a prior allegation like that that wasn't true?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   MS.
