In her sole assignment of error, Thornton asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering her to pay $5,454.01 in restitution. Because we find that the Gerkes had not suffered an economic loss, we hold that the trial court's order of restitution was contrary to law. We modify the judgment to remove the restitution order, and affirm the judgment of the trial court as modified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} While living at the home of John and Merri Gerke, Thornton, without permission, used a check belonging to the Gerkes to pay her rent at another location, and used their bank account to pay several bills. The Gerkes reported the funds stolen to Fifth Third Bank, which reimbursed the Gerkes $5,454.01, the full amount stolen by Thornton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Thornton was indicted for two counts of theft, one count of forgery, and two counts of telecommunications fraud. The Gerkes were the only victims listed in the indictment. Thornton waived her right to a jury trial and pleaded guilty to one count of theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1). The trial court accepted her guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} At Thornton's sentencing hearing, after reviewing the victim-impact statement, the trial court recognized that Fifth Third Bank had reimbursed the Gerkes for their loss. The trial court initially ordered that Thornton pay restitution to Fifth Third Bank or to the Gerkes. Defense\n   counsel remarked that R.C. 2929.18 did not permit the trial court to order Thornton to pay restitution to a third party, and that Fifth Third Bank was not a proper victim before the court. The trial court stated, \"Well, then what I'll do is I'll order the Gerkes to be paid * * * $5,454.01. And I guess it's up to them whether they want to pay the bank back.\" The trial court explained that it may promote theft if Thornton did not have to pay back the money that she had stolen from the Gerkes. The trial court entered judgment on count one, dismissed the other counts, sentenced Thornton to five years' community control, imposed a $250 fine and court costs, and ordered $5,454.01 in restitution to be paid to the Gerkes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Thornton filed a motion to stay the order of restitution pending appeal. The trial court denied her motion. Thornton also filed a motion to stay the execution of her sentence with this court, which was also denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In her sole assignment of error, Thornton alleges that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering her to pay $5,454.01 in restitution. Thornton argues that the Gerkes did not suffer an economic loss, because Fifth Third Bank had, prior to her sentencing, reimbursed them for the entire amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} R.C. 2953.08 governs felony-sentencing appeals. The statute provides that a defendant who has pleaded guilty to a felony may appeal as a matter of right on the ground that the sentence is contrary to law. R.C. 2953.08(A)(4). A sentence is defined as \"the sanction or combination of sanctions imposed by the sentencing court on an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense.\" R.C. 2929.01(EE). \" 'Sanction' means any penalty imposed upon an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense, as punishment for the offense * * * [and] includes any sanction imposed pursuant to * * * [R.C.] 2929.18 * * *.\" R.C. 2929.01(DD). A sentencing court may impose restitution as a part of a felony sentence pursuant to R.C. 2929.18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In reviewing challenges to felony sentences pursuant to R.C. 2953.08, \"we may only modify or vacate [a] sentence if we 'clearly and convincingly find' that either (1) the record does not support the mandatory sentencing findings, or (2) that the sentence is 'otherwise contrary to law.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Nevertheless, it is fully consistent for appellate courts to review those sentences that are imposed solely after consideration of the factors in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12 under a standard that is equally deferential to the sentencing court. That is, an appellate court may vacate or modify any sentence that is not clearly and convincingly contrary to law only if the appellate court finds by clear and convincing evidence that\n   the record does not support the sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Since\n   <em>\n    Marcum\n   </em>\n   , there has been a split among Ohio appellate courts in reviewing the imposition of restitution in felony sentences.

Prior to Thornton's sentencing hearing, Fifth Third Bank had reimbursed the Gerkes, who were the only identified victims, for the full amount stolen by Thornton. This fact was documented in the victim impact statement. Ordering restitution to the Gerkes would result in an impermissible windfall and would frustrate the purposes of restitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. Although we understand that the trial court imposed the restitution because it did not want to promote theft, the judiciary has the duty to interpret the words provided by the General Assembly, and to refrain from deleting or inserting words to achieve a particular result.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because the Gerkes had been reimbursed, and therefore, had not suffered an economic loss, we clearly and convincingly find that the trial court's order of restitution was contrary to law. We sustain Thornton's sole assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Because the Gerkes had not suffered an economic loss pursuant to R.C. 2929.18, the trial court's order of restitution was contrary to law. Therefore, we reverse that part of the trial court's judgment and modify the judgment to remove the restitution order. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed as modified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Judgment affirmed as modified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Mock, P.J., concurs separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Myers, J., concurs separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Mock, P.J., concurring separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 22} While I disagree that the Gerkes did not suffer an economic loss as a result of Thornton's criminal acts, I must accept the result that the award of restitution in this case was contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 23} I do not believe that Thornton should reap the benefit of her illegal activity\n   and avoid having to pay restitution in this case, but the Ohio General Assembly eliminated the language in R.C. 2929.18(A)(1) which permitted the trial court to order restitution to third parties for amounts paid to victims for economic losses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

If the bank had been listed as a \"victim\" in the indictment or restitution had been made a part of the plea agreement, we would not being having this discussion. But that is not the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 24} I write separately because some of the cases cited by the majority to support the proposition that reimbursement precludes a restitution order involved reimbursement from an insurance company. I disagree with those cases and believe our recent case involving restitution and insurance coverage remains good law in this district.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Berlinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877433\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/194/145/\">\n    194 Ohio App.3d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011-Ohio-2223\">\n    2011-Ohio-2223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=954%20N.E.2d%201290\">\n    954 N.E.2d 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Dist.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 25} In\n   <em>\n    Berlinger,\n   </em>\n   this court upheld an award of restitution to a victim who had been reimbursed by an insurance company. The court held that the victim had suffered an economic loss because premiums had been paid to secure the coverage in an amount that would cover the theft.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.\n   <em>\n    Berlinger\n   </em>\n   is therefore distinguishable from this case because our record contains nothing to indicate the Gerkes suffered another form of economic loss other than the $5,454.01 vanishing from their bank account. If the record had shown that the Gerkes had a subrogation agreement with Fifth Third or had suffered another form of collateral economic damage from Thornton's criminal wrongdoing, my decision in this case would be different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Myers, J., concurring separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 26} I too, concur. There is no question that at the time of the theft, the Gerkes were victims and suffered an \"economic loss\" as defined by R.C. 2929.01(L). However, by the time of the sentencing, they had been fully reimbursed by their bank. Under R.C. 2929.18 and Ohio case law, the bank, as a third party, cannot be awarded restitution. And because the Gerkes ultimately suffered no economic loss, they cannot be awarded restitution either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 27} While this leaves Thornton with no criminal restitution obligation, the result is required by the clear language of the statutes. The bank retains any rights it has to pursue Thornton civilly.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Pursuant to R.C. 2929.18(A)(3)(e), the trial court could have imposed a fine of up to $2,500.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
