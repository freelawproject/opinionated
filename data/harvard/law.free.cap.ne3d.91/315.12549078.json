For the reasons that follow, we reverse the trial court judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Whites Landing Fisheries (\"WLF\") is a company engaged in the commercial fishing industry and licensed by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (\"ODNR\"). On November 10, 2015, WLF was charged with three separate counts of harvesting Lake Erie yellow perch in excess of the established quota, a violation of R.C. 1533.341 and Ohio Adm. Code 1501:31-3-12. Because WLF had two prior convictions, it faced permanent revocation of its commercial fishing license if convicted of any of the three charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Quotas for the harvesting of Lake Erie yellow perch are determined annually by pound and are allocated by statistical districts called \"management units.\" R.C. 1533.341 ; Ohio Adm.Code 1501:31-3-12(A). Lake Erie yellow perch \"management units\" are defined by Ohio Adm. Code 1501:31-1-02(MMM) as \"the geographic area within the lake Erie fishing district by which yellow perch quotas are allocated. * * *.\" The Ohio regulations define three Lake Erie yellow perch management units.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In a letter dated April 14, 2015, ODNR notified WLF that \"there will be no [commercial] allocation [of yellow perch] in Management Unit 1 (MU1), 1.311 million lbs in Management Unit 2 (MU2), and 266,030 lbs in Management Unit 3 (MU3).\" In other words, the 2015 yellow perch quota for management unit one was zero. The state claims that WLF harvested yellow perch from management unit one. Two of the counts against WLF alleged that it harvested 100 pounds of yellow perch, and one alleged that it harvested 200 pounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} At issue here are the definitions of \"management unit one\" and \"management unit two.\" Those units are defined by Ohio Adm. Code 1501:31-1-02(MMM) as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (1) Unit 1\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (a) Lake Erie yellow perch management unit one shall consist of all waters in Lucas, Ottawa and Erie counties between east and west boundaries as defined:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (i) The west boundary is the Michigan-Ohio state line beginning in Maumee bay and extending northeast to the United States-Canada international line in Lake Erie including all waters in Lucas and Ottawa counties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (ii) The east boundary begins at the Huron pier lighthouse,\n   <em>\n    extends along an imaginary line running northeast to the eighty-two degree, thirty minute meridian\n   </em>\n   and thenceforth along the meridian north to the United States-Canada international line.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (2) Unit 2\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (a) Lake Erie yellow perch management unit two shall consist of all waters in Lorain and Cuyahoga counties between west and east boundaries as defined:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (i) The west boundary shall begin in the Huron river, including all boat ramps or marinas connected to the Huron river,\n   <em>\n    then extending from the Huron pier lighthouse along an imaginary line northeast to the eighty-two degree, thirty minute meridian\n   </em>\n   and thenceforth along that meridian north to the United States-Canada international line.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (ii) The east boundary begins at the Fairport harbor light, extends north\n   along the eighty-one degree, twenty minute meridian to the United States-Canada international line. (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 6} WLF argues-and the trial court agreed-that Ohio Adm. Code 1501:31-1-02(MMM)(1)(a)(ii) and (MMM)(2)(a)(i), defining the east boundary of management unit one and the west boundary of management unit two, are ambiguous in their use of the word \"northeast.\" WLF's argument and the trial court's conclusion are premised on the fact that https://www.merriam-webster.com/ provides more than one definition for \"northeast\": (a) \"the general direction between north and east,\" and (b) \"the point midway between the north and east compass points.\" The state insisted that \"northeast\" refers to a compass point of 45 degrees, but the court concluded that \"northeast\" could refer to any point beyond zero degrees but before 90 degrees. It held, therefore, that \"management unit one,\" is unconstitutionally vague, thereby rendering R.C. 1533.341 and Ohio Adm. Code 1501:31-3-12\"void as they are applied to the violations against\" WLF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 7} It is from this judgment that the state appealed. It assigns the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR 1\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   OHIO ADM.CODE 1501:31-1-02(MMM) IS NOT VAGUE MERELY BECAUSE THE RULE DOES NOT DEFINE THE WORD \"NORTHEAST\" AS PART OF THE EAST BOUNDARY OF LAKE ERIE YELLOW PERCH MANAGEMENT UNIT 1 AND TWO DICTIONARY DEFINITIONS OF THE WORD EXIST.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR 2\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   THE WORD \"NORTHEAST\" IS NOT UNCONSTITUTIONALLY VAGUE AS USED IN OHIO ADM.CODE 1501:31-1-02(MMM) BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE READ IN THE CONTEXT OF A DEFINED COMPASS DIRECTION IN COMMERCIAL FISHING AND CONSTRUED ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF GRAMMER [sic] AND COMMON USAGE AS THE MIDWAY POINT OF 45 DEGREES BETWEEN THE NORTH AND EAST COMPASS POINTS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In its first assignment of error, the state argues that the trial court failed to apply the common, everyday meaning of the word \"northeast.\" It argues that \"northeast\" is a specific direction or point on a compass of 45 degrees, precisely between the directions of north and east. It points to the testimony of Dr. Christopher Vandergoot, a biologist with ODNR's Sandusky Fishery Research Office, who characterized this as standard knowledge. It maintains that a word is not per se unclear or unconstitutionally vague merely because the dictionary provides two definitions for it or because it is not defined in a statute, and it urges that the meaning here must be ascertained in the context in which it appears-i.e., commercial fishing regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Similar to its first assignment, the state argues in its second assignment of error that \"northeast,\" as commonly used and understood in nautical navigation, is a specific ordinal direction on a compass found at a point equally between the cardinal directions of north and east. While the trial court suggested that the management units should have been more specifically defined in a way similar to a metes and bounds description for real estate, the state urges that this is impractical and that an ordinary person would understand\n   that in the context of commercial fishing regulations, \"northeast\" means a 45-degree angle on a compass. It emphasizes that the regulation did not define the boundaries for the management unit by describing it as \"in a northeasterly direction,\" thus to interpret it as anything other than at 45 degrees would change the clear, unambiguous meaning of the words used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The state also insists that WLF was on notice of the zero quota for management unit one because it was specifically advised of it in a letter sent by ODNR and received by WLF via certified mail. And it points out that the violations did not occur at or near the angular boundary line-they occurred further north. Thus, it maintains, under the facts of this case, it was clear that the fish were harvested from management unit one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 11} As to both of the state's assignments of error, WLF responds simply that \"there is no defined compass direction as 'Northeast,' particularly along an imaginary line.\" It maintains that \"northeast\" may be anywhere between zero and 90 degrees. And it insists that Dr. Vandergoot himself admitted that no bearing is defined and that \"someone else would find it a vague [sic] because it doesn't give a specific bearing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The void-for-vagueness doctrine.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 12} \"Under the Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution, any statute which fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute is void for vagueness.\" (Internal citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

And it claims in its second assignment of error that in ascertaining the meaning of the word, it is appropriate to consider the context in which the term is used. There is much overlap in the state's arguments in support of these assignments, therefore we address them together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The state argues that considering the dictionary definitions and the context in which the term is used-i.e., commercial fishing regulations-\"northeast\" is not vague. It insists that for purposes of nautical navigation, \"northeast\" directs one to\n   proceed at a 45-degree angle. It maintains that the trial court and WLF's interpretation requires one to construe \"northeast\" to mean \"in a northeasterly direction,\" and it claims that to do this would change the clear, unambiguous meaning of the word.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Certainly, the fact that a word is undefined and the dictionary supplies more than one definition does not automatically render a regulation void.

The defendant argued, among other things, that \"neighborhood\" was ambiguous and undefined. The Ohio Supreme Court disagreed. It examined the dictionary definitions; specifically, it recognized that Webster's Third New International Dictionary defined \"neighborhood\" to mean \"the quality or state of being immediately adjacent or relatively near to something,\" and Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary defined it to denote \"a place or region near\" and \"the people living near one another.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=446%20N.E.2d%20449\">\n    446 N.E.2d 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

At the hearing, WLF's counsel cross-examined Dr. Vandergoot about the boundaries separating management unit one from management unit two. WLF claims that Dr. Vandergoot\n   established that \"northeast\" is vague. It quotes Dr. Vandergoot's testimony in its brief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Q: Is there a bearing to get to the longitude line of 82:30.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   A: No\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Q: There's no bearing. So it's an imaginary or speculation as to how you get there from the Huron County lighthouse; is that correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A: One could infer that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Q: One could infer that.

He testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Q: (Inaudible.) So based on the language and the chart you cannot affirmatively explain to this court the boundaries of unit MU-1 and MU-2. Is it MM-1 and MM-2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   A: Well, actually it says it extends-well, actually, you would be able to infer that.

Other than to simply deny that the state offered a correct interpretation, WLF presented no evidence challenging the state's position. While it is true that Dr. Vandergoot initially agreed that Ohio Adm. Code 1501:31-1-02(MMM) does not provide a specific bearing to get to the eighty-two degree, thirty minute meridian, upon re-reading the definition for \"management unit,\" he realized that it provided a bearing of 45 degrees insofar as it described the direction as \"northeast.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 26} WLF had the burden to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute is unconstitutional. It failed to do so. Because WLF failed to meet its burden, we find the state's two assignments of error well-taken, and we reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Code 1501:31-1-02(MMM) is unconstitutional. We find the state's two assignments of error well-taken and reverse the September 26, 2016 judgment of the Huron Municipal Court. We remand this case to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this decision.
