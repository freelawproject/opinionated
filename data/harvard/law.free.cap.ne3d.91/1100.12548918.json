Father appeals and argues that the trial court's order terminating his parental rights is not supported by clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [2] We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [3] B.D. was born in May 2013. Father and L.J. (\"Mother\") were living together when B.D. was born, but the couple ended their relationship in August 2013. Father continued to visit with B.D. after he moved out of the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [4] In April 2014, shortly before B.D.'s first birthday, Father was incarcerated for violating his probation and for pending forgery charges. In September 2014, the Indiana Department of Child Services (\"the DCS\") received a report that Mother's home was unsanitary, she used heroin or methamphetamine daily, and B.D. was present during Mother's drug use. Father, who was still incarcerated, reported that he and Mother were heavy heroin users.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [5] B.D. was removed from Mother's care, and the DCS filed a petition alleging that he was a Child in Need of Services (\"CHINS\"). Mother admitted that she was unable to care for her child because she lacked a stable home and resources and abused illegal substances. Father was unable to care for B.D. due to his incarceration. B.D. was initially placed in a foster home, but he was later placed with his maternal grandparents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [6] During the CHINS proceedings, Father was ordered to meet with the family case manager, notify the case manager of changes in address or phone number, refrain from illegal drug use and take random drug screens, and complete a substance abuse assessment upon his release from incarceration. While he was incarcerated, Father participated in services to the best of his ability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [7] Father was released from jail on September 11, 2015, and he was placed on probation. Father participated in services and visitation with B.D. However, in January or February 2016, Father failed to meet with the case worker on several occasions. And Father's February 1, 2016 visitation was cancelled because he arrived at the visitation under the influence of drugs. Father took a drug screen that was positive for methamphetamine and amphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [8] Father failed to remain in contact with the DCS after February 9, 2016. In March 2016, Father violated his probation and was arrested for resisting law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [9] On May 9, 2016, the DCS filed a petition to terminate Mother's and Father's rights to B.D. In July 2016, Mother signed a consent to allow B.D. to be adopted by her parents. The trial court held hearings on the DCS's petition to terminate Father's parental rights to B.D. on December 29, 2016, March 2, 2017, and March 15, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [10] The trial court issued its order terminating Father's parental rights to B.D. on March 20, 2017. In pertinent part the trial court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   120. That it has been evident from the start of this case that drugs were an issue for both parents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   121. That father admitted to prior drug use during one of the first visits by DCS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   122. That while in jail at the time, there were limited resources for father to work on issues such as drug abuse and/or reunification with his child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   123. That the DCS testified that late into his first stint in jail, the father did work with a recovery coach from Centerstone and that father may have participated somewhat in a 12 step program (not offered through DCS).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   124. That while in jail, there was a limited ability to visit with the child and or develop a relationship with the child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   125. That visits with young children have never been permitted by this court, at the jail, and therefore being able to work on relationships between a jailed parent and a young child are limited to letters or phone calls.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   126. There is no evidence the father ever wrote letters or made phone calls during this first stint in jail, albeit the child was only between the age of one (1) and two (2) years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   127. On at least two occasions father was found in noncompliance only because of his inability to provide supervision for the child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   128. As father neared release and worked with Centerstone as well as the 12 step program, DCS began reporting father was compliant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   133. That upon his release in [September] 2015, the father immediately contacted DCS, was working in therapy and homebound casework, was doing supervised visits and was doing drug screens.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   140. That the father had set up an appointment for a mental health assessment, but the dates got moved and due to facts listed below, the assessment was never completed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   141. That DCS testified that up until January 2016 the father had been attending visits regularly and had completed home based services and recovery coaching services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   142. That in January of 2016 the father failed to show up to the scheduled CFTM meeting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   143. Thereafter the father also lost consistency with his visits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   144. That on February 1, 2016 the father showed up at a visitation with the child and was noticeably under the influence of something.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   145. That testimony from father's probation officer showed the court that at a probation meeting on February 17, 2016, the father in fact admitted to drug use as far back as December of 2015, and on into the new year, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   146. That thereafter the probation department required the father to get himself into a treatment program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   149. That father filled out paperwork for a program at Progress House but apparently never attended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   150. That father testified that he also attended a halfway house called Simply Devine for two (2) weeks but he left there of his own volition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   151. Father did contact DCS about other options and was given a referral to Harbor Lights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   152. That on February 28, 2016 the father admitted himself to Harbor Lights but checked himself out against medical advice on March 3, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   153. That following father leaving Harbor Lights, the DCS had no further contact with him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   154. That the probation department held off on filing a violation of probation as father agreed to check himself into Valle Vista on March 10, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   155. That father then checked himself out of Valle Vista on March 11, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   156. That father testified that he left each of the facilities for no good reason and stated that it was because of his drug addiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   157. That after leaving Valle Vista, the probation department filed a Motion for Revocation of Probation on March 15, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   158. That it is evident that the father was simply playing a game bouncing in and out of rehabilitation facilities in order to avoid returning to jail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   159. That on March 28, 2016, the father was charged with resisting law enforcement after fleeing from officers that were trying to serve him with his probation revocation warrant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   160. That father has remained in the Morgan County jail to this day after pleading guilty to [ ] resisting law enforcement and thereafter admitting to violating his probation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   161. For these events, the father received jail time that will be finished on April 23, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Appellant's App. pp. 17-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   [11] The trial court also discussed Father's enrollment in and graduation from a new drug and alcohol rehabilitation program available at the Morgan County Jail. The trial court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   172. That it is obvious that the father is more than capable of following drug abuse programs/counseling as has been shown by his completion of the RSAP program and the testimony of the director of the RSAP program regarding father's progress.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   173. However, this ability to participate and complete such programs also proves that such willingness to complete programs only takes place when he is locked down and essentially has no other options.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   174. That as for stability, the father testified at the hearing that he is basically homeless, will be living with his grandmother when he gets out of jail in April of 2017, and will need to find work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Appellant's App. p. 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   [12] The trial court also found that Father loves his son, but has been in jail for over half of the child's thirty-four months of life. And Father \"has been driven by his drug addiction and instability rather than doing what is best for his son to this point.\" Appellant's App. p. 21. Further, the court found that after he was released from jail in September 2015,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   185. That father had resources available through DCS and probation that he availed himself of for a time and then he stopped.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   186. That even after his drug failures the DCS and the probation attempted to get him help and it was evident thereafter that he simply was going through the motions so as not to get arrested on a probation violation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   187. That even when father was stopped by the police, he once more continued to commit a crime, in that he fled from officers that were trying to arrest him on the probation warrant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   188. The crimes for which father was in jail for all during this case have nothing to do with drug abuse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   189. In fact, his first crimes from 2014 were crimes of dishonesty and his second was a crime against society as he simply fled when detained by police.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   190. That while his drug use abuse is evident and there clearly is an ongoing issue with that, this court finds that drugs were not behind any of the criminal offenses and that therefore father simply is a person that commits crimes as well as abuses drugs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   191. This continuation of committing criminal offenses that are not drug related, suggests a lack of ongoing stability and danger on the part of the father.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   192. The drug use and abuse to this point suggests a lack of stability and ability of the father to provide a safe and stable place for his child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   193. That the combined events of drug use and jail have prevented any attempts by the father to find work and therefore provide a home/safe living space.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Appellant's App. p. 22. The trial court also found that it is likely that B.D. does not know who Father is. Appellant's App. p. 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   [13] The trial court concluded that it is \"the instability of the father to find work or a home, his continuing drug use, the continuing pattern of committing crimes and his return to incarceration that this court finds will not be remedied any time soon.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The trial court also concluded that the DCS proved that there is a reasonable possibility that continuation of the parent child relationship poses a threat to B.D.'s well-being and that terminating Father's parental rights was in B.D.'s best interests. Father now appeals the trial court's order terminating his parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion and Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   [14] The purpose of terminating parental rights is not to punish parents but instead to protect their children.\n   <em>\n    In re S.P.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9280488\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/806/874/#p880\">\n    806 N.E.2d 874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 880 (Ind.

Father was incarcerated when B.D. was removed from Mother's care. Father admitted to the DCS that both he and Mother were heavy heroin users. Upon his release from incarceration, Father complied with services and exercised visitation with B.D. for approximately five months. However, Father began using methamphetamine approximately three months after he was released from jail. He also violated his probation, and committed a new criminal offense. On the date of the termination hearing, Father was incarcerated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   [22] Father relies on\n   <em>\n    K.E. v. Indiana Department of Child Services\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6840164\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/39/641/\">\n    39 N.E.3d 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ind. 2015), to support his claim that the fact of his incarceration is insufficient to support a conclusion that there is a reasonable probability of non-remedy of the conditions for removal. However,\n   <em>\n    K.E.\n   </em>\n   is readily factually distinguishable from the instant case. In\n   <em>\n    K.E\n   </em>\n   ., our supreme court reversed the trial court's termination order of a father who was incarcerated at the time of the child's removal and remained so through the termination hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 647, 652. Although the father was not set to be released from incarceration for two years after the termination hearing, our supreme court found that the father had \"made substantial efforts towards bettering his life\" through his participation in twelve programs that were available during his incarceration that targeted parenting and life skills, along with addressing his substance abuse.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 648-49. In addition, the father in\n   <em>\n    K.E.\n   </em>\n   maintained regular contact and visits with his child while incarcerated through visitation and nightly phone calls, and he testified that he had made arrangements for housing and employment upon his release.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 647.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   [23] In this case, Father had been participating in a new program at the jail, but the trial court found that \"this ability to participate and complete such programs also proves that such willingness to complete programs only takes place when he is locked down and essentially has no other options.\" Appellant's App. p. 21. Father has not successfully addressed his substance abuse issues, and during his incarceration, he did not maintain contact with B.D. Moreover, the trial court found that Father's \"continuation of committing criminal offenses that are not drug related, suggests a lack of ongoing stability and danger on the part of the father.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 22. For all of these reasons, and under our extremely deferential standard of review, we cannot say that the trial court clearly erred in determining that there was clear and convincing evidence establishing that there was a reasonable probability that continuation of the parent-child relationship posed a threat to B.D.'s well-being.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   [24] Father also argues that the trial court erred in concluding that termination of the parent-child relationship was in B.D.'s best interests. In determining what is in the best interests of the child, the trial court must look beyond the factors identified by the DCS and look to the totality of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    A.D.S.\n   </em>\n   , 987 N.E.2d at 1158. The trial court must subordinate the interests of the parent to those of the child, and the court need not wait until the child is irreversibly harmed before terminating the parent-child relationship.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . A recommendation by the case manager or child advocate to terminate parental rights, in addition to evidence that the conditions resulting in removal or continued placement outside the parent's home will not be remedied, is sufficient to show by clear and convincing evidence that termination is in the child's best interests.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 1158-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   [25] Here, Father has been incarcerated for over half of B.D.'s young life. Father has been offered numerous services both through the DCS and the Department of Correction and has failed to avail himself of those services. Father violated his probation, continued to use drugs, and committed a new criminal offense during these proceedings. Father has not established that he can refrain from using illegal substances or provide a stable life for his child. \"[C]hildren cannot wait indefinitely for their parents to work toward preservation or reunification-and courts 'need not wait until the child is irreversibly harmed such that the child's physical, mental and social development is permanently impaired before terminating the parent-child relationship.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re E.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6955139\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/4/636/#p648\">\n    4 N.E.3d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 648 (Ind. 2014) (quoting\n   <em>\n    K.T.K. v.

Tr. pp. 23, 61, 90-95. This evidence clearly and convincingly supports the trial court's conclusion that termination of Father's parental rights was in the best interests of the child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    A.D.S.\n   </em>\n   , 987 N.E.2d at 1158.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   [27] The DCS proved the statutory elements required to terminate Father's parental rights by clear and convincing evidence. Therefore, we affirm the trial court's order terminating Father's parental rights to B.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   [28] Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Vaidik, C.J., and Crone, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Because the DCS presented clear and convincing evidence to prove this prong of the termination statute, we need not consider whether there is a reasonable probability that the continuation of the parent-child relationship poses a threat to B.D.'s well-being.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
