McKinney was in the course and scope of his employment at the time of his injuries. McKinney filed a claim with appellant Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation (\"BWC\"). The BWC paid McKinney's medical bills and provided compensation to McKinney. As of February 5, 2016, the BWC had paid McKinney $224,274.85, $196,527.57 in medical bills and $27,747.28 in compensation. The estimated future costs of McKinney's claims are $136,637.49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On April 25, 2015, McKinney filed an intentional tort claim against Omni. On February 17, 2016, McKinney filed a second amended complaint to add claims for spoliation and fraud against Omni and appellant Derek Lidderdale (\"Lidderdale\"), the vice-president of Omni.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The BWC filed a motion for leave to intervene on March 11, 2016. The BWC averred that McKinney was in the course and scope of his employment when he was injured and filed a workers' compensation claim. Further, that the BWC paid $224,274.85 on McKinney's claim and estimated future costs of the claim were $136,637.49. The BWC argued R.C. 4123.93 and R.C. 4123.931 create an independent right of recovery in favor of a statutory subrogee, here, the BWC, against a third party who may be liable to McKinney for his injuries. Thus, the BWC contended it should be permitted to intervene to protect its subrogation rights under these statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} McKinney filed a memorandum in opposition to the BWC's motion to intervene. McKinney argued R.C. 4123.93 and R.C. 4123.931 are not applicable in intentional tort cases and that Omni was not a statutory \"third party\" pursuant to the subrogation statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The trial court issued a judgment entry denying the BWC's motion to intervene on July 5, 2016. The trial court found ambiguity in R.C. 4123.93 and determined the statute should be construed liberally in favor of McKinney. Further, that the definition of \"employer\" in R.C. Chapter 4123 does not include the term \"third party.\" The trial court acknowledged the purpose of R.C. 4123.931 is to prevent double recovery, but found if the BWC was permitted to intervene in this case, it would likely result in no recovery for McKinney after he paid the subrogation amount to the BWC. Thus, it would result in McKinney\n   having little incentive to pursue the case against Omni.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On August 2, 2016, the BWC filed an appeal with this Court. Also on August 2, 2016, the BWC filed with the trial court a motion to reconsider its order denying their motion to intervene. Omni and Lidderdale filed their appeal with this Court on August 3, 2016. The trial court issued a judgment entry on August 9, 2016, denying the BWC's motion to reconsider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The BWC, Omni, and Lidderdale appeal the July 5, 2016 judgment entry of the Stark County Court of Common Pleas. Omni and Lidderdale assigned the following as error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} \"I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED THE BUREAU OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION'S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO INTERVENE ON THE BASIS THAT R.C. 4123.93 AND R.C. 4123.931 ARE AMBIGUOUS BECAUSE SUBSECTION (C) OF R.C. 4123.93 DOES NOT INCLUDE THE TERM \"EMPLOYER\" IN THE DEFINITION OF \"THIRD PARTY.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The BWC assigned the following as error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} \"I.

Additionally, the denial of the motion to intervene denies a provisional remedy ancillary to the intentional tort claim because, if R.C. 4123.931(G) is found not to be met, Omni and McKinney are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of benefits paid by BWC to McKinney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Further, the trial court's order denying intervention prevents a judgment in favor of the BWC as the BWC cannot assert its subrogation rights in this action. Finally, a meaningful and effective remedy would not be provided as BWC's statutory subrogation rights would not be protected and thus Omni and McKinney could be jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the benefits the BWC paid McKinney if McKinney would prevail in his intentional tort claim. Further, if McKinney succeeds in his claim against Omni and the judgment is paid without the BWC intervening in this case, the BWC will bring suit against McKinney and Omni. If McKinney is not collectible when the BWC receives its judgment, the BWC will seek collection from Omni and thus, Omni will have paid the same sum twice. Therefore, we find the denial of the motion to intervene is a provisional order and meets the requirements in R.C. 2505.02(B)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 18} McKinney cites\n   <em>\n    Gehm v.

McKinney contends Omni does not satisfy the definition of \"third party\" under R.C. 4123.93(C) and thus the BWC has no right of subrogation in this case; thus, there is no need for the BWC to intervene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 24} R.C. 4123.931 creates and defines rights of subrogation for payments of compensation benefits in workers' compensation claims. Under the current version of R.C. 4123.931, the payment of workers' compensation benefits \"creates a right of recovery in favor of a statutory subrogee against a third party, and the statutory subrogee is subrogated to the rights of a claimant against that third party. The net amount recovered is subject to a statutory subrogee's right of recovery.\" R.C. 4123.93(C) defines \"third party\" as an \"individual, private insurer, public or private entity, or public or private program that is or may be liable to make payments to a person without regard to any statutory duty contained in this chapter.\" R.C. 4123.931(I) provides that the statutory subrogation right of recovery, \"applies to, but is not limited to, all of the following * * * (3) amounts recoverable from an intentional tort action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 25} McKinney argues ambiguity should be construed liberally in favor of him and against appellants. Further, that Omni is not a \"third party\" because the term \"employer\" is not included in the definition of \"third party\" in R.C. 4123.93 and because the definition of \"employer\" contained in R.C. 4123.01(B) does not define an employer as a \"third party.\" R.C. 4123.01(B). Finally, that Omni is not a \"third party\" because a third party does not include a party who has a statutory obligation under this chapter; since Omni has a statutory duty, it cannot be considered a third party; and R.C. 4123.931(I)(3) only applies to intentional torts committed by third parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Absent ambiguity, the court must give effect to the plain meaning of a statute.\n   <em>\n    Cablevision of the Midwest, Inc. v.

The term \"private entity\" encompasses, within its own meaning, private entities that are employers. An \"entity\" is defined as \"an organization (such as a business or a governmental unit) that has a legal identity apart from its members or owners.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th Ed. 2014). In this case, Omni is a business organization that has a legal identity apart from its members or owners. Omni may be liable to make payments to McKinney based on McKinney's intentional tort and/or spoliation of evidence claims. See\n   <em>\n    Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation v.

Rather, the statute provides a third party is a private entity that may be liable to make payments to a person \"without regard to any statutory duty.\" The phrase \"regard\" is defined as \"attention, care, or consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). Thus, the statute provides a third party is a private entity that may be liable to make payments to a person without any consideration/care/attention paid to any statutory duty. Substituting any of these words for term \"regard\" demonstrates that even if a private entity has a statutory duty under the workers' compensation statute, it may still qualify as a \"third party\" under R.C. 4123.93(C). The case cited by McKinney in support of his argument,\n   <em>\n    In the Matter of the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Todd M. Jones,\n   </em>\n   Huron C.P. No. ES 2004 00159 (April 13, 2006), is a trial court case and is further distinguishable from the instant case as it addressed settlement funds received from a violation of a specific safety rule, not from an intentional tort claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Based on the foregoing, we find the statute is unambiguous and the terms are clearly defined within the statute. Giving effect to the statute's plain meaning, the legislature did not intend \"third party\" to exclude employers when it specifically provided that statutory subrogees have a right of subrogation in intentional tort actions and when the definition of \"third party\" includes a \"private entity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Case Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Appellants argue case law supports the conclusion that an employer is included in the definition of \"third party\" under R.C. 4123.93(C), while McKinney contends the case law supports the conclusion that an employer is not included in the definition of \"third party\" under R.C. 4123.93(C). We agree with appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 32} McKinney cites several common pleas court cases in support of its position. However, both\n   <em>\n    Kirk v.

This concern was prevalent in the previous version of the subrogation statutes, as the previous version of R.C. 4123.931 contained provisions that allowed for a windfall for the BWC and did not allow the claimant to demonstrate that portions of the settlement did not duplicate workers' compensation benefits received.\n   <em>\n    Holeton v.

The current version of R.C. 4123.931 now provides a pro rata formula to determine the amount allocated to each party and applies to both settled claims and judgment awards of damages.

The pro rata formula for claims that are settled and/or when a plaintiff proceeds to trial and damages are awarded are detailed in R.C. 4123.931(B) and R.C. 4123.931(D). Consideration of a claimant's financial incentive to pursue a tort claim is thus taken into account in these statutory formulas used to calculate the BWC's participation in settlements and verdicts.
