GALLAGHER, P.J., Eighth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 1} The core of this appeal is the extent of the probate court's jurisdiction over a judicially created park district under R.C. Chapter 1545. The probate court invoked its own continuing jurisdiction in a case initiated by the Chester Township Board of Trustees (\"Trustees\") in 1984 to create the Chester Township Park District (\"Park District\"). The central question, as framed by the parties, is whether the probate court maintained jurisdiction over the Trustees and the township as a political entity either through the exercise of its plenary power to enforce the terms of the 1984 order creating the Park District or, otherwise, through the probate court's continuing jurisdiction over the Park District as provided in R.C. Chapter 1545.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The May 10, 1984 order creating the Park District did not impose any obligations or duties. It simply created the legal entity known as the Park District, established the territorial limits of the Park District, and noticed an intent to appoint the original Park District Board of Commissioners (\"Commissioners\"). There are no terms in that order to be enforced in perpetuity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am. Motors Corp. v. Huffstutler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1708784\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/61/343/#p349\">\n    61 Ohio St.3d 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 349,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=575%20N.E.2d%20116\">\n    575 N.E.2d 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991) (case remanded for further proceedings including the exercise of continuing jurisdiction in connection with enforcing the terms of a permanent injunction).

Because there was nothing to enforce in the order creating the Park District, the Park District has focused its entire argument on the statutory grant of continuing jurisdiction conferred on a probate court in matters involving a park district as the basis for the probate court's action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Based on the statutory framework, however, we must conclude that the probate court exceeded its jurisdiction by declaring portions of an arm's-length agreement entered under R.C. 1545.14 to be invalid and imposing the costs of the master commissioner, appointed to review the Commissioners' conduct, against an unrelated political entity. In light of the demonstrated confusion over a park district's functions and the probate court's role within Chapter 1545, we must begin with the facts of this case as they relate to the statutory framework within which the Park District operates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Upon the creation of a park district, the probate court is required to appoint three commissioners to the board whose terms expire on a rotating basis for the first three years. R.C. 1545.05. Thereafter, each commissioner is appointed for a three-year term.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20N.E.2d%2019\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Judge Frank Lavrich created the Park District and appointed the first Commissioners on May 17, 1984. In the early years, the Trustees were responsible for soliciting volunteers and applications for the position of Commissioner, and the probate court accepted the Trustees' recommendation for filling any vacancy. In September 1993, Judge Charles Henry succeeded Judge Lavrich, and according to the record, Judge Henry followed his predecessor's procedure. By July 2007, the probate court began taking applications for the position of Commissioner directly instead of filtering the applications through the Trustees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The creation of the Park District created a legal entity, separate and apart from the township. However, the creation of the Park District did not automatically transfer any land or property over which the Park District could assert control. R.C. 1545.14 expressly provides that a park district cannot acquire or control any park, park lands, parkways, playgrounds, or other lands, or boulevards owned or controlled by any other public authority unless an agreement is reached between the park district and the public authority in possession of such lands.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20N.E.2d%2019\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, the public authorities maintained their ownership interests in any park land within the territorial limits of the Park District after its creation. There is no statutory obligation for any public authority to cede ownership or control of its park lands to a park district. A park district does not have a purpose unless there are properties to be maintained, to be developed, or over which the park district could assume control. The legislature contemplated this possibility and provided for the dissolution of a park district after a prolonged period of inactivity. R.C. 1545.38 (upon notice that the park district has not made any expenditures or deposits of funds in five years, the district shall be dissolved). In order to avoid this situation, the legislature provided two mechanisms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} A park district could purchase or acquire its own property. R.C. 1545.11. Under R.C. 1545.11, the commissioners could, but were not required to, acquire\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   lands either within or without the park district for conversion into forest reserves and for the conservation of the natural resources of the state, including streams, lakes, submerged lands, and swamp lands, and to those ends may create parks, parkways, forest reservations, and other reservations and afforest, develop, improve, protect, and promote the use of the same in such manner as the board deems conducive to the general welfare.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The commissioners have the discretion to obtain such property through gift, purchase by cash or installment payments, or by appropriation, which can only occur through the manner provided in R.C. 163.01 to 163.22. Any gift of property must be approved by the probate court. R.C. 1545.11. The Park District has not obtained any property of its own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The second method of obtaining a purpose for a park district is through R.C. 1545.14, which is entitled \"Cooperation with other public authorities.\" That section provides that the commissioners may enter into agreements with other legislative or public authorities in control of parks or park lands, whether within or without the park district, either (1) to assume control of all or a portion of any existing lands\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   (2) to otherwise contract or cooperate with the other public authority in connection with the \"use, development, improvement, and protection of parks or park lands.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20N.E.2d%2019\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is important to note the disjunctive phrasing of the options.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The commissioners of a park district do not need probate court approval before entering any agreement under R.C. 1545.14. The agreements are left to the discretion of the commissioners appointed to manage the park district. If the legislature had intended for the commissioners to seek probate court approval, language similar to sections 1545.11, 1545.12(B), and 1545.15, all of which require approval before the commissioners undertake specific actions, could have been included in R.C. 1545.14.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Cordray v. Court of Claims of Ohio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872757\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/190/161/\">\n    190 Ohio App.3d 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-4437\">\n    2010-Ohio-4437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=941%20N.E.2d%2093\">\n    941 N.E.2d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 27 (10th Dist.) (the omission of language dictates the conclusion that the legislature did not intend the omitted language to have any force or effect in proceedings under the statutory section). The contracting option provides the park district with a limited role in which the township delegates some or all of its responsibility over park lands to the park district through an agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Although it is a far better practice to define that role in writing, there is no legislative requirement that a park district enter a written contract with the public authority; it may simply \"cooperate with\" the other political body for the maintenance, use, and development of the park lands. There is also no statutory requirement specifying the degree of control over the park lands that the public authority must delegate to the park district. According to the unambiguous terms of R.C. 1545.14, the public authority may retain any degree of control it deems necessary in contracting or cooperating with the park district. Regardless of which option is chosen, the park district is authorized to develop, improve, and protect those lands as if the lands were acquired by the commissioners.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=941%20N.E.2d%2093\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The legislature also provided park districts with several options to obtain funding. The park district may levy a dedicated tax in an amount not to exceed one-half of one mill, but only \"[a]fter the budget commission of the county in which\n   the district is located certifies such levy,\n   <em>\n    or such modification thereof as [the budget commission] considers advisable\n   </em>\n   , to the county auditor, he shall place it upon the tax duplicate.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=941%20N.E.2d%2093\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, it is within the commissioners' discretion whether to seek the dedicated tax, and even if the commissioners decide to pursue the independent source of funding, the county budget commission must certify the tax if they consider any portion of it advisable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=941%20N.E.2d%2093\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this case, the Park District received the dedicated tax up until 2002. According to the master commissioner, the township eliminated it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite the elimination of the tax, the township provided the Park District with its necessary funding-as would be expected considering the fact that the township still owned the properties and had an obligation and desire to ensure the continuing vitality of the park lands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 511.37 (township trustees may make contributions of money from its general fund to the park district for the purpose of planning, acquisition, management, and improvement); 1988 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 88-033 (interpreting R.C. 511.37 to mean that the board of a park district does not need to seek approval of the funding terms from the probate court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In addition to the dedicated millage, the commissioners may directly submit a request for an additional tax levy to the voters by resolution. R.C. 1545.21. Outside of taxes, a park district may also receive a share of the undivided local government fund as determined by the county budget commission for the purpose of managing the park land properties. 2008 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 08-020, at 21-22, citing R.C. 5747.51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In April 1985, the Park District and the Trustees negotiated an arm's-length agreement under R.C. 1545.14 wherein the Trustees, with \"the authority and responsibility to operate and maintain park lands within Chester Township\" agreed (1) to allow the Park District to assume control of all park lands owned by the township for a period of five years unless either party terminates the agreement with 90 days' advance notice; (2) that the Park District would operate, maintain, develop, improve, and protect the park lands for the residents of Chester Township and the public; (3) that subject to prior approval from the Trustees, the Commissioners could (a) enter agreements with other political subdivisions for the use and operation of the parks, (b) construct or alter permanent improvements on the park or park lands, and (c) contract for and incur debts that could result in liens being imposed on the township's park land properties; and (4) that the Commissioners must agree that no rangers or park officers shall be appointed other than police officers employed by the township. No one disputed the terms of that agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In 1993, following the expiration of the original agreement and a short period in which the Park District cooperated with the township to maintain the park lands without a formal agreement, the Park District and the township negotiated a second agreement nearly identical to the first. There were two material differences between the agreements: (1) the 1993 agreement was for a period of five years, to renew yearly into perpetuity, but subject to the same 90-day termination clause; and (2) the 1993 agreement was not for the stated purpose of the Park\n   District assuming all control over the township's park lands. The Park District had a more limited role. The Park District only had the contractual authority to use, develop, improve, and protect the park lands within the township and subject to the limitations to which the Park District agreed. No one, and certainly neither of the real parties in interest to the agreement, challenged any aspect of the 1993 agreement in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In the early part of 2014, an anonymously drafted \"report\" surfaced, entitled \"Chester Township Park District 2013 Review\" (\"the review\"). The review questioned the Park District's financial affairs. Under R.C. 1545.06, which provides that any park commissioner may be removed at the discretion of the probate judge, the probate court had continuing jurisdiction to sua sponte consider removing any one of the Commissioners based on those allegations of financial misconduct. If, in exercising its grant of continuing jurisdiction, the probate court felt it necessary to remove any Commissioner, the court was required to provide that Commissioner with at least ten days' notice ahead of the statutorily mandated public hearing. R.C. 1545.06.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Upon receiving the review, the probate court appointed Attorney Mary Jane Trapp as the master commissioner under the court's \"fiduciary oversight authority.\" During the proceedings on the master commissioner's report, the probate court clarified that its jurisdiction was derived from R.C. 2101.06 and R.C. 1545.06, although no individual Commissioner was ever put on notice that the court intended to remove any one of them from office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} A master commissioner's duties under R.C. 2101.06 should not be confused with the probate court's authority to appoint an investigator as statutorily provided in other probate matters, such as guardianship proceedings. R.C. 3109.04(C) (a probate court can order an investigation, but the investigator must be made available for cross-examination at trial); R.C. 2111.042 (a probate court may appoint an investigator to review the guardianship of a minor). The statute, R.C. 2101.06, unlike other provisions in the Revised Code dealing with the authority of a probate court, does not authorize the trial court to appoint an investigator.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2151.28(I) (a guardian ad litem's functions include \"investigation, mediation, monitoring court proceedings and monitoring services provided for the child\"). Generally, if a court appoints an investigator when statutorily authorized to do so, \"[t]o protect the parties' due process rights, the trial court must make [the investigator] available for direct and cross-examination.\"\n   <em>\n    In re A.L.\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist.

The probate court's orders are all premised on the findings and conclusions within the master commissioner's report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In the master commissioner's report, the master commissioner determined upon her \"research and discussions with those involved with the park district's formation\" that the intent behind the Park District's creation was to keep the township politics out of the park district. The master commissioner ultimately concluded, through interviews and research, that the Park District and its employees had not committed any knowing violations of Ohio law. Several policy and procedure \"recommendations\" were also provided. No sworn testimony was taken, nor did the probate court require the master commissioner to do so or resolve any factual disputes. After submitting the report, the probate court made several findings of facts and conclusions of law but otherwise adopted the master commissioner's unfiled report. Judgment Entry Findings of Fact Conclusions of Law, November 26, 2014 (\"Confirmation Order\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 22} At the same time the master commissioner was reviewing the allegations against the Commissioners regarding financial decisions, a state agency was conducting a formal audit of the Park District's finances relating to the same allegations. The Park District is required to present its yearly budget to the Geauga County Budget Commission and to the township trustees in order to comply with\n   R.C. 5705.36(A)(1). As part of that process, the township fiscal officer had requested a state audit of the Park District that was under way as of the date of the master commissioner's report. It appears the probate court appointed the master commissioner to investigate that which other executive agencies were in the process of reviewing. The probate court could not have been aware of the audit at the time it appointed the master commissioner, but there was no consideration of the separate audit after the fact was disclosed in the master commissioner's report. The outcome of the audit is not in the record before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 23} In the Confirmation Order, the probate court went further than reviewing the conduct of the Commissioners and specifically concluded that (1) the Trustees had terminated the dedicated millage for the Park District, directly contravening the fundamental purpose for creating the Park District; (2) the 1993 agreement addressing the Trustees' contractual right to review any construction or alteration of any permanent improvement on the park lands impeded the Park District's separate purpose; (3) the Commissioners had the sole statutory authority to levy the millage under R.C. 1545.20 ; (4) the Trustees must provide funding until the Park District sets up its independent funding through dedicated millage; and (5) the Park District, the Commissioners, and the Park District's employees must comply with the recommendations made by the master commissioner regarding the \"best practices\" for operating a park district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The Trustees appealed the Confirmation Order, but the original appeal was dismissed for the want of jurisdiction. The Confirmation Order had not finalized the actual costs associated with the master commissioner's investigation, even though the parties were ordered to split the undetermined costs with the probate court.\n   <em>\n    In re Creation of Park Dist.

As we have already discussed, the 1984 order creating the Park District imposed no prospective obligations on any parties, much less the Trustees or the township. Although there is no question the probate court has some plenary power under its statutory grant of continuing jurisdiction, that power is not unbridled. In this regard, it is important to understand what was decided in\n   <em>\n    Grendell\n   </em>\n   and what was not. The case was an original action for a writ of prohibition.

It was not an action to determine whether the probate court possessed jurisdiction over any particular issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203881393\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Grendell\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31 (it was only decided whether the probate court patently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction, and after concluding that it did not, the court was unwilling \"to issue a writ and circumvent the appellate process\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Nevertheless, in May and June 2016, the probate court entered two additional orders citing the Ohio Supreme Court's obiter dictum as the basis of its jurisdiction to proceed. In the May order, the probate court found certain provisions in the 1993 agreement to be in conflict with the Park District's authority and ordered the parties to negotiate a new agreement. In the June judgment entry, the probate court further held (1) that the 1993 agreement between the Park District and the township infringes on the Park District's authority to assume all control of all park lands within the territorial limits of the Park District, allegedly conflicting with R.C. Chapter 1545, and (2) that the Park District and the township must bear 75 percent of the $40,000 cost of the master commissioner under R.C. 2101.06 and 2101.07.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The fees were imposed against the township under the belief that the probate court has a plenary power to prevent others from interfering with the Park District's purposes under R.C. 2101.24(C), and as a result, the court could order any such party to pay the costs of investigating the Park District's operations despite the fact that those parties had no control over the Park District's operational management. Further, the probate court held that the creation of the Park District meant that all the \"township's lands used for township park purposes, regardless of the record ownership, are under the jurisdiction of the Park Board\" at the expense of the title owner's property rights and R.C. 1545.14, which expressly provides any public authority the ability to delegate some authority to a park district without surrendering all control over the park lands. In light of its sua sponte findings, the probate court concluded that the portions of the 1993 agreement that vested any control over the park lands with the Trustees were not enforceable, and the township was \"permanently restrained and enjoined\" from enforcing or acting on any of those provisions that preserved the township's authority over its own park lands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 29} This appeal followed in which the Trustees claim the probate court exceeded its jurisdiction by sua sponte voiding the terms of a lawful agreement entered under R.C. 1545.14 in the Confirmation Order and the June 2016 order and erred by imposing the master commissioner's fees as costs against the township.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 30} At the most basic of levels, the probate court's orders all depend on the proper invocation of the court's continuing jurisdiction over the Park District.

Chapter 1545. In this regard, the probate court had jurisdiction to consider the removal of the Commissioners. R.C. 1545.06. As a result, the appointment of the master commissioner to take testimony and report the testimony with respect to the potential removal of a Commissioner is not the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 35} The issue before us is whether the probate court exceeded the scope of its continuing jurisdiction to consider removing any one of the Commissioners, (1) by imposing costs upon the township as a separate legal entity-incurred through the appointment of the master commissioner for the express purpose of investigating allegations of financial misconduct within the Park District and to provide consulting services to the Park District; and (2) by invalidating a contractual agreement entered between the Park District and the township defining the scope of the Park District's involvement with the township's park lands.\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist.

The probate court exceeded its continuing jurisdiction to remove a commissioner in appointing the master commissioner to investigate all aspects\n   of the Park District's operations and its contractual relationship with the township and then impose those costs upon the township, a separate and distinct political body. The probate court also lacked jurisdiction to sua sponte enjoin the township from enforcing the negotiated contract terms of the 1993 agreement. The probate court's jurisdiction, as applicable in this case, is statutorily limited to determining whether to remove any of the Commissioners. More simply stated, the legislature has not provided the probate court with a general grant of fiduciary oversight over the Park District.\n   <em>\n    Grendell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12135410\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/147/366/\">\n    147 Ohio St.3d 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-1520\">\n    2016-Ohio-1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=66%20N.E.3d%20683\">\n    66 N.E.3d 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 27 (the legislature did not provide probate courts with a general supervisory power over park districts). Although we recognize that the probate court judge acted with good intentions in seeking the master commissioner's report before acting on the allegations in the review and that the master commissioner herself acted in good faith, nevertheless, there are limitations as to the scope of the probate court's jurisdiction under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Because the trial court exceeded the grant of continuing jurisdiction, the Confirmation Order and the June 2016 order were not within the purview of the probate court's plenary power over matters properly before it under R.C. 2101.24(C). Those orders must be vacated. Once the probate court concluded that removal of the commissioners was unnecessary based on the master commissioner's report, the inquiry should have terminated. No other action was authorized by the legislature, and the township is not a party over which the probate court has continuing jurisdiction-the township has no authority to remove or appoint any of the Commissioners. The master commissioner's fees imposed as costs against the township were improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 38} None of this is to suggest that the Park District is without protection or recourse with respect to others interfering with the Park District's operations or in resolving contract disputes over agreements entered under R.C. 1545.14 -the two primary areas of concern upon which the probate court acted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 39} As a separate and distinct political entity, the Park District is capable of suing and being sued in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Marrek v.
