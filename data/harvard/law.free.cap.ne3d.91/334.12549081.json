For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On July 24, 2015, plaintiff-appellee, Richard Lewis, Jr., acting pro se, filed suit against appellant and Alfa Insurance Corporation (\"Alfa\"). In his complaint, appellee alleged he sustained injuries to his body, as well as damages to his 2007 Lincoln MKZ, as a direct result of a collision caused by appellant. The complaint was served by certified mail on appellant and Alfa at \"P.O. BOX 2128[,] Brentwood, TN 37024-2128.\" (Summons.) The record contains two United States Postal Service notices indicating that \"Jeff Alexander\" received and signed for the complaint at that address on August 3, 2015. Appellee indicated at the top of his complaint that the \"[d]ate of loss\" was \"12/16/13.\" (Complaint at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On August 18, 2015, Alfa and appellant each filed separate answers. Both answers denied appellee's claims and asserted several defenses. Appellant specifically asserted the defense of \"insufficiency of service of process and insufficiency of process\" as well as \"lack of personal jurisdiction over this answering [d]efendant.\" (Answer at 2.) Appellant ultimately stated that \"having fully answered the Complaint of Plaintiff[ ], prays that same may be dismissed and that she may go hence and\n   recover her costs of suit herein.\" (Answer at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On December 11, 2015, appellant and Alfa jointly filed an initial identification of witnesses. On April 11, 2016, appellant and Alfa jointly filed a notice of deposition of appellee, and, on April 13, 2016, appellant and Alfa jointly filed an amended notice of deposition of appellee. On July 21, 2016, the case was referred to a magistrate to preside over a jury trial scheduled for December 6, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On August 5, 2016, appellant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, pursuant to Civ.R. 3, alleging that appellee had failed to commence this action within the time provided by law. Specifically, appellant argued that (1) she has never resided or maintained a post office box in Tennessee, (2) appellee requested service of the complaint of both her and Alfa at Alfa's post office box in Brentwood Tennessee, (3) at the time of the filing of the complaint, she was living in Columbus, Ohio, and (4) she never received any complaint of summons from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas related to this case. Appellant moved for dismissal with prejudice of the complaint for failure to commence the case by serving her within one year from the filing of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On August 18, 2016, appellee, pro se, filed a memorandum contra and conceded that he had served appellant at the address of Alfa. Appellee stated that he was now aware of appellant's address and would serve the complaint on her at that address if permitted to do so. Appellee argued that the clerk was at fault for not informing him that service on appellant had \"failed\" and that, as a consequence, the rules should be liberally construed to permit appellee to serve appellant. Appellee argued the case should not be dismissed with prejudice. On August 22, 2016, appellant filed a reply memorandum noting that her answer had specifically notified appellee that she had never been served and rejecting appellee's argument that the rules should be liberally construed to permit service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On October 19, 2016, the trial court granted appellant's motion to dismiss. The court noted that Civ.R. 3(A) was the rationale for dismissing appellant's claims, but Civ.R. 12(B)(2) served as the vehicle for effectuating the dismissal. The court rejected appellee's argument that the lack of service was the clerk's fault, but, nevertheless, determined that \"justice requires this case be dismissed without prejudice so that the plaintiff may have the opportunity to refile his claims if he so chooses.\" (Decision and Entry at 3.) Appellant timely appealed the trial court's decision and entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellant assigns the following two assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   I. The Trial Court erred to the prejudice of Defendant Jasmine Moore when it failed to dismiss the Plaintiff's Complaint with prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   II. The Trial Court erred to the prejudice of Defendant when it construed the motion to dismiss as a motion pursuant to Ohio Rule of Civil Procedure 12(B)(2) rather than Ohio Rule of Civil Procedure 3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} \" Civ.R. 3(A) states that '[a] civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court, if service is obtained within one year from such filing upon a named defendant.' Where service of process is not properly made pursuant to Civ.R. 4 et seq., the court lacks jurisdiction to consider the complaint and any judgment on that complaint is void ab initio.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Shah v.

(Appellant's Brief at 11.) Therefore, according to appellant, it was error to construe her motion to dismiss as a motion pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(2) rather than pursuant to Civ.R. 3(A).

Therefore, here, where the trial court dismissed the complaint pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(2),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   for lack of jurisdiction over the person, the court did not err in dismissing the case without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 17} This conclusion is supported by the Supreme Court of Ohio's holding in\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court affirmed a trial court's dismissal, without prejudice, pursuant to Civ.R. 41(B)(4) and 4(E), of a complaint where the plaintiff had failed to perfect service. The court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Having determined that where a defendant has not been served, a court does not have jurisdiction over the defendant, we find, in applying the maxim\n   <em>\n    expressio unius est exclusio alterius\n   </em>\n   , that such a dismissal would be\n   <em>\n    otherwise than on the merits\n   </em>\n   pursuant to Civ.R. 41(B)(4) to the exclusion of Civ.R. 41(B)(3) (adjudication on the merits) despite the fact that a trial court's entry may be silent on the issue. This is because Civ.R. 41(B)(4) provides an\n   <em>\n    exception\n   </em>\n   to the general rule that an entry dismissing a case pursuant to Civ.R. 41(B) that does not indicate otherwise is an adjudication\n   on the merits. Civ.R. 41(B)(3). In other words, where a case is dismissed because the court did not have jurisdiction, such as in this case where service has not been perfected, the dismissal is always otherwise than on the merits. Therefore, Civ.R. 41(B)(4) is the controlling subsection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (Emphasis sic.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 225,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=680%20N.E.2d%20997\">\n    680 N.E.2d 997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, we overrule appellant's first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Finally, we note that appellee has asserted that the savings statute at R.C. 2305.19\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   permits him to refile this case. We decline to address this issue, but note the Supreme Court has indicated that when a court dismissed a case for lack of service under Civ.R. 41(B)(4), the plaintiff may utilize the savings statute to refile within one year, \"providing all other procedural requirements of the savings statute have been met.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   at paragraph two of the syllabus. The parties did not address the procedural requirements of the savings statute here or below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore,\n   neither the parties nor the trial court has addressed whether the action was \"attempted to be commenced\" as required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    La Barbera v.

Civ.R. 4(E) states: 'Summons: time limit for service. If a service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendant within six months after the filing of the complaint and the party on whose behalf such service was required cannot show good cause why such service was not made within that period, the action shall be dismissed as to that defendant without prejudice upon the court's own initiative with notice to such party or upon motion. * * *'\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n    This rule is designed to clear the dockets of cases in which a plaintiff has not pursued service upon a defendant. In most instances, the rule would be applied when a plaintiff has neglected to again attempt service after original service of process fails. It is beyond question that the rule should have been applied in the instant action where the clerk was instructed to refrain from attempting service. The trial court should have dismissed Goolsby's complaint without prejudice because service was not attempted. Goolsby would then have been required to refile, and presumably would not have done so until the desire to serve Anderson also arose.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    The same sentiment applies to the case at bar.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    R.C. 2305.19 states: \"(A) In any action that is commenced or attempted to be commenced, if in due time a judgment for the plaintiff is reversed or if the plaintiff fails otherwise than upon the merits, the plaintiff or, if the plaintiff dies and the cause of action survives, the plaintiff's representative may commence a new action within one year after the date of the reversal of the judgment or the plaintiff's failure otherwise than upon the merits or within the period of the original applicable statute of limitations, whichever occurs later.

However, we do not find this case controlling as the dismissal therein was on grounds that the statute of limitations had expired. The trial court here did not dismiss on statute of limitations grounds, but, rather, for lack of jurisdiction over the person. Appellant also refers to\n    <em>\n     Lewis v.
