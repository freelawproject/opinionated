While there, he saw an acquaintance, the victim in this matter, and approached him. According to Mr. Baskerville, the victim owed him money and he wanted to speak with the victim regarding their business arrangement. There is no dispute that, while the two spoke, an argument developed, and the victim became increasingly upset. Eventually, the two walked out of the mall together as they continued to argue. The argument ended when Mr. Baskerville removed a knife from his pocket and stabbed the victim once in the side of the neck. The victim then stumbled back into the mall where he died shortly thereafter. According to Mr. Baskerville, he stabbed the victim in self-defense. He admitted, however, that he ran from the scene, disposed of his knife, sanitized his car, burned the clothes he was wearing, and left Ohio. The police apprehended Mr. Baskerville in West Virginia the following month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} A grand jury indicted Mr. Baskerville on two counts of murder and one count of aggravated murder, felonious assault, and carrying a concealed weapon. The matter proceeded to a jury trial, at the conclusion of which the jury found Mr. Baskerville not guilty of aggravated murder, but guilty of his remaining charges. The trial court sentenced him to fifteen years to life in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Mr. Baskerville now appeals from his convictions and raises eight assignments of error for our review.

Rather, he disclosed his prior convictions when he took the stand in his own defense. The State then inquired about the details of his prior convictions when cross-examining him. Mr. Baskerville argues that there was no reason for the State to \"rehash and repeat\" his convictions because he had already disclosed them. He also asserts that the circumstances underlying his convictions were irrelevant to his charges and that their introduction only served to portray him as a violent person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Mr. Baskerville's argument essentially consists of two prongs. Under the first prong, the issue is whether the State could ask Mr. Baskerville about his prior convictions on cross-examination. Under the second prong, the issue is whether the State could ask Mr. Baskerville about the facts underlying his prior convictions. Because Mr. Baskerville testified about his prior convictions during direct examination, he \"open[ed] the door for the [S]tate to question him about them on cross-examination.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1412073\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/38/346/#p350\">\n    38 Ohio St.3d 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 350,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=528%20N.E.2d%20910\">\n    528 N.E.2d 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). Thus, the State was free to inquire about his prior convictions. Mr. Baskerville's testimony on direct examination, however, did not address the details of his prior convictions. As such, Evid.R. 404(B) still applied when the State went beyond the fact of his convictions and sought to question him about their underlying circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=528%20N.E.2d%20910\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On direct examination, Mr. Baskerville conceded that he had a prior record consisting of a \"[m]ajority of drug charges, well, marijuana charges, * * * and * * * a gun charge of basically a weapons under disability * * *.\" He stated that he had six or seven felonies and had \"been to the penitentiary twice.\" It was his testimony that he had \"copped out\" to all of his prior felonies because he was guilty of them. Accordingly, he offered testimony that, when he was actually guilty of a crime, he conceded his wrongdoing and accepted his punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On cross-examination, the State asked Mr. Baskerville whether his prior weapons charge prohibited him from carrying a gun, and he agreed that was the case. Over objection, the State then asked him why he had been carrying a gun, and Mr. Baskerville responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Actually to protect myself. I was faced with a situation where I got into it with a group [of] men at a bar. I didn't know these guys from Adam and Eve, and word around town they were going to do something to me, and these are the type of guys that like to use guns, and, I mean, they was just for my protection. I had got stopped with the gun, actually. I was going through a sobriety checkpoint and got check with the guns and money and weed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Following his answer, the State asked Mr. Baskerville whether he had started carrying a knife after being caught with a gun. Mr. Baskerville responded that he did not carry a knife on a daily basis, but did carry one, at times, for protection. He agreed that the \"street business\" he conducted was dangerous and, at times, necessitated that he carry one. The State then turned to the sanctions Mr. Baskerville had received for his prior crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The State asked Mr. Baskerville whether all his prior convictions had been low-level felonies, and he agreed that was true. The following exchange then took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [PROSECUTOR:] And they all probably got probation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [MR. BASKERVILLE:] I had to go to prison.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [PROSECUTOR:] Eventually?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [MR. BASKERVILLE:] I mean, for a couple of them, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [PROSECUTOR:] Well, let's ask. Originally when you started getting your convictions you got probation, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [MR. BASKERVILLE:] For one, yeah, the first time I got probation, but after that I went to prison.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [PROSECUTOR:] Because you violated probation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [MR. BASKERVILLE:] Okay, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [PROSECUTOR:] So it wasn't like you were facing prison when you pled to those cases? You only ended up going to prison because you pled for probation, and then you end up violating probation and then going to prison?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [THE COURT:] Overruled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [MR. BASKERVILLE:] But I was still facing prison either way. If I would have took it to trial and lost, I would have been going to prison.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Mr. Baskerville then agreed that the stakes in his immediate case were higher than in his previous cases due to the potential for a much longer prison sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Upon review, this Court cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion when it allowed the State to ask Mr. Baskerville about the circumstances of his weapons charge and the sanctions he faced for his prior convictions. Mr. Baskerville was charged with stabbing the victim and claimed that he acted in self-defense. His testimony that he carried weapons to protect himself from the dangers he faced as a result of his illegal activities bore upon his intent to carry his knife as a weapon and his willingness to use it in a confrontation. As such, that testimony was relevant and offered for a legitimate purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125145\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/134/521/\">\n    134 Ohio St.3d 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-5695\">\n    2012-Ohio-5695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=983%20N.E.2d%201278\">\n    983 N.E.2d 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 20, citing Evid.R. 401 and 404(B). Moreover, even if that testimony had minimal probative value, Mr. Baskerville has not explained how its admission unfairly prejudiced him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. His testimony that he carried a weapon\n   to defend himself was consistent with the self-defense theory that he presented at trial. Any error in its admission, therefore, did not result in material prejudice to him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Ellis\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist. Summit No. 27013,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-4186\">\n    2014-Ohio-4186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204724756\">\n    2014 WL 4724756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 14} As to the State's questions about the sanctions Mr. Baskerville faced for his prior convictions, Mr. Baskerville has not explained how those questions sought to elicit other acts testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 16(A)(7). Assuming he takes issue with the fact that the State asked him about having violated probation, the record reflects that the State made its inquiries in response to the testimony he gave on direct examination. On direct examination, Mr. Baskerville testified that he had \"copped out\" to all of his previous felonies even though he had to go to prison on two occasions. His testimony implied that, when guilty, he would admit his wrongdoings and accept the consequences, even if it meant he would go to prison. The testimony the State was able to elicit on cross-examination showed that all of his previous charges were probation-eligible and that the only reason he went to prison was because he later violated the terms of his probation. As such, the State's line of questioning was offered in direct response to the implication that Mr. Baskerville created on direct examination. That is, it tended to detract from the implication that, had he truly been guilty here, Mr. Baskerville would have entered a plea in spite of the potential for a prison sentence. Under these circumstances, there was no error in the admission of that testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Greer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1414517\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/39/236/#p242\">\n    39 Ohio St.3d 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 242-243,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=530%20N.E.2d%20382\">\n    530 N.E.2d 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988).

They went to several stores and were about to walk into another when Mr. Baskerville called out to the victim. The victim's fianc\u00e9e was familiar with Mr. Baskerville because he had engaged in illegal dealings with both her brother and the victim. She testified that the victim stopped to speak with Mr. Baskerville and, as she continued into the store with her son, she heard Mr. Baskerville say \"[s]omething pertaining to money.\" She testified that the two men began to argue while she was inside the store and, at some point, the victim called her over to ask a question. Specifically, he asked whether Mr. Baskerville had told her about his (the victim's) infidelity. Once she confirmed that Mr. Baskerville had done so, she returned to the store, and the two men continued to argue. She testified that she heard the victim say, \"I don't have your money,\" and later heard one of the men say \"let's take this outside * * *.\" She then saw both men begin walking in the same direction, so she left the store with her son to follow them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 20} As the two men walked a distance in front of the victim's fianc\u00e9e, she could hear that they were still arguing. She testified that her fianc\u00e9 turned around twice and cautioned her \"to take [their] son and get back.\" Accordingly, she remained inside the mall with her son as the two men walked outside and stood on the sidewalk in front of the mall's glass entryway. She continued to watch as the victim stood with his back to her and Mr. Baskerville stood in front of him. The victim's fianc\u00e9e testified that the two men were \"steady arguing\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   when Mr. Baskerville jumped up, punched the victim in the neck, and ran. The victim then ran back inside while holding his neck. His fianc\u00e9e testified that he eventually stopped running and lost consciousness next to a raised platform in the center of one of the mall's aisles. She confirmed that a knife the police found on the platform resembled a pocket knife that the victim carried regularly. There was testimony that the knife's blade was out when the police found it and that DNA found on the knife's blade and handle was consistent with the victim's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Dr. Dorothy Dean, a former deputy medical examiner for Summit County, performed the victim's autopsy. She testified that the victim sustained a stab wound to the left side of his neck from a sharp instrument consistent with a knife. The instrument penetrated three inches \"into his neck from left to right\" and cut a large number of muscles, his jugular vein, and his trachea. Dr. Dean testified that the victim died from massive blood loss due to the stab wound he sustained. She further testified that, during her examination, she did not note any additional, relevant injuries to the victim that might be consistent with a struggle or defensive wounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Mr. Baskerville's father testified that, about half an hour after he arrived home on the night of the stabbing, he received a call from Mr. Baskerville. He testified that Mr. Baskerville routinely drove a red SUV and that the call was about the car. Specifically, Mr. Baskerville called to say that he had parked the car behind his father's house with the keys inside and would call back later. At that point, Mr. Baskerville's father had no knowledge of the stabbing. Within the next 15 minutes, however, people began to contact him and he received information from them. Mr. Baskerville then called him again later that evening. During the second phone call, Mr. Baskerville told his father that he had gotten into a confrontation at the mall with a man who owed him money. He stated that the man became irate and eventually suggested they \"take this outside\" even though he (Mr. Baskerville) told the man that \"[i]t ain't even got to go this far.\" He told his father that the man was very aggressive, shouting expletives and stating that he was not afraid of Mr. Baskerville. He told his father, after they went outside, he \"thought that [the man] was going to do something to [him],\" so he stabbed him in the neck and ran. Although Mr. Baskerville's father encouraged him to turn himself in, Mr. Baskerville did not do so. Meanwhile, his father contacted the police to report that Mr. Baskerville's car was parked at his house. There was testimony that the car had been wiped clean, but that forensic scientists were still able to find DNA on swabs taken from its interior. There was testimony that the DNA they found was consistent with the victim's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Detective James Pasheilich testified that he secured an arrest warrant for Mr. Baskerville within a few hours of the stabbing, but that he evaded capture for more than a month. The detective testified that his department had to ask the Northeastern Fugitive Task Force to aid in Mr. Baskerville's apprehension. He testified that the task force eventually found Mr. Baskerville in West Virginia and secured his return to Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Mr. Baskerville testified in his own defense and also presented the testimony of a friend who worked at a kiosk in the mall where the stabbing occurred. The friend testified that he was working the evening of the stabbing and Mr. Baskerville came to the kiosk to ask questions about a cell phone repair. While the friend was helping other customers, he saw Mr. Baskerville walk over to a nearby shoe\n   store and begin talking to a man he did not recognize. As their conversation continued, the friend testified that the other man (the victim) began talking louder and acting \"a little upset\" while Mr. Baskerville remained quiet and \"kind of nonchalant.\" He testified that, at one point, he heard Mr. Baskerville tell the other man, \"it don't have to be like this; he don't have to get loud because it * * * wasn't that serious.\" The friend last observed the two men walk away together while a woman and a small child trailed behind them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Mr. Baskerville testified that he and his cousin went to the mall that evening so that he could stop at his friend's kiosk regarding his cell phone. While there, he happened to see the victim and went to speak to him. He testified that he had not seen the victim for several months and, before that, had fronted the victim drugs with the understanding that the victim would sell them and return with money. Mr. Baskerville stated that the victim did not respond when he first called over to him, so he tried again. He testified that, once he got the victim's attention and asked about their unfinished business, the victim immediately became upset. Mr. Baskerville claimed that he tried to get the victim to calm down because he only wanted to know why the victim had failed to follow through with their arrangement. He testified, however, that the victim told him, \"mother f* * *er, I don't owe you s* * *,\" and accused Mr. Baskerville of recently trying to find him. As Mr. Baskerville continued to ask the victim about their deal amidst the victim's expletive-laced responses, the victim said: \"If you think that, we going to settle this s* * * outside. Let's go outside.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 26} According to Mr. Baskerville, after the victim suggested they go outside, he felt his phone vibrate and realized it was time to leave and go pick up his kids. He then told his cousin to meet him at the car and began walking outside. Although he walked alongside the victim, Mr. Baskerville testified that it was his intention to leave and \"kind of defuse the situation.\" Nevertheless, he admitted that he and the victim ended up outside, standing face-to-face. He acknowledged there was \"tension in the air\" as the two faced each other. He testified that, as they argued, the victim stated: \"[B]* * * *, I don't owe you s* * *. I leave you right where you stand.\" According to Mr. Baskerville, he took the latter statement as a threat and, shortly after the victim uttered it, the victim went to reach to his side or to his pocket. At that moment, Mr. Baskerville felt that if he did not \"do something right [then] to stop what[ was] about to happen, something[ ] [would] happen to [him].\" He, therefore, quickly \"pop[ped] [his] knife out\" and struck the victim. He testified that he did not know where he struck the victim and did not intend to kill him. He stated that, when he backed up, he saw something in the victim's hand before turning to run. Mr. Baskerville confirmed that he was carrying a knife in his pocket that day, but claimed that he only carried it as a protective measure. He also testified that he knew the victim had a reputation for being \"a snake and a bully\" and for carrying a weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Mr. Baskerville admitted that, after he stabbed the victim, he took steps to hide evidence from the police. Specifically, he admitted that he took his car to his father's house, wiped it down with cleaning solution, burned the clothes he was wearing, and left town. He further admitted that he disposed of his knife, which he later termed \"the murder weapon,\" somewhere between Akron and West Virginia. According to Mr. Baskerville, he went to West Virginia to try to earn money for his defense. He acknowledged, however, that he did not learn about the intricacies of\n   self-defense until he was apprehended and spoke to another inmate at the jail. He acknowledged that the inmate told him how he had \"beat a body case\" (i.e., a murder case) by tweaking his story to reflect that he had acted in self-defense. Mr. Baskerville conceded that, at that point, he was deciding whether to lie about what had happened. He admitted saying that his decision to lie would depend upon the quality of the evidence the police had against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Mr. Baskerville argues that his convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence because (1) he was not at fault in creating the violent situation that erupted here, (2) he possessed a bona fide belief that he was in imminent harm, and (3) before he acted, he had attempted to leave. He asserts that there can be \"no doubt\" the victim pulled a knife on him, as the police found the knife next to the victim's body. Accordingly, he argues that the jury lost its way by not concluding that he acted in self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Having reviewed the record, we cannot conclude that the jury lost its way when it rejected Mr. Baskerville's claim of self-defense. A person is only entitled to use deadly force if his \" 'only means of escape was the use of force' \" such that he did not violate a duty to retreat or avoid the danger.\n   <em>\n    Goff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5760984\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/128/169/\">\n    128 Ohio St.3d 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-6317\">\n    2010-Ohio-6317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=942%20N.E.2d%201075\">\n    942 N.E.2d 1075\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 36, quoting\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1752225\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/77/323/#p326\">\n    77 Ohio St.3d at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=673%20N.E.2d%201339\">\n    673 N.E.2d 1339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The jury heard testimony that Mr. Baskerville and the victim began their disagreement in the mall before walking outside together and arguing face-to-face. They also heard testimony that the victim, who was angry, swearing, and allegedly had a reputation for violence, had specifically suggested that he and Mr. Baskerville settle their argument outside.

The court admitted a total of 31 mall photographs, all of which were taken after the victim's body had been removed. One of the photographs simply depicts the sign for the mall, so it is clearly not gruesome in nature. The remaining photographs show the area where Mr. Baskerville and the victim were standing outside and the path the victim took back through the mall to the place where he ultimately lost consciousness and died. The vast majority of the photographs show little to no blood on the ground, but several depict a large amount of blood in the area where the victim ultimately collapsed. Mr. Baskerville argues that the court erred by admitting the mall photographs because they were simply used \"for shock value to inflame the jury * * *.\" Yet, \" 'photos of blood stains * * * do not have a shock\n   value equivalent to a photograph of a corpse.

The first photograph depicted the victim's entire body, and Dr. Dean used it to show old scars that the victim had, injuries he received strictly from medical intervention, and bags that he initially had on his hands to preserve potential evidence. The second picture depicted the victim's face, washed clean, and Dr. Dean used it for identification purposes, as well as to show the lack of any injury. Five of the other pictures, taken from different angles, depicted the backs and fronts of the victim's hands. Dr. Dean used those pictures to show that the victim had a significant amount of blood on his hands, but no injuries that would suggest either a struggle or a defensive wound.

The juvenile testified that he and his friend heard Mr. Baskerville and the victim arguing, so they decided to follow them in hopes of seeing further argument or a fight. They walked outside behind the men and passed by them when the men stopped. The juvenile testified that he could not recall exactly what the men were saying, but it involved money. Although the prosecutor attempted to employ the procedure for refreshing a witness' recollection, the juvenile would not respond affirmatively when the prosecutor asked whether reviewing his prior statement would aid his memory. The prosecutor then asked the juvenile whether he remembered hearing one of the men make a statement about a gun, and the juvenile stated that he did not. At that point, the prosecutor sought to introduce the statement that the juvenile gave to the police, and defense counsel objected on the basis that the prosecutor was attempting to impeach his own witness. Following an extended side bar discussion, the prosecutor once again attempted to use the procedure for refreshing a witness' recollection. The juvenile then agreed that it would be helpful to review his prior statement and did so before questioning resumed. The juvenile ultimately agreed that he had heard either Mr. Baskerville or the victim say something about a gun. He did not recall what exactly was said or by whom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Mr. Baskerville argues that the trial court erred when it allowed the juvenile to testify that he heard a statement about a gun. He argues that the juvenile's testimony was improper because the State essentially had to impeach him to elicit it. Yet, even assuming the procedure here was flawed, Mr. Baskerville has not explained how that error affected his substantial rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crim.R. 52(A). The victim died as a result of a stabbing, not a shooting, and there was no suggestion at trial that either Mr. Baskerville or the victim possessed a gun at the time of this incident. Additionally, the juvenile who testified readily admitted that he could not recall what was said about a gun or which man even uttered that statement. Under these facts and circumstances, Mr. Baskerville has not shown that he suffered any prejudice as a result of the trial court's error, if any.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%201539064\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As such, his fifth assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 3\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   THE PROSECUTOR'S CONDUCT THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL ROSE TO THE LEVEL OF PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT AND DEPRIVED MR.

The jury here reasonably could have concluded that, by not remaining in the mall or otherwise retreating from the victim, Mr. Baskerville violated a duty to retreat or avoid the danger. Thus, he has not shown that he would have prevailed on his claim of self-defense, but for the court's at fault instruction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   at 27,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=759%20N.E.2d%201240\">\n    759 N.E.2d 1240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . His second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Second, Mr. Baskerville argues that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury on the lesser-included offenses of involuntary manslaughter, voluntary manslaughter, and aggravated assault. With regard to voluntary manslaughter and aggravated assault, both\n   offenses require a person to have acted \"while under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage * * *.\" R.C. 2903.03(A) ; R.C. 2903.12(A). The trial court specifically denied Mr. Baskerville's request for an instruction on voluntary manslaughter because there was no evidence that he met the foregoing requirement. Mr. Baskerville never claimed to be angry or motivated by rage. Indeed, it was his testimony that he remained calm and tried to defuse the situation with the victim. He testified that he only stabbed the victim because he felt that he was in imminent harm. Moreover, the friend whose testimony he presented in his defense described him as quiet and \"kind of nonchalant\" during his exchange with the victim. Even viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Mr. Baskerville,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meadows\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-4271\">\n    2013-Ohio-4271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205439847\">\n    2013 WL 5439847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 8, there was no evidence that he stabbed the victim \"while under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage.\" R.C. 2903.03(A) ; R.C. 2903.12(A). Thus, the evidence did not reasonably support a conviction on the offenses of voluntary manslaughter and aggravated assault, and the trial court did not err by refusing to instruct on those offenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lockhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-914\">\n    2017-Ohio-914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201051980\">\n    2017 WL 1051980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 14, quoting\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1090904\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/89/593/#p600\">\n    89 Ohio St.3d at 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=734%20N.E.2d%20345\">\n    734 N.E.2d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 50} To the extent Mr. Baskerville argues that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury on involuntary manslaughter, the record reflects that he waived that instruction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lockhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-914\">\n    2017-Ohio-914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201051980\">\n    2017 WL 1051980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 14 (\"A defendant * * * retains the right to waive such instructions, including through counsel.\"). Mr. Baskerville's counsel specifically informed the court that he was not requesting an involuntary manslaughter instruction because, as a matter of law, Mr. Baskerville was not entitled to it. Even if defense counsel was incorrect in his legal assessment, \"[a] party will not be permitted to take advantage of an error which he himself invited or induced the trial court to make.\"\n   <em>\n    Lester v.
