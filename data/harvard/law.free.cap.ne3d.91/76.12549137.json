Johnson, Esq. (\"Johnson\") appeals the trial court's grant of summary judgment on behalf of defendants-appellees, U.S. Title Agency, Inc. (\"US Title\") and Chicago Title Insurance Company (\"Chicago Title\") on several grounds, arising from the closing of a home renovation construction loan. After a thorough review of the record, the matter is reversed and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND AND FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In 2008, Johnson hired Berns Custom Homes (\"Berns\") as the general contractor (\"Contractor\") to renovate his recently purchased home in Bentleyville, Ohio (\"Property\"). Johnson obtained a $815,581 construction loan (the \"Loan\") from KeyBank National Association (\"KeyBank\") to satisfy the existing mortgage and finance the renovations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Johnson, an attorney specializing in legal malpractice issues, retained counsel Mark Wachter (\"Wachter\") to assist him with negotiating the Loan. A key factor in the negotiations was to ensure that\n   the project proceeded to completion and that contractual and insurance protections were sufficient to accomplish this goal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} At Wachter's recommendation, the parties agreed that US Title would serve as the closing agent, escrow agent, and title agent for Chicago Title who would issue the title policies. KeyBank provided written closing instructions to US Title for the transaction, entitled \"Construction-to-Permanent Closing Instructions\" (\"Closing Instructions\"). Wachter allegedly issued verbal closing instructions to US Title (\"Johnson Closing Instructions\"), asking for the same protections against mechanics liens that KeyBank received, and for compliance with KeyBank's Closing Instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Closing took place at the offices of US Title, who was charged with, among other responsibilities, adhering to the Closing Instructions or absorbing liability for their failure to do so. Documents executed at the closing included the construction loan agreement and rider dated May 27, 2010 (collectively \"Loan Agreement\"), and the mortgage agreement that included a construction rider (\"Mortgage\"). The Mortgage, executed by Johnson and KeyBank, and recorded by US Title, included a construction rider, and a provision that no lien whatsoever could take priority over the Mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Following the printed provisions, the Loan Agreement contains a signature block signed by Johnson and the date May 27, 2010. The next page contains a contractor's consent clause (the \"Consent Clause\") with a signature block for Berns and the date of May 27, 2010 inserted, followed by a signature page executed by a KeyBank director, on behalf of KeyBank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The Consent Clause provides that the Contractor \"hereby subordinates its lien on the Property, now existing or hereafter arising, to the lien of the Security Documents.\" The sum of $477,723.00 is also set forth, representing the amount of the construction contract between Johnson and Berns. The signature portion below the subordinate clause contained typewritten language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   May 27, 2010\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   CONTRACTOR\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Berns Custom Homes, Inc.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   By: ________________________\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Name: Justin Berns\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Authorized Signatory\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 8} US Title concedes in its appellate brief that, \"when signed,\" the Consent Clause, \"provides for the Contractor to contractually subordinate his rights to any liens the Contractor may file on the property, now or in the future, in favor of the Mortgage such that the Mortgage would still remain in first position.\" Though the May 27, 2010 date is inserted below the clause, and the name of the authorized signatory for Berns is typed underneath the signature line, US Title states that it did not have Berns sign because Berns was not a party to the Loan, and it was not required by the Closing Instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On June 14, 2010, US Title provided Johnson with a copy of the HUD-1 settlement statement setting forth the charges and allocations for the transaction. The HUD-1 reflects Johnson's payment for Closing Protection Coverage (\"CP Coverage\"). On July 15, 2010, US Title provided Johnson's counsel with a copy of the owner's policy of title insurance (\"Owner's Policy\") issued by Chicago Title for the Loan and Mortgage. Also on that date, US Title states it provided KeyBank with a copy of the lender's policy of title insurance (\"Lender's Policy\") issued by Chicago Title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 10} As required by Ohio law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Johnson was offered CP Coverage via a closing protection letter form (\"CP Letter\") from US Title that Johnson signed indicating acceptance. According to the language of the CP Letter, the CP Coverage indemnified Johnson for any loss resulting from listed conditions, including the closing agent's \"[f]ailure to comply with any applicable written closing instructions, when agreed to by the Licensed Agent [US Title].\" No exclusions are listed in the CP Letter. The parties agree that Johnson paid for and was entitled to the CP Coverage, but did not receive a copy of the CP Coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 11} During September 2010 to October 2010, a dispute arose between Berns and Johnson. Johnson terminated Berns. Berns and four subcontractors filed mechanic's liens for $297,191. The matter proceeded to mandatory mediation and, later, to arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 12} US Title notified KeyBank of the liens on December 29, 2010. KeyBank dishonored Johnson's draw request as a result. Subsequently, Johnson discovered that: (1) the Lender's Policy had not been issued to KeyBank until after KeyBank was provided with notice of the liens, an assertion disputed by US Title, (2) the CP Coverage policy that Johnson purchased had not been provided to Johnson, (3) the Consent Clause containing the Contractor's consent to subrogation to the Mortgage of all liens had not been executed by the Contractor; (4) neither the Owner's Policy nor the Lender's Policy contained a future advance endorsement or exclusion protecting against priority of mechanics liens, and (5) the use of an open end form of mortgage instead of the Mortgage used in this transaction would have assured priority for future advances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On several dates between December 31, 2010 and January 17, 2011, Johnson and his counsel corresponded with US Title and Chicago Title requesting removal of the liens pursuant to the CP Coverage and the title insurance under the Owner's Policy, and asserting Johnson's third-party beneficiary status under KeyBank's Lender's Policy. Johnson also requested that the Owner's Policy be corrected to remove the lien exceptions, and that appellees satisfy the mechanics liens claim. Johnson asserted that appellees' failure to comply with the Closing Instructions caused the current issues. Appellees did not respond to the claim requests. The liens remained and KeyBank refused to release further draws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Johnson filed suit against US Title and Chicago Title. The complaint asserts six counts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   I. US Title-breach of contract against US Title including the failure to insure for mortgage priority, violating the Closing Instructions, failing to have the contractor sign the Construction Loan, refusal to honor the title policies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   II. Chicago Title-breach of contract against Chicago Title including the failure of Chicago Title's agent, US Title, to properly handle the closing; and denial of claims under the owner's policy, closing protection coverage, and as a third-\n   party beneficiary of KeyBank's Lender's Policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   III. Chicago Title and US Title-specific performance and injunctive relief requiring that appellees extinguish the liens, provide for subordination of the liens or issue title insurance insuring over any after-filed liens.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   IV. US Title-alleging US Title was negligent in performing professional services by failing to issue the proper title insurance policies, filing closing documents without properly examining them for compliance with the requirement that the Mortgage must maintain priority over subsequent liens.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   V. US Title-breach of fiduciary duty to Johnson, including the failure to correctly conduct the closing to effect the intention of the parties that the Mortgage maintain priority at all time, and to record and/or issue the proper documents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   VI. Chicago Title and US Title-breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing by failing to remedy the problems caused by the breaches set forth in Counts I through V.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Private mediation between the parties was unsuccessful. The court ordered plaintiff's expert deadline of May 15, 2013, defense's expert deadline of June 15, 2013, and dispositive motion deadline of July 1, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Chicago Title filed for summary judgment on June 27, 2013, supported by evidence including testimony from Johnson, Edward R. Horejs, Jr. (\"Horejs\") of Chicago Title, Michael Gerome (\"Gerome\") of US Title, title expert Michael Waiwood (\"Waiwood\"), and various exhibits. US Title filed for summary judgment on June 28, 2013. The motion was supported by Waiwood's affidavit. Appellees also filed motions to prevent Johnson from offering expert witness testimony at trial due to his failure to designate an expert by the deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Johnson filed for summary judgment on July 1, 2013, with evidence that included a supporting affidavit by Johnson. Johnson was granted leave until August 14, 2013, to respond to appellees' motions for summary judgment. On August 14, 2013, Johnson filed the replies to summary judgment, and a motion for leave to submit the expert report of Dr. Robert Belinger (\"Belinger\"), opposed by appellees. A series of motions ensued between the parties regarding the expert report; however, there are no dispositive journal entries in the record resolving any of these motions. On August 29, 2013, Johnson filed the notice of original affidavit of Belinger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On September 18, 2013, the trial court granted appellees' motions for summary judgment, and denied Johnson's motion, finding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (1) Johnson's claims are excluded by the express terms of the Owner's Policy and CP Coverage as the liens were created by Johnson after closing and after he chose to fire the Contractor;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (2) Johnson's claims were excluded by the CP Coverage terms, as Johnson created the lien problem and he failed to provide written closing instructions to US Title seeking a variance of the customary exclusions and limitations regarding mechanics liens;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (3) Johnson lacked standing to assert a breach of contract regarding the KeyBank's Lender's Policy and Closing Instructions, as he failed to demonstrate that he was a party to those documents; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (4) the claims for bad faith, specific performance and injunctive relief failed as a result of the court's finding on the stated issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Johnson appealed; however, this court dismissed the appeal because Counts IV and V of the amended complaint had not been resolved.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 21, 2014, the trial court dismissed the two counts pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A), without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 20} A second appeal was filed on March 24, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This court granted Johnson's motion to dismiss the appeal on June 13, 2014, because the Civ.R. 41(A) dismissal was not sufficient to constitute a final appealable order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A court order granting a motion for summary judgment without actually entering judgment for any party is not an final order.\n   <em>\n    Bapst v. Goodwin\n   </em>\n   , 4th Dist. Pike No. 08CA780,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-6244\">\n    2009-Ohio-6244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%204264349\">\n    2009 WL 4264349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ], \u00b6 9. It is not made final or appealable by the dismissal of some other claims without prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The trial court returned the case to the active docket and issued dispositive motion deadlines for the remaining counts. US Title and Johnson filed \"renewed\" motions for summary judgment. Johnson's filing included an affidavit from Wachter. The affidavit was not submitted with Johnson's prior motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 22} On September 24, 2015, the trial court granted summary judgment for appellees on Counts IV and V of the amended complaint without opinion. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Johnson advances four assignments of error proposing various grounds upon which the trial court improperly granted summary judgment in this case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   I. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants as to plaintiff's claims for breach of contract where defendants failed to properly execute the Closing Instructions, failed to honor the terms of their policies, and failed to issue the correct policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   II. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of US Title as to plaintiff's claim for breach of fiduciary duty where US Title served as an escrow agent for plaintiff and KeyBank, and breached its duty to follow the Closing Instructions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   III. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of US Title as to plaintiff's claim for negligence where US Title failed to secure the correct form of coverage for plaintiff and failed to follow Closing Instructions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   IV. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants as to plaintiff's claim for bad faith where defendants failed to acknowledge receipt and pay plaintiff's claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Our standard of review for summary judgment appeals is de novo:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   We review the trial court's decision on summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

According to Waiwood, the CP Coverage only covers liens to the extent that protections are contained in a title insurance binder, commitment or policy. The title insurance policies in this case specifically exclude lien coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   {\u00b6 73} We agree that the plain language of the CP Coverage excludes coverage for the liens created by Johnson.

Here, the parties agree that the signing of the Loan Agreement by the Contractor would have protected the priority of the Mortgage. There is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether appellees are liable under the CP Coverage and what damages, if any, Johnson may establish as a result. \"Under the plain language of the CP [Coverage], the only relevant inquiry in this case is whether * * * [the] issuing agent failed to comply with * * * relevant written closing instructions.\"\n   <em>\n    FDIC v.

The resolution of this issue turns on establishing that Johnson provided verbal closing instructions to US Title directing that US Title issue an Owner's Policy with exclusion for mechanics liens, as the KeyBank Closing Instructions did not specify the exclusion for the Owner's Policy, only for the lender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   {\u00b6 76} In light of our determination that Johnson is a third-party beneficiary of the Closing Instructions, that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to the provision of verbal closing instructions by Johnson, and that the language of the CP Coverage addresses a loss of settlement\n   funds due to an agent's failure to comply with \"applicable written closing instructions,\" we reverse the trial court's finding and remand to the trial court for further consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Despite Johnson's assertions otherwise, his emails to U.S. Title were not notice to Chicago Title, as required by the Owner's Policy. There is no genuine issue of material fact that the first notice Chicago Title had of the claims was when Johnson filed the amended complaint adding Chicago Title as a defendant. Indeed, Johnson admits that he gave no notice to Chicago Title prior to filing his amended complaint. Based on\n   <em>\n    Kincaid\n   </em>\n   and the notice provisions of the Policy, Johnson lacks standing to bring suit; his claims against Chicago Title fail; and summary judgment in favor of Chicago Title was properly granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   {\u00b6 88} With respect to U.S. Title, Johnson asserts claims for breach of contract, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and bad faith (Counts I, IV, V, and VI respectively of the amended complaint). I would\n   hold that the trial court properly granted summary judgment to U.S. Title on all of these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   {\u00b6 89} Johnson contends that the closing instructions were either an express or implied-in-fact contract between U.S. Title, himself, and KeyBank. Johnson claims that U.S. Title breached this alleged contract by failing to (1) obtain his contractor's signature on the construction loan agreement; (2) advise KeyBank that its choice of a closed-end mortgage was wrong; and (3) secure title insurance with exclusions for any liens filed against his property after the closing date of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   {\u00b6 90} But the evidence is clear that Johnson never submitted any written closing instructions to U.S. Title. Indeed, it is undisputed that the only written closing instructions were issued by KeyBank to U.S. Title. The evidence is also clear that the closing instructions issued by KeyBank did not contemplate losses incurred by Johnson. In fact, the instructions specifically stated that U.S. Title \"will be made liable for losses incurred\n   <em>\n    by the Lender\n   </em>\n   as a result of the agent closing a loan with knowledge that errors were contained in any documents or instructions.\" (Emphasis added.) The instructions did not require coverage for the alleged losses Johnson now claims, and therefore, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   {\u00b6 91} The majority concludes that although Johnson is not a party to the contract created by the closing instructions, he has standing to pursue his breach of contract claim as a third-party beneficiary of the closing instructions. The problem with this analysis is two-fold. First, Johnson never raised his third-party beneficiary claim in the trial court and thus has waived it for purposes of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   {\u00b6 92} Moreover, even assuming Johnson is a third-party beneficiary of the closing instructions, his breach of contract claim still fails. Contrary to Johnson's assertions otherwise, there is simply no evidence in the record that KeyBank ever asked either U.S. Title or Chicago Title to insure over unreleased mechanic's liens to allow KeyBank to make further construction disbursements. Indeed, the plain language of the construction loan agreement makes clear KeyBank's intention to seek title endorsements before making disbursements. The agreement specifically provides that KeyBank could request title endorsements and refuse to disburse further construction funds to Johnson if unreleased mechanic's liens on the property were discovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   {\u00b6 93} Further, the record reflects that KeyBank informed Johnson that the transaction was closed correctly, and that KeyBank was not obligated to disburse more construction funds to Johnson in light of the mechanic's liens. Thus, despite Johnson's assertion that the mechanic's lien exclusion should not have been included in the title policy, it is apparent that KeyBank got exactly what it wanted at closing. Logically then, as a third-party beneficiary of the closing instructions, Johnson did too. Consequently, there was no breach of the closing instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   {\u00b6 94} Johnson also cannot demonstrate a breach of contract under the Owner's Policy. Under the exclusions from coverage, Johnson is not covered for liens that attached or were created after the date of the policy. Even Johnson's expert agreed that there is no coverage under the Owner's Policy for liens filed after the date of the policy. The policy is dated June 2, 2010; the mechanic's liens were recorded well after the date of the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   {\u00b6 95} Likewise, Johnson cannot prove breach of the closing protection coverage. As the trial court correctly recognized,\n   Johnson's closing protection coverage excludes coverage for \"matters created, suffered, assumed or agreed to by you and/or your agents or employees.\" The mechanic's liens arose when Johnson refused to pay his contractor. Thus, it is apparent that Johnson's claims arose out of a situation he created, and therefore, the \"created, suffered, assumed or agreed to\" exclusion applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   {\u00b6 96} Johnson's negligence claim against U.S. Title also fails. It is well established that there is no cause of action for negligence where the alleged duty arises out of a contract.\n   <em>\n    Corporex Dev. &amp; Constr. Mgmt. v.

The majority apparently agrees, finding that Johnson is a third-party beneficiary of the closing instructions. Nevertheless, the majority improperly holds that Johnson's negligence claim can proceed upon remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   {\u00b6 98} I would find that Johnson's breach of fiduciary duty claim against U.S. Title also fails. Johnson is not a party to the Lender's Policy and cannot create a duty owed to him by U.S. Title based on contractual terms between U.S. Title and KeyBank. Furthermore, even assuming that U.S. Title, as escrow agent, was an agent of both KeyBank and Johnson, Johnson's breach of fiduciary claim still fails. It is undisputed that Johnson never provided any written instructions to U.S. Title. Although Johnson asserts that his attorney called U.S. Title and stated that Johnson wanted his coverage to be \"no less comprehensive than that of KeyBank,\" in light of KeyBank's representation that the transaction closed appropriately, there is no issue of fact that U.S. Title followed KeyBank's closing instructions. Thus, Johnson cannot demonstrate that U.S. Title breached its fiduciary duty to him in carrying out KeyBank's written closing instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   {\u00b6 99} Finally, I would find that Johnson's bad faith claim against U.S. Title fails. Ohio law is clear that a purported breach of a covenant of good faith and fair dealing is not an independent tort claim upon which liability can attach. Good faith is part of a contract claim and does not stand alone.\n   <em>\n    Pappas v. Ippolito\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3876067\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/177/625/\">\n    177 Ohio App.3d 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-3976\">\n    2008-Ohio-3976\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=895%20N.E.2d%20610\">\n    895 N.E.2d 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Dist.). Nor is U.S. Title an insurer such that an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing should be attributed to its relationship with Johnson.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57. Accordingly, the trial court properly granted summary judgment on Johnson's bad faith claim. By finding Johnson to be a third-party beneficiary of the closing instructions, the majority implicitly finds that his claim arises in contract. Accordingly, it errs in holding that his bad faith claim against the defendants can proceed upon remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   {\u00b6 100} Because there are no genuine issues of material fact regarding any of Johnson's claims, I would affirm the trial court's ruling granting summary judgment to U.S. Title and Chicago Title.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
