Valentino-Val, L.L.C. (\"Lombardo\"), appeals from the trial court's decision granting partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiff-appellee, Beverage Holdings, L.L.C. (\"Beverage\"). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On April 29, 2011, Lombardo and Beverage entered into an agreement in which Beverage purchased from Lombardo a preschool/daycare business known as the Goddard School and the property upon which it was located for $1,726,000. Lombardo was not able to sell the building at the time of the sale because of outstanding debt it had on its mortgage. As a result, Lombardo and Beverage, through related entities, entered into a sale of the business itself and a lease agreement for Beverage, through its related company, PRB Development, L.L.C. The lease agreement provided that Beverage would lease the property and continue to run the Goddard School until Lombardo was able to sell the real property. The real property purchase agreement permitted closing of the sale of the real property to occur sometime in the future, with an anticipated closing being several years from the date the agreement was signed. The agreement provided Beverage with the right to notify Lombardo when it wanted to close the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In the interim, the parties agreed that Beverage would make monthly rental payments to Lombardo in the amount of $12,500 until the parties closed on the transaction. Beverage also paid the real property taxes, assessments, property and fire insurance, all utilities, all use and occupancy taxes, and all maintenance and repairs. Under section 3 of the agreement, the calculation of the purchase price was subject to several adjustments. Section 3 provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Adjustments to Purchase Price.\n   </em>\n   At closing, the purchase price shall be adjusted by providing [Beverage] a credit for the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   a) The Purchase Price shall be decreased by:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ii) Rents received by Seller from the tenant of the Premises, prorated to date of closing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On March 12, 2015, Beverage sent Lombardo a notice of its intent to purchase the property. On May 19, 2015, Lombardo responded by notifying Beverage that it was revoking the agreement and disputed Beverage's interpretation of the section 3(a)(ii), which adjusted the final purchase price for the rents paid by Beverage. Beverage then filed a complaint against Lombardo for declaratory judgment, damages, injunction, specific performance, and other legal and equitable relief. Beverage alleges that Lombardo breached the agreement when it unilaterally revoked and repudiated on the purchase agreement when Beverage exercised its \"notice of intent to close transaction.\" Beverage sought to purchase the premises for $1,202,110.09, which included adjustments for principal payments, prepayment fee, $462,500 in rent credits, and the security deposit. Lombardo refused to accept the final purchase price, alleging that Beverage failed to close within 180 days of signing the purchase agreement. Lombardo further alleged that the agreement intended to provide credits only for rents received for the period following the date of closing, prorated to the date of closing. Relevant to this appeal, Beverage sought a declaratory judgment\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   a) As to the calculation of the final purchase price pursuant to the terms and conditions stated in the Purchase Agreement; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   b) The interpretation of how much in rent is subject to the reduction noted in Section 3 of the Purchase Agreement where it states that the purchase price will be reduced by: \"Rents received by Seller from the tenant of the Premises, prorated to date of Closing.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. After reviewing both motions, the trial court denied Lombardo's motion for summary judgment and granted Beverage's motion in part. In a thoughtful opinion, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [Beverage] seeks a declaratory judgment interpreting Section 3(a)(ii) of the Agreement. Section 3(a)(ii) states the purchase price for the property shall be adjusted by providing [Beverage] a credit for \"Rents received by [Lombardo] from [Beverage] of the Premises, prorated to date of closing.\" Both parties agree there is a credit for rents received. [Beverage] believes the credit applies to all rents received from the date of the Agreement. [Lombardo] believes the credit applies only to a prorated amount of the last month's rent according to the date of closing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   When parties to a contract dispute the meaning of the contract language, courts must first look to the four corners of the document to determine whether or not ambiguity exists. If the contract terms are clear and precise, the contract is not ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beasly [ Beasley] v.

In contrast, the language does not support [Lombardo's] interpretation limiting the credit to a prorated amount of a single month's rent payment. No such limit exists in the actual language used by the parties. The Agreement clearly provides [Beverage] a credit for rents received by [Lombardo], and allows for the final month's rent credit to be prorated according to the date of closing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The interpretation of Section [3(a)(ii) ] is appropriate for disposition through a declaratory judgment action. As there are no issues of material fact and because reasonable minds can come to but one\n   conclusion, [Beverage] is entitled to Summary Judgment on Count I of its Complaint as it relates to the interpretation of Section 3(a)(ii) of the Agreement. The Court finds that Section 3(ii)(a) of the Agreement provides [Beverage] a credit for all rents paid from the date of the Agreement until closing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 6} It is from this order Lombardo appeals, raising the following three assignments of error for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error One\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The trial erred when it interpreted the contract to provide for a credit of all rent paid and failed to give full effect to the term \"prorated\" in the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Two\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The trial court erred when it failed to consider extrinsic evidence in interpreting the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Three\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The trial court erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of [Beverage] as to the interpretation of the parties' contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Within these assigned errors, Lombardo argues the trial court erred in interpreting the contract to provide Beverage with a credit for all rents paid from the date of the agreement until closing, instead of prorating the rent to the month of closing.

Lombardo contends the above phrase means that the purchase price is reduced only by the singular prorated rent paid in the month of closing. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Relying on the four corners of the agreement and giving these terms their ordinary meaning, the agreement provides for all rent paid by Beverage to be deducted from the initial purchase price. In fact, Lombardo's attorney solely drafted section 3 of the agreement. It is undisputed the parties were aware that there was a significant delay of up to five years before the closing of the sale. Lombardo's lenders conditioned permission for the lease upon the payoff by Lombardo within five years. This is evident by the agreement providing Beverage with a credit to the purchase price for all rents paid. If closing had occurred within the customary few weeks, then the lease would have been unnecessary. In addition, the rent is prorated because it is prepaid. As a result, Beverage would not receive a credit for rent amounts that were not yet due. The phrase \"prorated to closing\" conveys this concept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Lombardo further argues the court erred by not considering parol evidence\n   when interpreting the contract. Lombardo seeks to introduce parol evidence to give full effect of the parties' intent. Parol evidence, however, may only be admitted when the terms of the contract are ambiguous.

The real estate purchase agreement states that Lombardo's financing at the time made it impractical to currently close the transaction and, in fact, that the sale might not close for \"several years.\" In consideration of this fact, the parties agreed that Lombardo would reduce the purchase price to Beverage Holdings \"by the amount of principal payments made by Seller to Seller's lender for the mortgage notes currently on the property\" and that, at closing, Beverage Holdings would \"receive a credit equal to the reduction in principal for the mortgage notes from the date of the execution of this agreement until the closing date.\" Given that the parties understood that Lombardo had issues with its financing prior to entering into the real estate purchase agreement, it would be absurd to conclude that Lombardo intended to deduct from the purchase price both principal payments and all rents received during what could be a lengthy lease term (the parties contemplated a lease term of as much as ten years). Doing so would seem only to undermine its already precarious financial situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The closing clause also indicates that the rent proration reduction was meant to apply only to rent paid after Beverage Holdings gave notice of intent to close. The parties anticipated a closing time between 120-180 days. Given this amount of time, it was prudent for the parties to state that any rents, which were payable in advance under the lease, be prorated to closing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Admittedly, the real estate purchase agreement is not a model of clarity. But reasonable minds could find that Beverage Holdings is attempting to take advantage of errors in drafting that go beyond the hard consequences of imprecision\n   and lapse into absurdity. I would find that questions of fact exist as to what the parties truly intended with the rent proration clause.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
