Saif Sabree appeals from the judgment of a single justice of this court, pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, denying him relief from State prison sentences that he claims were illegal. We affirm.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-9\">\n      The procedural history of Sabree's case is extensive, and our summary is abbreviated. On February 12, 1974, he was indicted on charges of rape, armed robbery, and armed assault in a dwelling. See\n      <em>\n       Commonwealth\n      </em>\n      v.\n      <em>\n       Nicholson\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3947088\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/4/87/#p88\">\n       4 Mass.App. Ct. 87\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 88,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=341%20N.E.2d%20688\">\n       341 N.E.2d 688\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (1976). After a jury trial, he was convicted on all counts and sentenced to a life term for each offense, with the sentence for armed assault to run concurrently with the sentence for armed robbery, and the sentence for rape to run from and after the armed robbery sentence.\n      <footnotemark>\n       2\n      </footnotemark>\n      For reasons that are not part of the record before us, the Appellate Division of the Superior Court reordered and amended the sentences by reducing the sentences for armed assault and armed robbery to concurrent terms of from six to ten years, and ordering that they take effect from and after the life sentence for rape. The Appeals Court affirmed the convictions, see\n      <em>\n       Nicholson\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <em>\n       supra\n      </em>\n      , as well as several subsequent orders denying his various motions for a new trial.

Sabree also filed a petition pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, which sought an order compelling the Superior Court to act on a pending motion. That was denied because he failed to create a record to support his allegations. See\n      <em>\n       Sabree\n      </em>\n      v.\n      <em>\n       Commonwealth\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285248,285250\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/432/1003/\">\n       432 Mass. 1003\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 1003,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=732%20N.E.2d%20275\">\n       732 N.E.2d 275\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (2000).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-10\">\n      In 2015, Sabree filed a motion in the Superior Court seeking substantially the same relief that he requested in the G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition now before us: release from alleged unlawful restraint or correction of the sentences now being served, pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (a), as appearing in\n      <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=435%20Mass.%201501\">\n       435 Mass. 1501\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (2001). He also sought an evidentiary hearing and other relief. Although there is some indication that the motions were denied, the judge's orders have not been entered on the docket. The Superior Court's docket indicates that the proceedings have been stayed pending the filing and disposition of the G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-12\">\n      The single justice properly denied relief because \"the petitioner has [or had] other means by which to seek review\n     of his claim that his sentence ... is illegal-in his direct appeal and in his rule 30 (a) motion and any appeal from the denial of that motion.\"\n      <em>\n       Commonwealth\n      </em>\n      v.\n      <em>\n       Jones\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273378\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/461/1005/#p1005\">\n       461 Mass. 1005\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 1005-1006,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=960%20N.E.2d%20322\">\n       960 N.E.2d 322\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (2012). See\n      <em>\n       Cucinelli\n      </em>\n      v.\n      <em>\n       Commonwealth\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451948\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/1004/#p1004\">\n       477 Mass. 1004\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 1004,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20N.E.3d%20777\">\n       73 N.E.3d 777\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (2017). As for his claim that his trial or appellate counsel were ineffective in failing to press issues concerning the alleged illegality of the sentences imposed by the Superior Court, or the Appellate Division's authority or jurisdiction to restructure and amend the sentences, he could have raised that claim in a postconviction motion pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), and an appeal from any adverse ruling. He also failed to provide a record sufficient to evaluate his claims: notably absent, for example, is any indication of what materials were before the Appellate Division in 1974.
