WRIGHT, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant, William T. Ferrell, appeals his convictions for possession of heroin and a drug abuse instrument following his no contest plea. He argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. We agree and reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Ferrell was a backseat passenger of a friend's car when she was pulled over for a marked lanes violation. Ferrell remained seated in the backseat while officers removed the driver of the vehicle and conducted a pat down. She then authorized a search of her vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} An officer then asked Ferrell to exit the car. She also asked him if he had anything in his pockets. Ferrell responded in the negative, and the officer then asked if Ferrell minded if the other officer checked. Ferrell agreed. A search of his pockets revealed nothing. The officer proceeded to search his socks and found something white. The officer then placed Ferrell in handcuffs. Upon questioning, Ferrell ultimately informed the officer the item in his sock contained heroin, and upon further questioning, he also admitted to having a \"rig\" in his backpack, which was still in the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} He was indicted and charged with possession of heroin, a fifth-degree felony, in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)(C)(6) and possession of drug abuse instruments, a second-degree misdemeanor, in violation of R.C. 2925.12(A)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Ferrell moved to suppress evidence of the drugs as violative of the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches. He also sought exclusion of his statements after the search, including his admission that he had heroin in his sock and a hypodermic needle in his backpack because he was not informed of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights in violation of the right against self-incrimination in the Fifth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Following a hearing, the trial court overruled his motion and found that upon viewing the totality of the circumstances, the entire search was consensual. The court explained that Ferrell did not limit or withdraw consent to have his socks searched. The trial court likewise found that Ferrell's statements were admissible, explaining that because he consented to the search, any statements stemming from that search were admissible. The trial court's decision does not, however, address Ferrell's\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   argument and does not analyze whether his incriminating statements were the product of a custodial interrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Ferrell raises one assigned error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} \"The trial court erred as a matter of law in overruling Appellant's Motion to Suppress Evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellate review of a motion to suppress evidence involves mixed questions of law and fact.\n   <em>\n    State v.

First, he claims Officer Samantha Burton lacked a specific and articulable suspicion that Ferrell had a weapon, sufficient to warrant his removal from the car and a pat down for weapons. However, the court did not find that this was a pat down search for weapons authorized pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Terry v. Ohio,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    392 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968). Instead, the court found that the search was consensual, and Officer Burton testified at the hearing that she did not suspect or believe that Ferrell had a weapon. Thus, this sub-argument lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Ferrell's second sub-argument asserts that the scope of his consent to be searched was limited to his pockets, and because the drugs were found in his sock, the officers exceeded the scope of the consent and the contraband should have been suppressed. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Section 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, protect individuals against unreasonable governmental searches and seizures. A search based on consent is one exception to the Fourth Amendment's general warrant requirement.\n   <em>\n    State v.

When the state seeks to rely upon consent to justify a search, it has the burden of establishing that the consent was voluntary and freely given.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=685%20N.E.2d%20762\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 13} \"The standard for measuring the scope of a suspect's consent under the Fourth Amendment is that of 'objective' reasonableness-what would the typical reasonable person have understood by the exchange between the officer and the suspect?\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Florida v.

It reveals that Ferrell was in the backseat of his friend's car when she was pulled over for a traffic violation. Three officers were present. The driver agreed to a search of her vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Thereafter, Officer Samantha Burton of the Kent Police Department asked Ferrell his name and if he would mind stepping out of the car. He complied. Burton then asked him, \"got anything in your pockets?\" to which he responded \"nope.\" Burton then directed him toward one of two male officers present at the scene and inquired, \"do you mind if this officer checks?\" Ferrell says \"ok,\" and he walks into the grass where a male officer is standing. Ferrell's hands are in the air. The male officer, Officer Bowen, then has Ferrell place his hands behind his back and asks him if he has \"anything illegal? Sharp? Needles? Knives?\" Ferrell responds negatively to each inquiry. Bowen is then seen searching Ferrell's pockets for approximately two minutes. Bowen then bends down and looks in Ferrell's socks, and finds something white. Upon repeatedly questioning Ferrell about what is in his sock, Ferrell responds \"dope\" and then confirms that it is heroin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Bowen then asks Ferrell if he has a \"rig\" on him, which is slang for a hypodermic needle and syringe used to inject heroin, or if he has one in the car. Ferrell eventually admits that he has one in his backpack, which was still in the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In\n   <em>\n    Jimeno\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court considered whether the driver's oral consent to search his car included consent to search a brown paper bag found on the floor of the car. The Court decided it did and explained that objective reasonableness dictates the scope of the authorized search, and \"[t]he scope of a search is generally defined by its expressed object * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221328\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/248/#p250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221328\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/248/#p250\">\n    at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221328\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/248/#p250\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Jimeno\n   </em>\n   , officers were granted consent to search the car for narcotics.

This overly broad construction of his agreement to allow his car to be searched was not objectively reasonable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 834,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=615%20N.E.2d%201094\">\n    615 N.E.2d 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Here, the question is whether it was reasonable for the officers to consider Ferrell's consent to search his pockets as including consent to examine the contents of his socks. It was not. Ferrell was asked if he had anything in his pockets and was then almost immediately asked if he minded if the other officer checked. Ferrell responded ok. Upon seeking consent to search, Officer Burton did not identify the object of the search, and she limited her request to Ferrell's pockets. His agreement to be searched, and the scope of the search, was limited by the officer's question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 21} There was no further consent sought by the officers and Ferrell did not volunteer to extend the scope of his consent. Contrary to the state's argument and the trial court's finding, his failure to object and stop the search of his socks does not equate with consent, and the typical reasonable person would understand by the exchange between the officers and Ferrell that his consent to be searched was limited to his pockets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Furthermore, Officer Bowen's inquiries as to whether Ferrell had anything illegal, sharp, or if he had knives or needles did not extend the scope of Ferrell's consent because Bowen's inquiries were not preceded by a request for Ferrell to agree to be searched for these items. Our independent review of the undisputed evidence depicted in the dashcam footage does not support the trial court's determination that Ferrell consented to a search of his socks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Thus, because the officer exceeded the scope of Ferrell's consent to search, the trial court should have suppressed the heroin in his sock found via the unlawful search. Accordingly, Ferrell's second sub-argument has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Ferrell's third and final sub-argument asserts that his custodial statements to the officers following his unlawful search should have been suppressed because he was not advised of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. He seeks suppression of his admission that the substance in his sock was heroin as well as his statement to officers that he had a \"rig\" in his backpack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 25} The trial court found that Ferrell's statements were admissible because Ferrell consented to be searched. Consent to be searched, however, is not determinative of whether one's statements are admissible. Instead,\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings are required when an individual is subject to a custodial interrogation even if the attendant search is wholly consensual. The determinative issue governing whether\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings are required is whether the suspect is \"in custody.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 26} \"[T]he Fifth Amendment privilege * * * serves to protect persons in all settings in which their freedom of action is curtailed in any significant way from being compelled to incriminate themselves. * * * [W]ithout proper safeguards the process of in-custody interrogation of persons suspected or accused of crime contains inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual's will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely.

And a law-enforcement officer, in the midst of investigating a traffic stop and performing all its attendant procedures, would not consider a driver free to leave unless given permission.

Ferrell does not respond. Bowen then places handcuffs on Ferrell and informs him he \"has to\" because he does not know what was in his sock. They are still on the side of the road with two other officers present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 34} After placing handcuffs on Ferrell, Bowen again asks him if he is going to tell him what was in his sock.

Bowen then twice asks if Ferrell has a rig in the car and explains that the officers do not want to get poked or pricked. He also tells Ferrell that a rig is the least of his worries. Ferrell thereafter admits he has one in his backpack in the car, and a hypodermic needle is later found in his backpack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 36} As stated, Ferrell was subsequently indicted and charged with possession of a drug abuse instrument to which he pleaded no contest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Considering the totality of the circumstances, Ferrell was \"in custody\" at the time he admitted that the substance found in his sock was dope and heroin and when he admitted to having a rig in his backpack. Although he was in a public place, he was handcuffed after an officer found something hidden in his sock. The officer told him he \"had to\" place him in handcuffs because he did not know what he had found, but the officer did not inform him that he was not under arrest. And only after Ferrell was in handcuffs, did he respond to the officer's third request to tell him what was in his sock. The interaction at this point ceased to be an investigative traffic stop.

The majority interprets the scope of Ferrell's consent to be searched as limited to his pockets. A review of the video, however, demonstrates that neither Ferrell nor the officers involved shared the majority's interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 50} By the time Ferrell was removed from the vehicle, the driver and another passenger had already been removed and had already been searched. In both cases, the search was a pat-down or frisk type of search. The passenger was arrested on an outstanding warrant while the driver was asked to remain outside the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Officer Burton then asks if Ferrell would step out of the car. He complies. She asks if he has anything in his pockets. He says that he does not. She asks if he would stand over by the sidewalk. He complies. She asks whether he minds if another officer \"checks.\" He replies that he does not mind. Officer Bowen then asks if Ferrell has anything sharp, needles, or knives. Ferrell denies that he does. (Incidentally, Ferrell's replies to the officers' queries have all been truthful.) Officer Bowen then searches Ferrell in the same manner that the driver and other passenger had just been searched.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Viewing the video of this encounter, it is evident that, when Officer Burton asked Ferrell if he minded if Officer Bowen \"checks,\" she did not intend to limit the search to Ferrell's pockets. It is equally evident that, when Ferrell gave his consent, he did not believe that he was limiting the scope of the search to his pockets. Officer Bowen only asked whether he minded if the officer \"checks.\" She did not say \"checks your pockets.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 53} If contract law applied, the majority would have a colorable argument that there might not have been a meeting\n   of the minds with respect to a general search for anything sharp, needles, or knives.
