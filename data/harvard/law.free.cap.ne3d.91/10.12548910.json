Bradford's motion to withdraw his guilty plea and motion for appointed counsel. On appeal, Appellant contends that 1) the trial court abused its discretion by denying him his Sixth Amendment right to counsel at the oral hearing on his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, which he argues was a critical stage of the proceeding; 2) the trial court lacked authority to preside over the oral hearing and issue an entry, as the trial judge was improperly assigned; 3) the trial court abused its discretion by overruling his motion to withdraw his guilty plea where he claimed his conviction was void and his sentence was unlawfully imposed, thus rendering his detention unlawful, and established a manifest injustice; 4) the trial court erred when it accepted his unintelligent and involuntary pleas which were induced by his reliance on counsel's advice, when, as a matter of law, he could not have been convicted of the crime of escape, to which he pleaded guilty; and 5) the trial court erred when it failed to acknowledge the underlying fact that he was illegally under detention pursuant to a jury verdict convicting him of an unindicted offense under R.C. 2903.01(B) and an unlawfully imposed sentence under R.C. 2903.01(A), where lawful detention is an essential element of the crime of escape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Because four of Appellant's assignments of error rely upon the premise that his underlying sentence imposed by the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas in 2004 is void, and because we have found that the error in the 2004 sentencing entry simply constituted a clerical error rather than an error resulting in the sentence or a portion of the sentence being void, we overrule assignments of error one, three, four and five. Further, because we have concluded that the trial judge was properly assigned and therefore had authority to preside over Appellant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea, we overrule Appellant's second assignment of error. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On January 9, 2004, Appellant, Pele K. Bradford, was indicted by a Hamilton County, Ohio, grand jury on one count of aggravated murder, in violation of R.C. 2903.01(A), and one count of having weapons while under disability, in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(3). A review of the Hamilton County online docket indicates that the indictment was later amended on February 10, 2004; however, the substance of the amendment is not available on the online docket.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant was subsequently found guilty by a jury \"of Aggravated Murder 2903.01(B) as charged in Count 1 of the Indictment.\" Both the verdict form and the jury trial transcript consistently reference that Appellant was found guilty of aggravated murder in violation\n   of R.C. 2903.01(B). Appellant was also found guilty of count two as charged in the indictment. However, the judgment and sentencing entry filed by the trial court on June 8, 2004 states that Appellant was found guilty of \"count 1; Aggravated Murder with Specifications # 1 and # 2, 2903-01A/ORCN, SF[,]\" and \"count 2: Having Weapons While Under Disability, 2923-13A3/ORCN, F5[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The Hamilton County online docket indicates that Appellant filed a direct appeal from his convictions and sentences on June 18, 2004. In his appeal, he argued that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence and the trial court erred in excluding a police report from evidence. Appellant did not raise any arguments claiming his convictions or sentences were void or that the verdict form or sentencing entry cited the wrong subsection of the murder count. The First District Court of Appeals rejected both of Appellant's assignments of error and affirmed his convictions on May 6, 2005.\n   <em>\n    State v. Bradford\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist.

However, on March 26, 2008, Appellant filed a petition for post-conviction relief in the Ross County Court of Common Pleas claiming he was not the actual defendant named in the indictment and that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over him. The petition was denied and Appellant filed an appeal in this Court from the denial. On April 10, 2009, this Court rejected Appellant's arguments and affirmed his conviction for escape.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Subsequently, on March 25, 2015, Appellant filed an action in mandamus in the First District Court of Appeals, seeking a correction of the judgment entry for his conviction for aggravated murder.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Bradford v. Dinkelacker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772421\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/146/219/\">\n    146 Ohio St.3d 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772421\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/146/219/\">\n    2016-Ohio-2916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20N.E.3d%201216\">\n    54 N.E.3d 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 1. The First District Court dismissed the motion and Appellant then appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Ohio.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3. In analyzing Appellant's argument, the Supreme Court noted that Appellant had been found guilty \" 'of Aggravated Murder 2903.01(B) as charged in Count I of the Indictment[,]' \" but also noted that \" 'the court's journal entry stated \"[a]ggravated Murder with Specifications # 1 and # 2, 2903-01A/ORCN, SF.\" ' \" The Supreme Court nevertheless affirmed the First District's dismissal of Appellant's action in mandamus on May 12, 2016, reasoning as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Bradford could have raised the mistake in the original journal entry as part of his direct appeal of his conviction. He also could have appealed Judge Dinkelacker's entry denying his motion to correct the judgment entry. He therefore had an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Nowhere in its decision did the Supreme Court state that Appellant's conviction or sentence was void as a result of the discrepancy between the verdict form and the sentencing entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Then, on October 22, 2015, six years after we affirmed his conviction for escape, Appellant filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea to the escape charge in the Ross County Court of Common Pleas. In his motion he argued that his original murder conviction in Hamilton County was void because the verdict forms indicated he was found guilty of aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01(B), as charged in the indictment, but the trial court's sentencing entry stated he had been found guilty of a violation of R.C. 2903.01(A). Appellant argued that because his underlying conviction and sentence were void, his conviction for escape was also void, because he was not under lawful detention at the time he was charged with escape. The trial court, however, denied the motion. In denying the motion, the trial court reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"I am specifically finding that the Ross County Court of Common Pleas has no jurisdiction, no authority to\n   <em>\n    consider\n   </em>\n   the verdict, conviction, or sentence of the Hamilton County, Ohio, Court of Common Pleas, so therefore I cannot find that there's a manifest injustice in this Ross County, Ohio, case, so your motion to withdraw your guilty plea, sir, is overruled.\" (Emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   It is from this denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea that Appellant now brings his current appeal, assigning the following errors for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"I. THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY DENYING THE APPELLANT HIS SIXTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO COUNSEL AT THE FEBRUARY 1, 2016 ORAL HEARING ON APPELLANT'S PRESENTENCE MOTION TO WITHDRAW GUILTY PLEA WHICH WAS A CRITICAL STAGE OF THE PROCEEDING.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   II. THE TRIAL COURT LACKED AUTHORITY TO PRESIDE OVER THE FEBRUARY 1, 2016 ORAL HEARING AND ISSUE AN ENTRY AS HE WAS IMPROPERLY ASSIGNED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   III. THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY OVERRULING APPELLANT'S MOTION TO WITHDRAW GUILTY PLEA WHERE THE APPELLANT'S VOID CONVICTION FOR A VIOLATION OF R.C. 2903.01(B) AND AN UNLAWFULLY IMPOSED SENTENCE UNDER R.C. 2903.01(A) IN CASE NO.

In his second assignment of error, Appellant contends that the trial court lacked authority to preside over the oral hearing on the motion to withdraw his guilty plea to the escape conviction, arguing that the trial court judge was improperly assigned to the case. Appellant argues that Art. IV, Section 6(C) provides for assignment of retired judges to serve as acting judges upon assignment of the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio, and that there was no assignment of Judge J. Jeffery Benson made by the Supreme Court. Appellant therefore concludes that Judge Benson lacked jurisdiction over the matter and the resultant entry denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea is void. For the following reasons, we disagree with Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 9} A judge who acts absent a proper transfer of a case is without authority and his rulings are voidable upon a timely objection by either party.\n   <em>\n    Washington Mutual Bank v.

Jurek's case was transferred two different times post-divorce without the required journal entry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.

Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6707204\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/15/45/\">\n    15 Ohio App.3d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=472%20N.E.2d%20361\">\n    472 N.E.2d 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), which stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"any party objecting to reassignment must raise that objection at the first opportunity to do so. If the party has knowledge of the transfer with sufficient time to object before the new judge\n   takes any action, that party waives any objection to the transfer by failing to raise that issue on the record before the action is taken.\"\n   <em>\n    Jurek\n   </em>\n   at *3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Further, as noted by the State, the Rules of Superintendence for the Court of Ohio in Rule 36, which governs the assignment system, provides for the \"redistribution of cases involving the same criminal defendant, parties, family members, or subject matter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Here, we initially note that Judge Jeffrey Benson was not a retired judge serving by assignment of the Supreme Court of Ohio. Rather, he was a current sitting judge of the Ross County Court of Common Pleas at the time of Appellant's hearing. Further, although Appellant's case was originally assigned to Judge Nusbaum, the record reflects that a journal entry was filed on December 14, 2015 indicating that the case was being transferred to Judge Benson because Judge Nusbaum had recused himself. The journal entry is signed by the presiding judge of the court. It is reasonable to conclude that recusal and resultant reassignment of a case would fall under the provisions of Sup.R. 36. Thus, this was not a scenario involving the transfer of Appellant's case from one judge to another without the required journal entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The record further reflects that four days after the case was transferred, on December 18, 2015, Judge Benson filed a judgment entry overruling Appellant's previously filed \"Motion to Deem Conceded.\" Appellant made no challenge to Judge Benson's authority over the case after the issuance of that entry. Moreover, Appellant was present at the hearing on his motion to withdraw his guilty plea on March 22, 2016. He made no challenge to Judge Benson's authority prior to, during or immediately after the hearing. The transcript from the motion hearing indicates Appellant engaged in a dialogue with Judge Benson in which Appellant made reference to the fact that Judge Nusbaum had previously been assigned to the case, but he made no complaint whatsoever related to Judge Benson's authority or jurisdiction over the matter at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Based upon the foregoing, we find no irregularity or flaw in the transfer of Appellant's case from one judge to another that would render the orders issued by the transferee judge voidable, let alone void. Further, even if there was an error rendering the order voidable, the record reflects that Appellant failed to bring the argument to the attention of the trial court at his earliest opportunity to do so, either after the issuance of the transfer order, the December 18th order, or certainly at the oral hearing on the motion. As such, he has waived any argument related to the transfer of the case. Accordingly, Appellant's second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 13} For ease of analysis, we next address Appellant's fifth assignment of error, out of order. In his fifth assignment of error, Appellant contends that the trial court erred when it failed to acknowledge the underlying fact that he was illegally under detention pursuant to a jury verdict convicting him of an unindicted offense under R.C. 2903.01(B) and an unlawfully imposed sentence under R.C. 2903.01(A) in Hamilton County Case No. B-0400169, where lawful detention is an essential element of the crime of escape. Phrased another way, Appellant contends that his escape conviction was based upon a void conviction and an invalid sentence imposed in Hamilton County, and that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to acknowledge and determine the essential element of lawful detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The State responds by arguing that the Ross County Court of Common Pleas had no jurisdiction to \"overturn\" a determination of the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas because it is \"not a court of appeal to determine the validity of judgment from another county court of common pleas.\" Similarly, the trial court reasoned that it did not have jurisdiction or authority to \"consider\" the verdict, conviction or sentence of the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas. While we agree with the State that the Ross County Court of Common Pleas had no authority to \"overturn\" or vacate Appellant's Hamilton County conviction, we disagree with the trial court's statement that it had no jurisdiction or authority to \"consider\" the Hamilton County conviction.\n   <em>\n    Lingo v.

Although it is not completely clear from his arguments on appeal, in his motion to withdraw his guilty plea filed below, Appellant seems to suggest that the jury's finding of guilt under the (B) subsection of the statute essentially convicted him of an \"unindicted offense.\" Implicit in this argument is the suggestion that Appellant was actually indicted under the (A) subsection of the statute. Appellant has not provided this Court with a complete record from his Hamilton County case. However, a review of the information available on the online docket for Hamilton County, in which we are both requested and permitted to take judicial notice, reveals that Appellant was, in fact, indicted for aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01(A), not (B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Thus, at first blush, it appears that there may have been an error in the jury verdict forms. However, the online docket also reveals that after a bill of particulars was filed in the case, the State filed a motion to amend the indictment, which was granted by the court. Appellant's original indictment contained two counts, the aggravated murder count, and a second count of having weapons while under disability in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A). It appears from the sentencing entry that Appellant was convicted of the second count, as charged in the indictment, and was sentenced for a violation of R.C. 2923.13(A). Thus, the logical conclusion is that the having weapons while under disability count was not changed when the indictment was amended. Thus, because there was only one other count, the aggravated murder charge was likely the count that was amended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Unfortunately, as set forth above, Appellant did not provide us with the complete record of the Hamilton County case and the online docket does not permit viewing of the actual substance of the court filings. \" '[I]t is the appellant's duty to transmit the [record] to the court of appeals. * * * This duty falls to the appellant because the appellant has the burden of establishing error in the trial court.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Further, because Appellant's underlying murder sentence has not been determined to be void, we reject Appellant's argument that he was not under lawful detention, which was an element of his subsequent escape conviction.

In his first assignment of error, Appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion by denying Appellant his Sixth Amendment right to counsel at the February 1, 2016 oral hearing on his \"presentence motion to withdraw guilty plea[,]\" which Appellant argues was a critical stage of the proceeding. In making this argument, Appellant contends that his motion to withdraw should be treated as a presentence motion to withdraw, rather than a post-sentence motion to withdraw \"due to the undeniable fact that Appellant was never legally under detention for the conviction and sentence for which the escape charge was predicated upon,\" thereby rendering the sentence imposed on the escape charge void.

Based upon his interpretation of the holding in\n   <em>\n    Billiter\n   </em>\n   , Appellant asserts \"that his conduct could not have constituted escape as a matter of law * * * because he was never lawfully under detention at the time of the alleged escape.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 28} In his fourth assignment of error, Appellant contends that the trial court erred when it accepted his unintelligent and involuntary pleas which were induced by his reliance on counsel's advice where he claims, as a matter of law, he could not have been convicted of the crime of escape, to which he pled guilty, thereby rendering his pleas in violation of the due process clause under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Unites States Constitution. Appellant essentially contends that his counsel was ineffective for failing to \"investigate and recognize\" Appellant was not legally under detention at the time he advised Appellant to plead guilty to escape, and that the trial court abused its discretion when it determined the manifest injustice standard had not been met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 29} With regard to Appellant's first assignment of error, we noted Crim.R. 32.1 provides that \"[a] motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or no contest may be made only before sentence is imposed; but to correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea.\" Under Appellant's fifth assignment of error, we rejected his argument that his underlying conviction and sentence for aggravated murder imposed in the Hamilton County Court of Common was void. Thus, we must also reject Appellant's argument that his motion to withdraw his guilty plea should be treated as a presentence motion. Appellant's argument is premised upon a finding that his underlying conviction for aggravated murder was void, thereby rendering his detention unlawful and further rendering his subsequent escape conviction void. Having rejected Appellant's argument that his murder conviction was void, we have found his detention underlying his escape conviction to be lawful. Therefore, Appellant's argument fails and his motion was properly treated as a post-sentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Further, with respect to Appellant's argument that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his request for appointed counsel in connection with the filing of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, we acknowledge that \"[t]he Sixth Amendment right to counsel applies to critical stages of criminal proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Our review of the record before us fails to demonstrate any error with respect to Appellant's underlying murder conviction and sentence and thus neither Appellant, nor counsel had counsel been appointed, could demonstrate a manifest injustice requiring withdrawal of the plea to escape.

Further, in\n    <em>\n     Burns\n    </em>\n    , we note that our reference to curing a sentencing error was made in regard to curing a sentencing error that occurred in Highland County, which sentence was on direct review, and not curing the underlying sentencing error that occurred in Brown County, which was outside of this Appellate District.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    As set forth above, Appellant now seeks to withdraw his guilty plea to escape, in violation of R.C. 2921.34. The relevant version of R.C. 2921.34 in effect at the time Appellant was charged with escape provided, in pertinent part, as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n    \"(A)(1) No person, knowing the person is under detention or being reckless in that regard, shall purposely break or attempt to break the detention, or purposely fail to return to detention, either following temporary leave granted for a specific purpose or limited period, or at the time required when serving a sentence in intermittent confinement.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n    * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n    (B) Irregularity in bringing about or maintaining detention, or lack of jurisdiction of the committing or detaining authority, is not a defense to a charge under this section if the detention is pursuant to judicial order or in a detention facility. In the case of any other detention, irregularity or lack of jurisdiction is an affirmative defense only if either of the following occurs:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n    (1) The escape involved no substantial risk of harm to the person or property of another.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n    (2) The detaining authority knew or should have known there was no legal basis or authority for the detention.\"\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    As set forth above, in affirming the appellate court's denial of Appellant's action in mandamus, the Supreme Court of Ohio noted, in determining Appellant had an adequate remedy at law, that \"Bradford could have raised the mistake in the original journal entry as part of his direct appeal of his conviction. He also could have appealed Judge Dinkelacker's entry denying his motion to correct the judgment entry.\"\n    <em>\n     Bradford v. Dinkelacker\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 6.
