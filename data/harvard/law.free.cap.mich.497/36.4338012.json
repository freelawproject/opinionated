Currently, the retirement system consists of five defined benefit plans, one defined contribution plan, and the Inflation Equity Fund (IEF). Each year, the county is required by Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24, to make an \u201cannual required contribution\u201d (ARC). An annual actuarial valuation determines the ARC amount. MCL 38.1140m.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The IEF was created in 1985 by county ordinance to provide a pool of money for discretionary payments to eligible retirement system participants and beneficiaries in addition to those payments required by the pension system, as a method to counteract the effect of inflation. Payments from the IEF are known as the \u201c13th check.\u201d The IEF is funded by investment profits earned on the assets held in the defined benefit plans and the IEF, to the extent those profits exceed a certain rate of return.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">In 2010, Wayne County faced a substantial fiscal obligation in order to satisfy its actuarially determined ARC. In order to satisfy its ARC obligation, the county passed an ordinance amendment, Wayne County Code of Ordinances (WCCO), \u00a7\u00a7 141-32 and 141-36, as amended by Wayne County Enrolled Ordinance No. 2010-514. As is relevant here, the amended ordinance limited the IEF to a maximum balance of $12 million, and directed that IEF funds exceeding that amount be transferred to the retirement system\u2019s defined benefit plans. Because the IEF balance at the time was significantly greater than $12 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>million, the ordinance resulted in a transfer of $32 million from the IEF into the defined benefit plans. The amended ordinance further permitted the county to use the $32 million transfer from the IEF to the defined benefit plans as an offset against its ARC obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">The retirement system challenged the 2010 ordinance amendment, claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>that the transfer and corresponding ARC offset violated Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24, and various provisions of the Public Employee Retirement Systems Investment Act (PERSIA), MCL 38.1132 <em>et seq. </em>The county moved for summary disposition, which the trial court granted, ruling that the IEF did not amount to an \u201caccrued financial benefit\u201d as considered in Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24, and that the amended ordinance\u2019s transfer and offset did not violate PERSIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court, holding that the transfer of funds from the IEF and offset against the county\u2019s ARC obligation violated the requirement in MCL 38.1133(6) that the funds be for the \u201cexclusive benefit\u201d of the retirement system\u2019s participants and their beneficiaries and that the county used the IEF funds in violation of the \u201cprohibited transaction rule,\u201d MCL SS-l^^Xc).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Wayne Co Employees Retirement Sys v Wayne Co, </em>301 Mich App 1; 836 NW2d 279 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>We affirm the Court of Appeals in part. Except as noted later in this opinion, we agree with the Court of Appeals that, in this case, the transfer of funds from the IEF to the retirement system\u2019s defined benefit plans, coupled with the offset against the county\u2019s ARC obligation, violated PERSIA for the reasons stated in the Court of Appeals opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 30-46 (finding a violation of the \u201cexclusive benefit rule\u201d in MCL 38.1133(6)), and <em>id. </em>at 46-48 (finding a violation of the \u201cprohibited transaction rule\u201d in MCL 38.1133(6)(c)). Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding that the $32 million that was offset against the county\u2019s ARC violates PERSIA, and the county must satisfy its ARC obligations absent consideration of that $32 million. <em>Id. </em>at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">However, we also vacate two aspects of the Court of Appeals opinion. First, we vacate footnote 29 and corresponding portions of the Court of Appeals opinion in which the panel reasoned that, because the transfer of IEF funds, even without a corresponding offset to the county\u2019s ARC, would violate PERSIA, the transferred funds must be returned to the IEF account and used \u201cfor the purpose intended.\u201d See <em>Wayne Co Retirement Sys, </em>301 Mich App at 51 n 29. Although the county raised the theory that the transfer of IEF funds without an offset is valid under PERSIA in Count II of its counterclaim, the trial court did not rule on this alter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>native claim because it ruled that the county\u2019s ordinance was \u201clegal as written.\u201d It was therefore unnecessary for the Court of Appeals to rule on this issue, and since this issue received only cursory treatment by the parties in the Court of Appeals, the preferable course would have been to remand for further proceedings on this claim. The Court of Appeals nonetheless addressed the matter, and although we invited farther development of it in this Court, the county failed to pursue it in its brief and at oral argument, instead taking the position that the presence of the corresponding offset had no bearing on the validity of the transfer under PERSIA. The county\u2019s abandonment of the issue on appeal has rendered it unnecessary, and has left us ill equipped to address the merits of whether the amended ordinance\u2019s transfer would be permissible under PERSIA without the corresponding offset. Accordingly, we express no opinion on the issue of whether the intrasystem transfer of retirement system assets without a corresponding offset to the plan sponsor\u2019s ARC violates PERSIA, and leave that question open for another day. Nonetheless, because the county has abandoned this issue in the instant case, we leave in place the Court of Appeals\u2019 determination that the transferred funds must be returned to the IEE See <em>Mitcham v Detroit, </em>355 Mich 182, 203; 94 NW2d 388 (1959) (\u201cThe appellant himself must first adequately prime the pump; only then does the appellate well begin to flow.\u201d); <em>Horetski v American Sandblast Co, </em>340 Mich 323, 327; 65 NW2d 702 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Thus, while we vacate footnote 29 in its entirety, to the extent that the remedy fashioned by the Court of Appeals was based on its conclusion that the transfer even without an offset violates PERSIA, we leave its remedy intact for purposes of this case because, as stated above, the county abandoned its argument that the transfer without the offset does not vi\u00f3late PERSIA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding that \u201cthe $32 million that was offset against the county\u2019s ARC [must] be[] returned, restored, or credited to the IEF, with the county being required to satisfy its ARC obligations absent consideration of that $32 million.\u201d <em>Wayne Co Retirement Sys, </em>301 Mich App at 52. Additionally, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that \u201cthe $12 million IEF limitation can operate prospectively\u201d and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">[a] proper prospective application of the $12 million IEF limitation would entail limiting future funding of the IEF until it dropped below $12 million, which is exactly how WCCO, \u00a7 141-32(b)(l), operates and is presently structured, where it provides the formula for annual funding of the IEF, subject to the $12 million IEF balance limit. Accordingly, WCCO, \u00a7 141-32(b)(l), remains wholly intact and WCCO, \u00a7 141-32(a)\u2014the provision setting forth the $12 million IEF limit\u2014also remains in effect, but with the caveat that the limit is inapplicable in regard to the previously existing $44 million (or $32 million excess) until those IEF assets are first reduced down to $12 million. With respect to the $5 million dollar IEF distribution limit found in WCCO, \u00a7 141-32(b)(2), it is already prospective in nature, operating to limit disbursements made after the 2010 ordinance became effective. <em>[Id. </em>at 52-53 (footnote omitted).][<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Second, we vacate the portions of the Court of Appeals opinion discussing the constitutional implications of the amended ordinance in relation to Const <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>1963, art 9, \u00a7 24. As the Court of Appeals expressly acknowledged, it is not necessary to consider any potential constitutional implications of the amended ordinance because this case can be decided by applying PERSIA alone. See <em>Wayne Co Retirement Sys, </em>301 Mich App at 35 n 23. Because \u201cquestions of constitutionality are not decided where a case may be disposed of without such a determination,\u201d <em>MacLean v Mich State Bd of Control for Vocational Ed, </em>294 Mich 45, 50; 292 NW 662 (1940) (citation omitted), the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis of the issue is dicta. Accordingly, we vacate as unnecessary all portions of the Court of Appeals opinion that considered whether the IEF benefits constitute \u201caccrued financial benefits\u201d for purposes of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24, including all discussion of \u201cgroup\u201d accrued benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">In summary, we affirm the portions of the Court of Appeals opinion holding that the transfer of $32 million from the IEF to the retirement system\u2019s defined benefit plans and corresponding offset against the county\u2019s ARC obligation in this case violated PERSIA for the reasons stated in the Court of Appeals opinion. We likewise affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 determination that the transferred funds must be returned to the IEF. However, we vacate as beyond the scope of the instant appeal the reasoning underlying that determination\u2014 namely, the portions of the Court of Appeals opinion concluding that the transfer at issue would violate PERSIA without the corresponding offset against the county\u2019s ARC obligation, and the determination that the transferred funds, once returned to the IEF, must be used only for the purposes of that fund going forward. The net effect of our decision is that the issue whether the transfer without a corresponding offset violates PERSIA remains an open one, but the remedy fashioned by the Court of Appeals in this case is left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>undisturbed for purposes of this case. Finally, we vacate as unnecessary the portions of the Court of Appeals opinion discussing the constitutional implications of the amended ordinance in relation to Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We remand to the trial court for proceedings and entry of judgment not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b278-5\">Young, C.J., and Cavanagh, Markman, Kelly, Zahra, McCormack, and Viviano, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-6\"> When the complaint in this case was filed, 1VICL 38.1133(6) stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">The system shall be a separate and distinct trust fund and the assets of the system shall be for the exclusive benefit of the participants and their beneficiaries and of defraying reasonable expenses of investing the assets of the system.

However, because the current complaint was filed before the effective date of the amendments, we refer to the preamendment version of PERSIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\"> In keeping with our decision to leave open the question whether the mere transfer of retirement assets without a corresponding offset to a plan sponsor\u2019s ARC violates PERSIA, nothing in our decision to affirm the Court of Appeals remedy in this case should be read as necessarily allowing or precluding any municipality, including the county, from enacting an ordinance that directs the intrasystem movement of system assets. As stated within, we decline to determine whether, or under what conditions, such a transfer is permissible under PERSIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b278-6\"> The Court of Appeals also ruled on the validity of a number of other aspects of the amended ordinance; these rulings have not been challenged before this Court, and thus remain intact.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
