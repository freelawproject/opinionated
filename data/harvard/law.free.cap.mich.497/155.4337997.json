In light of the clear legislative dictates of MCL 257.626(5), the circuit court is precluded from granting defendant\u2019s request and providing such a jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">On the afternoon of March 2, 2012, defendant was driving his automobile at approximately 80 mph on a road with a posted speed limit of 35 mph. While changing lanes, defendant collided with another vehicle, which, in turn, struck a third vehicle that had been parked on the side of the road. The driver of the second vehicle was killed in the collision. Consequently, defendant was charged with reckless driving causing death under MCL 257.626(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Prior to trial, defense counsel filed a motion in limine, requesting that the circuit court instruct the jury on the misdemeanor lesser offense of committing a moving violation causing death. Despite the explicit prohibition in MCL 257.626(5) against such an instruction, the circuit court granted the motion, concluding that moving violation causing death is a necessarily included lesser offense of reckless driving causing death and, therefore, MCL 257.626(5) violates the doctrine of separation of powers under Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The prosecution appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed in a split published opinion. The majority held that MCL 257.626(5) is constitutionally infirm because it violates both the separation of powers and a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental due process right to a trial by jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Noting the general rule that a jury may acquit a defendant of the charged offense and instead find him guilty of a lesser offense, the majority first concluded that it is a violation of the separation of powers for the Legislature to prohibit the courts from instructing the jury on a necessarily included lesser offense. Because MCL 257.626(5) impermissibly precludes an instruction on moving violation causing death, which \u201cby definition\u201d is a necessarily included lesser offense of reckless driving causing death, the majority held the statutory prohibition to be unconstitutional.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The majority explained that because the Legislature\u2019s sole function is to create substantive law whereas the Supreme Court has exclusive rulemaking authority in matters of practice and procedure, effectuating the right to a properly instructed jury is exclusively within the domain of the judiciary.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, by prohibiting courts from instructing juries on the necessarily included lesser offense of moving violation causing death, the Legislature, via MCL 257.626(5), unconstitutionally infringed the judiciary\u2019s authority to establish court practice and procedure.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Alternatively, the majority concluded that MCL 257.626(5) could likewise be invalidated as an unconsti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>tutional deprivation of a defendant\u2019s right to a trial by a properly instructed jury. The majority observed that although MCL 257.626(5) plainly prevents the court from instructing the jury on the lesser offense of moving violation causing death, the statute does not bar or otherwise restrict <em>a judge </em>sitting as fact-finder from finding a defendant guilty of that lesser offense. The majority reasoned that, had the Legislature intended to limit a judge\u2019s consideration of moving violation causing death, it could have easily included language to that effect. Because a criminal defendant has no right to a bench trial unless the prosecutor and judge agree,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> MCL 257.626(5) places a criminal defendant in the position of compromising one right in favor of another, namely, a criminal defendant must relinquish his constitutional right to a trial by jury in order to permit the fact-finder to consider the lesser offense of moving violation causing death.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">We granted the prosecution\u2019s interlocutory application for leave to appeal, directing the parties to brief the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">(1) whether a legislative provision barring consideration of a necessarily included lesser offense violates the separation of powers doctrine, Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2; (2) whether MCL 257.626(5) violates a defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial by foreclosing a jury instruction on a lesser offense; and (3) whether MCL 257.601d is a necessarily included lesser offense of MCL 257.626(4).[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The prosecution contends that the circuit court erred by granting defendant\u2019s request to instruct the jury on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>the misdemeanor lesser offense of moving violation causing death. We review de novo a claim of instructional error involving a question of law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, a circuit court\u2019s decision as to whether a requested lesser-included-offense instruction is applicable under the facts of a particular case will only be reversed upon a finding of an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> An abuse of discretion occurs when the circuit court chooses an outcome that falls outside the range of principled outcomes.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Before addressing any alleged instructional error by the circuit court, however, we first consider whether a defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on the offense of moving violation causing death despite the statutory prohibition set forth in MCL 257.626(5). We review this and other questions of law de novo.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">In determining whether the circuit court erred by granting the request to instruct the jury on the misdemeanor lesser offense of moving violation causing death, we begin by reviewing the common law and statutory basis for lesser offense instructions, after which we will address the extent to which this review affects the construction of the reckless driving causing death and moving violation causing death provisions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>A. PROPRIETY OF LESSER-INCLUDED-OFFENSE INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">At common law, the general rule of lesser included offenses was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">when an indictment charged an offense which included within it another less offense or one of a lower degree, the defendant, though acquitted of the higher offense, might be convicted of the less.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">This rule, however, was subject to the qualification, that upon an indictment for a felony, the defendant could not be convicted of a misdemeanor.[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">This common-law rule has since been legislatively modified<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and appears in what is now MCL 768.32(1), which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">Except as provided in subsection (2), upon an indictment for an offense, consisting of different degrees, as prescribed in this chapter, the jury, or the judge in a trial without a jury, may find the accused not guilty of the offense in the degree charged in the indictment and may find the accused person guilty of a degree of that offense inferior to that charged in the indictment, or of an attempt to commit that offense.[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Reduced to its simplest terms, when a defendant is charged with an offense \u201cconsisting of different degrees,\u201d the factfinder may, consistent with the statutory text, acquit the defendant of the charged offense and find him of her \u201cguilty of a degree of that offense inferior to that charged in the indictment. ..</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">In <em>People v </em>Cornell,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> this Court considered what crimes constitute lesser or \u201cinferior\u201d offenses within the meaning of MCL 768.32(1). After reviewing the dissonant approaches to lesser-included-offense instructions articulated throughout our jurisprudence, this Court noted that \u201cthe word \u2018inferior\u2019 in the statute does not refer to inferiority in the penalty associated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>with the offense, but, rather, to the absence of an element that distinguishes the charged offense from the lesser offense.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> On this basis, this Court concluded that a defendant is entitled to a lesser offense instruction only if that lesser offense is necessarily included in the greater offense; that is, the offense must be committed as part of the greater offense insofar as it would be \u201cimpossible to commit the greater offense without first committing the lesser offense.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Cornell </em>thus interpreted the legislative prerogative contained in MCL 768.32(1)\u2014that an included-inferior-offense instruction may be appropriate upon request\u2014as limited to necessarily included lesser offenses only; it foreclosed consideration of cognate lesser offenses, which, in the absence of adequate notice, may violate a defendant\u2019s fundamental due process rights.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Under <em>Cornell, </em>then, the rule of lesser included offenses is simple: pursuant to MCL 768.32(1), the court must first determine whether an offense is necessarily included, which requires a comparison of the elements of the offenses, and if so, the court must then determine whether an instruction is warranted on the facts of a particular case by examining whether \u201cthe charged greater offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>requires the jury to find a disputed factual element that is not part of the lesser included offense and a rational view of the evidence would support [the instruction].\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aq8\">As a corollary of this conclusion, <em>Cornell </em>returned MCL 768.32(1) to its original construction as given by this Court in <em>Hanna-, </em>consideration of cognate lesser offenses is not permitted and the right to an instruction on a necessarily included lesser offense turns on whether \u201cthe charged greater offense requires the jury to find a disputed factual element that is not part of the lesser included offense and a rational view of the evidence would support [the instruction].\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In so doing, this Court noted the separation of powers concerns inherent in its earlier caselaw permitting instructions on cognate offenses: to interpret MCL 768.32(1) as permitting instruction on cognate offenses is not a proper exercise of Supreme Court authority to determine rules of practice and procedure. While this Court exclusively retains the authority and duty to prescribe general rules that \u201cestablish, modify, amend, and simplify the practice and procedure in all courts of this state,\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> it cannot be disputed that \u201cenact[ing] court rules that establish, abrogate, or modify the substantive law\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> transcends the limits of that authority. Indeed, \u201cmatters of substantive law are left to the Legislature.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> And because \u201c[determining what charges a jury may consider does not concern merely the \u2018judicial dispatch of litigation,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> MCL 768.32(1) thus concerns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>a matter of substantive law and, consequently, courts may not promulgate procedural rules contrary to statutory law governing lesser-included-offense instructions, but are instead required to adhere to the legislative dictates.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">B. RECKLESS DRIVING CAUSING DEATH AND MOVING VIOLATION CAUSING DEATH</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Defendant was charged with reckless driving causing death pursuant to MCL 257.626(4). The reckless driving statute, MCL 257.626, provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person who operates a vehicle upon a highway or a frozen public lake, stream, or pond or other place open to the general public, including, but not limited to, an area designated for the parking of motor vehicles, in willful or wanton disregard for the safely of persons or property is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $500.00, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">(4) Beginning October 31, 2010,[<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>] a person who operates a vehicle in violation of subsection (2) and by the operation of that vehicle causes the death of another person is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 15 years or a fine of not less than $2,500.00 or more than $10,000.00, or both. The judgment of sentence may impose the sanction permitted under section 625n. If the vehicle is not ordered forfeited under section 625n, the court shall order vehicle immobilization under section 904d in the judgment of sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-10\">(5) In a prosecution under subsection (4), the jury shall not be instructed regarding the crime of moving violation causing death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Taken together, then, these provisions demonstrate the Legislature\u2019s intent that a person is guilty of reckless driving causing death, a 15-year felony, if that person \u201coperates a vehicle ... [in willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property] and by the operation of that vehicle causes the death of another person. ...\u201d Moreover, in a prosecution for reckless driving causing death, \u201cthe jury shall not be instructed regarding the crime of moving violation causing death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ad2\">Despite these plain legislative dictates, the circuit court granted defendant\u2019s request that the jury be instructed on the misdemeanor lesser offense of moving violation causing death, which, in turn, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-4\">(1) A person who commits a moving violation that causes the death of another person is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 1 year or a fine of not more than $2,000.00, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">(3) This section does not prohibit the person from being charged with, convicted of, or punished for any other violation of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">(4) As used in this section, \u201cmoving violation\u201d means an act or omission prohibited under this act or a local ordinance substantially corresponding to this act that involves the operation of a motor vehicle, and for which a fine may be assessed.[<footnotemark>31</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">IV APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Assuming, based on the record concession, that moving violation causing death indeed constitutes a necessarily included lesser offense of reckless driving causing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>death, we nevertheless conclude that the circuit court erred in granting the request that the jury be instructed on the misdemeanor lesser offense of moving violation causing death. MCL 768.32(1) sets forth the general rule that a defendant is entitled to have the jury instructed on necessarily included lesser offenses. MCL 257.626(5), in turn, sets forth a clear exception to this general rule: when a defendant is charged with reckless driving causing death, \u201cthe jury shall not be instructed regarding the crime of moving violation causing death.\u201d As <em>Cornell </em>indicates, MCL 768.32(1) reflects both the Legislature\u2019s abolition of the common-law misdemeanor restriction as well as its proscription against consideration of cognate lesser offenses.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> As <em>Cornell </em>further indicates, this legislative modification does not impermissibly infringe this Court\u2019s constitutional authority to enact rules governing practice and procedure, because \u201c[djetermining what charges a jury may consider . .. concerns a matter of substantive law.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Just as modifying the common-law rule is a permissible exercise of legislative authority under Cornell, we conclude that, by extension, so too is creating a substantive exception to that rule.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Notwithstanding this Court\u2019s explicit statements to the contrary, the Court of Appeals interprets <em>Cornell </em>to \u201csupport\u201d its conclusion that \u201cdetermining what instructions should be given to the jury is exclusively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>within the judiciary\u2019s role.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals opinion similarly asserts that \u201c[c]orrectly instructing the jury ... is a fundamental requirement of fair and proper administration of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Yet the two cases upon which the Court of Appeals relies in support of this <em>proposition\u2014People v Murray </em>and <em>People v </em>Townes<footnotemark>37</footnotemark>\u2014contain no such language nor do they somehow suggest that a criminal defendant has an unfettered right to have the jury instructed on a lesser included offense or that such instructions are within the exclusive domain of the judiciary. At most, these cases merely reaffirm the unexceptional legal premise that a judge has a duty to accurately instruct the jury regarding the \u201claw applicable to the facts,\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> irrespective of whether a proper request for or objection to those instructions has been made. Contrary to the Court of Appeals\u2019 assertion, MCL 257.626(5) is not a matter of practice and procedure, and, consequently, there can be no violation of separation of powers simply because a necessarily included lesser offense exists and the Legislature has acted within its constitutional authority by creating a substantive exception that prohibits or otherwise limits the jury\u2019s consideration of that lesser offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Nevertheless, defendant also argues that his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial requires an instruction on moving violation causing death. However, the United States Supreme Court has not identified any requirement that a jury <em>must </em>consider lesser included offenses when deciding whether to convict on the <em>charged </em>of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>fense. While the United States Supreme Court has ruled that, in a capital case, the jury must have the opportunity to convict on a lesser included offense,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> this holding has been limited to capital offenses.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Except within this limited circumstance, the United States Supreme Court has expressly declined to rule on whether there is a constitutional entitlement to have the jury consider lesser included offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Neither does the fact that MCL 257.626(5) is silent in the context of a judge sitting as finder of fact at a bench trial alter our conclusion. As stated, the Legislature made a policy decision that the jury may not be instructed on the lesser offense of moving violation causing death when the defendant is on trial for reckless driving causing death. The trial judge has a duty to instruct the jury \u201cas to the law applicable to the case,\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> including lesser included offenses, and MCL 257.626(5) presents one such law applicable to the charge of reckless driving causing death. Furthermore, there is logical connection between the jury being instructed \u201cas to the law applicable to the case,\u201d MCL 768.29, and the jury finding guilt based on those instructions. That is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>by precluding the jury from being instructed on the crime of moving violation causing death, the Legislature was essentially precluding the jury from <em>convicting </em>a criminal defendant of that lesser offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">While jurors are not presumed to know the law applicable to a case, Michigan law presumes that a trial judge sitting as finder of fact is \u201caware of lesser-included offenses without the need for instruction.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Conversely, the judge must also be aware when (as here) it is not appropriate to consider lesser included offenses.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> As a result, the Legislature did not need to provide an explicit limitation on a judge acting as the finder of fact when enacting its exception to the general rule governing lesser included offenses. To interpret MCL 257.626(5) as precluding the lesser offense instruction in <em>either </em>a jury trial or bench trial is therefore consistent with the general purpose of MCL 257.626(5): to eliminate the possibility that a defendant charged with reckless driving causing could be convicted of moving violation causing death. For these reasons, we agree with the Court of Appeals dissenting opinion, which explained that \u201c[g]iven the clear intent of the Legislature to forbid consideration of the lesser misdemeanor offense of moving violation causing death when a defendant has been charged with reckless driving causing death, a judge trying a case without a jury would surely understand that he or she could not convict the defendant of the lesser offense.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">As a result of defendant\u2019s charge of reckless driving causing death, MCL 257.626(5) barred an instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>on the misdemeanor lesser offense of moving violation causing death. This legislative enactment does not run afoul of the separation of powers because, consistent with <em>Cornell, </em>MCL 257.626(5) is a substantive rule of law and is thus within the domain of the Legislature.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Because defendant was statutorily precluded from having the jury consider the lesser offense of moving violation causing death, we therefore hold that the circuit court erred by granting the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">We conclude that the circuit court erred by granting defendant\u2019s request that the jury be instructed on moving violation causing death. Defendant was charged with the greater offense of reckless driving causing death and, as such, was precluded under MCL 257.626(5) from receiving an instruction on the misdemeanor lesser offense of moving violation causing death.

But I believe the Legislature\u2019s use of the words \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d and \u201cvehicle\u201d is significant given that the Michigan Vehicle Code has assigned distinct definitions to the two terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">MCL 257.79 defines \u201cvehicle,\u201d in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">\u201cVehicle\u201d means every device in, upon, or by which any person or property is or may be transported or drawn upon a highway, except devices exclusively moved by human power or used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Whereas MCL 257.33 defines \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">\u201cMotor vehicle\u201d means every vehicle that is self-propelled, but for purposes of chapter 4 of this act[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] motor vehicle does not include industrial equipment such as a forklift, a front-end loader, or other construction equipment that is not subject to registration under this act. Motor vehicle does not include an electric patrol vehicle being operated in compliance with the electric patrol vehicle act. Motor vehicle does not include an electric personal assistive mobility device. Motor vehicle does not include an electric carriage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">Thus, by its terms, a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d is more narrowly defined as a \u201cvehicle\u201d with the distinct feature of being self-propelled. Arguably, then, a person could operate<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a \u201cvehicle\u201d in violation of the reckless driving causing death statute, but not violate the moving violation causing death statute if the vehicle involved was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>not specifically a \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d But this distinction raises the question\u2014what types of vehicles could a person operate in violation of the reckless driving causing death statute that are not motor vehicles?</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">According to my review of the Michigan Vehicle Code, a \u201cvehicle\u201d for purposes of the reckless driving causing death statute could be a \u201cperson riding an animal,\u201d \u201can animal-drawn vehicle,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or an \u201celectric carriage.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And while those devices are vehicles under the act, they are obviously not \u201cmotor vehicles.\u201d Thus, while it could be possible for a person to be charged with reckless driving causing death for recklessly driving a horse-drawn carriage, it would be impossible for that person to be found guilty of moving violation causing death because a horse-drawn carriage is not a motor vehicle. In other words, the offense of moving violation causing death is not a necessarily included lesser offense of reckless driving causing death because it <em>is </em>possible to commit reckless driving causing death without first committing a moving violation causing death\u2014if you are operating a \u201cvehicle\u201d that is not also a \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">I am fully aware that the circumstances under which a person may commit reckless driving causing death using such a non-motor vehicle will be rare, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>rarity of that potential occurrence does not change the legal analysis. An offense is either always considered a necessarily included lesser offense or it is not.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And applying principles of statutory interpretation,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> I believe the Legislature\u2019s use of different terminology to describe the elements of each offense dictates the conclusion that the offense of moving violation causing death is not a necessarily included lesser offense of reckless driving causing death because all of the elements of moving violation causing death are not subsumed into reckless driving causing death such that it is impossible for a person to commit reckless driving causing death without first committing moving violation causing death.

The majority holds that jury instructions on lesser included offenses \u201cconcern a matter of substantive law,\u201d and, therefore, the Legislature\u2019s decision to bar instruction on the lesser included offense of moving violation causing death, MCL 257.601d(l), within MCL 257.626(5), is a permissible exercise of legislative power and does not offend the separation-of-powers doctrine. I continue to disagree with the majority\u2019s test regarding the difference between substantive and procedural law, and I disagree that lesser-included-offense instructions are a matter of substantive law. See <em>McDougall v Schanz, </em>461 Mich 15, 60-61; 597 NW2d 148 (1999) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting). Further, I believe that MCL 257.626(5) deprives a defendant of the ability to present his theory of the case and disadvantages a defendant who chooses to exercise his right to a jury trial in violation of the Sixth Amendment. Therefore, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">I. SEPARATION OF POWERS</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The majority\u2019s separation-of-powers test was established in <em>McDougall, </em>where it held that a law only impinges on the Court\u2019s power to govern \u201cpractice and procedure\u201d under Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5, when \u201cno clear legislative policy consideration other than judicial dispatch of litigation can be identified.\u201d <em>McDougall, </em>461 Mich at 30, quoting <em>Kirby v Larson, </em>400 Mich 585, 598; 256 NW2d 400 (1977) (opinion of WILLIAMS, J.) (quotation marks omitted). In doing so, the <em>McDougall </em>majority overruled <em>Perin v Peuler, (On Rehearing), </em>373 Mich 531; 130 NW2d 4 (1964), criticizing Perin\u2019s rule as overly broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>However, I continue to believe that <em>Perin </em>properly applied Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5. As I explained in <em>McDougall, </em>461 Mich at 41-42 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting), the separation-of-powers doctrine can be traced to the first Michigan Constitution, \u201cwhich even predated our statehood.\u201d We have long held that when a court rule and a statute conflict, the court rule shall control absent the Court\u2019s acquiescence. See e.g., <em>Byrne v Gypsum Plaster &amp; Stucco Co, </em>141 Mich 62, 63-34; 104 NW 410 (1905); <em>Berman v Psiharis, </em>325 Mich 528, 533; 39 NW2d 58 (1949); <em>In re Koss Estate, </em>340 Mich 185, 189-190; 65 NW2d 316 (1954). As <em>Perin </em>correctly explained, \u201c[t]he function of enacting and amending judicial rules of practice and procedure has been committed exclusively to this Court[,] a function with which the legislature may not meddle or interfere save as the Court may acquiesce and adopt for retention at judicial will.\u201d <em>Perin, </em>373 Mich at 541 (citations omitted). Thus, unless this Court acquiesces to the Legislature\u2019s decisions to regulate court procedures, this Court\u2019s power to regulate its own matters will always trump any legislatively prescribed rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Supplementing Perin\u2019s analysis, when one considers the definitions of \u201csubstantive law\u201d and \u201cprocedural law,\u201d it becomes clear that lesser-included-offense instructions are procedural rather than substantive law, and, therefore, within the Court\u2019s constitutionally prescribed powers under art 6, \u00a7 5. \u201cSubstantive law\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he part of law that creates, defines, and regulates the rights, duties, and powers of parties,\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(8th ed); whereas, \u201cprocedural law\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he rules that prescribe the steps for having a right or duty judicially enforced, as opposed to the law that defines the specific rights and duties themselves.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, our caselaw supports these distinctions between substantive and procedural law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>For example, <em>Phelps v Wayne Circuit Judge, </em>225 Mich 514, 517-518; 196 NW 195 (1923), determined a statute to be procedural and explained that \u201c[t]he contingent right given by the statute is not substantive law, but a rule of procedure relating only to the remedy. Its purpose and character class it as adjective law, which deals with methods for maintenance and enforcement of primary rights or to redress their invasion.\u201d Similarly, <em>Chandler Motor Sales Co v Dertien, </em>229 Mich 630, 634; 201 NW 954 (1925), explained that a procedural law \u201cis one of practice. It relates to the method of applying a remedy and not to the substantive law (citation and quotation marks omitted).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Lesser-included-offense instructions determine the method by which the substantive law\u2014i.e. crimes\u2014are applied in a criminal case. They do not, however, determine what is or is not a crime, and they do not define the rights and duties of members of society. Instead, they help prescribe the steps that a jury follows in reaching its verdict by informing the jury of their options under the existing substantive law. In other words, lesser-included-offense instructions inform the jury of the applicable crimes the jury may consider. Another way to approach the issue is to consider a jury\u2019s verdict the \u201cremedy\u201d in a criminal trial. Just like the outcome of a civil case is a remedy, the outcome in a criminal case is the verdict. See <em>Chandler Motor Sales Co, </em>229 Mich at 634. Stated another way, lesser-included-offense instructions consider the methods for redressing a criminal defendant\u2019s potential \u201cinvasion,\u201d see <em>Phelps, </em>225 Mich at 517-518, by prescribing the steps for determining a criminal sentence. Likewise, lesser-included-offense instructions do not determine <em>what </em>remedy is available, or whether a remedy <em>is </em>available, but instead inform the method of choosing and applying the \u201cremedy\u201d by providing varied options <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>to the jury. And while the bar in MCL 257.626(5) on jury instruction in this case could arguably define the substantive rights of a defendant, the rights being defined are those within the context of a trial: they are the <em>procedural </em>rights a criminal defendant is afforded, and not the rights and obligations of the defendant as it relates to his membership in society.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Having established that lesser-included-offense instructions are indeed procedural, and, thus, within the purview of the court, the Legislature\u2019s action is only impermissible if the law conflicts with a court rule. I believe that there is such a conflict. MCR 2.512(B)(2) requires that the court \u201cshall instruct the jury on the applicable law, the issues presented by the case, and, if a party requests as provided in [another subrule], that party\u2019s theory of the case.\u201d In my view, MCR 2.512(B)(2) directs that the court instruct the jury regarding lesser included offenses because lesser included offenses for which a defendant is potentially culpable is part of the \u201capplicable law.\u201d In addition, as discussed later in this opinion, jury instructions, including lesser-included-offense instructions, are integral to a defendant\u2019s ability to present his theory of the case. Therefore, in my mind, MCL 257.626(5) irreconcilably conflicts with MCR 2.512(B)(2). The court rule must control unless this Court acquiesces or adopts the statute\u2019s rule\u2014we have done neither. Therefore, MCL 257.626(5) impermissibly infringes this Court\u2019s sole authority to adopt rules and procedures and thus violates the separation-of-powers doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">To the contrary, the majority holds that lesser-included-offense instructions are a matter of substantive law and, thus, the Legislature\u2019s regulation of such instructions does not offend the separation-of-powers doctrine. However, the majority merely cites a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>statement in <em>People v Cornell, </em>466 Mich 335, 353; 646 NW2d 127 (2002), that \u201c[d]etermining what charges a jury may consider . .. concerns a matter of substantive law.\u201d Yet <em>Cornell </em>provided little analysis to support this bold pronouncement, simply citing the following passage from <em>People v Piasecki, </em>333 Mich 122, 143; 52 NW2d 626 (1952):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\">The measure of control exercised in connection with the prevention and detection of crime and prosecution and punishment of criminals is set forth in the statutes of the State pertaining thereto, particularly the penal code and the code of criminal procedure. The powers of the courts with reference to such matters are derived from the statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">When read in context, it is clear that <em>Piasecki </em>defined <em>jurisdictional </em>powers of the Court as <em>granted </em>by the Legislature. Importantly, <em>Piasecki </em>did not involve a situation in which the Legislature attempted to intrude on powers constitutionally granted to the courts under Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5. Thus, <em>Cornell\u2019s </em>citation to <em>Piasecki </em>to support its assertion was incorrect, as the following passage from <em>Piasecki </em>makes clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument does not rest on the theory of an improper usurpation of judicial authority but on the claim that if the <em>jurisdiction </em>of the court in the criminal case has attached there may be no interference with such <em>jurisdiction.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\"><em>We are not dealing with a situation in which the legislature has undertaken to interfere with the exercise of strictly judicial prerogatives in the trial of cases </em>.... Such decisions are not in point in the instant controversy. We are concerned here with the <em>power of the legislature to create substantive rights </em>and to provide for the protection thereof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>in matters that are clearly within the scope of the police power of the State. <em>[Id. </em>at 147-148 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">It is clear that Piasecki\u2019s discussion regarding the court\u2019s power was describing those jurisdictional powers granted to the courts by the Legislature, not those powers that are inherent in the courts by virtue of Michigan\u2019s Constitution. Thus, in my opinion, <em>Cornell\u2019s </em>fleeting statement was incorrect, and the majority\u2019s reliance on it is likewise improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Moreover, in <em>McDougall </em>and subsequent cases, including this one, the majority continues to apply an overbroad test that risks making this Court\u2019s ability to govern judicial matters all but an illusion. As previously stated, the majority considers whether \u201cno clear legislative policy consideration other than judicial dispatch of litigation can be identified.\u201d <em>McDougall, </em>461 Mich at 30 (citation and quotation marks omitted). However, the pitfalls of the majority\u2019s test become clear when one considers that a policy reason can be found for nearly any legislative enactment affecting the procedures of the courts. Under the majority\u2019s test, arguably the Legislature could amend the voir dire process to attempt to ensure better jury selections, or even attempt to dictate the structure of a trial for the purposes of efficiency. I am hesitant to believe that the Legislature acts purely arbitrarily, without policy considerations in mind. In other words, irrespective of whether the Legislature acts within the confines of its power, every law passed by the Legislature, whether constitutional or not, is the result of a policy decision. It would seem, therefore, that unless the Legislature acts arbitrarily, with no policy goal in mind, <em>every law </em>involves a \u201clegislative policy consideration.\u201d Therefore, I believe that the mere existence of legislative policy goals is not sufficient to avoid separation-of-powers concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>II. RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">In addition to violating the separation-of-powers doctrine, MCL 257.626(5) gravely implicates the constitutional right to a trial by jury in two ways. First, more broadly, lesser-included-offense instructions ensure that a jury makes an informed decision and a defendant is able to present the theory of his case. Second, MCL 257.626(5) punishes a defendant for exercising his right to a trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">First, the Sixth Amendment requires that the state afford a defendant a jury trial at the defendant\u2019s request in \u201cserious criminal cases.\u201d <em>Duncan v Louisiana, </em>391 US 145, 156; 88 S Ct 1444; 20 L Ed 2d 491 (1986). See, also, <em>People v Duncan, </em>462 Mich 47, 53; 610 NW2d 551 (2000). Also, the court\u2019s failure to instruct a jury on the elements of an offense \u201cdeprive[s] defendants of \u2018basic protections\u2019 without which \u2018a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence . . . and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.\u2019 \u201d <em>Neder v United States, </em>527 US 1, 8-9; 119 S Ct 1827; 144 L Ed 2d 35 (1999), quoting <em>Rose v Clark, </em>478 US 570, 577-578; 106 S Ct 3101; 92 L Ed 2d 460 (1986). The court must inform the jury of the law by which its verdict must be controlled; otherwise, the jury is deprived of a tool essential to its decision-making process. See <em>Duncan, </em>462 Mich at 52-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">As noted, we have held that the failure to instruct on an element of a crime undermines the reliability of a verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 54. Similarly, the failure to instruct on a lesser included offense undermines the reliability of a jury\u2019s verdict. When credible evidence exists to support such an instruction, the failure to provide it denies the jury the opportunity to consider the defendant\u2019s theory of the case and deprives a defendant of his right to a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>trial. See <em>People v Rodriguez, </em>463 Mich 466, 474; 620 NW2d 13 (2000); <em>Cornell, </em>466 Mich at 375 (KELLY, J., dissenting). Indeed, instructions on lesser included offenses mitigate \u201cthe risk that a defendant might otherwise be convicted of a crime more serious than that which the jury believes he committed simply because the jury wishes to avoid setting him free.\u201d <em>Vujosevic v Rafferty, </em>844 F2d 1023, 1027 (CA 3, 1988), citing <em>Keeble v United States, </em>412 US 205, 212, 213; 93 S Ct 1993; 36 L Ed 2d 844 (1973). Therefore, these instructions are important to ensure that a defendant is only convicted of the crime he actually committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Because this Court has concluded that lesser-included-offense instructions are a necessary part of ensuring reliable verdicts and, thus, protecting a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, why would we sanction a law as constitutional when it curtails constitutional guarantees? Notably, this Court would invalidate as unconstitutional any law that sought to curtail a defendant\u2019s right to an attorney under the Fifth or Sixth Amendment. Similarly, the Court would invalidate any law that sought to reduce the protections of the Fourth Amendment against search and seizure in order to aid police. It must follow that any law which impinges on a defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial must, similarly, be found unconstitutional. Therefore, in my mind, any law, including MCL 257.626(5), that bars a jury from hearing and considering lesser included offenses violates a criminal defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">But the constitutional concerns with MCL 257.626(5) do not stop there. In addition to its impact on a jury\u2019s ability to render informed decisions, it also impermissibly punishes a defendant for <em>exercising </em>his right to a jury trial. MCL 257.626(5) states, \u201cIn a prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>under [reckless driving causing death], the <em>jury </em>shall not be instructed regarding the crime of moving violation causing death.\u201d Emphasis added. MCL 257.626(5), by its plain language, only restricts a <em>jury\u2019s </em>ability to be instructed on the lesser included offense of moving violation causing death. However, it is silent regarding bench trials and, thus, does not preclude the consideration of the lesser included offense if the defendant chooses to forgo the right to a jury trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The effect of this statute is that a defendant who exercises his right to a jury trial is placed at a disadvantage because the lesser included offense of moving violation causing death is not available. This places defendants between a rock and a hard place as they are forced to choose whether to exercise their constitutional right to a jury trial or to have considered the lesser offense of moving violation causing death, a misdemeanor, instead of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>reckless driving causing death, a 15-year felony. See MCL 257.601d(l), MCL 257.626(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Further, MCL 763.3(1) allows a prosecutor, in effect, to preclude any consideration of the lesser included offense of moving violation causing death. MCL 763.3(1) states that, \u201cIn all criminal cases arising in the courts of this state the defendant may, <em>with the consent of the prosecutor and approval by the court, </em>waive a determination of the facts by a jury and elect to be tried before the court without a jury.\u201d Emphasis added. See, also, <em>People v Kirby, </em>440 Mich 485, 487; 487 NW2d 404 (1992). Therefore, a defendant may not elect a bench trial without the prosecutor and the court\u2019s <em>consent. </em>This grants the prosecutor a significant strategic advantage to preclude the consideration of a charge that, as has been explained, is necessary to a defendant\u2019s ability to present his theory of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">\u201cThe right [to a jury trial] includes, of course, as its most important element, the right to have the jury, rather than the judge, reach the requisite finding of \u2018guilty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sullivan v Louisiana, </em>508 US 275, 277; 113 S Ct 2078; 124 L Ed 2d 182 (1993). \u201cWhat the factfinder must determine to return a verdict of guilty is prescribed by the Due Process Clause. The prosecution bears the burden of proving all elements of the offense and must persuade the factfinder \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 of the facts necessary to establish each of those elements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 277-278 (citations omitted). The ultimate effect of MCL 257.626(5) and MCL 763.3(1) is that a defendant may never be able to have the lesser included offense of moving violation causing death considered in a criminal trial. The result is a chilling effect on a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to trial by jury. In my view, MCL 257.626(5) violates a defendant\u2019s right to jury trial and is, therefore, unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>hi. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Because I believe that jury instructions are procedural rather than substantive, and because MCL 257.626(5) conflicts with MCR 2.512(B)(2), I believe that MCL 257.626(5) is an unconstitutional violation of the separation-of-powers doctrine. Further, because MCL 257.626(5) limits a defendant\u2019s ability to present the theory of his case to a jury and effectively punishes a defendant for exercising his Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury, MCL 257.626(5) is also unconstitutional under the Sixth Amendment. Accordingly, I would affirm the Court of Appeals holding that the circuit court properly granted defendant\u2019s request that the jury be instructed on the lesser included offense of moving violation causing death.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-6\"> The majority ignores its own textualist approach when it states, \u201cTo interpret MCL 257.626(5) as precluding the lesser offense instruction in <em>either </em>a jury trial or bench trial is . . . consistent with the general purposes of MCL 275.626(5).\u201d However, this approach ignores that \u201c[wjhen construing a statute, the Court\u2019s primary obligation is to ascertain the legislative intent that may be reasonably inferred from the words expressed in the statute. If the language of the statute is unambiguous, the Legislature is presumed to have intended the meaning expressed.\u201d <em>GC Timmis &amp; Co v Guardian Alarm Co, </em>468 Mich 416, 420; 662 NW2d 710 (2003) (citations and quotation marks omitted). The language of MCL 257.626(5) is clear, and it only precludes the <em>jury\u2019s </em>consideration of lesser-included-offense instructions. Had the Legislature intended the meaning that the majority gives MCL 257.626(5), it would have included language similar to that in MCL 768.32(2), which states that \u201cthe jury, or <em>judge </em>in a trial without a jury, may find the accused not guilty of the offense in the degree charged in the indictment but may find the accused guilty of a degree of that offense inferior to that charged in the indictment only if the lesser included offense is a major controlled substance offense.\u201d Emphasis added. Therefore, the Legislature knows how to preclude lesser included offense considerations in <em>both </em>jury and bench trials, but chose not to do so in MCL 257.626(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
