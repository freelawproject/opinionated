INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">This Court is yet again faced with a challenge to the Legislature\u2019s education-related funding appropriation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>for state-imposed mandates under the Headlee Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs are taxpayers and school districts seeking a declaratory judgment that the amount of funding appropriated by the Legislature to fund new and increased recordkeeping requirements is materially deficient. Consistent with our construction of the Head-lee Amendment and our court rules, we have required that plaintiffs bringing an action charging inadequate funding of a legislative mandate under the Headlee Amendment must allege and prove not only that the funding was insufficient, but the type and extent of the harm. Today we make clear that this burden includes the requirement that the plaintiff show the specific amount of underfunding where the Legislature has made at least some appropriation of funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The special master applied this burden of proof and dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims when plaintiffs stated at trial that they would not provide proofs establishing the specific amount of underfunding. The Court of Appeals reversed, requiring plaintiffs only to provide evidence that the methodology used by the Legislature to determine the amount of the appropriation was materially flawed, and remanded the case to the special master for further proceedings. The Court of Appeals\u2019 standard is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s longstanding requirement that a plaintiff alleging inadequate funding must show the type and extent of the funding shortfall.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Plaintiffs were properly instructed regarding the burden of proof by the special master before trial and failed to offer proofs concerning the specific amount of the alleged shortfall. Thus, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and enter a judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>II. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">A. HISTORY OF <em>ADAIR </em>LITIGATION AND LEGISLATIVE ACTION</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The legislatively imposed mandates at issue require that school districts collect and report certain information regarding school district performance to the Center for Educational Performance and Information (CEPI).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The CEPI was created through Executive Order 2000-9 and 2000 PA 297 and is entrusted to \u201c[coordinate the collection of all data required by state and federal law from districts, intermediate districts, and postsecondary institutions\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u201cprovide information to school leaders, teachers, researchers, and the public,\u201d including \u201c[r]esearch-ready data sets for researchers to perform research that advances this state\u2019s educational performance.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Initially, the state did not make an appropriation to fund the CEPI mandate. As a result, in 2000 plaintiffs commenced a Headlee Amendment action in the Court of Appeals. In the first <em>Adair </em>case decided by this Court, we held that the <em>lack </em>of funding for CEPI reporting requirements presented a \u201ccolorable claim under Head-lee\u201d because the mandates \u201crequire[d] the districts to actively participate in maintaining data that the state requires for its own purposes,\u201d a requirement that had not existed before that time.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">After a few additional trips between this Court and the Court of Appeals, the case culminated in <em>Adair v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number><em>Michigan (Adair </em>I).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Adair I, </em>this Court affirmed the Court of Appeals\u2019 declaratory judgment that the Legislature had violated the prohibition of unfunded mandates (POUM) provision of the Headlee Amendment. We held that, in a case in which the state provides <em>no funding at all </em>to fund a mandate, a POUM Headlee claim does not require proof by a plaintiff of specific increased costs necessitated by the state mandate. In that situation, \u201ca plaintiff need only establish that the state imposed on it a new or increased level of activity without providing any funding to pay for it.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">In response to <em>Adair </em>7, the Legislature enacted MCL 388.1752a,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which appropriated about $25 million for the 2010-2011 school year to reimburse local school districts for the cost of the CEPI recordkeeping mandate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Legislature also added an additional CEPI mandate, the teacher-student data link (TSDL), which requires reporting of data to allow districts \u201cto assess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>individual teacher impact on student performance.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> So, for the 2010-2011 school year, the Legislature made a separate appropriation in the amount of $8.4 million for the newly created TSDL mandate.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For the following school year, 2011-2012, the Legislature appropriated approximately $34 million to cover all of the CEPI record keeping requirements, which included money for the TSDL requirements (the \u201c\u00a7 152a appropriation\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Additionally, for both of these school years, the Legislature made a \u201cdiscretionary nonmandated payment\u201d (the \u201c\u00a7 22b appropriation\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, these funds were conditioned on furnishing the data as required by the CEPI mandates. The condition currently reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">In order to receive an allocation under subsection (1), each district shall do all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">(c) Furnish data and other information required by state and federal law to the center and the department in the form and manner specified by the center or the department, as applicable.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">B. THE CURRENT LITIGATION</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Plaintiffs, more than 450 Michigan school districts together with one individual taxpayer from each district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>filed an original action in the Court of Appeals<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> challenging the amount of the \u00a7 152a appropriation for school year 2010-2011 as inadequate to compensate the school districts for the CEPI requirements. Plaintiffs amended their pleadings to include a similar challenge to the following school year\u2019s appropriation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The Court of Appeals assigned the case to a special master. After discovery, defendants moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> claiming that plaintiffs could not produce any evidence of the amount of necessary increased costs and that in any case, the \u00a7 22b appropriation fully funded the mandates. The master denied defendants\u2019 motion, finding that plaintiffs had presented \u201cmore than sufficient evidence to show that the state has underfunded the CEPI mandates ... [and] the [TSDL] mandate.\u201d He also ruled that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">[pllaintiffs have a \u2018higher burden\u2019 which requires them to produce evidence of specific dollar-amount increases in the costs incurred in order to comply with the CEPI requirements. <em>[Adair I, </em>486 Mich at 480] n 29 .... The Plaintiffs\u2019 poignant argument that the general direction of <em>Adair I </em>mitigates requiring them to establish the insufficiency of the amount of appropriation overlooks the factual distinc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>tion between <em>Adair I </em>(no appropriation made) and this case (appropriations made).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">At that point, the master believed that \u201c[o]nce the state establishes an appropriation, the Plaintiffs are equipped to attack whether the amount is sufficient. Indeed, the Plaintiffs\u2019 expert has done just that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The case proceeded to trial, but during opening statements, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated that they would not attempt to prove a specific dollar amount of underfunding, but rather intended to show through expert testimony that the Legislature\u2019s methodology to determine the requisite amount of funding was materially flawed and thus that the appropriation could not be constitutionally adequate under Headlee. At the close of plaintiffs\u2019 opening statement, on the basis of plaintiffs\u2019 refusal to present proofs on the specific amount of alleged funding shortfall, defendants filed a motion for an involuntary dismissal,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> claiming that plaintiffs were unable or unwilling to meet their burden. Plaintiffs responded that, because this was merely a declaratory action, they need not quantify the extent of the underfunding, but only show that an underfunding occurred. The special master granted defendants\u2019 motion. In a written opinion, the master reiterated that plaintiffs had the burden to establish the specific amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>underfunding. Because plaintiffs declined to offer those proofs, their case was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Both parties filed objections, and the Court of Appeals reversed the special master\u2019s ruling on the appropriate burden of proof, but affirmed in all other respects.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The panel concluded that the special master had relied too heavily on the fact that <em>Adair I </em>involved no legislative funding while this case involves a claim for underfunding. In the Court of Appeals\u2019 view, <em>Adair I </em>stood for the proposition that neither Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 29 nor MCL 21.233 required plaintiffs to prove how much their districts\u2019 costs had increased as a result of a new or increased mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Instead, stated the panel, plaintiffs had the \u201cburden to present sufficient evidence to allow the trier of fact to conclude that the method employed by the Legislature to determine the amount of the appropriation was so flawed that it failed to reflect the actual cost to the state if the state were to provide the activity or service mandated as a state requirement. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals concluded that plaintiffs stood ready to meet this burden through expert testimony, which a trier of fact could find \u201cundermined the validity of the method used by the Legislature to determine the amount of the appropriations at issue .. . ,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The panel remanded to the special master to reopen the proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Both parties sought leave to appeal in this Court; we granted defendants\u2019 application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>hi. standard of review</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Questions of constitutional and statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> An appellate court reviews de novo a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for an involuntary dismissal.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">IV ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Because we are interpreting the Michigan Constitution, the proper focus is on the will of the people ratifying the amendment. \u201cThe primary objective in interpreting a constitutional provision is to determine the text\u2019s original meaning to the ratifiers, the people, at the time of ratification.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This is the rule of \u201ccommon understanding,\u201d which is described by Justice Cooley as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">A constitution is made for the people and by the people. The interpretation that should be given it is that which reasonable minds, the great mass of the people themselves, would give it. For as the Constitution does not derive its force from the convention which framed, but from the people who ratified it, the intent to be arrived at is that of the people, and it is not to be supposed that they have looked for any dark or abstruse meaning in the words employed, but rather that they have accepted them in the sense most obvious to the common understanding, and ratified the instrument in the belief that that was the sense designed to be conveyed.[<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>This Court locates the common understanding of constitutional text by applying the plain meaning of the text at the time of ratification.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Interpretation of a constitutional provision also takes account of \u201cthe circumstances leading to the adoption of the provision and the purpose sought to be accomplished.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">A. THE HEADLEE AMENDMENT AND IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">In 1978, the voters passed the Headlee Amendment by initiative. The Headlee Amendment was adopted with \u201cthe primary purpose of relieving the electorate from overwhelming and overreaching taxation.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> To effectuate its purpose, the amendment set forth \u201ca fairly complex system of revenue and tax limits.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> One of these limitations is contained in Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 25, which provides, \u201cThe state is prohibited from requiring any new or expanded activities by local governments without full state financing, from reducing the proportion of state spending in the form of aid to local governments, or from shifting the tax burden to local government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The Headlee Amendment provides for another set of limitations in article 9, \u00a7 29. The first sentence of that section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">The state is hereby prohibited from reducing the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of any existing activity or service required of units of Local Government by state law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">The second sentence of \u00a7 29 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">A new activity or service or an increase in the level of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>activity or service beyond that required by existing law shall not be required by the legislature or any state agency of units of Local Government, unless a state appropriation is made and disbursed to pay the unit of Local Government for any necessary increased costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The first sentence prohibits the state from reducing the state-financed proportion of an existing activity required of local governments; the second generally prohibits new mandates which increase the burden on local governments unless accompanied by funding to offset increased costs. Claims under the first sentence are referred to as \u201cmaintenance of support\u201d or \u201cMOS\u201d claims. Claims under the latter sentence are referred to as \u201cprohibition of unfunded mandates\u201d or \u201cPOUM\u201d claims. This appeal involves a POUM claim: the plaintiffs contend that the state failed to provide adequate funding for increased services under the CEPI mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Shortly after the Headlee Amendment was enacted, the Legislature passed an act to implement the constitutional provisions.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The act requires the Legislature to \u201cannually appropriate an amount sufficient to make disbursements to each local unit of government for the necessary cost of each state requirement. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> \u201cNecessary cost\u201d means \u201cthe net cost of an activity or service provided by a local unit of government.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> \u201cNet cost,\u201d in turn, is defined as \u201cthe actual cost to the state if the state were to provide the activity or service mandated as a state requirement, unless otherwise determined by the legislature when making a state requirement.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>B. ACCEPTANCE OF GENERAL APPROPRIATION AS WAIVER</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">As an initial matter, defendants contend that plaintiff school districts\u2019 acceptance of the \u201cdiscretionary nonmandated payment\u201d\u2014the \u00a7 22b appropriation\u2014 constitutes a waiver of any claim that the Legislature has failed to fulfill its Headlee obligations. Because acceptance of the appropriation is conditioned on compliance with the CEPI mandates, defendants contend that such acceptance thereby waives any claim of a constitutional deficiency under the Headlee Amendment. \u201cWaiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The condition in MCL 388.1622b reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">(3) In order to receive an allocation under subsection (1), each district shall do all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">(c) Furnish data and other information required by state and federal law to [CEPI] and the department in the form and manner specified by [CEPI] or the department, as applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The proper interpretation of a statute is rendered by reference to its plain language.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Examining the language, one searches in vain to find any notice that, by accepting the \u00a7 22b appropriation, plaintiffs have thereby relinquished their right to bring a constitutional challenge to the adequacy of funding provided by the Legislature. Indeed, all the \u00a7 22b appropriation requires is that the district comply with the statute\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>reporting mandates\u2014to \u201cfurnish data and other information required by state and federal law to the center and the department\u201d\u2014in exchange for the allocation. The districts are bound to the terms of the condition upon acceptance of the appropriation, but the terms do not include a waiver of any Headlee claim.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The only thing the plaintiffs intentionally and voluntarily waived upon acceptance of these funds was the ability to ignore the condition requiring them to furnish data and information as required by the CEPI mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">C. APPROPRIATE BURDEN OF PROOF</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">This Court has considered Headlee claims arising under both the MOS and POUM sentences of \u00a7 29 and has consistently announced that a plaintiff making either claim under the Headlee Amendment must show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>the type and extent of the alleged shortfall in order to prove its case. In <em>Oakland Co v </em>Michigan,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> we considered whether, under the Headlee Amendment\u2019s MOS provision, the state unconstitutionally reduced the ratio of financing for county foster care services. In remanding to the lower court for further proceedings, Justice MARILYN Kelly\u2019s plurality opinion stated that \u201cplaintiffs must allege the type and <em>extent of the harm </em>so that the court may determine if a \u00a7 29 violation occurred for purposes of making a declaratory judgment. In that way, the state will be aware of the financial adjustment necessary to allow for future compliance.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The Court adopted this plurality position in the majority opinion of the 2004 <em>Adair </em>case, which concerned a POUM claim.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Thus, the Court has announced this standard as applicable to both of the sentences in \u00a7 29 of the Headlee Amendment, and has done so when the plaintiffs have requested only declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">In 2007, the Michigan Court Rules were amended in order to clarify that a plaintiff bringing a Headlee claim must plead \u201cwith particularity the factual basis for the alleged violation . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In an action involving \u00a7 29, \u201cthe plaintiff shall state with particularity the type and extent of the harm and whether there has been a violation of either the first or second sentence of that section.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">While the requirement that a plaintiff must allege and prove the type and extent of the harm had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>articulated consistently, this Court recognized a narrow exception in <em>Adair I. </em>In that case, we held that, when the state failed to make <em>any </em>appropriation to fund an increased level of activity or service mandated by the state, the plaintiff need not establish the particular amount of increased costs.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Instead, if a plaintiff proves that the state required a new or increased level of activity or service without providing any funding, the burden shifts to the state \u201cto demonstrate that no state funding was required because the requirement did not actually increase costs or the increased costs were not necessary.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">This exception, however, is explained by the distinct factual scenario facing the Court in that case. We have recognized on multiple occasions that POUM claims are in some respects similar to MOS claims.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Significantly, MOS claims and POUM claims concerning an alleged underfunding are quite similar. Both types of claims require a close look at the Legislature\u2019s appropriation in comparison with the mandate in order to evaluate whether the appropriation is sufficient to meet Headlee obligations. This calculus is qualitatively different from a POUM claim in which the Legislature failed to appropriate any funding at all. While the former involves at least some appropriation that the Legislature can argue is sufficient to meet its Headlee obligations, the latter involves the complete absence of funding. A POUM claim alleging no funding is a simpler claim to make, as explained in <em>Adair I, </em>because the Legislature can be said to have completely abdicated its funding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>duty; all that needs to be shown is that the mandate required some increased level of activity or service.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> This characteristic\u2014the absolute lack of funding\u2014 separates <em>Adair I </em>from <em>Oakland Co </em>and the 2004 <em>Adair </em>case. Thus, <em>Adair I </em>is appropriately limited to situations in which the Legislature has not made any appropriation to cover the cost of a new or increased mandate and is inapplicable to \u00a7 29 claims in which some funding has been appropriated.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Consistent with prior caselaw and our court rules, we hold that a plaintiff must allege and prove the specific amount of the purported funding shortfall in order to establish the \u201cextent of the harm\u201d caused by the Legislature\u2019s inadequate funding.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> In other words, to sustain a claim under the Headlee Amendment when the Legislature appropriated at least some amount of funding to cover the cost of a new or expanded mandate, a plaintiff must allege and prove the extent of the \u201cnecessary increased cost\u201d of the new or increased activity or service.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Requiring a plaintiff to establish the specific amount of a funding is consistent with the Constitution and reduces litigation gamesmanship. By requiring a plaintiff to prove the extent of the underfunding, \u201cthe state will be aware of the financial adjustment necessary to allow for future compliance.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> In other words, if a plaintiff carries its burden, the Legislature will have a judicially determined amount that it must appropriate in order to comply with Headlee. If a plaintiff were required only to show flaws in the methodology by which the appropriation was determined, further determination of the precise cost would be needed, thus further delaying \u201cfull state financing\u201d to the localities guaranteed by our Constitution.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The burden of showing the specific amount of funding shortfall is not only consistent with the language of the Headlee Amendment but avoids needless litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">d. application</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Before trial, the special master properly made clear that \u201c[p]laintiffs have a \u2018higher burden\u2019 which requires them to produce evidence of specific dollar-amount increases in the costs incurred in order to comply with the CEPI requirements.\u201d Nonetheless, during their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>opening statement, plaintiffs disclaimed any obligation to prove a specific dollar amount of damages, stated that they would not attempt such proofs, and asserted that they intended to prove only that the Legislature\u2019s methodology for determining the amount of funding for the mandates at issue was flawed. Plaintiffs contended that they would carry their preferred burden by presenting expert testimony. Plaintiffs\u2019 expert report concluded that the state\u2019s appropriation was materially lacking because the determinations made by the state were inadequate and incomplete. While the report extensively documented the alleged problems with the Legislature\u2019s methodology in calculating the \u00a7 152a appropriation, the report failed to offer any evaluation of the extent of the shortfall. Plaintiffs did not offer, nor did they intend to offer, proofs sufficient to create an issue of fact regarding whether they could carry their burden. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling and reinstate the special master\u2019s involuntary dismissal in favor of defendants because plaintiffs failed to offer facts that would entitle them to relief.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Because our precedents as well as our court rules make clear that a plaintiff must allege and prove with specificity the extent of the harm incurred as a result of a legislative funding shortfall, we decline to remand the case for further proceedings. The special master put the plaintiffs on notice before trial that they bore the burden of establishing the specific amount of increased costs. Even though plaintiffs were apprised of their burden, they declined to prepare or offer proofs that would at least create an issue of fact regarding the extent of underfunding.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>v CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">We reaffirm and hold that a plaintiff claiming that the Legislature\u2019s appropriation failed to fully fund the cost of a new or increased service or activity must allege and prove the specific amount of the shortfall. Plaintiffs failed to offer any proofs that could entitle them to relief.

In that very section, MCL 388.1622b(7) specifically contemplates potential Headlee claims by school districts against the state by setting up a procedure for reimbursing the districts in the event of a successful claim. The inclusion of this provision belies the defendants\u2019 argument that acceptance of the appropriation waives any Head-lee claim. MCL 388.1622b(7) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">It is the intent of the legislature that all constitutional obligations of this state have heen fully funded....

First, we asked the parties to address \u201cwhich party has the burden of proving underfunding of a legislative mandate in a challenge under Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 29\u201d and the elements of such a claim. <em>Adair v Michigan, </em>495 Mich 937, 937-938 (2014). This first issue involves a plaintiffs burden of proof in showing that the state underfunded \u201c[a] new activity or service or an increase in the level of any activity or service beyond that required by existing law\u201d for the purposes of the second provision of the Headlee Amendment, commonly referred to as a \u201cprohibition on unfunded mandates\u201d or \u201cPOUM\u201d claim. Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 29; <em>Adair v Michigan, </em>486 Mich 468, 478; 785 NW2d 119 (2010) <em>(Adair I).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In addition, we asked the parties to address \u201cwhether acceptance of a general appropriation from the Legislature which is specifically conditioned on compliance with reporting requirements pursuant to MCL 388.1622b([3])(c) waives any challenge to the funding level for those requirements under Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 29.\u201d <em>Adair, </em>495 Mich at 938.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>With respect to this second issue, I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff school districts did not waive their POUM claim by accepting the conditional appropriation under MCL 388.1622b (\u00a7 22b). As the majority explains, nothing on the face of \u00a7 22b would lead plaintiffs to believe that accepting the funds would result in a waiver of a Headlee Amendment claim, and thus, plaintiffs did not intentionally relinquish a known right. See <em>Sweebe v Sweebe, </em>474 Mich 151, 156-157; 712 NW2d 708 (2006) (citations omitted). Moreover, in <em>Adair v Michigan (On Second Remand), </em>279 Mich App 507, 523-524; 760 NW2d 544 (2008), aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part by <em>Adair I, </em>486 Mich 468, the Court of Appeals addressed a similar issue regarding a general appropriation under \u00a7 22b, holding that \u201cthe POUM clause reflects the intent of the voters that the Legislature <em>actually determine </em>the necessary costs associated with the implementation of new legislative mandates and then appropriate that amount for the <em>express purpose </em>of funding the new mandate.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, I agree with the majority\u2019s rejection of defendants\u2019 argument that accepting the conditional \u00a7 22b appropriation waived plaintiffs\u2019 Headlee Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">My agreement with the majority ends there, however. Specifically, with respect to the first issue, I dissent from the majority\u2019s holding that a plaintiff alleging that the state failed to adequately measure and appropriate sufficient funding for the purposes of complying with the POUM provision must bear the burden to plead and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>prove a quantified dollar amount of underfunding. As explained below, in deciding a POUM plaintiffs burden to show that the state failed to fully fund a new activity or service or an increase in the level of any activity or service, my aim is to recognize the dissimilarities of a per se and underfunding claim while remaining consistent with <em>Adair </em>Fs underlying principles. See Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 29; MCL 21.233(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">To begin, not unlike the majority, I think that there is a meaningful factual difference between a per se POUM claim, i.e., a mandate that was <em>not </em>accompanied by any appropriation, see <em>Adair I, </em>486 Mich at 479 n 29, and a POUM claim alleging underfunding. In <em>Adair I, </em>which involved a per se POUM claim, we held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">to establish a violation of the POUM provision, a plaintiff must show that the state required a new activity or service or an increase in the level of activities or services. If no state appropriation was made to cover the increased burden on local government, the plaintiff need not show the amount of increased costs. It is then the state\u2019s burden to demonstrate that no state funding was required because the requirement did not actually increase costs or the increased costs were not necessary. <em>[Id. </em>at 480.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Assuming that the state proceeded in good-faith compliance with its Headlee Amendment obligation, the state would have contemplated whether the mandate required an appropriation <em>before </em>it enacted the mandate at issue. See, generally, MCL 21.235(2). Specifically, if no funds were appropriated, the state would have necessarily determined that (1) the mandate would not constitute \u201ca new activity or service or an increase in the level of any activities or services,\u201d Const 1963, art 9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>\u00a7 29; (2) local governments would not have \u201cnecessary increased costs,\u201d <em>id,.; </em>and (3) any increased cost was not a \u201cnecessary cost,\u201d as defined by the Headlee Amendment\u2019s implementing provisions, MCL 21.235(1) and MCL 21.233(6).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our standard regarding a POUM plaintiffs burden alleging a per se violation established in <em>Adair I </em>reflects the fact that such a claim may involve disputes on one or more of those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Conversely, when the state decides to appropriate funding in conjunction with the mandate for the express purpose of meeting its Headlee Amendment obligation, it is unlikely that any of the above consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>ations would be at issue. Instead, as plaintiffs assert in this case, the issue becomes whether the state properly measured the appropriation. For the purposes of that inquiry, the Legislature, pursuant to the constitutional directive to enact implementing legislation, see Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 34, has instructed that the appropriation be measured by \u201cthe net cost of an activity or service provided by a local unit of government,\u201d and the \u201cnet cost\u201d \u201cshall be the actual cost to the state if the state were to provide the activity or service mandated as a state requirement. . . .\u201d MCL 21.233(6). This is consistent with this Court\u2019s previous recognition that the statute\u2019s reference to \u201cactual cost to the state\u201d <em>is </em>the proper measure of the appropriation. See <em>Adair I, </em>486 Mich at 488-489; <em>Durant v Michigan, </em>424 Mich 364, 390-391; 381 NW2d 662 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In my view, the majority erroneously bypasses the import of MCL 21.233(6) on the basis that the parties in this case did not address the \u201capparent tension\u201d between (1) the POUM provision\u2019s statement that the appropriation should be made \u201cto pay the unit of Local Government for any necessary increased costs\u201d and (2) the appropriation\u2019s measure as the \u201cactual cost to the state\u201d under MCL 21.233(6).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cThe legislature has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>power to adopt a statute, except as it is prohibited by the Constitution; and a statute will not be declared in conflict with the Constitution while serious doubt exists as to such conflict.\u201d <em>Gratiot Co v Federspiel, </em>312 Mich 128, 132; 20 NW2d 131 (1945) (citations omitted). I have \u201cserious doubt\u201d whether there is such a conflict in this case, and therefore, in my opinion, the Legislature\u2019s explicit measure of the appropriation under MCL 21.233(6) is a valid and indispensible consideration in properly addressing a POUM plaintiffs burden to sustain a claim of underfunding.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">To elaborate, under Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 29, the POUM provision requires that local governments have projected or incurred \u201cnecessary increased costs\u201d resulting from the mandate. See <em>Adair I, </em>486 Mich at 483-485. The implementing legislation then requires that the local governments\u2019 costs be increased beyond a <em>de minimis </em>amount before an appropriation is required. MCL 21.233(6) and MCL 21.232(4). That system is sensible because if the local governments\u2019 \u201cnecessary increased costs\u201d are not increased beyond a <em>de minimis </em>amount, to otherwise require an appropriation would create a windfall for local governments.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Stated differently, there is no need for funding if it would merely cost local governments, at most, a <em>de minimis </em>amount to implement the mandate. If, however, local governments\u2019 costs will increase beyond a <em>de minimis </em>amount as a result from the mandate, an appropriation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>required, but it is not measured by the dollar amount of the local governments\u2019 costs to implement the mandate. Instead, MCL 21.233(6) requires that the appropriation be measured by the state\u2019s costs if it were to perform the activity or service, which is consistent with the Headlee Amendment\u2019s purpose\u2014i.e., that the state cannot shift its costs to locad governments to perform what the state would like to see implemented.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In sum, using the state\u2019s costs as the measure of the appropriation ensures that the state does not unconstitutionally increase local tax burdens because it provides local governments with the money that the state is saving by not implementing the mandate itself. But the POUM provision does not require that the state make an appropriation to local governments if the mandate will not increase the local governments\u2019 necessary costs beyond a <em>de minimis </em>amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Additionally, I disagree with a key premise and strong implication on which the majority relies: that <em>Adair I </em>in its entirety merely stands for a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to a longstanding general rule regarding a POUM plaintiffs burden. Rather, I agree with the unanimous Court of Appeals opinion below that there are relevant general principles underlying <em>Adair </em>J\u2019s analysis of the Headlee Amendment. See <em>Adair v Michigan, </em>302 Mich App 305, 314-315; 839 NW2d 680 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Specifically, addressing whether the mandates resulted in increased costs to plaintiff school districts, <em>Adair I </em>relied on the language of the Headlee Amendment and MCL 21.233(6), which undoubtedly remains applicable regardless of whether a per se or under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>funded POUM claim is at issue. We held that evidence of a \u201cdiversion of manpower . .. constituted increased costs to the districts.\u201d <em>Adair I, </em>486 Mich at 483-484. And by juxtaposing the reference to <em>\u201cactual </em>cost to the state\u201d under MCL 21.233(6)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to the language of the Headlee Amendment, we concluded that \u201c[t]he Headlee Amendment does not require the district to show that its <em>actual </em>expenditures increased.\u201d <em>Adair I, </em>486 Mich at 484 n 32 (emphasis added). Further, when discussing the implementing statute, <em>Adair I </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-4\">Neither Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 29 nor MCL 21.233 suggests that plaintiffs bear the burden of proving precisely how much the school districts\u2019 costs increased as a result of the mandate. In fact, the language of MCL 21.233 implies the opposite. That section defines \u201cnecessary cost\u201d as the \u201cnet cost of an activity or service provided by a local unit of government.\u201d The \u201cnet cost\u201d is defined as \u201cthe actual cost to the state if the state were to provide the activity or service mandated as a state requirement....\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 486-487.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Because <em>Adair I </em>involved a per se violation of the POUM clause, we held that \u201ca plaintiff need only establish that the state imposed on it a new or increased level of activity without providing any funding to pay for it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487. As explained earlier, the pertinent difference between a per se and an underfunded POUM claim is that the latter only involves an inquiry into the sufficiency of the appropriation. Because the appropriation, consistently with our caselaw and legislative instruction, is measured by the actual cost to the state if the state were to provide the new activity, the burden to show that the Legislature\u2019s appropriation accurately reflects the state\u2019s costs is properly placed on the state. See <em>id. </em>at 489 (\u201c[T]he Legislature is in a position far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>superior to plaintiffs\u2019 to determine what the actual cost to itself would be if it performed the increased record-keeping and reporting duties. Proofs on this point are easily accessible to the state because it could ascertain the costs it would incur if it provided the new activity.\u201d). While <em>Adair I </em>held that local governments must have \u201cnecessary increased costs\u201d associated with implementing the mandate that exceed a <em>de minimis </em>amount, the local governments\u2019 costs need not be quantified for the purposes of <em>measuring </em>the sufficiency of the appropriation; whereas, the state\u2019s quantified costs if it were to implement the mandate are central to a claim that a POUM mandate was underfunded.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">That is not to say that a plaintiff should be able to succeed under a POUM claim with a bare assertion that the state has underfunded the appropriation. I fully appreciate that we noted in <em>Adair I </em>that a plaintiffs burden \u201cwould likely [be] higher\u201d when the Legislature did, in fact, appropriate funds, as opposed to the lack of any appropriation at issue in <em>Adair </em>I. See <em>Adair </em>I, 486 Mich at 480 n 29. Also, as the majority emphasizes, in 2007 a majority of this Court adopted MCR 2.112(M), which requires, in part, that a Headlee Amendment plaintiff \u201cstate with particularity the type and extent of the harm ....\u201d Again, I think that \u201c[t]he dispositive issue is the cost to the state if it were to provide the new or increased activity or service, not the cost incurred by the local governmental unit.\u201d <em>Adair </em>I, 486 Mich at 489. Thus, I would not apply this requirement in a manner that requires a plaintiff to arrive at the numeric difference between the state\u2019s actual costs and the amount that the state did in fact appropriate for the purposes of a pleading requirement or a plaintiffs ultimate burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Instead, in keeping with <em>Adair </em>7\u2019s burden-shifting framework, I would hold that to overcome the state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>motion for summary disposition, a plaintiff must show that there is a genuine issue of material fact that the state underfunded the appropriation. See MCR 2.116(C)(10). Depending on the nature of the underlying subject matter of the mandate and the circumstances surrounding the mandate\u2019s enactment with its accompanying appropriation, I would imagine that proofs in this regard might vary from case to case. For example, as the majority accurately explains, the appropriations in this case followed our holding in <em>Adair I. </em>Plaintiffs assert that the appropriations were measured on the basis of a cost study designed to bring the state into compliance with the Headlee Amendment, and, accordingly, they proffered detailed expert testimony about specific expenditures that were not accounted for in the cost study and the following appropriations. I agree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that this evidence shows</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">that plaintiffs stood ready to present some evidence that, if determined credible by the trier of fact, would have undermined the validity of the method used by the Legislature to determine the amount of the appropriations at issue and that would have shifted the burden of going forward with evidence to the state to present some evidence that the appropriations do fully fund the state\u2019s obligation under the POUM provision. <em>[Adair, </em>302 Mich App at 316-317.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>I also think that this conclusion is consistent with MCR 2.112CM) because, in alleging specific expenditures that had not been accounted for by the state\u2019s cost study, plaintiffs alleged the \u201cextent\u201d of the underfunding by claiming <em>what </em>the Legislature failed to value, albeit without quantifying what those expenditures would cost the state if it were to implement the mandate. See <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>(1981) (defining \u201cextent\u201d as \u201c[t]he range over which something extends; scope; comprehensiveness\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Finally, the majority reasons that requiring plaintiffs \u201cto establish the specific amount of funding... reduces litigation gamesmanship\u201d and \u201cavoids needless litigation.\u201d However, I disagree with the instant majority\u2019s \u201cparade of potentially negative \u2018consequences\u2019 \u201d that would occur if it declined to adopt the state\u2019s argument in this case. <em>Adair I, </em>486 Mich at 491.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is true that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>POUM plaintiff may end up with a declaratory judgment that merely states that there was underfunding, which would require the Legislature to appropriate supplemental funding. Yet because the required appropriation is statutorily measured as the state\u2019s costs if it were to implement the mandate, there is no guesswork about local governments\u2019 costs and the appropriation, as the current majority insinuates. In my view, the fact that a plaintiff may file another claim alleging <em>further </em>insufficient funding, i.e., that the state <em>continues </em>to fail to comply with its Headlee Amendment obligation, is no reason to heighten a plaintiffs initial burden. Stated differently, it is the <em>state\u2019s </em>duty in the first instance to adequately fund the mandate. As a result, when faced with an allegation that the state underfunded a mandate, I do not believe it is unreasonably cumbersome to place the burden on the state to show that it accurately measured the appropriation. That is because if it had complied with the POUM provision in the first instance, it would know exactly how the appropriation was measured, which, if accurate, would swiftly and effectively dispose of any allegations of underfunding.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>In light of my analysis, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s holding that a Headlee Amendment plaintiff alleging that the state did not properly measure and fund a mandate that falls within the scope of the POUM provision must plead and prove a specific, quantified dollar amount of underfunding. As a result, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and allow this case to continue in proceedings before the special master.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-4\"> In full, Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 29 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">The state is hereby prohibited from reducing the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of any existing activity or service required of units of Local Government by state law.

Avoiding this issue in <em>Adair I </em>when this Court was not considering the sufficiency of funds that were actually appropriated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>might have been tenable because no appropriation had been made, but for the reasons stated within, I think that it must he addressed in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b351-9\"> See <em>Adair I, </em>486 Mich at 477 (\u201cWhen interpreting constitutional provisions, we are mindful that the interpretation given the provision should he the sense most obvious to the common understanding and one that reasonable minds, the great mass of the people themselves, would give it.\u201d) (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b352-7\"> See <em>Durant, </em>424 Mich at 391 (\u201cProviding only the actual cost to the state, if it provided the service, is in keeping with the voters\u2019 desire that there be no shift of responsibility for services from the state to the local governments without adequate compensation.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b353-6\"> Emphasis added.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b355-6\"> As the majority aptly explains, plaintiffs appealed defendants\u2019 motion for involuntary dismissal.

However, I fail to see how either the court rule\u2019s or <em>Oakland Co\u2019s </em>reference to the \u201cextent\u201d of harm <em>necessarily </em>means that a POUM plaintiff alleging underfunding must show the specific dollar figure of underfunding. Moreover, to the extent that the majority finds <em>Oakland Co </em>relevant in this case on the basis of a rule that is often quoted in the context of Headlee Amendment claims\u2014i.e., that because the MOS and POUM provisions are contained within the same amendment, they are read harmoniously, see, e.g., <em>Durant, </em>424 Mich at 380 n 7\u2014I continue to think that this general rule has limited application when the underlying issue involves a matter that is specific to one of the two provisions.

In that way, <em>the state will be aware of the financial adjustment necessary to allow future compliance </em>(emphasis added).\u201d Viewed in context, <em>Oakland Co </em>was explaining that, while it is an atypical remedy, plaintiffs may obtain a monetary damage award for a Headlee Amendment violation when the state consistently refuses to comply with its funding obligations. As explained earlier, because the state is well equipped to determine how much an activity or service would cost if the state were implementing it, it does not have to rely on local governments to inform the state of the financial adjustment necessary to bring it in compliance with article 9, \u00a7 29. Indeed, if the contrary were true, the state would have to seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>counsel from local governments before enacting <em>any </em>mandate falling under the POUM provision in the first place or risk violating the Constitution every time such a mandate is made.
