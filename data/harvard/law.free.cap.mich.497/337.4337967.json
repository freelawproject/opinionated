By enacting MCL 600.2919a, the Legislature intended to create a separate statutory cause of action for conversion \u201cin addition to any other right or remedy\u201d a victim of conversion could obtain at common law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case, defendant argues that conversion \u201cto the other person\u2019s own use\u201d requires a showing that the other person used the converted property for the property\u2019s common or intended purpose. We decline to adopt such a narrow interpretation of \u201cown use.\u201d Rather, we hold that the separate statutory cause of action for conversion \u201cto the other person\u2019s own use\u201d under MCL 600.2919a(l)(a) requires a showing that the defendant employed the converted property for some purpose personal to the defendant\u2019s interests, even if that purpose is not the object\u2019s ordinarily intended purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">In this case, plaintiff proffered evidence at trial that would allow the jury to conclude that defendant used the wine for some purpose personal to defendant\u2019s interests. As a result, the circuit court erred by granting defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict on this claim. We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the Kent Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Plaintiff, Aroma Wines &amp; Equipment, Inc., is a wholesale wine importer and distributor. Defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Columbian Distribution Services, Inc., operates warehouses in Michigan. Starting in 2006, Aroma agreed to rent some of Columbian\u2019s climate-controlled warehouse space to store its wine while awaiting sale.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to the parties\u2019 agreement, Columbian was required to maintain the wine within a temperature range of 50 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit. While the agreement required Columbian to provide Aroma with notice before Columbian could transport Aroma\u2019s wine to a different warehouse complex, Columbian reserved the right under the agreement to move the wine without notice \u201cwithin and between any one or more of the warehouse buildings which comprise the warehouse complex\u201d identified in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Aroma\u2019s sales declined sharply during 2008, and Aroma began falling behind on its monthly payments to Columbian. In January 2009, Columbian notified Aroma that it was asserting a lien on Aroma\u2019s wine and that Aroma could not pick up any more wine or ship any more orders until past due invoices were paid. In March 2009, Columbian released to Aroma a small portion of its wine in exchange for a $1,000 payment on Aroma\u2019s account. Notwithstanding this payment, Columbian asserted that Aroma had accrued a past-due balance of more than $20,000 on the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">At some point during this dispute, and contrary to the terms of the contract, Columbian removed the wine from its climate-controlled space and transported it to an uncontrolled environment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Aroma alleges that Columbian moved its wine to rent the space to higher-paying customers. Columbian concedes that it moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Aroma\u2019s wine but claims that the move was temporary, that its purpose was to renovate the climate-controlled space and thereby increase its storage capacity, and that none of the wine was exposed to extreme temperature conditions. Aroma claims that the temperature changes destroyed the wine\u2019s salability.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Aroma filed the instant suit in the Kent Circuit Court. Its second amended complaint alleged four separate causes of action: (1) breach of contract, (2) violation of the Uniform Commercial Code, (3) common-law conversion, and (4) statutory conversion under MCL 600.2919a(l)(a). As part of its statutory conversion claim, Aroma alleged that Columbian \u201cconverted [Aroma\u2019s] wine inventory to its own use\u201d and sought treble damages for the alleged statutory conversion. In response, Columbian countersued for breach of contract based on Aroma\u2019s nonpayment of rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The case proceeded to trial. At the close of Aroma\u2019s proofs, Columbian moved for a directed verdict on Aroma\u2019s fourth count, the statutory conversion claim, arguing that Aroma had failed to provide any evidence to support its assertion that Columbian converted Aroma\u2019s wine to its own use. In support of the motion, Columbian emphasized that implicit in the definition of the word \u201cuse\u201d is an inference limiting the definition to \u201cusing something for the purpose . . . intended by the nature of the product or good.\u201d Aroma sought a broader interpretation of \u201cuse\u201d that did not limit its scope to acts involving the wine\u2019s intended purpose but instead encompassed acts by which the converter exercised its dominion and control over the wine. Under this interpretation, then, Columbian could \u201cuse\u201d Aroma\u2019s wine by asserting dominion and control over that wine as leverage in the dispute over the balance due Columbian. The court agreed with Columbian\u2019s interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>\u201cuse,\u201d concluded that \u201cone would have to drink [the wine] or perhaps sell it\u201d to use' it, and granted Columbian\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on Aroma\u2019s statutory conversion claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">Trial continued on Aroma\u2019s remaining counts and on Columbian\u2019s counterclaim. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found that Columbian had breached its contract with Aroma and converted Aroma\u2019s wine, awarding Aroma damages totaling $275,000. The jury also found that Aroma did not breach its contract with Columbian and, as a result, did not offset the award granted to Aroma by any amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Aroma appealed the circuit court\u2019s decision to grant Columbian\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on Aroma\u2019s statutory conversion claim. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the circuit court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cuse\u201d was too narrow.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While the panel noted the various definitions of \u201cuse,\u201d it determined that \u201cmost relevant in the context of conversion, \u2018use\u2019 is defined as \u2018to employ for some purpose[.]\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The panel explained that contrary to the circuit court\u2019s conclusion, \u201cdrinking or selling the wine are not the only ways that [Columbian] could have employed [Aroma\u2019s] wine to its own purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because Aroma \u201cpresented some evidence to support its theory that [Columbian] filled the temperature-controlled storage space that [Aroma\u2019s] wine was moved out of with other customers\u2019 products,\u201d and because Columbian\u2019s claim that it was engaged in an expansion project \u201citself could be considered an act of employing the wine to [its] own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>purposes,\u201d Columbian was not entitled to a directed verdict.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rather, the panel concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">[i]f a jury believed the evidence showing that [Columbian] moved [Aroma\u2019s] wine for its own purposes\u2014whether it be to sell the space to other customers or complete a construction project\u2014or that it used the wine as leverage against [Aroma], it could have determined that [Columbian] converted the wine to its own use!<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">As a result, the Court of Appeals remanded this case to the circuit court for such a jury determination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Both parties then sought leave to appeal the Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of \u201cown use.\u201d Aroma\u2019s appeal (Docket No. 148907) claimed that, like the circuit court, the Court of Appeals had erroneously defined statutory conversion as containing an additional element beyond those required to show common-law conversion. On this theory, and on the basis of the jury\u2019s finding of common-law conversion at trial, no further proceedings on the question of statutory conversion would be necessary and Columbian would be liable for statutory conversion. Columbian agreed with the Court of Appeals that statutory conversion requires a separate finding that the conversion was to the converter\u2019s \u201cown use,\u201d but filed a separate application for leave to appeal (Docket No. 148909) that sought to reinstate the circuit court\u2019s narrower definition of \u201cown use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">We granted both parties\u2019 applications for leave to appeal, limited to the single issue regarding \u201cthe proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>interpretation of \u2018converting property to the other person\u2019s own use,\u2019 as used in MCL 600.2919a.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">II. standard of review</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">We review de novo a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for a directed verdict.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A party is entitled to a directed verdict if the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, fails to establish a claim as a matter of law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">We also review de novo questions of statutory interpretation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cWhen interpreting a statute, we follow the established rules of statutory construction, the foremost of which is to discern and give effect to the intent of the Legislature.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The language of the statute is the most reliable evidence of that intent, and we enforce the clear and unambiguous language of the statute as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>written.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cEffect should be given to every phrase, clause, and word in the statute and, whenever possible, no word should be treated as surplusage or rendered nugatory.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">III. LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Under the common law, conversion is \u201c \u2018any distinct act of dominion wrongfully exerted over another\u2019s personal property in denial of or inconsistent with his rights therein.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> At issue here is whether a plaintiff who has proved common-law conversion necessarily has a cause of action under MCL 600.2919a(l)(a) and, if not, what additional conduct is required to show that a defendant converted property to his, her, or its own use.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">We begin, then, with the text of MCL 600.2919a, which states in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">(1) A person damaged as a result of either or both of the following may recover 3 times the amount of actual damages, plus costs and reasonable attorney fees:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-9\">(a) Another person\u2019s stealing or embezzling property or converting property to the other person\u2019s own use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-10\">(b) Another person\u2019s buying, receiving, possessing, concealing, or aiding in the concealment of stolen, embezzled, or converted property when the person buying, receiving, possessing, concealing, or aiding in the concealment of stolen, embezzled, or converted property knew that the property was stolen, embezzled, or converted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>(2) The remedy provided by this section is in addition to any other right or remedy the person may have at law or otherwise.[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-3\">Aroma\u2019s second amended complaint alleges that Columbian \u201cconverted [Aroma\u2019s] wine inventory to its own use\u201d and that, as a result, MCL 600.2919a(l)(a) \u201capplies to the facts of this case.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Words in a statute are interpreted \u201caccording to the common and approved usage of the language,\u201d but \u201ctechnical words and phrases, and such as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, shall be construed and understood according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In addition, \u201cwhen the Legislature chooses to employ a common-law term without indicating an intent to alter the common law, the term will be interpreted consistent with its common-law meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The word \u201cconverting,\u201d used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>in MCL 600.2919a(l)(a), is one word that has acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law because it is derived from the common-law tort identified above and is used in that context here.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Nevertheless, that is only the beginning of our analysis of the phrase \u201cconverting property to the other person\u2019s own use.\u201d Aroma claims that the jury\u2019s verdict against Columbian for common-law conversion necessarily means that Columbian had violated its statutory counterpart, namely, MCL 600.2919a(l)(a). Under this theory, common-law conversion originated as \u201cconversion to the other person\u2019s own use\u201d and, as a result, the Legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cconverting to the other person\u2019s own use\u201d simply identified common-law conversion as, by itself, sufficient to establish a defendant\u2019s fault for purposes of MCL 600.2919a(l)(a). To assess the validity of this argument we turn to the history of common-law conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">A. COMMON-LAW CONVERSION</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">According to Blackstone, several distinct actions in tort originated from the principle that \u201cif an acquisition of goods by either force or fraud were allowed to be a sufficient title, all property would soon be confined to the most strong, or the most cunning\u201d and all other people \u201ccould never be secure of their possessions.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The common law secures this right to personal property by allowing someone wrongfully deprived of his or her property to recover either that property or monetary damages, or both, for the wrongful deprivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Three distinct causes of action are relevant to our analysis. Each arose out of the distinct ways that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>wrongful deprivation could occur. Someone who wrongfully took property was liable in trespass to the property owner.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Someone who wrongfully detained property that came to that person legally was liable in detinue to the property owner.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Someone who refused to return lost property to its rightful owner, instead using it himself or herself or disposing of it to another, was liable in trover.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> This latter cause of action, arising out of the finder\u2019s <em>conversion </em>of the property, was \u201cinvented through the ingenuity of some long forgotten common law pleader\u201d who sought \u201cto fill in the gaps left by the actions of trespass . . . and detinue .. . .\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\">Correspondingly, Blackstone explained the origin of trover as allowing the \u201crecovery of damages against such person as had found another\u2019s goods, and refused to deliver them on demand, but converted them to his own use.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In a technical sense, trover was originally actionable only when the property was \u201clost to the true owner\u201d in perpetuity, because to convert goods meant to dispose of them, that is, \u201cto make away with them, to deal with them in such a way that neither owner nor wrongdoer had. any further possession of them; for example, by consuming them, or by destroying them, or by selling them, or otherwise delivering them to some third person.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> \u201c[M]ere detention\u201d of another person\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>property \u201cis not a conversion in the original sense.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Nevertheless, \u201c[a]lmost from the beginning. . . the effort was made to expand trover into the field of the wrongful detention of chattels [that were] not found.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> A plaintiff who brought an action for trover was able to claim that the defendant refused to deliver property upon the plaintiffs demand as \u201cevidence of a conversion\u2014evidence, that is to say, that the defendant has already made away with the property and therefore cannot and does not restore it.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Eventually, \u201c[j]uries were directed as a matter of law to find a conversion on proof of demand and refusal without lawful justification.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Before the turn of the twentieth century, the meaning of conversion as originally understood at common law began to evolve. Justice COOLEY\u2019s treatise on torts defined conversion as \u201c[a]ny distinct act of dominion wrongfully exerted over one\u2019s property in denial of his right, or inconsistent with it. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Importantly, Justice COOLEY quoted Georgia caselaw from 1846 for the proposition that \u201c \u2018it is not necessary that it should be shown that he has applied [the converted property] to his own use.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> While \u201cit is a conversion where one takes the plaintiffs property and sells or otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>disposes of it, it is equally a conversion if he takes it for a temporary purpose only, if in disregard of the plaintiffs right[,] .. . though he return [the property] to the owner.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">This Court\u2019s conversion caselaw bears out this development in the common law. Justice COOLEY\u2019s 1874 decision for this Court in <em>Kreiter v Nichols </em>involved the conversion of beer and emphasized that if someone \u201cconverts [beer] to his own use in any form, a civil action will lie to recover from him the value,\u201d and \u201cthis civil action would not depend in any degree upon the method or purpose of the conversion.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In explaining that conversion of beer to the other person\u2019s \u201cown use\u201d was broad in purpose, the Court observed that \u201cthe legal responsibility to pay for [the beer\u2019s] value would be the same\u201d whether the converter \u201cdestroyed [it] from a belief in its deleterious effects, or made way with [it] in carousals or private drinking. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> By 1884, Justice COOLEY\u2019s decision for this Court in <em>Daggett v Davis </em>recognized that under certain circumstances, there may be \u201ca technical conversion. . . , though no use was made of the\u201d property.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Under those circumstances, a plaintiff is \u201centitled to recover only his actual damages,\u201d not the full value of the property.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">From this development in the common law, the scope of a common-law conversion is now well-settled in Michigan law as \u201c \u2018any distinct act of dominion wrong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>fully exerted over another\u2019s personal property in denial of or inconsistent with his rights therein.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> More recently, <em>Thoma v Tracy Motor Sales, Inc </em>reaffirmed this definition of conversion and adopted the Restatement of Torts to illustrate examples of \u201cthe ways in which a conversion may be committed.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The excerpt adopted by the Court states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-3\">\u201cA conversion may be committed by</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\">\u201c(a) intentionally dispossessing another of a chattel,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">\u201c(b) intentionally destroying or altering a chattel in the actor\u2019s possession,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">\u201c(c) using a chattel in the actor\u2019s possession without authority so to use it,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">\u201c(d) receiving a chattel pursuant to a sale, lease, pledge, gift or other transaction intending to acquire for himself or for another a proprietary interest in it,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">\u201c(e) disposing of a chattel by sale, lease, pledge, gift or other transaction intending to transfer a proprietary interest in it,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">\u201c(f) misdelivering a chattel, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-10\">\u201c(g) refusing to surrender a chattel on demand.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>43</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">These examples crystallize the common law\u2019s development over the centuries to encompass many different ways in which property may be converted, beyond the original meaning of finding lost property and converting that property to the converter\u2019s own use. In addition to the Restatement\u2019s example, this Court has held that a sheriff or court officer who unlawfully seizes personal property is, in the absence of governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>immunity, liable for conversion, even if he or she does so in the execution of a court order.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\">To summarize: While the tort of conversion originally required a separate showing that the converter made some use of the property that amounted to a total deprivation of that property to its owner, by the twentieth century common-law conversion more broadly encompassed any conduct inconsistent with the owner\u2019s property rights. In this context, the Legislature enacted MCL 600.2919a, to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">B. STATUTORY CONVERSION</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">For most of Michigan\u2019s history, conversion was a tort for which the only redress was an action at common law. Indeed, when the Legislature first enacted what we now refer to as the statutory conversion remedy, in 1976, its terms did not provide a separate remedy against a converter. As originally enacted, MCL 600.2919a stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">A person damaged as a result of another person\u2019s buying, receiving, or aiding in the concealment of any stolen, embezzled, or converted property when the person buying, receiving, or aiding in the concealment of any stolen, embezzled, or converted property knew that the property was stolen, embezzled, or converted may recover 3 times the amount of actual damages sustained, plus costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.

This shift in the common law occurred long before the Legislature\u2019s 2005 amendments of MCL 600.2919a. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>a result, the Legislature\u2019s inclusion of the phrase \u201cto the other person\u2019s own use\u201d in \u00a7 2919a(l)(a) indicates its intent to limit \u00a7 2919a(l)(a) to a subset of common-law conversions in which the common-law conversion was to the other person\u2019s \u201cown use.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">The Court of Appeals did not specifically address whether an additional element is required to transform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>common-law conversion into conversion to the other person\u2019s \u201cown use\u201d pursuant to MCL 600.2919a(l)(a). However, implicit in its analysis is that a plaintiff seeking treble damages pursuant to \u00a7 2919a(l)(a) must \u201cpresento evidence that the conversion was to defendant\u2019s \u2018own use\u2019 as required by MCL 600.2919a(l)(a).\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Similarly, Aroma\u2019s counsel in opposition to the motion for directed verdict also presumed that common-law conversion \u201chas a slightly different standard\u201d than \u00a7 2919a(l)(a). We turn now to the scope of that difference <em>\u2014what </em>conduct satisfies the additional statutory requirement that the conversion was to the other person\u2019s \u201cown use.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-3\">C. DEFINITION OF \u201cOWN USE\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">The word \u201cuse\u201d is one of the most common words in the English language<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> and conveys different shades of meaning as either a noun (as in, \u201can object\u2019s <em>use\u201d) </em>or a verb (as in, \u201cto <em>use </em>an object\u201d). Within the phrase \u201cconverting property to the other person\u2019s own use,\u201d the word \u201cuse\u201d is employed as a noun. <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>identifies many different definitions and senses of the word \u201cuse\u201d as a noun, including the following most relevant within the context of MCL 600.2919a(l)(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">1 a : the act or practice of employing something : EMPLOYMENT, APPLICATION &lt;he made good ~ of his spare time&gt; b : the fact or state of being used &lt;a dish in daily ~ &gt; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">2 a (1): habitual or customary usage (2): an individual habit or group eustom[.][<footnotemark>53</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Columbian proffered, and the circuit court adopted, a narrow definition of \u201cuse\u201d focused on the intended purpose of the converted property, such as the definition of the word as \u201chabitual or customary usage\u201d quoted above. Under this definition, to convert Aroma\u2019s wine to Columbian\u2019s \u201cown use\u201d means that \u201cone would have to drink it or perhaps sell it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\">In reversing the circuit court\u2019s decision, the Court of Appeals held that \u201cthe definition of \u2018use\u2019 encompasses a much broader meaning\u201d than the circuit court\u2019s definition allows.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Under the Court of Appeals\u2019 preferred definition, \u201cuse\u201d \u201crequires only that a person \u2018employ for some purpose . . . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> As a result, converting to the other person\u2019s \u201cown use\u201d means merely that a defendant \u201cemploy[s]\u201d another person\u2019s property for any purpose, as long as it is \u201cto [the defendant\u2019s] own purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The Court of Appeals thus implicitly acknowledged the placement of the word \u201cuse\u201d within MCL 600.2919a(l)(a). In particular, the word \u201cown\u201d modifies \u201cuse,\u201d suggesting that any use of the converted property must be intentionally geared toward a purpose personal to the person converting the property. When examining the phrase \u201cown use\u201d in this light, it becomes clear that the Legislature did not seek to restrict the application of MCL 600.2919a(l)(a) on the basis of the intended or common purpose of the converted property. Rather, the only restriction to the application of MCL 600.2919a(l)(a) to a common-law conversion offense is that it must be used for a purpose personal to the converter. Therefore, we agree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 definition of \u201cuse\u201d and hold that conversion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>\u201cto the other person\u2019s own use\u201d requires a showing that the defendant employed the converted property for some purpose personal to the defendant\u2019s interests, even if that purpose is not the object\u2019s ordinarily intended purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">This broad definition of \u201cown use\u201d finds support in our early conversion caselaw. As explained earlier, in <em>Kreiter, </em>this Court held that conversion to someone\u2019s own use need not be geared toward the intended purpose of the converted property and held that a converter of beer was liable regardless of whether he or she \u201cdestroyed [it] from a belief in its deleterious effects, or made way with [it] in carousals or private drinking.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Similarly, our precedent also illustrates that not every common-law conversion is to the converter\u2019s \u201cown use,\u201d and therefore that additional language is not surplusage. For instance, this Court has also held that, leaving aside any potential governmental immunity defenses, a sheriff or court officer is liable for conversion if he or she unlawfully seizes personal property pursuant to a court order.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> While the sheriff has converted that property, the sheriff has not converted the property to his or her \u201cown use\u201d within the meaning of MCL 600.2919a(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Accordingly, we agree with the Court of Appeals that someone alleging conversion to the defendant\u2019s \u201cown use\u201d under MCL 600.2919a(l)(a) must show that the defendant employed the converted property for some purpose personal to the defendant\u2019s interests, even if that purpose is not the object\u2019s ordinarily intended purpose. We now turn to the specific evidence presented in this case to determine whether Columbian is entitled to a directed verdict on Aroma\u2019s statutory conversion claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>IV APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\">In determining whether the circuit court properly granted Columbian\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on Aroma\u2019s statutory conversion claim, we reiterate that we are not making any factual determinations, only whether sufficient evidence has been presented for the fact-finder\u2014in this case, the jury\u2014to conclude that Columbian converted Aroma\u2019s wine to its \u201cown use,\u201d that is, for some purpose personal to Columbian.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Under this standard, our application of MCL 600.2919a(l)(a) is straightforward. Whether Columbian committed a <em>common-law </em>conversion is not at issue here, for the jury has already decided that question against Columbian. In arguing that it did not commit <em>statutory </em>conversion, Columbian claims that it moved the wine from its temperature-controlled storage area to complete a renovation project at its warehouse. Even considering just this admission, we agree with the Court of Appeals that a jury could consider \u201cthe act of moving plaintiffs wine contrary to the contract in order to undertake an expansion project to benefit itself\u201d to be \u201can act of employing the wine to [Columbian\u2019s] own purposes constituting \u2018use\u2019 of the wine.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Moreover, Aroma proffered various e-mails between its owner and Columbian\u2019s employees to support its claim that Columbian limited Aroma\u2019s access to its wine during a period when Columbian declared Aroma\u2019s account to be delinquent. Furthermore, the Court of Appeals also observed that Aroma proffered evidence that, if believed, would allow a jury to conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>that Columbian \u201cfilled the temperature-controlled storage space . .. with other customers\u2019 products.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> As a result,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-4\">[i]f a jury believed the evidence showing that defendant moved plaintiffs wine for its own purposes\u2014-whether it be to sell the space to other customers or complete a construction project\u2014or that it used the wine as leverage against plaintiff, it could have determined that defendant converted the wine to its own use.[<footnotemark>62</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Therefore, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the circuit court erred when it granted Columbian\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on Aroma\u2019s statutory conversion claim. Aroma presented evidence during its case-in-chief that would allow a jury to find that Columbian converted Aroma\u2019s property to its own use within the meaning of MCL 600.2919a(l)(a). As a result, Columbian is not entitled to a directed verdict on Aroma\u2019s statutory conversion claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Although its language is rooted in common-law conversion, the tort established in MCL 600.2919a(l)(a) is not the same as common-law conversion. Rather, the separate statutory cause of action for conversion \u201cto the other person\u2019s own use\u201d requires a showing that the defendant employed the converted property for some purpose personal to the defendant\u2019s interests, even if that purpose is not the object\u2019s ordinarily intended purpose. Aroma has alleged facts that, if believed by a jury, would indicate Columbian\u2019s conversion of Aroma\u2019s wine for its own purposes. Therefore, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that Columbian is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>entitled to a directed verdict on Aroma\u2019s statutory conversion claim and remand this case to the Kent Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b596-5\">YOUNG, C.J., and MARKMAN, ZAHRA, MCCORMACK, Viviano, and Bernstein, JJ., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-9\"> MCL 600.2919a(2).

As a result, the Legislature had a range of options open to it when it decided to enact policy that expanded \u00a7 2919a to encompass additional conduct, and it chose one of those options by requiring a victim of conversion to show that the conversion was to the other person\u2019s \u201cown use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Moreover, as a matter of statutory interpretation, Aroma\u2019s reading of the statute in light of the House legislative analysis is faulty on two levels. First, the language of the amended MCL 600.2919a is unambiguous and, as a result, the examination of legislative history \u201cof any form\u201d is not proper. <em>In re Certified Question from, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, </em>468 Mich 109, 115 n 5; 659 NW2d 597 (2003). Second, even if legislative history were relevant to the interpretation of MCL 600.2919a, legislative analyses</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">are entitled to little judicial consideration in resolving ambiguous statutory provisions because: (1) such analyses are not an official form of legislative record in Michigan, (2) such analyses do not purport to represent the views of legislators, individually or collectively, but merely to set forth the views of professional staff offices situated within the legislative branch, and (3) such analyses are produced outside the boundaries of the legislative process as defined in the Michigan Constitution, and which is a prerequisite for the enactment of a law. <em>[Id., </em>citing Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 26 and 33.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b590-5\"> <em>Aroma Wines, </em>303 Mich App at 447. Although the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion in this case is the first published decision to interpret the amended version of MCL 600.2919a, Aroma claims that several unpublished decisions of the Court of Appeals support its assertion that common-law conversion and conversion to the other person\u2019s \u201cown use\u201d are synonymous. We address these cases for the sake of completeness and to observe that none of these cases withstands scrutiny even as merely persuasive authority. See MCR 7.215(C)(1) (\u201cAn unpublished opinion is not precedentially binding under the rule of stare decisis.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Three of Aroma\u2019s cited cases concluded that no common-law conversion occurred, so they can only stand for the uncontroversial principle that common-law conversion is a threshold to conversion to the other person\u2019s own use. See <em>Victory Estates LLC v NPB Mortgage LLC, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued November 20, 2012 (Docket No. 307457); <em>Paul v Paul, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued December 17, 2013 (Docket No. 311609); <em>Armstrong v O\u2019Hare, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued April 22,2014 (Docket No. 308635). A fourth case, <em>JP Morgan Chase Bank v Jackson GR, Inc, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued July 15, 2014 (Docket No. 311650), simply held that treble damages are unavailable when no damages occurred in the first place or would not have even been contested. Other cases did not discuss the \u201cown use\u201d language of \u00a7 2919a(l)(a), presumably because the issue was not raised. See <em>J Franklin Interests, LLC v Meng, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued September 29, 2011 (Docket No. 296525); <em>Stockbridge Capital, LLC v Watcke, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued March 4, 2014 (Docket No. 313241).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Finally, Aroma cites <em>J &amp; W Transp, LLC v Frazier, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued June 1,2010 (Docket No. 289711), which bears examining in slightly more detail. There, the panel suggested a two-step process for determining whether a plaintiff could properly assert a statutory conversion claim because it observed that \u201cdefendants failed to return plaintiffs\u2019 property after demand had been made <em>and used property in their possession without the authority to do so.\u201d Id. </em>at 15 (emphasis added). As a result, this decision, far from supporting Aroma\u2019s theory of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u00a7 2919a, actually undercuts it. Nevertheless, none of the unpublished Court of Appeals opinions cited for Aroma\u2019s theory provides this Court with any meaningful analysis of \u00a7 2919a, because the issue has not been squarely presented to any appellate court until this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\"> We further emphasize that the Legislature intended MCL 600.2919a to work alongside the common law by creating a nonexclusive statutory cause of action in addition to other remedies available, including that for common-law conversion.
