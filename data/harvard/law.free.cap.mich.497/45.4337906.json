The statute provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[g]overnmental agencies shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>liable for bodily injury . . . resulting from the negligent operation by any officer, agent, or employee of the governmental agency, of a motor vehicle of which the governmental agency is owner .. . ,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, we must address whether the phrase \u201cliable for bodily injury\u201d allows for recovery of economic damages, such as work-loss damages, and noneconomic damages, such as pain and suffering or emotional distress damages. The Court of Appeals in <em>Hannay v Dep\u2019t of Transp </em>concluded that economic damages are compensable under the motor vehicle exception,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> while the Court of Appeals in <em>Hunter v Sisco </em>concluded that noneconomic damages are not compensable under this exception.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">We conclude that the phrase \u201cliable for bodily injury\u201d contained in the motor vehicle exception means legally responsible for damages flowing from a physical or corporeal injury to the body. More simply, \u201cbodily injury\u201d is merely the category of harm for which governmental immunity from tort liability is waived under MCL 691.1405 and for which damages that naturally flow are compensable. Moreover, the restrictions on damages recoverable in third-party tort actions involving motor vehicle accidents set forth in MCL 500.3135 of the no-fault act, MCL 500.3101 <em>et seq., </em>apply to cases permitted by the waiver of governmental immunity provided for in the motor vehicle exception. We therefore hold that a plaintiff may bring a third-party tort action for economic damages, such as work-loss damages, and noneconomic damages, such as pain and suffering or emotional distress damages, against a governmental entity if the requirements of MCL 500.3135 have been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Because we conclude that work-loss damages are compensable under the motor vehicle exception, we must also address a second issue presented in <em>Hannay: </em>whether the facts as found were sufficient to satisfy the statutory language defining work-loss damages with respect to plaintiffs claim of work loss as a dental hygienist. Plaintiff, a 22-year-old employed in a dental office, aspired to be a dental hygienist.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiff had previously applied for admission to a dental hygienist program at Lansing Community College (LCC), but she was not admitted to the program. Plaintiff intended to enhance her application and reapply to the program, but she had not been accepted at the time of her injury. Her employer and his wife, a hygienist in his office, testified that plaintiff would have gained admission to the program and that they would have employed plaintiff as a hygienist after she completed her education and obtained her license. Notwithstanding this testimony, we conclude that it is simply too tenuous a proposition to conclude that the work-loss damages in dispute were a legal and natural consequence of the tortious conduct. Instead, these damages are contingent and speculative, rendering plaintiffs claim for work-loss damages barred under Michigan law to the extent that her claim is based on potential wages as a dental hygienist.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">In <em>Hannay </em>we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding with respect to the type of damages recoverable for bodily injury under the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity, MCL 691.1405, but we reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding that plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to support her claim for work-loss damages as a dental hygienist. In <em>Hunter </em>we reverse the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Appeals\u2019 holding with respect to the type of damages recoverable for bodily injury under the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity, MCL 691.1405. We remand both cases to the respective trial courts for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"Ap\">A. <em>HANNAY-</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">This matter arises from a February 13, 2007 motor vehicle accident involving a vehicle driven by plaintiff Heather Hannay and a salt truck owned by defendant Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) and driven by MDOT\u2019s employee, Brian Silcox. Silcox failed to stop at a stop sign, and the salt truck collided with plaintiffs vehicle. Plaintiff alleged that Silcox<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and MDOT, as Silcox\u2019s employer and the owner of the salt truck, were hable for damages caused by Silcox\u2019s negligence. Plaintiff alleged injuries to her shoulders, neck, spine, back, head, chest, arms, knees, and other internal and external injuries to her body. Plaintiff claimed all economic damages compensable under the no-fault act, but specifically alleged allowable expenses and work loss in excess of the statutoiy limitations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> MDOT raised governmental immunity as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Following a bench trial, the trial court concluded that MDOT was liable for work-loss damages exceeding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>statutory limitations under the no-fault act and that plaintiff was entitled to work-loss damages as a dental hygienist earning $28 per hour.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In reaching its conclusion, the court found that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that plaintiff would \u201chave been admitted into the Dental Hygienist program at LCC,\u201d that it was \u201cmore likely than not [that she would] have successfully completed the program,\u201d and that plaintiff had proven part-time, but not full-time, employment of three days a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the trial court did not err by awarding plaintiff economic damages and that the trial court\u2019s factual findings supported the calculation of plaintiffs work-loss award.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Regarding the trial court\u2019s conclusion that work-loss damages were recoverable against a governmental entity in light of the motor vehicle exception, the Court of Appeals held that \u201cthe bodily injury that must be incurred to maintain an action against a governmental entity and the items of damages recoverable from those injuries are separate and distinct from one another.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the panel concluded that \u201cwork-loss benefits .. . that exceed the statutory personal protection insurance benefit maximum pursuant to MCL 500.3135(3) are awardable against governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>entities . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The panel characterized work-loss damages as \u201citems of damages that arise from the bodily injuries suffered by plaintiff,\u201d and explained that \u201c[t]o hold otherwise would conflate the actual bodily-injury requirement for maintaining a motor vehicle cause of action against a governmental entity with the types of damages recoverable as a result of the bodily injury.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">B. <em>HUNTER</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">This matter arises from a July 20, 2009 motor vehicle accident involving plaintiff Harold Hunter, Jr., and a dump truck owned by defendant City of Flint Transportation Department (Flint) and driven by Flint\u2019s employee, defendant David Sisco.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Flint\u2019s vehicle sideswiped plaintiffs vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Plaintiff sued Flint as the employer of Sisco and owner of the dump truck and independently for negligent entrustment of a motor vehicle. Plaintiff alleged that the injuries he suffered amounted to a serious impairment of a bodily function, a permanent and serious disfigurement, and a serious neurological defect (closed-head injury). According to plaintiff, he suffered injuries to his spine as a result of the accident. Plaintiff alleged noneconomic damages, namely, pain and suffering, as well as shock and emotional damages.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Flint raised governmental immunity as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Flint filed a motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(7) and (10), asserting that plaintiff could not succeed in a claim against Flint because the damages he sought were not compensable under the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity and that plaintiff failed to establish that he suffered a threshold injuxy under the no-fault act. Flint\u2019s position was that because plaintiffs no-fault provider was liable for economic damages under the no-fault act, and because the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity does not allow for recovery of noneconomic damages, the claim against Flint should be dismissed. The trial court denied Flint\u2019s motion for summary disposition, concluding that \u201cbodily injury\u201d encompasses noneconomic damages associated with bodily injury and finding that there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether plaintiff suffered a serious impairment of a bodily function that was caused by the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion for summary disposition in part, holding that noneconomic damages \u201care precluded under MCL 691.1405 because a governmental agency may only be liable for \u2018bodily injury\u2019 and \u2018property damage,\u2019 \u201d and noneconomic damages \u201cdo not constitute physical injury to the body and do not fall within the motor vehicle exception.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>in light of the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in <em>Hannay, </em>but the panel denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The meaning of the phrase \u201cliable for bodily injury\u201d is an issue of statutory interpretation, which this Court reviews de novo.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The role of this Court in interpreting statutory language is to \u201cascertain the legislative intent that may reasonably be inferred from the words in a statute.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In doing so, \u201c[c]ourts must give effect to every word, phrase, and clause in a statute and avoid an interpretation that renders nugatory or surplusage any part of a statute.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">When construing a statute, we consider the statute\u2019s plain language, and we enforce clear and unambiguous language as written. While terms must be construed according to their plain and ordinary meaning, words and phrases as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, shall be construed and understood according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning.[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">\u201c[W]ords and phrases used in an act should be read in context with the entire act and assigned such meanings as to harmonize with the act as a whole,\u201d and \u201ca word or phrase should be given meaning by its context or setting.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">While this Court reviews a trial court\u2019s factual findings, such as those used to calculate a damages award, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>for clear error,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we review de novo the applicability of those facts to the law.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Moreover, when a party files suit against a governmental agency, it is the burden of that party to plead \u201chis or her claim in avoidance of governmental immunity.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> A party can bring a motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(7), as was the case in <em>Hunter, </em>on the ground that the claim is barred by governmental immunity.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Plaintiff Hunter also filed a motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(0(10), which is appropriate when, \u201c[ejxcept as to the amount of damages, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment or partial judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> This Court reviews de novo decisions regarding motions for summary disposition.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">A. THE GOVERNMENTAL TORT LIABILITY ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Sovereign immunity and governmental immunity, while related concepts, are not synonymous.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> \u201cSovereign immunity refers to the immunity of the state from suit and from liability, while governmental immunity refers to the similar immunities enjoyed by the state\u2019s political subdivisions.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> As we recently explained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>In re Bradley Estate, </em>the GTLA replaced and was preceded by Michigan jurisprudence, dating back to 1837, \u201crecognizing] the preexisting common-law concept of sovereign immunity, which immunizes the \u2018sovereign\u2019 state from all suits to which the state has not consented, including suits for tortious acts by the state.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> MCL 691.1407(1) codifies this common-law sovereign immunity concept and \u201climits a governmental agency\u2019s exposure to tort liability.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">However, the GTLA not only provides immunity for the state and its agencies, like defendant MDOT in <em>Hannay, </em>but also provides immunity for the state\u2019s political subdivisions, such as defendant Flint in Hunter.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We explained in <em>Robinson v Lansing </em>that \u201c[i]n Michigan, governmental immunity was originally a common-law doctrine that protected all levels of government.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> However, this Court, in 1961, \u201cabolished common-law governmental immunity with respect to municipalities.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The Legislature reacted by enacting the GTLA in 1964, \u201crestoring immunity for municipalities and preserving this protection for the state and its agencies.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The GTLA provides six exceptions to gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>ernmental immunity, one of which is the motor vehicle exception\u2014the subject of these cases.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">B. THE MOTOR VEHICLE EXCEPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity, MCL 691.1405, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">Governmental agencies <em>shall be liable for bodily injury and property damage </em>resulting from the negligent operation by any officer, agent, or employee of the governmental agency, of a motor vehicle of which the governmental agency is owner, as defined in Act No. 300 of the Public Acts of 1949, as amended, being sections 257.1 to 257.923 of the Compiled Laws of 1948.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">This provision has remained unchanged from its original phrasing when enacted as part of the GTLA in 1964.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The heart of our inquiry is the interpretation of the phrase \u201cliable for bodily injury,\u201d which contains two key components: (1) \u201cliable for\u201d and (2) \u201cbodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">1. \u201cLIABLE FOR\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Our recent decision in <em>Bradley Estate </em>sheds light on the proper interpretation of the phrase \u201cliable for,\u201d though the motor vehicle exception was not at issue in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>that case. Instead, we interpreted the phrase \u201ctort <em>liability </em>\u201d found in the GTLA\u2019s broad grant of immunity, MCL 691.1407(1),<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> which grants immunity to governmental entities from \u201ctort liability if the governmental agency is engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.\u201d Specifically, we were called on to decide whether a particular cause of action sought to impose \u201ctort liability\u201d within the meaning of MCL 691.1407(1), thus, triggering governmental immunity pursuant to that provision.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> We concluded that \u201c \u2018tort\u2019 as used in MCL 691.1407(1) is a noncontractual civil wrong for which a remedy may be obtained in the form of compensatory damages.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Looking at the phrase as a whole, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">Our analysis, however, requires more. MCL 691.1407(1) refers not merely to a \u201ctort,\u201d nor to a \u201ctort claim,\u201d nor to a \u201ctort action,\u201d but to \u201ctort liabilityThe term \u201ctort,\u201d therefore, describes the type of liability from which a governmental agency is immune. As commonly understood, the word \u201cliability,\u201d refers to liableness, i.e., \u201cthe state or quality of being liable.\u201d <em>To be \u201cliable\u201d means to be \u201clegally </em>responsible[.]\u201d Construing the term \u201cliability\u201d along with the term \u201ctort,\u201d it becomes apparent that the Legislature intended <em>\u201ctort liability\u201d to encompass legal responsibility arising from a tort. </em>We therefore hold that \u201ctort liability\u201d as used in MCL 691.1407(1) means all legal responsibility arising from a noncontractual civil wrong for which a remedy may be obtained in the form of compensatory damages.[<footnotemark>39</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Because this Court concluded that \u201cliable\u201d means \u201clegally responsible,\u201d our interpretation of \u201ctort liability\u201d in MCL 691.1407(1) informs how to interpret the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>phrase \u201cliable for\u201d in the motor vehicle exception. We see no reason why this Court\u2019s prior analysis of the word \u201cliability,\u201d which stems from the word \u201cliable,\u201d should not likewise apply in this case, particularly given that the phrases \u201ctort liability\u201d and \u201cliable for\u201d are contained within the same statute\u2014the GTLA.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Thus, the phrase \u201cliable for bodily injury\u201d means <em>legally responsible </em>for bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\">2. \u201cBODILY INJURY\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">We interpreted the phrase \u201cbodily injury\u201d in <em>Wesche v Mecosta Co Rd Comm, </em>specifically within the context of the motor vehicle exception.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The central issue in <em>Wesche </em>was \u201cwhether the motor vehicle exception . .. authorizes a claim for loss of consortium against a governmental agency.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> In analyzing the language of the motor vehicle exception, we stated: \u201cThis language is clear: it imposes liability for \u2018bodily injury\u2019 and \u2018property damage\u2019 resulting from a governmental employee\u2019s negligent operation of a government-owned motor vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Because the GTLA does not define \u201cbodily injury,\u201d this Court resorted to dictionary definitions, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">The word \u201cbodily\u201d means \u201cof or pertaining to the body\u201d or \u201ccorporeal or material, as contrasted with spiritual or mental.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2000). The word \u201cinjury\u201d refers to \u201charm or damage done or sustained, [especially] bodily harm.\u201d <em>Id. Thus, \u201cbodily injury\u201d simply means a physical or corporeal injury to the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number><em>body. </em>It is beyond dispute that a loss of consortium is not a physical injury to a body. A claim for loss of consortium is simply one for loss of society and companionship.. .. Thus, because loss of consortium is a <em>nonphysical injury, </em>it does not fall within the categories of damage for which the motor-vehicle exception waives immunity![<footnotemark>44</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">We see no reason to deviate from our prior analysis. Thus, because we have interpreted \u201cbodily injury\u201d to mean \u201ca physical or corporeal injury to the body,\u201d \u201cliable for bodily injury\u201d means legally responsible for <em>a physical or corporeal injury to the body.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">3. \u201cLIABLE FOR BODILY INJURY\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Our final consideration in looking at the phrase \u201cliable for bodily injury\u201d as a whole is to determine the scope of the liability to which the government is exposed under the motor vehicle exception. Essential to this inquiry is the fundamental difference between an injury and the damages that arise from that injury. This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Henry </em>is instructive for determining the scope of liability in that it delineates this distinction.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> There, we set forth the traditional elements of a negligence action\u2014\u201c(1) duty, (2) breach, (3) causation, and (4) damages\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark>\u2014but explained that \u201cit has always been implicit in this analysis that in order to prevail, a plaintiff must also demonstrate <em>an actual injury to person or property.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>47</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We then made clear that \u201csuch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>injury constitutes the <em>essence of a plaintiffs </em>claim,\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and that \u201cinjury\u201d and \u201cdamages\u201d are distinct from one another, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">While the courts of this state may not have always clearly articulated this injury requirement, <em>nor finely delineated the distinction between an \u201cinjury\u201d and the \u201cdamages\u201d flowing therefrom, </em>the injury requirement has always been present in our negligence analysis. It has simply always been the case in our jurisprudence that plaintiffs alleging negligence claims have also shown that their claims arise from <em>present physical injuries. </em>We are not aware of any Michigan cases in which a plaintiff has recovered on a negligence theory without demonstrating some present physical injury. Thus, in all known cases in Michigan in which a plaintiff has satisfied the \u201cdamages\u201d element of a negligence claim, he has also satisfied the \u201cinjury\u201d requirement.[<footnotemark>49</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Thus, \u201cdamages\u201d and \u201cinjury\u201d are not one and the same\u2014damages <em>flow from </em>the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">In light of this Court\u2019s prior interpretation of \u201ctort liability\u201d in <em>Bradley Estate, </em>this Court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cbodily injury\u201d in <em>Wesche, </em>and this Court\u2019s delineation of the difference between \u201cinjury\u201d and \u201cdamages\u201d in <em>Henry, </em>\u201cliable for bodily injury\u201d in the present case means legally responsible <em>for damages flowing from </em>a physical or corporeal injury to the body. Stated differently, \u201cbodily injury\u201d is simply the category of harm (i.e., the type of injury) for which the government waives immunity under MCL 691.1405 and, thus, for which damages that naturally flow are compensable. Therefore, the legal responsibility that arises from \u201cbodily injury\u201d is responsibility for <em>tort damages </em>that flow from that injury. This conclusion is supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the fact that the GTLA generally grants immunity from \u201ctort liability,\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> and to the extent that this immunity is waived, the resulting liability, logically, is liability for <em>tort damages.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">It is a longstanding principle in this state\u2019s jurisprudence that tort damages generally include damages for all the legal and natural consequences of the injury (i.e., the damages that naturally flow from the injury), which may include damages for loss of the ability to work and earn money, as well as pain and suffering and mental and emotional distress damages. For example, in <em>Sherwood v Chicago &amp; WM R </em>Co,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> this Court approved of a jury instruction that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">In estimating the compensatory damages in cases of this character, <em>all the consequences of the injury, </em>future as well as past, are to be taken into consideration, including the bodily pain, which is shown by the proofs to be reasonably certain to have naturally resulted from the injury. The injured party, when entitled to recover, should be awarded compensation for all the injuries, past and prospective. These are intended to include and embrace indemnity for actual nursing and medical expenses; also for <em>loss of power, or loss of capability to perform ordinary labor, or capacity to earn money, </em>and reasonable satisfaction of physical powers. The elements of damages which the jury are entitled to take into account consist of all effects of the injury complained of, consisting of personal inconvenience, the sickness which the plaintiff endured, the loss of time, <em>all bodily and mental suffering, </em>impairment of capacity to earn money, the pecuniary expenses, the disfigurement or permanent annoyance which is liable to be caused by the deformity resulting from the injury; and, in considering what would be a just sum in compensation for the sufferings or injury, the jury are <em>not only at liberty to consider the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number><em>bodily pain, but the mental suffering, anxiety, suspense, and fright </em>may be treated as elements of the injury for which damages, by way of compensation, should be allowed. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Thus, damages for both a loss of the ability to work and earn money as well as pain, suffering, and emotional distress have long been understood as consequences of an injury for which damages are compensable.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Additionally, in <em>Beath v Rapid R Co, </em>this Court concluded that \u201c[t]he plaintiff was not confined in her recovery to damages sustained by reason of <em>physical pain and anguish suffered, </em>but had the right to recover for the <em>mental pain and anxiety </em>she was compelled to undergo by reason of the injuries sustained,\u201d because \u201cthe shame and mortification which the plaintiff had suffered by being obliged to use crutches\u201d \u201cwas one of the <em>elements of damages which might naturally flow from the injury.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>53</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Moreover, recent caselaw of this Court reiterates this longstanding principle. For example, in <em>Price v High Pointe Oil Co, Inc,</em><footnotemark><em>54</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we noted the general rule regarding recovery of damages in a tort action recognized in <em>Sutter v Biggs</em><footnotemark><em>55</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that \u201cthe tort-feasor is liable for all injuries resulting directly from his wrongful act, whether foreseeable or not, provided the <em>damages are </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number><em>the legal and natural consequences of the wrongful act, </em>and are such as, according to common experience and the usual course of events, might reasonably have been anticipated.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> This body of caselaw collectively demonstrates the longstanding principle that tort damages generally include the damages that naturally flow from the injury, which may include both economic damages, such as damages incurred due to the loss of the ability to work and earn money, as well as noneconomic damages, such as pain and suffering and mental and emotional distress damages.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">As indicated by the <em>Hannay </em>Court of Appeals panel, concluding that \u201cbodily injury\u201d does not include dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>ages naturally flowing from that injury would conflate the requirement of a bodily injury (i.e., the injury requirement recognized in <em>Henry) </em>with the items of damages that are recoverable as a result of that injury (i.e., the damages that naturally flow from the bodily injury). Thus, the statutory language of MCL 691.1405 does not support a conclusion that the Legislature intended to restrict liability to certain items of damages resulting from a bodily injury. Instead, the language only indicates that the Legislature intended to restrict the <em>categories of injury </em>for which the tort damages that naturally flow are compensable. We therefore hold that the phrase \u201cliable for bodily injury\u201d within the motor vehicle exception means that a plaintiff who suffers a bodily injury may recover for items of tort damages that naturally flow from that physical or corporeal injury to the body, which may include both economic and non-economic damages. As discussed later in this opinion, however, the scope of these damages is limited by the no-fault act.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">4. \u201cBODILY INJURY\u201d IS A TERM OF ART IN MICHIGAN JURISPRUDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Our analysis interpreting the phrase \u201cliable for bodily injury\u201d gains further support from our state\u2019s history of governmental-immunity legislation, which indicates that \u201cbodily injury\u201d is a term of art used by the Legislature in the context of governmental immunity to refer to a category of injury for which damages that naturally flow are compensable, as long as those damages are properly pleaded. As a legal term of art, \u201cbodily injury\u201d is a technical phrase that has \u201cacquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law\u201d and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>therefore, \u201cshall be construed and understood according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">This phrase appeared in the context of governmental immunity in 1861 in the first version of the highway exception. Public Act 197 of 1861 provided</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">[t]hat any person or persons sustaining <em>bodily injury </em>upon any of the public highways in this State, by reason of neglect to keep in repair any bridge or culvert, by any township or corporation whose duty it is to keep such bridge or culvert in repair, such township or corporation <em>shall be liable to, and shall pay </em>to the person or persons so injured or disabled, <em>just damages, </em>to be recovered in an action of trespass on the case, before any court of competent jurisdiction.[<footnotemark>60</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The 1885<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> and 1887 versions of the highway exception added sidewalks to the list of structures for which there was a duty to keep in repair.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Therefore, as far back as 1861, the phrase \u201cbodily injury\u201d was used by the Legislature to connote a category of injury for which damages\u2014specifically, \u201cjust damages\u201d\u2014were compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Our decisions implicating these early versions of the highway exception urge a consistent interpretation in this case. For example, regarding damages because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>an inability to work, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Moore v Kalamazoo </em>is instructive.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> In that case, the plaintiff was injured due to a defective sidewalk, and the trial court instructed that the jury \u201cshould take into account her <em>past earnings. . . during the time that she has already been injured, </em>and the time that you find, from the evidence, that she will <em>remain incapable of earning anything in the future . . </em>. .\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> This Court concluded that the allegations were sufficient to warrant admission of the proofs of damages and the instruction given.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> This case made clear that the damages that were recoverable as a result of a bodily injury included damages resulting from an inability to work that flow from the injury, if properly alleged.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>In another example, this Court\u2019s 1894 decision in <em>Roberts v Detroit </em>demonstrated that pain and suffering damages, like damages resulting from an inability to work, were recoverable for a bodily injury in the context of the highway exception.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The plaintiff sought loss-of-consortium damages from the city of Detroit that resulted from injuries his wife incurred due to falling on a defective sidewalk. The issue was whether the highway exception applied to provide the plaintiff a cause of action in light of the fact that it was the plaintiffs <em>wife </em>who was physically injured, rather than the plaintiff himself.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> This Court stated, \u201c[s]o far as [the highway exception] is concerned, it limits the liability <em>to cases of bodily injury,\u201d </em>and concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">The plaintiffs case does not fall within [the highway-exception] (1) because he has no right to recover for the <em>bodily injury\u2014i.e., pain and suffering, </em>etc\u2014of another; (2) because the statute in terms limits the recovery to the person so injured or disabled/[<footnotemark>69</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">It is clear from <em>Roberts </em>that had the plaintiff, rather than his wife, suffered a bodily injury, damages naturally flowing from that injury would have been recoverable under the highway exception, including damages for \u201cpain and suffering.\u201d Further, this case demonstrates that while damages that naturally flowed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the injury were compensable, the person seeking such damages must have had a <em>bodily injury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">More generally, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hall v City of Cadillac </em>demonstrated that damages that were the natural consequence of a bodily injury were recoverable.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> <em>Hall </em>involved a city\u2019s failure to keep a sidewalk in reasonable repair, which resulted in bodily injury to the plaintiff, and this Court reviewed the instructions to the jury.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> This Court concluded in relevant part that the trial court properly instructed the jury that <em>\u201cdamages for the injury suffered and its natural consequences </em>were recoverable, up to the time of trial, together with such prospective damages of like character as were reasonably probable .. . .\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Thus, damages that were a natural consequence of the bodily injury were recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In light of the foregoing, by the time the phrase \u201cbodily injury\u201d appeared in the 1964 version of the motor vehicle exception,<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> that phrase long had a settled meaning in Michigan law. \u201cBodily injury\u201d was understood to be a category of injury for which damages that were the natural consequence flowed, including both damages resulting from an inability to work, as well as pain and suffering, so long as those damages were properly pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">5. THE <em>HUNTER </em>COURT\u2019S RELIANCE ON <em>WESCHE </em>IS MISPLACED</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Hunter </em>relied in part on Wesche\u2019s definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d in concluding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>because noneconomic damages do not constitute a physical injury, such damages are not compensable under the motor vehicle exception.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> The panel first looked to <em>Wesche </em>and agreed with this Court\u2019s conclusion that the term \u201cliable for bodily injury\u201d does not create a threshold requirement, explaining, \u201c[h]ad the Legislature intended to simply create a threshold that, once established, would permit noneconomic or emotional damages, it would have done so explicitly .. . .\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> The panel determined that the <em>Wesche </em>definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d was correct, and based on that definition, concluded that damages for pain and suffering as well as shock and emotional-distress damages do not constitute a \u201cbodily injury\u201d that is compensable under the motor vehicle exception.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">We agree with the <em>Hunter </em>panel only to the extent that it concluded that <em>Wesche </em>correctly defined \u201cbodily injury.\u201d We concluded in <em>Wesche </em>that the motor vehicle exception does not waive governmental immunity for loss-of-consortium claims, reasoning that \u201ca loss of consortium is not a physical injury to a body,\u201d and while \u201ca loss-of-consortium claim is derivative of the underlying bodily injury, it is nonetheless regarded as <em>a separate cause of action </em>and <em>not merely an item of damages.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>77</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We concluded that the motor vehicle exception \u201cdoes not state or suggest that governmental agencies are liable for <em>any </em>damages once a plaintiff makes a threshold showing of bodily injury or property damage.\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> Unlike provisions of the no-fault act that create a statutory threshold, such as MCL 500.3135(1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>MCL 691.1405 \u201ccontains no such language.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> Instead, \u201c[i]t merely provides that governmental agencies \u2018shall be liable for bodily injuiy and property <em>damage\u2019 </em>and says nothing to suggest that <em>a separate cause of action, </em>such as one for loss of consortium, may be asserted once a threshold of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 has been met.\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> For these reasons, this Court held \u201cthat a loss of consortium is not a \u2018bodily injuiy\u2019 \u201d and therefore, governmental entities are entitled to governmental immunity for loss-of-consortium claims.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">We disagree with the <em>Hunter </em>panel\u2019s construction of <em>Wesche </em>because it conflates injury with damages. We stated in <em>Wesche </em>that \u201c[t]he waiver of immunity is limited to two categories of <em>damage: </em>bodily injury and property damage.\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Notably, the word \u201cdamage\u201d in the singular has a very different meaning than the plural word <em>\u201cdamages.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defines \u201cdamage\u201d as \u201c[l]oss or injury to person or property &lt; actionable damage resulting from negligence&gt;,\u201d and \u201cdamages\u201d as \u201c[m]oney claimed by, or ordered to be paid to, a person as compensation for loss or injuiy &lt;the plaintiff seeks $8,000 in damages from the defendant &gt;.\u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals in <em>Hunter </em>ostensibly read the word \u201cdamage\u201d in our opinion in <em>Wesche </em>to mean \u201cdamages,\u201d which was an error.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Moreover, our decision in <em>Wesche </em>focused on the fact that a loss of consortium does <em>not </em>constitute an \u201citem of damages\u201d because it is not a claim for bodily injury.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Thus, it can be inferred from our decision that items of damages naturally flowing from a bodily injury are compensable. Our conclusion in <em>Wesche </em>that a bodily injury is not a threshold requirement that, once met, permits recovery of all potential damages and that, instead, a plaintiff seeking damages for a bodily injury must have actually suffered a bodily injury, is consistent with this Court\u2019s decision in Roberts:<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> The <em>Roberts </em>decision made clear that a plaintiff cannot seek damages for a bodily injury when the requested damages resulted from the bodily injury of another.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> We therefore reaffirm that \u201cbodily injury\u201d in the motor vehicle exception is not a threshold requirement that opens all doors of potential liability for tort damages; rather, it is a <em>category </em>of injury for which items of tort damages that naturally flow are available, as confined by the limitations of the no-fault act.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">6. DAMAGES COMPENSABLE UNDER THE MOTOR VEHICLE EXCEPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Our analysis, however, does not end with our interpretation of the phrase \u201cliable for bodily injury\u201d within the motor vehicle exception. While governmental entities are legally responsible for damages naturally flowing from a physical or corporeal injury to the body under the language of the motor vehicle exception, this liability is <em>limited </em>by the no-fault act, which generally abrogates \u201ctort liability arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use within this state of a motor vehicle,\u201d unless the damages come within an enumerated exception.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> As we explained in <em>Hardy v Oakland Co, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\u201cthe restrictions set forth in the no-fault act control the broad statement of liability found in the immunity statute.\u201d<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> Thus, to the extent that the no-fault act narrows the damages available in a third-party tort action through its general abolition of tort liability and provision of certain enumerated exceptions, those restrictions likewise apply when the tortfeasor is a governmental entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Relevant to the present cases, MCL 500.3135(1), (2), and (3)(b) allow third-party tort actions for noneconomic damages if the \u201cdeath, serious impairment of body function, or permanent serious disfigurement\u201d threshold is met, while MCL 500.3135(3)(c) allows for third-party tort actions for certain kinds of economic damages, specifically \u201c[d]amages for allowable expenses, work loss, and survivor\u2019s loss ... in excess of the daily, monthly, and 3-year limitations contained in\u201d the sections applicable to those three types of no-fault benefits.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> Therefore, we hold that a plaintiff may bring a third-party tort action for economic damages, such as work-loss damages, and noneconomic damages, such as pain and suffering or emotional distress damages, against a governmental entity if the requirements under MCL 500.3135 have been met.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> In this respect, we affirm the <em>Hannay </em>panel\u2019s conclusion that work-loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>benefits that exceed the statutory maximum are available against a governmental entity,<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> and we reverse the <em>Hunter </em>panel\u2019s conclusion that noneconomic damages \u201cdo not fall within the motor vehicle exception.\u201d<footnotemark>94</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>C. HANNAY: WORK-LOSS DAMAGES AWARDED</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Because we have concluded that damages for work loss are compensable under the motor vehicle exception, we must now address whether the facts as found were sufficient to satisfy the statutory language defining work-loss damages with respect to plaintiffs claim of work loss as a dental hygienist. Damages in tort actions that are \u201c[r] emote, contingent, or speculative\u201d are not compensable because they are not in conformity with the general rule that a \u201ctortfeasor is liable for all injuries resulting directly from his wrongful act,\u201d as long as \u201cthe damages are the legal and natural consequences of the wrongful act, and are such as, according to common experience and the usual course of events, might reasonably have been anticipated.\u201d<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> This Court has elaborated on this point, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">[T]o render a wrongdoer liable in damages in a tort action where the connection is not immediate between the injurious act and the consequences, such nearness in the order of events and closeness in the relation of cause and effect must subsist, so that the influence of the injurious act would predominate over that of other causes, and concur to produce the consequences or be traceable to those causes.[<footnotemark>96</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>This Court does not, however, \u201cpreclude recovery [of damages] for lack of precise proof\u201d or \u201crequire a mathematical precision in situations of injury where, from the very nature of the circumstances, precision is unattainable,\u201d particularly in circumstances in which the defendant\u2019s actions created the uncertainty.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> The plaintiff bears the burden to prove the damages sought by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In addition to these overarching rules for recovery of damages in tort, we recognize that there is a distinction drawn between work loss and loss of earning capacity in the context of claims made under the no-fault act. This Court has made clear that while work-loss damages are compensable under the no-fault act, loss-of-earning-capacity damages are not.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> This distinction is derived from the statutory language of the no-fault act, specifically MCL 500.3107.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">MCL 500.3135(3)(c) allows for third-party tort actions for \u201c[d]amages for allowable expenses, work loss, and survivor\u2019s loss as defined in sections 3107 and 3110 <em>in excess </em>of the daily, monthly, and 3-year limitations contained in those sections.\u201d (Emphasis added.) MCL 500.3107 defines \u201cwork loss\u201d in the context of no-fault benefits, providing, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">(1) Except as provided in subsection (2), personal protection insurance benefits are payable for the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>(b) Work loss consisting of loss of income <em>from work an injured person would have performed </em>during the first 3 years after the date of the accident if he or she had not been injured... ,[<footnotemark>101</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-3\">Importantly, the statutory language requires that work-loss damages consist of lost income from \u201cwork an injured person <em>would </em>have performed.\u201d We explained in <em>MacDonald v State Farm </em>that \u201cwork-loss benefits compensate the injured person for income he would have received <em>but for </em>the accident.\u201d<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> Thus, work-loss damages are only available if the accident was the \u201cbut for\u201d cause\u2014i.e., cause-in-fact\u2014of the work loss. Indeed, this Court made clear in <em>Ouellette v Kenealy </em>that such economic damages \u201care recoverable in tort only ... for \u2018actual\u2019 work loss,\u201d i.e., \u201cactual loss of income from work an injured person would have performed if he had not been injured,\u201d \u201cwhen the loss of income exceeds the daily, monthly, and three-year limitations.\u201d<footnotemark>103</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">This Court has expressly recognized that in contrast to work-loss damages, loss of earning capacity damages are those arising from work that an injured person \u201ccould\u201d have performed but for the injury.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> Thus, damages for work loss consist of wages that a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u201cwould\u201d have earned but for the accident,<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> whereas loss-of-earning-capacity damages are wages a person \u201ccould\u201d have earned but for the accident.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> In other words, work-loss damages compensate a plaintiff for the specific wages that he or she would have earned in light of the specific facts of the case, while loss-of-earning-capacity damages compensate a plaintiff for his or her loss of unrealized potential for earning income, i.e., for possible wages a plaintiff could have earned if he or she pursued potential opportunities, education, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\">Yet, \u201c[w]ork-loss benefits are not necessarily restricted to a claimant\u2019s wage at the time of the accident.\u201d<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> That \u201ca claimant is working a lower paying part-time job at the time of the accident\u201d does not preclude the plaintiff \u201cfrom proving that he would have taken a higher paying full-time job had he not been injured in a car accident.\u201d<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> Ultimately, however, \u201cclaimants are left to their proofs.\u201d<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> In the context of assessing work-loss benefits under the no-fault act, this Court has made clear that work loss should not overcompensate a claimant by, for instance, \u201cbasting] his work loss, without any proof of actual loss, on the highest paying job he ever had\u201d; instead, it is \u201cintended to compensate claimants approximately dollar for dollar for the amount of wages lost because of the injury or disability.\u201d<footnotemark>110</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Because work-loss damages are intended to replace the income a person would have received but for the accident, <em>prior </em>wages generally are the most relevant and reliable evidence for determining what a plaintiff actually would have earned had the accident not occurred.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> Only in certain circumstances may a plaintiff recover work-loss damages for wages he or she could not have earned before the accident, i.e., wages that are not based on the plaintiffs wage history. While the statute by its terms does not limit a plaintiffs work-loss award to the plaintiffs wages at the time of the accident,<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> courts must be cautious in considering wages that the plaintiff could not have earned before the accident in calculating a work-loss award because of the risk that a calculation based on such wages will be contingent and speculative and, therefore, barred under Michigan law.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Michigan caselaw provides some examples of circumstances under which it was appropriate to consider wages the plaintiff could not have earned before the subject accident in determining what wages a plaintiff would have earned but for the accident. In <em>Gobler v Auto-Owners Ins Co, </em>this Court interpreted a phrase contained in the survivor\u2019s benefits provision of the no-fault act, MCL 500.3108, the language of which is analogous to MCL 500.3107, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">[A] survivor\u2019s loss . . . consists of a loss, after the date on which the deceased died, of contributions of tangible things of economic value, not including services, that dependents of the deceased at the time of the deceased\u2019s death <em>would have received for support during their dependency from the deceased if the deceased had not suffered the accidental bodily injury causing death and expenses .. . </em>.[<footnotemark>113</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The decedent in that case died on the day that he completed his final requirements for a forestry degree from Michigan State University, had applied for forestry positions, was awarded a degree posthumously, and received what amounted to a job offer six months after he died.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> The evidence presented also indicated that the decedent would have accepted the position. Thus, the evidence established that the decedent would have earned wages as an employee of the forestry service; but for his death, there was virtually nothing standing between the decedent and his earning the income at issue.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> This Court concluded that it was not convinced that the trial court had made a mistake in finding that the deceased \u201cwould have been employed by the forestry service had he survived the accident.\u201d<footnotemark>116</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>In <em>Swartout v State Farm Mut, </em>the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss a plaintiffs claim for work-loss benefits.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> At the time of the accident, the plaintiff was to graduate from nursing school in two months, but because of her injuries, she was unable to complete what would have been her final semester.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> She was able to graduate the following year and obtain employment, but sought work-loss benefits because of the delay in her employment caused by the accident.<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> The plaintiff submitted the following evidence: (1) an affidavit from her school stating that but for her being forced to withdraw due to the accident, she would have graduated on time and (2) an affidavit from a hospital stating that plaintiff would have been employed there no later than July 27, 1981, if she had received her degree on time, and identifying the rate of pay she would have received.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> The majority explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">[The] plaintiff... has alleged facts which, if believed, would establish the source of her employment, the exact date of employment and the exact wages that would have been received between July of 1981 and June of 1982. In other words, plaintiff has stated a claim for wages that would, rather than could, have been earned but for her injuries. We therefore conclude that plaintiffs claim should have survived defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition. [<footnotemark>1<em>21</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The Court of Appeals majority concluded that \u201cwhether plaintiff would have received income but for her injuries should be left to the trier of fact,\u201d as was the case in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number><em>Gobler.</em><footnotemark><em>122</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, when the evidence presented demonstrates that the wages at issue were inevitable but for the accident, a damages award based on such wages will not be barred as a matter of law on grounds of being contingent and speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Gobler </em>and <em>Swartout, </em>however, plaintiff Hannay was not on the brink of graduating from her professional degree program\u2014indeed, she had not yet been <em>accepted </em>into the dental hygienist program. Moreover, plaintiff Hannay\u2019s application for admission was rejected twice, once on its merits. Conversely, in <em>Gobler </em>and <em>Swartout, </em>the plaintiffs had satisfied nearly every condition to employment. Plaintiffs situation is more akin to that of the plaintiff in <em>Gerardi, </em>a Court of Appeals case in which the plaintiff sought work-loss benefits because of a one-year delay in her nursing school studies caused by injuries she incurred in an automobile accident.<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> The plaintiff still had one year of nursing school remaining at the time of her injury.<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> The Court concluded that \u201c[a] fair reading of the complaint reveals that the plaintiff is in fact alleging a loss of wages she could have earned in the future as a registered nurse, but for the delay in her studies,\u201d i.e., loss-of-earning-capacity damages, reasoning, in part, that \u201cplaintiff would not have been able to work as a registered nurse prior to her accident.\u201d<footnotemark>125</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Plaintiff Hannay ostensibly pleaded her claim for damages as a claim for work-loss damages as a dental hygienist, and the trial court purported to award such damages. This was error. The evidence presented did not establish by a preponderance of the evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>but for the accident, plaintiff Hannay ultimately <em>would </em>have earned wages as a dental hygienist.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In his deposition testimony, Mark Johnston (the dentist plaintiff worked for as a dental assistant) indicated that plaintiff was \u201cdestined to work in a dental office\u201d and was \u201cwell on her way to getting into the [dental hygienist] program . . . .\u201d Similarly, in her deposition testimony, Mary Johnston (a longtime dental hygienist who worked with plaintiff, who had been an instructor at the school where plaintiff applied, and who administered licensing exams for dentists and dental hygienists) testified that she thought plaintiff \u201cabsolutely. . . would have been admitted into the program.\u201d The Johnstons both indicated that they would have hired plaintiff as a hygienist in their office.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Clearly, the Johnstons were convinced that plaintiff Hannay would be successful in achieving her long-held dream of becoming a dental hygienist. The operative question here is not whether these witnesses were credible<footnotemark>126</footnotemark>\u2014the operative question is <em>what exactly did the evidence presented </em>demonstrate? Did the evidence demonstrate that plaintiff Hannay <em>would </em>have earned wages as a dental hygienist but for her bodily injuries, or did it demonstrate merely that had she continued to apply herself and pursue the opportunity to become educated and licensed in that field she <em>could </em>have earned such wages, i.e., that she possessed a yet-unrealized potential for earning such wages?</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">We recognize that there is some degree of uncertainty inherent in work-loss awards generally,<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> but even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>assuming that the opportunity presented by the Johnstons did in fact constitute an offer of employment, the sheer number of conditions that were required to be satisfied before plaintiff could be employed by Dr. Johnston\u2014namely, that plaintiff Hannay <em>would </em>have been accepted into the dental hygienist program, <em>would </em>have successfully completed the program, and <em>would </em>have passed the licensing exam\u2014places this case outside the inherent uncertainty involved in work-loss claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">We conclude that these unsatisfied conditions render the award of work-loss damages under the no-fault act contingent and speculative in this case and, therefore, barred under Michigan law to the extent that these damages were based on plaintiffs potential employment as a dental hygienist. In short, \u201cit is too tenuous a proposition to say that the element of damages in dispute,\u201d namely, work-loss damages for loss of income as a dental hygienist, \u201cis a legal and natural consequence of defendant\u2019s wrongful act.\u201d<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> The Johnstons\u2019 honestly held belief that plaintiff would have succeeded was simply not sufficient to prove that plaintiff would have satisfied the conditions necessary to earn wages as a dental hygienist, including the primary condition of being admitted into the dental hygienist program, a condition which neither they nor plaintiff had final control over. Accordingly, the facts as found by the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>court were not sufficient to satisfy the statutory language defining work-loss damages with respect to plaintiffs claim of work loss as a dental hygienist, namely that plaintiff <em>would </em>have earned income as a dental hygienist <em>but for </em>the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">For these reasons, we reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision to affirm plaintiff Hannay\u2019s work-loss damages award, and remand to the trial court for recalculation of the work-loss award consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">In light of our holding that a plaintiff may bring a third-party tort action for both economic damages, such as work-loss damages, and noneconomic damages, such as pain and suffering or emotional distress damages, against a governmental entity if the requirements under MCL 500.3135 have been met, we affirm the <em>Han-nay </em>panel\u2019s conclusion that work-loss benefits that exceed the statutory maximum are available against a governmental entity, and we reverse the <em>Hunter </em>panel\u2019s conclusion that noneconomic damages do not fall within the category of damages compensable under the motor vehicle exception and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. With regard to the second issue in <em>Hannay, </em>we reverse the portion of the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion that affirms the work-loss damages award and remand to the trial court for recalculation of the work-loss award consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b322-8\">Young, C.J., and Markman, Kelly, McCormack, and Viviano, JJ., concurred with Zahra, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b322-9\">CAVANAGH, J.

The <em>Hunter </em>panel further erred in its analysis of plaintiff Hunter\u2019s claimed damages by conflating certain questions of liability under the no-fault act with questions of immunity under the GTLA. As previously noted, after the <em>Hunter </em>panel erroneously concluded that noneconomic damages were beyond the scope of the motor vehicle exception\u2019s waiver of immunity, it remanded for the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to resolve outstanding factual issues bearing on whether the City was immune from plaintiff Hunter\u2019s claimed excess economic damages and, thus, entitled to summary disposition as to those damages under MCR 2.116(C)(7) as well. The <em>Hunter </em>panel included among these factual issues whether plaintiff Hunter suffered a \u201cserious impairment of body function\u201d as contemplated under MCL 500.3135, reasoning that \u201c[a] plaintiff making a tort claim for excess damages under the motor vehicle exception must, as a threshold, show a serious impairment of body function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241. This reasoning is flawed in two respects. First, while we agree a showing of \u201cdeath, serious impairment of body function, or permanent serious disfigurement\u201d is necessary under the no-fault act in order for a plaintiff to recover <em>noneconomic </em>damages in a third-party tort action against a governmental entity, see <em>Hardy, </em>461 Mich at 565, neither the no-fault act nor the GTLA requires this for a plaintiff to recover excess <em>economic </em>damages. Second, and relatedly, while a plaintiff must demonstrate \u201cdeath, serious impairment of body function, or permanent serious disfigurement\u201d to recover noneconomic damages in a third-party tort action, whether that requirement has been met is a question of liability, not immunity. As discussed earlier, to demonstrate immunity has been waived as to a claim for such damages, the GTLA, by its plain language, requires a showing of \u201cbodily injury.\u201d Accordingly, while plaintiff Hunter\u2019s path to recovery of noneconomic damages from defendant Flint requires him to demonstrate both a \u201cbodily injury\u201d under the GTLA and a \u201cserious impairment of body function\u201d under the no-fault act, he need only clear the first such hurdle in opposing defendant Flint\u2019s motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(7). For these reasons, it was error for the <em>Hunter </em>panel to conclude that resolution of this motion with regard to excess economic damages would require an evidentiary hearing before the court to determine whether plaintiff Hunter suffered a \u201cserious impairment of body function.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"95\">\n<p id=\"b312-7\"> <em>Sutter, </em>377 Mich at 86.
