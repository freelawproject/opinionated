The trial court\u2019s decision was based on <em>Harrison v Munson Healthcare, Inc, </em>304 Mich App 1; 851 NW2d 549 (2014), which held, in part, that the peer review privilege does not protect objective facts gathered contemporaneously with an event.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">We hold that \u00a7\u00a7 20175(8) and 21515 do not contain an exception to the peer review privilege for objective facts. As a result, this portion of <em>Harrison </em>was wrongly decided. In this case, the trial court erred by relying on <em>Harrison </em>to order production of the objective-facts portion of the incident report. Therefore, we vacate the trial court\u2019s May 8, 2014 order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In September 2008, Pramod K. Sanghi, M.D., performed a cardiac catheterization on 80-year-old decedent Dorothy Krusac, successfully placing stents in Krusac\u2019s heart. Immediately following the procedure, however, Krusac began moving her legs around and rolled off the operating table. Three medical personnel were present when this happened: Deborah Colvin, R.N., Heather Gengler, R.N., and Rogers Gomez, the lab technician. According to the deposition testimony of Colvin and Gomez, they were able to catch Krusac and cradle her gently to the floor, where she came to rest on her left side. At that time, Krusac denied hitting her head, but later complained of neck and back pain from the fall. The CT scan performed later that day showed no evidence of injury from the fall. Shortly after the surgery and fall, Krusac died.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Plaintiff John Krusac, as personal representative of the estate of Dorothy Krusac, filed a medical malpractice complaint in the Saginaw Circuit Court against defendant, alleging that Krusac died as a result of injuries sustained from the fall. During discovery, it became known that Colvin had filled out an incident report shortly after the event and submitted it to her supervisor. Plaintiff filed a motion in limine on the eve of trial, asking the court to conduct an in camera inspection of the incident report and provide plaintiff with the facts contained in it. Relying on <em>Harrison, </em>plaintiff argued that the facts were necessary to cross-examine the hospital staff and that it would be unethical for defendant to offer a defense inconsistent with the facts contained in the report. Defendant responded that the peer review privilege under \u00a7\u00a7 20175(8) and 21515 protected the report from discovery. After hearing oral arguments, the trial court denied plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>motion. Plaintiff thereafter sought reconsideration, which the court granted. The court ordered defendant to produce a copy of the report for in camera review. After reviewing the report, on May 8, 2014, the trial court issued an order requiring defendant to provide plaintiff with the first page of the incident report, which contained only objective facts. The court based its decision on the Court of Appeals\u2019 recent holding in <em>Harrison </em>that the peer review privilege does not apply to objective facts contained in an incident report.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Defendant sought leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals, and moved for immediate consideration and a stay of the proceedings. The Court of Appeals granted immediate consideration, but denied defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal for failure to persuade the Court of the need for immediate appellate review. The Court also denied the motion to stay the proceedings. Defendant then sought review by this Court. After granting defendant\u2019s motion to stay the trial court proceedings, we granted leave to appeal and directed the parties to address</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">(1) whether <em>Harrison v Munson Healthcare, Inc, </em>304 Mich App 1 (2014), erred in its analysis of the scope of the peer review privilege, MCL 333.21515; and (2) whether the Saginaw Circuit Court erred when it ordered the defendant to produce the first page of the improvement report based on its conclusion that \u201cobjective facts gathered contemporaneously with an event do not fall within the definition of peer review privilege.\u201d <em>[Krusac v Covenant Med Ctr, Inc, </em>496 Mich 855-856 (2014).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">This case involves a question of statutory interpretation, which we review de novo. <em>Madugula v Taub, </em>496 Mich 685, 695; 853 NW2d 75 (2014). As with any statutory interpretation, our goal is to give effect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Legislature\u2019s intent, focusing first on the statute\u2019s plain language. <em>Id. </em>at 696. When the language of a statute is unambiguous, the Legislature must have intended the meaning clearly expressed, and the statute must be enforced as written. No further judicial construction is required or permitted. <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The peer review privilege is a creature of statute, not the common law. See Scheutzow &amp; Gillis, <em>Confidentiality and Privilege of Peer Review Information: More Imagined Than Real, </em>7 JL &amp; Health 169, 181 (1992-1993) (\u201cIt is generally accepted that the privilege ascribed to peer review proceedings does not arise from any recognized common law principle, but is rather a legislative creation....\u201d). Therefore, in assessing whether the peer review privilege applies to objective facts contained in an incident report, we must turn first to the language of the relevant statutes. See <em>Dorris v Detroit Osteopathic Hosp Corp, </em>460 Mich 26, 33; 594 NW2d 455 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">MCL 333.21513(d) imposes a duty on hospitals to create peer review committees \u201cfor the purpose of reducing morbidity and mortality and improving the care provided in the hospital for patients.\u201d Essential to the peer review process is the candid and conscientious assessment of hospital practices. <em>Feyz v Mercy Mem Hosp, </em>475 Mich 663, 680; 719 NW2d 1 (2006). To encourage such an assessment by hospital staff, the Legislature has protected from disclosure the records, data, and knowledge collected for or by peer review committees. <em>Id. </em>at 680-681. To this end, MCL 333.20175(8) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>The records, data, and knowledge collected for or by individuals or committees assigned a professional review function in a health facility or agency, or an institution of higher education in this state that has colleges of osteopathic and human medicine, are confidential, shall be used only for the purposes provided in this article, are not public records, and are not subject to court subpoena.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Similarly, MCL 333.21515 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">The records, data, and knowledge collected for or by individuals or committees assigned a review function described in this article are confidential and shall be used only for the purposes provided in this article, shall not be public records, and shall not be available for court subpoenal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">These statutes, and their predecessors,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> have been interpreted as \u201cfully protecting] quality assurance/peer review records from discovery .. ..\u201d <em>Dorris, </em>460 Mich at 40. For example, in <em>Attorney General v Bruce, </em>422 Mich 157, 164-165; 369 NW2d 826 (1985), we rejected the Attorney General\u2019s argument that the privilege \u201cwas intended only to protect the confidentiality of peer review proceedings from discovery in circuit court proceedings (i.e., malpractice actions). . . .\u201d Instead, we held that the privilege protects from disclosure records sought by the Board of Medicine and the Department of Licensing and Regulation and ordered by investigative subpoena to be produced. <em>Id. </em>at 173. Similarly, in <em>In re Investigation of Lieberman, </em>250 Mich App 381, 389; 646 NW2d 199 (2002), the Court of Appeals held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>privilege protects from disclosure records sought pursuant to a search warrant in a criminal investigation. Indeed, after reviewing the language of \u00a7 21515, the court concluded that \u201cthe Legislature has imposed a <em>comprehensive ban </em>on the disclosure of [peer review materials.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The Court of Appeals took a more constricted view of the peer review privilege in <em>Harrison. </em>In that case, the plaintiff sued a surgeon and the hospital (the defendants) after receiving a burn from a surgical instrument during surgery. At trial, the plaintiff learned that an operating room nurse had authored an incident report. The plaintiff sought to introduce the report. The defendants objected, claiming that the peer review privilege protected the report from introduction. The trial court reviewed the report at an in camera hearing and determined that the facts in the report contradicted the operating room nurse\u2019s deposition testimony. The court found that the report itself was protected by the peer review privilege but ruled that the facts contained in the report, as opposed to the conclusions drawn, should have been documented in the plaintiffs medical record and made available to the plaintiff. The court declared a mistrial and imposed sanctions totaling roughly $54,000 on the defendants and their attorney based on their presentation of a defense inconsistent with the facts contained in the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">In a published opinion, the Court of Appeals addressed whether the peer review privilege applied to the incident report at issue. Relying heavily on caselaw from foreign jurisdictions, the panel found a distinction between \u201cfactual information objectively reporting contemporaneous observations or findings and \u2018records, data, and knowledge\u2019 gathered to permit an effective review of professional practices.\u201d <em>Harrison, </em>304 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>App at 30. It held that \u201c[o]bjective facts gathered contemporaneously with an event do not fall within [the peer review privilege.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32. It reasoned that \u201c[t]o hold otherwise would grant risk managers the power to unilaterally insulate from discovery firsthand observations that the risk manager would prefer remain concealed\u201d and that \u201c[t]he peer-review statutes do not sweep so broadly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34. The panel concluded that the facts recorded on the first page of the incident report were not privileged, but that the remainder of the incident report was protected because it reflected a deliberative review process.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">However, contrary to the <em>Harrison </em>panel\u2019s conclusion, the peer review statutes do not contain an exception for objective facts contained in an otherwise privileged incident report. Both \u00a7\u00a7 20175(8) and 21515 protect the \u201crecords, data, and knowledge\u201d collected for or by a peer review committee. While the words \u201crecord,\u201d \u201cdata,\u201d and \u201cknowledge\u201d are so common they hardly bear defining, a review of the dictionary definitions of each demonstrates that the <em>Harrison </em>panel\u2019s interpretation contradicts the plain language of the peer review statutes. See <em>Spectrum Health Hosp v Farm Bureau Mut Ins Co of Mich, </em>492 Mich 503, 515; 821 NW2d 117 (2012) (recognizing that a court \u201cmay consult dictionary definitions to give words their common and ordinary meaning\u201d) (citation omitted). \u201cRecord\u201d is defined as \u201can account in writing or the like preserving the memory or knowledge <em>of facts </em>or events.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2001) (emphasis added). \u201cData\u201d is defined as <em>\u201cindividual facts, </em>statistics, or items of information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). \u201cKnowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>edge\u201d is defined as <em>\u201cacquaintance with facts, </em>truths, or principles\u201d or \u201cfamiliarity or conversance, as by study or experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Because the ordinary meaning of these statutory terms plainly encompasses objective facts, we hold that objective facts are subject to the peer review privilege. We therefore disagree with the <em>Harrison </em>panel\u2019s conclusion that the Legislature intended to exclude from protection objective facts contained in an otherwise peer review privileged incident report.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Plaintiff argues that an interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 20175(8) and 21515 that protects objective facts from disclosure would conflict with MCL 333.20175(1), which requires a hospital to \u201ckeep and maintain a record for each patient, including a full and complete record of tests and examinations performed, observations made, treatments provided, and. . . the purpose of hospitalization.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>However, \u00a7 20175(1) does not alter the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>the peer review privilege. Whereas \u00a7\u00a7 20175(8) and 21515 pertain to a hospital\u2019s duty under MCL 333.21513(d) to create a peer review committee that collects and reviews information in an effort to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve patient care, \u00a7 20175(1) imposes on a hospital an entirely distinct and unrelated duty\u2014to make a full and complete medical record concerning a patient\u2019s current care. Because these provisions pertain to entirely distinct duties, no conflict exists, and we cannot conclude that the Legislature intended \u00a7 20175(1) to create an exception to the peer review privilege. See <em>Bruce, </em>422 Mich at 167-169 (rejecting an argument that disclosures required by another subsection of \u00a7 20175 defeated the peer review privilege).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The <em>Harrison </em>panel, certain amici, and plaintiff have expressed concern that a holding that the peer review privilege applies to objective facts in an incident report \u201cwould grant risk managers the power to unilaterally insulate from discovery firsthand observations that the risk manager would prefer remain concealed.\u201d <em>Harrison, </em>304 Mich App at 34. However, although the terms \u201crecords,\u201d \u201cdata,\u201d and \u201cknowledge\u201d are broad enough to include objective facts, the scope of the privilege is not without limit. Instead, the privilege only applies to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>records, data, and knowledge that are collected for or by the committee under \u00a7\u00a7 20175(8) and 21515 \u201cfor the purpose of reducing morbidity and mortality and improving the care provided in the hospital for patients.\u201d MCL 333.21513(d). See also <em>Dorris, </em>460 Mich at 40.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, while the peer review privilege may make it more difficult for a party to obtain evidence,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the burden on a litigant is mitigated by the fact that he or she may still obtain relevant facts through eyewitness testimony, including from the author of a privileged incident report, and from the patient\u2019s medical record.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finally, if a litigant remains unsatisfied with the statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>tory balance struck between disclosing information to patients and protecting peer review materials, any recalibration must be done by the Legislature. See <em>Koontz v Ameritech Servs, Inc, </em>466 Mich 304, 312; 645 NW2d 34 (2002) (\u201cBecause the proper role of the judiciary is to interpret and not write the law, courts simply lack authority to venture beyond the unambiguous text of a statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\">For the reasons stated above, we reject the <em>Harrison </em>panel\u2019s holding that objective facts gathered contemporaneously with an event do not fall within the peer review privilege. Accordingly, we overrule <em>Harrison </em>to the extent that it is inconsistent with our opinion today.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Instead, we hold that \u00a7\u00a7 20175(8) and 21515 make privileged all records, data, and knowledge collected for or by a peer review committee in furtherance of its statutorily mandated purpose of reducing morbidity and mortality and improving patient care. This includes objective facts gathered contemporaneously with an event contained in an otherwise privileged incident report.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">IV APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Because <em>Harrison </em>was wrongly decided and the trial court relied on <em>Harrison </em>to order production of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>portion of the incident report, we vacate the trial court\u2019s May 8, 2014 order in its entirety. The scope of this interlocutory appeal is limited to whether the trial court erred by relying on <em>Harrison </em>to order production of the objective facts found in the incident report. Having answered that question, we remand to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><em>V. </em>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">We conclude that <em>Harrison </em>was wrongly decided, and we overrule the portions of it that are inconsistent with this opinion. Because the trial court in the instant case erred by relying on <em>Harrison </em>to order production of the objective facts contained in the incident report authored by Colvin, we vacate the trial court\u2019s May 8, 2014 order and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b498-6\">Young, C.J., and Markman, Kelly, Zahra, McCormack, and VIVIANO, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b498-7\">BERNSTEIN, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-8\"> In this opinion, we use \u201cpeer review committee\u201d to refer generally to \u201cindividuals or committees assigned a professional review function\u201d under MCL 333.20175(8) and \u201cindividuals or committees assigned a review function\u201d under MCL 333.21515.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b491-9\"> The first peer review statutes were enacted by our Legislature nearly 50 years ago.

However, resort to these cases was not permitted because the peer review statutes are unambiguous. See <em>Madugula, </em>496 Mich at 696. In any event, the cases utilized by the <em>Harrison </em>panel do not support the creation of such an exception. The panel relied upon three cases cited by this Court in <em>Monty v Warren Hosp Corp, </em>422 Mich 138, 146-147; 366 NW2d 198 (1985): <em>Davidson v Light, </em>79 FRD 137 (D Colo, 1978), <em>Bredice v Doctors Hosp, </em>50 FRD 249 (D DC, 1970), and <em>Coburn v Seda, </em>101 Wash 2d 270; 677 P 2d 173 (Wash, 1984). However, the <em>Monty </em>court relied on those cases as guidance for determining whether a hospital committee was assigned a peer review function, not whether the content of an incident report was protected by the peer review privilege. In addition, a reading of these cases indicates that they shed no light on the scope of our peer review statutes as they either do not discuss a statutory privilege at all (e.g., <em>Bredice </em>and <em>Davidson), </em>or pertain to a statutory privilege materially different from ours (e.g., <em>Coburn).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b494-8\"> Essentially, plaintiff asks us to read the statutes <em>in pari </em>materia\u2014i.e., construing them together as one law to resolve the alleged conflict. See <em>Int\u2019l Business Machines v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>496 Mich 642, 652; 852 NW2d 865 (2014) (opinion hy Viviano, J.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b495-6\"> Plaintiff argues, in essence, that since a hospital is required to publish certain factual information in the patient\u2019s medical record, it cannot claim the same information is protected by the peer review privilege.

Rather, even though the information may properly be proved from another source\u2014i.e., the medical record or witness testimony-\u2014a hospital may still claim an exemption from disclosing materials that are subject to the peer review privilege.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b496-5\"> In providing guidance to courts on how to engage in this statutory inquiry, we have previously stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">In determining whether any of the information requested is protected by the statutory privilege, the trial court should bear in mind that mere submission of information to a peer review committee does not satisfy the collection requirement so as to bring the information within the protection of the statute. Also, in deciding whether a particular committee was assigned a review function so that information it collected is protected, the court may wish to consider the hospital\u2019s bylaws and internal regulations, and whether the committee\u2019s function is one of current patient care or retrospective review. [Monty, 422 Mich at 146-147 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\"> Indeed, by their very nature, privileges \u201care not designed or intended to facilitate the fact-finding process or to safeguard its integrity,\u201d but \u201c[t]heir effect instead is clearly inhibitive; rather than facilitate the illumination of truth, they shut out the light.\u201d <em>People v Warren, </em>462 Mich 415, 428; 615 NW2d 691 (2000), quoting 1 McCormick, Evidence (5th ed), \u00a7 72, pp 298-299.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b496-8\"> To the extent plaintiff is arguing that defendant\u2019s <em>failure </em>to comply with its statutory duty to publish certain information in the medical record should be deemed a waiver of the peer review privilege, we reject that claim as well. As noted earlier, hospitals have a statutory duty to maintain a full and complete medical record for each patient, which includes, among other things, observations made and treatments provided to the patient. MCL 333.20175(1). However, deeming the peer review privilege waived is not among the sanctions provided by the Legislature for violations of \u00a7 20175(1). See, e.g., MCL 333.20175a, 333.20176(1); see also <em>Fischer v WA Foote Mem Hosp, </em>261 Mich App 727, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>730-731; 683 NW2d 248 (2004) (discussing the ways within the Public Health Code to enforce its provisions).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\"> The <em>Harrison </em>panel also found support for its decision in <em>Centennial Healthcare Mgt Corp v Dep\u2019t of Consumer &amp; Indus Servs, </em>254 Mich App 275; 657 NW2d 746 (2002). However, <em>Centennial </em>is inapposite. <em>Centennial </em>does not address whether a private litigant has a right to review objective facts contained in an otherwise privileged incident report, but instead involves whether an administrative rule promulgated by the Michigan Department of Consumer and Industry Services infringed the peer review privilege. But, to the extent <em>Centennial </em>may be read as contrary to our opinion today, we limit its reasoning and holding to its specific facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
