The declaration as amended contained ten counts.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-12\" pgmap=\"652(85) 653(34)\">March 16, 1904, an order was entered upon appellant to file within twenty days a bill of particulars of places at which, and names of persons to whom, each of said slanderous remarks were uttered, and names of individuals, firms or corporations which otherwise would have dealt with the appellant but for the use of said slanderous words; the filing of said bill to be without prejudice to appellant\u2019s right to amend it so as to set up matters coming to the knowledge of appellant between the date of filing said bill and the trial of said cause, provided the amendment be upon reasonable notice.

When required and furnished its effect is to limit the plaintiff on the trial to proof of the particular cause or causes therein mentioned. Morton v. McClure, 22 Ill. 257; Waidner v. Pauly, 141 Ill. 442; Hess Co. v. Dawson, 149 Ill. 145. Whether or not the plaintiff shall be ruled to furnish a bill of particulars in a given case, is a matter resting in the sound legal discretion of the court, and the action of the court in making or refusing the rule will not be reviewed in appellate jurisdictions unless it be shown clearly that such discretion was abused. C. &amp; A. Ry. Co. v. Smith, 10 Ill. App. 359, 362; DuBois v. People, 200 Ill. 164.</p> <p id=\"b654-5\" pgmap=\"654\">Where the allegations of the declaration in an action for slander are not specific enough fully to apprise the defendant of the cause of action in its statement of the actual words uttered, or to whom or in whose presence, or the place where uttered, the court may, and, upon proper application, should order the filing of a bill of particulars, so that the defendant may have a fair chance to prepare for the trial.</p> <p id=\"b654-6\" pgmap=\"654\">.It is almost necessary, of course, in an action of slander, unless the plaintilf alleges the place where, the time when, and the names of the persons to whom the slander was uttered, to order a bill of particulars of the place where, the time when, and the names of the persons to whom the slander was uttered. Townsend on L. &amp; S. (4th ed.), 490.</p> <p id=\"b654-7\" pgmap=\"654\">In Gardinier v. Knox, 27 Hun, 500, the date the words were spoken was given, and it was alleged that they were spoken at the Town of Kussell \u201c in the presence of divers good and worthy citizens.\u201d Upon motion the court ordered a bill of particulars, saying: \u201c The complaint gives little information, for under it proof need not be confined to the day stated; it might be given as to any place in the Town of Eusseil and as to any persons shown to be present. If the defendant knew the times and place where the occurrence would be shown, he could obtain proof of his own whereabouts.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b654-9\" pgmap=\"654(67) 655(107)\">In Tilton v. Beecher, 59 N. Y. 176, an action of crim. con., the trial court denied an application for a bill of particulars solely upon the ground that it bad no power to grant it. The Court of Appeals decided that the trial court possessed the power, and for that reason reversed and remanded the case. After an extended review of the authorities in England and in the United States, the court laid down the following rule: \"A bill of particulars is appropriate in all descriptions of actions where the circumstances are such that justice demands that a party should be apprised of the matters for which he is to be put for trial with greater particularity than is required by the rules of pleading.\" See, also, Com. v. Snelling, 15 Pick. 321; Jones v. Platt, 60 How. Pr. 277; Davies v. Chapman, 6 Ad. &amp; E. 767; Stiebleing v. Lockhaus, 21 Hun, 457; Rex v. Hodgson, 3 Carr &amp; Payne, 422; N. Y. Infant Asylum v. Roosevelt, 35 Hun, 501.</p> <p id=\"b655-14\" pgmap=\"655\">The trial court did not err in ordering appellant to file a bill of particulars in this case. Appellant saw fit to disobey that order. Such disobedience fully justified the action of the court in dismissing the suit.</p> <p id=\"b655-18\" pgmap=\"655\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b655-19\" pgmap=\"655\">Affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
