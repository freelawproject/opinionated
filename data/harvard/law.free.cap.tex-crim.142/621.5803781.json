These documents, which appear to be duly authenticated, were offered in evidence upon the hearing of the writ of habeas corpus, and no objection was interposed thereto. Appellant was identified by Mr. Franks, credit manager of the hotel, as the person who passed the check and against whom the complaint was filed in the Justice Court of Shelby County, Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">Appellant offered in evidence a complaint filed in the Justice Court of Precinct No. 1 of Dallas County, charging him with passing a hot check. This complaint was dismissed by the Justice Court upon a motion of the District Attorney. No other evidence on the part of appellant was introduced. At the conclusion of the hearing, appellant was remanded to the cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>tody of the Sheriff of Dallas County to be delivered to R. W. McGee, the person designated by the Governor of the demanding state to receive and return appellant to said state.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
