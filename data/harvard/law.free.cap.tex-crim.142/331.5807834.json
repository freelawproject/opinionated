The record contains no bills of exception and there is no brief in behalf of appellant to show upon what theory the appellant asks this court to reverse his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">We have examined the record and it appears that the evidence is conclusive that he was engaged with two other men, the Boyd Brothers, in a hold-up in the City of San Angelo on December 30, 1940, by which they took the sum of $15.60 from B. F. Williams, who was engaged on that night in operating a filling station on the outskirts of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The statement of facts shows the former conviction for a similar offense in Palo Pinto County, as set out in the indictment, and also several other convictions to run concurrently in Wichita County.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The record amply sustains the conviction with the penalty assessed and we find no error which this court may be called upon to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
