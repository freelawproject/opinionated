The <em>locus in quo </em>was described as \u201c a remnant or gore, containing sixty-nine acres, more or less, lying in the northeasterly division of Tuftonborough, and on the line dividing the same from the town of Ossipee.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>The plea was the general issue, accompanied by a brief statement, setting forth that the cutting was done on No. 11 of the hundred-acre lots in Ossipee, to which the defendant had good right, claiming under one Merrill Cram.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-5\">It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff was the owner of the gore in Tuftonborough, as set forth in his-writ, and that Cram was owner of No. 11 of the hundred-acre lots in Ossipee, and that the cutting was done by the defendant under Cram. It appeared, also, that the gore and No. 11 were adjoining lots, and that the true dividing line between them was the line between the towns of Tuftonborough and Ossipee. It appeared, further, that the line between the two towns run from a corner of Wolfborough to a corner of Moultonborough; that,commencing at the corner of Wolfborough, there was a well traced, spotted line between the towns, which run some distance on a straight course, and was so far undisputed ; and that, commencing at the corner of Moultonborough, there was also a well traced and spotted line, which run some distance in a straight course, and was likewise so far undisputed; and it appeared that if these lines were continued in the same course they would come together and form a straight line. There was, however, a space between the two, in which the line could not be traced by any monuments in a straight course, and in this space were the gore and lot No. 11.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-6\">There was evidence tending to show that, beginning at the terminus of that part of the undisputed line which commenced at the corner of Wolfborough, there was a diverging line, running towards the Moultonborough part of the undisputed line, which continued beyond the <em>locus in </em>quo; and there was evidence tending to show that this diverging line was the one that was' run and established by the original proprietors between the two towns. This line, however, if continued in the. direction in which it commenced, would have shot by the other part of the undisputed straight line which commenced at Moultonborough, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>but it appeared that the monuments ceased about twenty-five rods before coming up even with the terminus of the undisputed line. And the counsel for the plaintiff requested the court to instruct the jury that if they believed that. the diverging line, if continued on in the course in which it was running, would not strike the undisputed line, then they could not find it to be the true line.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-5\">But the court declined so to instruct the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-6\">In the course of the trial the defendant introduced a plan, to which was annexed the following certificate:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-7\">\u201c This plan, attached hereto, numbered 4, dated 1781, and signed by James Hersey, being a plan of his survey of one hundred acre lots in Ossipee, belongs to the Masonian Proprietors, and was found by me among the papers and records of said proprietors, and the drawing into lots corresponds with the records of said proprietors.

The question to the jury was what was the original line, run by Hersey, in 1781, and they found the one set up by the defendant as that line. It was immaterial whether it met; it was a well-marked line, so far as these parties are concerned, run by Hersey and ratified by the proprietors, and when they had authority to ratify, being owners on both sides more than fifty years since.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-13\">It was the only line.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-14\">It cannot be changed by the selectmen. <em>Gorrill </em>v. <em>Whittier, </em>3 N.

That question, when determined, will fully settle the rights &lt;of these parties. And that fact is found, to a very considerable extent, by the case. The true line dividing those towns runs from a corner of the town of Wolfborough to a corner of the town of Moultonborough. Its true locality is found, and not in dispute, for a considerable distance from the corner of Wolfborough, which is found to be a straight line in the direction of the corner of Moultonborough. And also a straight line, commencing at the corner of Moultonborough, and running for some distance in the direction of the corner of Wolfborough, which would, if extended in the same direction, meet the terminus of the true line as found running from the corner of Wolfborough, is found to be the true locality of the line between the towns thus far. The locality of the portion of the line of the towns of Tuftonborough and Ossipee, that lies between the termini of the two straight lines thus described, is alone in dispute. In fact, the real dispute is still more limited, and necessarily extends only to the \u201c diverging line,\u201d mentioned in the case, which extends from the. terminus\"of the straight, undisputed line, commencing at the corner of Wolfborough and running towards the Moultonborough part of the undisputed line. That diverging line extends beyond the land in controversy, and, therefore, the locality of the residue of the line, between Tuftonborough aiftd Ossipee, which is not found by the case, as it does not in Any way form the boundary between the lands in dispute, \u00a1becomes immaterial in determining the present controversy, excepting so far as the want of evidence of that fact may bear as a matter of evidence upon the question of the true Wne forming the true boundary between the premises of tjlese parties. The case finds that there was evidence off the fact of the existence of such a diverging line, and oil its extension beyond the <em>locus in quo, </em>and that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>the line that was run and established between the two towns by the original proprietors. This portion of the line was marked by monuments, as were the two undisputed portions. This case, then,, is to be taken as showing a line agreed upon by the adjoining owners, namely, the original proprietors, <em>(Enfield </em>v. Day, 7 N. H. Rep. 457,) as the boundary line diverging their possessions, and marked by monuments so far as the diverging line extended. And the question arising upon this blanch of the case is, whether that evidence and agreement is so far controlled by the fact that the diverging line, if extended in a straight line, would not strike the terminus of the Moultonborough part of the undisputed line, as to render it incompetent for the jufy to find by their verdict that the diverging line is the true line, so far as it extends between the two towns, and is thus agreed upon and marked. It is difficult to see upon what principle this position is to be maintained. Here was, at most, as we conceive, to be drawn from the fact relied upon by the defendant, an inference against the probability that the diverging line was the true line. Doubtless, if the line thus marked, instead of diverging from a straight line, had been found to be leading off in a straight line between the termini of the two\\undisputed portions of the line, that fact would have strengthened the evidence and increased the probability that it Vas the true line. That would be the extent of the weight '^&gt;f that fact, in a case like the present. But that mere faclt would not be conclusive nor controlling, as against the fact {otherwise satisfactorily proved. But the question is still, whether a fact that may be regarded as tending to show tnlat the line claimed is not the true line can be regarded as controlling the agreement of parties at the time, competent tcP agree as to the divisional line between their adjoining la!\u00ab3s. We regard this as being so far from the correct rSle upon this subject, that it is entirely the reverse of it. In\\fact, in this State the parol agreements of the adjoining owW <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Hands, fairly entered into in reference to the divisional lines between them, accompanied by the erection of monuments and the occupation of the parties in conformity therewith, have been allowed to have the effect to conclude them as matter of evidence as to the extent of their respective rights. Such agreements furnish conclusive proof of the accuracy of the line thus established. <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Fellows, </em>6 N. H. Rep. 107; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>9 N. H. Rep. 473; <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>12 N. H. Rep. 19; <em>Carleton </em>v. <em>Redington, </em>1 Foster\u2019s Rep. 291. A similar doctrine prevails in other jurisdictions. <em>Ebert </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>1 Binney 215; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>19 Wend. 320; <em>Rockwell </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>16 Wend. 285. It is entirely clear, then, that this state of the proof cannot be controlled by the mere fact that the diverging line, if extended, would not meet the terminus of the Moultonborough part of the undisputed line. It would not be controlled by evidence even showing satisfactorily that the diverging line was not, in fact, the true original line. In the present state of the case, that evidence would be wholly inadmissible for such a purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\u2022 The omission of the judge to instruct the jury in the manner requested by the defendant, was justified by the state of the evidence, and the verdict cannot be set aside for that cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">A further question arises in the case, as to the plan that was given in evidence upon the trial. No particular ground of exception is stated in the case. Without stopping to inquire whether, for that cause, it might not well be regarded as waived, (being one which might have been obviated, if stated at the trial, <em>McConihe </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>12 N. H. Rep. 396,) we shall proceed to determine the principal question, which, as we understand it, arises upon the case. The objection relied upon, as we suppose, relates to the proof of its authenticity or of its genuineness as a plan, and not to its competency as proof relative to the question of boundary between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Was its genuineness so made out in proof as to entitle it to be given in evidence ?</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The fact was shown that the plan was found in the custody of J. W. <em>Pierce, and </em>that he was at the time the acting clerk of the Masonian Proprietors, having the custody of their records, and that it was delivered by him, at his office in Portsmouth, in this State, as an original plan and as a part of the proprietary records, and the witness of these facts produced the plan in court. It purported, upon its face, to be an ancient plan, bearing date 1781, and purporting to be signed by James Hersey, surveyor. It was accompanied by a certificate attached to the plan, signed by Pierce, which also showed that it had been, in point of fact, in his custody, and came from his possession. Now here is ample evidence that the plan, was found in the proper custody. It was found where it might be expected to be found. It was found in the proper custodia of the records of the corporation. A corporation can only keep its records and papers in the custody of its agents. Here, then, the plan in question was found along with the other muniments and evidences of the title of the corporation, and in the hands of its proper agents. Upon this state of fact, it is well .settled that the genuineness of the plan was sufficiently proved to entitle it to go to the jury as evidence of such facts as it was competent to prove. 1 Greenl. Ev. 166, 167, 534; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Laguere, </em>5 Cow. 225, 226. This case came up for consideration in the case of <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Poor, </em>1 Foster\u2019s Rep. 440-445, where the reasons for the rule of evidence are stated much at large, and need not here be repeated. -</p>\n<p id=\"AqH\">We see no ground for doubt as to the propriety of the ruling, admitting the copy from the records of the Masonian Proprietors. The copy is. certified by the acting clerk, who is shown to be such, and that is sufficient. <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Bemis, </em>11 N. H. Rep. 44; <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>14 N. H. Rep. 101. And, moreover, it was shown by a witness to have been compared by him with the original record, and to be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>true copy. And it is well settled that where the proof is by a copy, an examined copy, duly made and sworn to, is always admissible. 1 Greenl. Ev. 534. The objection here is not taken that the copy offered was an extract, and not the entire record. And there is nothing to show that it is not a full record of the entire matter which it embraces or to which it relates. \u201c Copies of so much of the record as relates to the subject-matter of the suit are allowed.\u201d It would be idle to require more. Nothing more can be necessary to enable the court and jury to determine and to give a right construction to what is done. <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>14 N. H. Rep. 101. The copy of the record introduced, purported to contain a record of the vote of the proprietors, holden at Portsmouth, August 17, 1775, relative to the line <em>between </em>the towns of Tuftonborough and Ossipee, run by James Hersey, from the corner of Wolfborough to Moultonborough corner, as the northerly line of Tuftonborough. This was the only matter material embraced in the controversy. And it is not made in any way to appear that any thing further was transacted on that occasion, or that this was not the whole record, made up of the doings of the proprietors at that time. And that is sufficient. <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>before cited. Moreover, we think this last ground of exception cannot prevail, for another reason. It was plainly of such a character that it could have been readily obviated if it had existed, and had been specifically pointed out at the trial. If it had been objected, in terms, that the copy produced was only a copy of a part of the proceedings had, and recorded at the date of said meeting, it is apparent that the deficiency could easily have been supplied. By the practice of the court, the objection, if it appeared, and it were insisted upon, that the copy produced in evidence was only a part of the record, it must be considered as waived. <em>McConihe </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>before cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
