From the first, it was the agreement of the parties, that Hinckley &amp; Egery were to be secured the payment therefor, by a mortgage on the land and steam mill, machinery and iron work.

On the same day that the policy was issued, a mortgage was duly executed by the said Dutton to Hinckley &amp; Egery ; the said mortgage being upon the land and steam saw mill, the steam engine, boilers and machinery connected therewith in the mill, being the property upon which the policy in suit was issued, to the amount of $1128, and which was recorded October 14,1847. The mortgage which was then signed, originally bore a prior date, which at that time was erased at the instance of Dutton, and the 11th of October substituted therefor, Dutton assigning as a reason that he had made application for insurance subsequent to the first date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-11\">It did not appear whether the mortgage was executed before or after the policy was issued, the date of both instruments being the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-12\">Dutton never gave the company any notice of this mortgage thus executed on the 11th of October, 1847 ; and subsequently, in the summer of 1850, Hinckley &amp; Egery took possession of the mortgaged property under the mortgage; and of this fact the company never had any notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-13\">The application, with its covenants, and the policy, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the charter and by-laws <em>of the </em>company, were made a part of the case, as regulating and defining the liability of the defendants.on this policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-5\">The sixth section of the charter provides that \u201c the buildings, with the land whereon they stand, and the property insured therein, shall be held by the company as security for any deposite note which they may hold of the member for whom they are insured, and the policy of insurance to any member of said company upon his buildings, or other property, shall of itself create a lien upon the same for the sum of any such deposit note, and the cost which inay accrue in collecting the <em>same; </em>and such lien shall continue during the existence of said .policy, and the liability of the assured thereon, notwithstanding any transfer or alienation thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-6\">The eighth section of the by-laws was as <em>follows: \u201c </em>Applications for insurance must be made in -writing, and specify all the facts and circumstances touching the character of the risk, within itself, or by the surrounding objects, whether it regards the subject of insurance, or the building containing the same; and also the applicant\u2019s interest therein.

The plaintiff is entitled to recover notwithstanding the mortgage executed by Henry Dutton to Hinckley &amp; Egery, October 11, 1847. This is no violation of any warranty in the policy or application. The warranty in relation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>to incumbrances refers to the condition of things at the time &lt;of the application, October 5, 1847. 3 Kent\u2019s Com. 374.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-5\">A mortgage is not an alienation. <em>Stetson </em>v.

Rev. Stat. of Maine, ch. 125, \u00a7\u00a7 37, 38. The lien had not been removed ; and a mechanic\u2019s lien is an incumbrance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-12\">The final execution of the mortgage to Hinckley &amp; Egery was contemporaneous with the issuing of the policy. It was a change of circumstances happening before the contract of insurance was complete, which the company was entitled to know.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-13\">The answer of the applicant was a warranty, and if it failed at the moment of the insurance the contract failed. 3 Kent\u2019s Com. 288; <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Sun Ins.

Or, in other words, the applicant is bound to state all matters materially affecting the nature, extent and duration of the title, and the incumbrances on it\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>This principle is clearly stated and sustained in <em>Addison </em>v. <em>Kentucky and Lou.

And the 8th section of the by-laws requires it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-5\">The same doctrine is fully recognized in the following cases. <em>Etna Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>16 Wend. 385; <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Manf. Ins. Co., </em>10 Pick. 40; <em>Niblo </em>v. <em>N. American Ins. Co. </em>1 Sandford\u2019s Sup. Ct.

The court will see fraud in examining the case, and will so find it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-9\">III. The sixth section of the charter provides that the company shall have a lien on the real estate of the insured, and the incumbrances diminished the security of the company for assessments.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b159-10\">Eastman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AP\">The defendants. issued the policy in suit to Henry Dutton, on the 11th day of October, 1847, upon an application made and signed by him on the 5th of October, six days previous to the date of the policy. On the 26th day of August, 1848, the policy was duly assigned to the plaintiff, and the assignment approved by the company ; and on the third day of June, 1849, the property insured was consumed by fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">No controversy exists in regard to the plaintiff\u2019s right to bring the suit as the assignee of Henry Dutton, the insured, nor in regard to the destruction of the property; but the defence rests mainly upon two grounds: first, that there was a misrepresentation in the application for insurance\u2014 the application representing the property to be incumbered only to the amount of \u00a7300, whereas the defendants allege that it was in truth subject to a lien for labor and materials fur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>wished under the statute of Maine, and also that at the time of the issuing of the policy there was a further mortgage upon the property, which was executed on the 11th day of October, 1847, the day of the date of the policy' \u2014 and, second, that the case shows fraud, and that the policy is void on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">With regard to the incumbrances upon the property, one question only was put in the application, which was this: \u201c Is the property incumbered ?\u201d and the answer was \u201c $300.\u201d Was this answer a compliance with the charter and by-laws which formed a part of the contract of insurance between the parties, and was a true representation given as required.by general principles, and by their contract? The defendants contend that the answer was in fact a misrepresentation, and did not disclose all the incumbrances ; and if this be so, the action cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">It is said that there was a mechanic\u2019s lien upon the property. Was this so ? The statute of Maine upon this subject is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Section 37. Any person who shall performdabor or furnish materials for erecting, altering or repairing any house or other building or appurtenances, or furnish labor or materials for the above purposes, by virtue of any contract with the owner thereof, or other person who had contracted with such owner, shall have a lien to secure the payment of the same, upon such house or building, and the lot of land on which the same stands, and upon the right of redeeming the same when under mortgage; and such lien shall continue in force for the space of ninety days from the time when such payment becomes due.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">\u201c Section 38. Such person may secure the benefit of such lien by an attachment of such house or building, land or right of redemption, within thfe said ninety days; and such attachment shall have precedence of all other attachments, \u25a0not made under any such lien.\u201d Rev. Stat. of Maine, ch. 125, \u00a7\u00a7 37, 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Whether the claim of Hinckley &amp; Egery was of the character to be protected by this statute before it was settled by Dutton, in September, 1847, we do not propose to consider. The particulars of it are not given, nor the time when due, and we cannot see how much of it, if any, would fall within the purview of the statute. A portion of it appears to have been for machinery, and that is not in terms specified in the act; although, perhaps, it might be regarded as coming within its spirit.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Nor is it necessary to determine whether the lien created by this statute is an incumbrance contemplated by the application and the by-laws and charter of the company. No judicial construction has ever been put upon our statute in regard to the subject, that we are aware of. Our act is not so broad in its provisions as that of Maine, and it is not generally in force throughout the State, being confined in its application to those cities and towns which may adopt it. But, as observed, it is unnecessary to put any construction upon the act relied on by the defendants; for we think that the lien, whatever may have been its character, was terminated by the giving and receiving of the note of Dutton for the demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The account was against Eastman &amp; Dutton, and whatever was furnished was delivered to them. But on the 26th of September, 1847, prior to the application for the insurance and the issuing of the policy, Hinckley &amp; Egery took the note of Dutton alone, for the balance of the account. This note, as we understand the case, was taken in satisfaction of the account against Eastman &amp; Dutton, and the claim against them was thereby relinquished. Whatever lien, therefore, there may have been created by virtue of the contract to furnish the labor and materials, was lost by the new contract; and Hinckley &amp; Egery probably so understood it, for the mortgage to them of the whole property was about that time made out to secure the note. No attempt was ever made to enforce the lien, and the mortgage was ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>eeuted on the 11th of October, fifteen days after the note was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">But it is said that this mortgage of October 11, 1847, was an incumbrance, and makes void the policy. It is true it was an incumbrance from the time of its execution ; but whether it was executed before or after the issuing of the policy, (both bearing the same date,) does not appear; nor is it necessary to know, as it was not an incumbrance when the application was made ; and it was not the duty of the insured to notify the company of its execution. The charter and by-laws do not require any notice of subsequent incumbrances.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">If the assured stated his title to the property truly when he made his application, that was all that was required under this'charter. And this he did; the only incumbrance on the property at that time was the $300 mortgage. The mechanic\u2019s lien had become extinct on the 26th of September, and the mortgage to Hinckley &amp; Egery, although in contemplation, was not executed, and did not become an incumbrance' on the property till October 11th. It was no fault of the applicant that the policy was not issued immediately after the application was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">In our opinion, then, the policy cannot be avoided on the ground of misrepresentation or concealment of any incumbrances existing upon the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Neither do we think that the defendants stand any better upon their second position ; that of fraud. There may be facts disclosed in the case which would be competent evidence to be submitted to a jury on such a question ; but the court cannot infer fraud from what is set forth. All that is stated may have been done by Dutton, in honesty and good faith. Dilatoriness, although oftentimes as injurious to a creditor as fraud itself, is, nevertheless, not in itself fraud, nor can we, as a court, so find it.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">According to the provisions of the case there must be,</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
