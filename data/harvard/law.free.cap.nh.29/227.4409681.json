In the preamble of said act it is recited that John Pinkerton, Esq., of Londonderry, being desirous of giving to trustees, in said act to be appointed, certain lands or personal estate, to be by said trustees forever appropriated and expended for the support of a public school or academy in said Londonderry, \u2014 therefore it is enacted that there shall be established in said town an academy, for the purpose of promoting piety and virtue, and for the education of youth in such of the liberal arts and sciences or languages, as the trustees in the act appointed shall direct; that certain persons therein named shall be trustees of said academy, and shall be incorporated into a body politic by the name of the Pinkerton Academy; that said trustees, the longest livers and survivors of them, and their succesors, shall be the true and sole visitors, trustees and governors of said academy, with full power to elect such officers of the academy as they should judge necessary and convenient, and to make and ordain such laws, orders and rules for the government thereof as to them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>might seem fit, the same not being contrary to the constitution or laws of the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-5\">It further appeared in evidence that the plaintiff, for many years prior to the 24th of September, 1845, had been employed by the defendants as principal instructor in said academy, at an annual salary of $700. On the said 24th of September, a meeting of the board of trustees was duly held, at which proceedings were had as set forth in the following extract from the records of said trustees:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-6\">\u201c September 24, 1845. The trustees of the Pinkerton Academy met according to adjournment. The executive committee, who, in accordance with the suggestion of E. L. Parker, at the last meeting, were informally requested by a majority of the trustees to see Mr. A. F. Hildreth, in relation to the expediency of resigning his charge as principal of the academy, made their report, \u2014 that they had seen Mr. Hildreth, and that the following' resignation, with the conditions annexed, was the result of their meeting:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-7\">\u2018 To the trustees of Pinkerton Academy, Gentlemen : \u2014 I hereby tender to you my resignation as principal of Pinkerton Academy, to take effect at any future time when the trustees shall provide a suitable person to take charge of the institution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-8\">(Signed) A.

H.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-9\">The undersigned, who, as principal of the Pinkerton Academy, has had many years experience in teaching, will receive into his family from eight to ten lads, for the purpose of preparing them for college or the counting-room. He will not only devote his exclusive attention to the studies and recitations of his pupils during the hours assigned for that purpose, but will also pay particular attention to their deportment during those of relaxation and exercise. While resident in his family, they will at all times, both in health and sickness, be treated with parental care and kindness. They will be required, in company with himself and family, to attend public worship on the Sabbath. No lad will be received or retained whose habits are known to be vicious. The course of instruction will be thorough ; adapted to the capacity of the pupil and best suited to promote the exercise of his intellectual and moral powers. The Latin and Greek will be taught according to the much and justly admired system of Ollendorf, which it is believed greatly facilitates the progress of the pupil in acquiring a knowledge of these languages and tends to form, at the commencement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>of the collegiate course, a taste for the study of the classics. Imitation and frequent repetition, the means by which children learn their own language, should be practised in learning the languages of the ancient Greeks and Romans. In connection with other studies, the elements of vocal music will be taught. Particular attention will be paid to the elements of elocution and good reading. Being subjected to the constant watch and care of their instructor, parents may feel confident that the moral habits of their sons will be duly guarded and the proper improvement of their time secure. The year will be divided into three terms, commencing the first Wednesday in September, the last Wednesday in December, and the last Wednesday in April, \u2014 with three vacations, \u2014 two of two weeks each and one of six weeks. Tuition and board, including washing, fuel and light, will be $50 per term. The school will be opened on Wednesday, May 15,1850. As the first term will be only eleven weeks, the expense will be but $38.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-5\">(Signed) A. F. Hildreth.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-6\">That agreeably to said notice, the plaintiff kept in his said house a family school for boys from about said 15th of May, 1850, until after the commencement of this action, and had in his said school from six to ten pupils during the whole of said time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-7\">The defendants contended that upon the foregoing evidence no contract was proved upon which the plaintiff was entitled to recover, and that if a contract were shown upon which the plaintiff could recover, the circumstances proved in relation to the school kept by the plaintiff, in the immediate vicinity of Pinkerton Academy, constituted a defence to the action ; but the court, being inclined to the opinion that the evidence proved a contract upon which the plaintiff could maintain an action, and that those circumstances constituted no defence to the action, a verdict was taken by consent for the plaintiff, for the balance of six months\u2019 sal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>ary, with interest, being $150, and interest thereon, according to the votes of the 24th September, 1845, and of the 27th of July, 1847, being $210,75.

By Mr. Hildreth\u2019s agreement, he was bound to stay, while the trustees were not bound to retain him, unless for their interest or convenience. On this point, of such promise being an adequate consideration for the promise set forth in the declaration, see <em>Farmer </em>v. Stuart, 2 N. H. Rep. 100; <em>Underhill </em>v. <em>Gibson &amp; a. 2 </em>N. H. Rep. 352; <em>Violett </em>v. Patten, 5 Cranch. 142, 150, cited in U. S.

The power of the trustees to deal with the fund is undoubtedly limited to the uses and objects for which the fund was committed to their management by the founder of the institution, and they cannot legally appropriate it to granting gratuitous pensions or making presents. But their control over the property is, as certainly, coextensive with those objects, and whatever engagements they make within that scope they may be required to use the fund to fulfil.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">Among the very plain and unquestionable powers and duties which belong to those trustees, is the power and duty of employing and paying suitable teachers, in such manner that there may be an uninterrupted succession in the office, and that the course of instruction in the school may not be broken up. In doing this, there is required of them the exercise of the prudence, foresight and just economy which belong to men who manage their own affairs well. In this respect, great confidence has been reposed in them by the founder, and it would be a total perversion of his purposes and of the policy of the law, in protecting from vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Hence and officious interference of authority these beneficent provisions for society, to disturb them in the exercise of the functions which have been conferred upon them, so long as there is no evidence or surmise of fraud or gross incompetency.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">In the exercise of their office, the trustees, on the 24th of September, thought fit to provide for a change of preceptors of the academy, to take place at a time not then distant ; and this they wisely thought fit to do in a manner that should secure the office against a vacancy, and the school against interruption. To effect this, they entered into a contract with the plaintiff, which has become the subject of the present action. The effect of it, when divested of the terms of courtesy in which it was framed, is this. The plaintiff agrees to remain in office as principal of the institution, performing Its appropriate duties, till such time as the trustees shall appoint a successor, and. then to resign. The trustees, on their part, agree, in consideration that the plaintiff consents to remain in office, at their will and election, to pay him something more than the ordinary salary that had been paid, when the engagement had been for a year at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">That such a change in the terms of the plaintiff\u2019s engagement was one which the trustees might well have deemed a proper, prudent and necessary one to make, in view of providing for a change of incumbents, as furnishing those facilities for so doing without hazarding the continuance of the school, is, in our apprehension, a clear proposition. That the change subjected the plaintiff to inconveniences resulting from an uncertainty as to the time his employment would continue, rendering the increase of his compensation most reasonable to be exacted on his part, and to be conceded on the part of the trustees, seems to us equally clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The change secured to the academy a plain benefit, and was, as to the plaintiff, attended with obvious inconvenience and detriment, and, in either view, constituted a good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>and valid consideration for the undertaking on which the action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">It is not remarkable that the plaintiff should have forgotten or have never understood the extent and nature of the rights which grew out of the transaction of September 24, 1845, and should at any time have expressed an erroneous opinion concerning them. But this in no wise impairs his rights, provided his statements have not misled other parties, and caused them to pursue a different course from the one they would have pursued if the truth had been known to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The plaintiff, having resigned his connection with the Pinkerton Academy, with the approbation of the trustees, set up a private school. The bearing of this fact upon the case has not been pointed out in the notes furnished by counsel, neither is it perceived by the court. The plaintiff was a teacher by profession, and no reason appears to have existed why he might not have pursued his calling in the manner and at the time and place he chose to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\"><em>Judgment on the </em>verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
