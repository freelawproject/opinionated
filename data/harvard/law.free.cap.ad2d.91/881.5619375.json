For the reasons stated in Special Term\u2019s opinion of November 8,1982, we find that the fair market value of this parcel equaled or exceeded its assessed value for the tax years under discussion. While Special Term states in its opinion that it did not increase the assessed valuation for the tax years 1976/1977 to 1978/1979, its order, entered December 2, 1980, seems to raise the assessment for those years. For the sake of clarification, we modify the order to show that the assessments for all the years are being confirmed. Concur \u2014 Murphy, P. J., Carro, Bloom and Lynch, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
