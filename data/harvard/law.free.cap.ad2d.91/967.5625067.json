Order reversed insofar as appealed from, on the law, without costs or disbursements, and appellant\u2019s motion granted unconditionally. In his affidavit in opposition to appellant\u2019s motion, the plaintiff failed to (1) establish a reasonable excuse for his failure to comply with two previous orders of preclusion, and (2) make a prima facie showing of merit by an affidavit of a physician competent to attest to the meritorious nature of his claim. Accordingly, it was an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion to have afforded plaintiff a further opportunity to serve upon appellant a responsive bill of particulars and an authorization for North Shore University Hospital medical records (see <em>Barasch v Micucci, </em>49 NY2d 594; <em>Harris v Brooklyn Hosp. at Brooklyn Cumberland Med. Center, </em>81 AD2d 658; <em>Ferrigno v St. Charles Hosp., </em>86 AD2d 594). Titone, J. P., Thompson, Weinstein and Niehoff, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
