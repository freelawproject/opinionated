Order affirmed, with $50 costs and disbursements. Appellant failed to set forth facts showing either a meritorious cause of action or that its inordinate delay in moving to vacate its default was excusable (see <em>Barash v Micucci, </em>49 NY2d 594; <em>Abramowitz v Berger, </em>20 AD2d 903; <em>Pakula v Rodin, </em>66 AD2d 658).
