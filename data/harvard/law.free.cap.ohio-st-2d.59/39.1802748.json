See <em>State, ex rel. Mees, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 128. Where there is no evidence upon which the commission could have based \u2022its factual conclusion an abuse of discretion is present and mandamus becomes appropriate. <em>State, ex ret. Hutton, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Relator contends that the opinion of Dr. Koenigshcff does not constitute \u201cevidence\u201d upon which the commission could have based its decision. In <em>State, ex rel. Wallace, </em>v. <em>Indus Comm. </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St. 2d 55, and <em>State, ex rel. Rachow, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St. 2d 17, however, this court held that the opinion of a non-examining physician may constitute evidence before the commission to the extent that it is tantamount to a response to a hypothetical question. In other words, the non-examining physician must expressly accept all the findings of the examining physician, but may express his own conclusion based on those findings. Here, Dr. Koenigshoff expressly incorporates the report of Dr. Hein in his opinion and bases his conclusion that relator is not permanently and totally disabled due to the recognized disabilities under the claim on Dr. Hein\u2019s \u201cobjective physical findings.\u201d In particular, Dr. Koenigshoff notes Dr. Hein\u2019s finding of \u201cconsiderable degenerative osteoarthritis in his [relator\u2019s] lower spine,\u201d a condition never recognized in this claim. Neither Dr. Hein\u2019s report nor any other evidence in the record suggests that relator\u2019s arthritis is related to his August 5, 1969, industrial injury. In fact, while Dr. Hein concluded that relator is \u201cpermanently and totally disabled as far as his back is concerned,\u201d he does not state that disability was caused by relator\u2019s industrial injury. Thus, we believe that the decision of the commission that relator is not permanently and totally disabled is supported by some evidence. The fact that Dr. Hein is an orthopedic specialist while Dr. Koenis\u2019shoff is not extends merely to the weight that the commission may give the evidence, not its sufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Relator also contends that denial of his claim solely upon the opinion of a non-examining physician when an ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>amining specialist concludes that he is permanently and totally disabled violates his right to due process of law since that opinion is not competent evidence and it is the commission\u2019s practice to arbitrarily deny claims by referring them to staff doctors for only a cursory review. We have already determined that Dr. TCoenigshoff\u2019s opinion is competent evidence. Relator offers no proof that the commission refers claims to its medical staff to be arbitrarily denied. In fact, in <em>State, ex rel. General Motors, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm, </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 278, the commission found the claimant there was permanently and totally disabled despite Dr. Koenigshoff\u2019s opinion to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In conclusion, because the opinion of Dr. Koenigshoff \u2022constitutes evidence supporting the commission\u2019s denial of relator\u2019s motion for permanent and total 'disability, the commission did not abuse its discretion. Accordingly, relator\u2019s complaint for a writ of mandamus must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b101-7\">Cet.ebrkzze, O. J., Herbert, W. Brown, P.
