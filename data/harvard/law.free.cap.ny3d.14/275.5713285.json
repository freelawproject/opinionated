Under our decision in <em>Matter of Felix v New York City Dept. of Citywide Admin. Servs. </em>(3 NY3d 498 [2004]), the dismissals clearly were not disciplinary, and the employees\u2019 assertion that they were does not have a relationship with their collective bargaining agreement sufficient to justify arbitration of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Lauren Lanterman was a teacher employed by the Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS); Victor Ortiz was a counselor employed by the Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS). Though they worked for different agencies, Lanterman and Ortiz belonged to the same union, the New York State Public Employees Federation (PEF), and their rights were governed by the same collective bargaining agreement (CBA).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">Both Lanterman and Ortiz needed credentials for the jobs they held. A civil service classification standard, promulgated pursuant to Education Law \u00a7 112 (1) and 8 NYCRR 116.3 (b), required Lanterman to have a teaching certificate appropriate to her specialty. OASAS regulations, promulgated pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 19.07 (d), required Ortiz to have a credential as a credentialed alcoholism and substance abuse counselor (CASAC). Before the events leading to this litigation, Lanterman had a provisional teaching certificate, and Ortiz had a CASAC credential good for three years. Both of these credentials expired, and both Lanterman and Ortiz failed to obtain new ones. As a result, both were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>PEF filed grievances for Lanterman and Ortiz, claiming that their dismissals violated their rights under article 33 of the CBA. That article is entitled \u201cDISCIPLINE\u201d and begins with the following words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\">\u201c33.1 Applicability</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">\u201cThe disciplinary procedure set forth in this Article shall be in lieu of the procedure specified in Sections 75 and 76 of the Civil Service Law and shall apply to all persons currently subject to Sections 75 and 76 of the Civil Service Law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The stated purpose of article 33 is \u201cto provide a prompt, equitable and efficient procedure for the imposition of discipline for just cause\u201d (\u00a7 33.2). It prescribes a detailed \u201cdisciplinary procedure,\u201d beginning with a \u201cnotice of discipline,\u201d which may be followed by a \u201cdisciplinary grievance,\u201d which, if not otherwise resolved, may in turn become the subject of a \u201cdisciplinary arbitration\u201d (\u00a7 33.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">OCFS and CASAS rejected the grievances and the Governor\u2019s Office of Employee Relations upheld the rejections. The position of these agencies is that the grievances are not subject to arbitration because Lanterman\u2019s and Ortiz\u2019s dismissals were not for disciplinary reasons, but for the employees\u2019 failure to have the qualifications necessary for their jobs. PEF, Lanterman and Ortiz respond, in substance, that this itself is an arbitrable question. Under article 34 of the CBA, a \u201ccontract grievance,\u201d defined as \u201ca dispute concerning the interpretation, application or claimed violation of a specific term or provision of this Agreement\u201d (\u00a7 34.1 [a]), is an arbitrable dispute. PEF, Lanterman and Ortiz argue that, since they say that article 33\u2019s disciplinary procedures are available in their case, and the employers say they are not, a \u201cdispute, concerning the interpretation, application or claimed violation\u201d of a provision of the CBA exists. They thus seek an arbitration about what the contract means, to be followed, if they prevail, by a disciplinary procedure and perhaps a second, disciplinary, arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">PEF filed notices of intention to arbitrate on Lanterman\u2019s and Ortiz\u2019s behalf, and the state agencies brought these proceedings under CPLR article 75 to stay the arbitrations. Both employees prevailed in Supreme Court. In the Appellate Division, the cases were decided by the same panel on the same day <em>(Matter of New York State Off. of Children &amp; Family Servs. [Lanterman], </em>62 AD3d 1109 [3d Dept 2009]; <em>Matter of New York State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number><em>Off. of Alcoholism &amp; Substance Abuse Servs. [Ortiz], </em>62 AD3d 1118 [3d Dept 2009]). The judgment in Lanterman\u2019s favor was reversed, but that in Ortiz\u2019s favor was affirmed, with two Justices dissenting in each case. The reason for the contrasting results is that one Justice was persuaded by the state agencies\u2019 argument, made as to Lanterman but not as to Ortiz, that the proposed arbitration would violate public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In each case, the unsuccessful parties appeal to us as of right, pursuant to CPLR 5601 (a). We affirm in <em>Lanterman </em>and reverse in <em>Ortiz. </em>Because we conclude that neither grievance is arbitrable under the CBA, it is unnecessary for us to decide the public policy issue raised in <em>Lanterman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The question Lanterman and Ortiz seek to arbitrate is essentially the same question we decided in <em>Felix. </em>There, a New York City employee was dismissed for failing to establish city residence, which was a prerequisite to his employment under a local law. The employee sought a hearing under Civil Service Law \u00a7 75 (\u201cRemoval and other disciplinary action\u201d), but we rejected his claim, holding that the disciplinary provisions of the Civil Service Law did not apply to him. We explained that \u201cwhile an act of misconduct invokes Civil Service Law \u00a7 75 disciplinary procedures,\u201d an employee\u2019s failure to meet a residence requirement \u201cis separate and distinct from an act of misconduct\u201d (3 NY3d at 505). We approved the distinction made in <em>Mandelkern v City of Buffalo </em>(64 AD2d 279, 281 [4th Dept 1978, Simons, J.]) between issues of \u201cjob performance, misconduct or competency,\u201d which are subject to Civil Service Law disciplinary procedures, and \u201ca qualification of employment,\u201d which is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">In Felix\u2019s terms, the dismissals of Lanterman and Ortiz were plainly not disciplinary, but were for failure to meet qualifications of employment\u2014a teaching certificate in Lanterman\u2019s case, a CASAC credential in Ortiz\u2019s. The State does not claim that the employees have forfeited their jobs by misconduct. It claims that they do not have the qualifications that they must have to hold those jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">PEF, Lanterman and Ortiz try to distinguish <em>Felix </em>by arguing that these cases involve contractual, not statutory, disciplinary procedures. The argument is without merit, because the relevant contract clause, on its face, is made applicable to exactly those cases to which the statute would otherwise apply: the contractual disciplinary procedure is \u201cin lieu of the procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>specified in Sections 75 and 76 of the Civil Service Law\u201d and is applicable \u201cto all persons currently subject to Sections 75 and 76 of the Civil Service Law.\u201d <em>Felix </em>squarely holds that sections 75 and 76 are inapplicable to the grievances of Lanterman and Ortiz.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">PEF, Lanterman and Ortiz argue, in substance, that however weak their claim to be accorded disciplinary hearings may be, the claim is for an arbitrator, not a court, to decide. It is generally true that we distinguish \u201cbetween the merits of grievances and the threshold question of whether courts or arbitrators have the authority to decide the merits\u201d <em>(Matter of City of Johnstown [Johnstown Police Benevolent Assn.], </em>99 NY2d 273, 279 [2002]) and that \u201c[e]ven an apparent weakness of the claimed grievance is not a factor in the court\u2019s threshold determination\u201d <em>(Matter of Board of Educ. of Watertown City School Dist. [Watertown Educ. Assn.], </em>93 NY2d 132, 142 [1999]). These rules are applicable as long as a contractual interpretation is at least colorable, but it is not true that any claim, no matter how insubstantial, may be arbitrated. Under <em>Watertown, </em>the test is \u201cwhether there is a reasonable relationship between the subject matter of the dispute and the general subject matter of the CBA\u201d (93 NY2d at 143). We hold here, as we did in <em>Matter of Uniform Firefighters of Cohoes, Local 2562, IAFF, AFL-CIO v City of Cohoes </em>(94 NY2d 686, 694-695 [2000]), that the \u201creasonable relationship\u201d test is not met: \u201cdespite the breadth of the arbitration clause in the CBA, it cannot be construed to extend to arbitration of grievances which, as a matter of law, do not effectively allege any breach of the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Accordingly, in <em>Lanterman, </em>the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed with costs. In <em>Ortiz, </em>the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed with costs and the petition to stay arbitration granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b343-6\">Ciparick, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"ANW\">Because the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement (CBA) may be interpreted to manifest a clear intent to arbitrate the question of whether an employee who lacks the requisite credentials for employment can be terminated under the CBA\u2019s contract grievance and discipline procedures, I respectfully dissent and would compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">In both of these cases the majority permanently stays arbitration, holding that the parties to the CBA did not agree to arbitrate their disputes involving termination of employees who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>did not maintain professional credentials. The effect of this ruling is to deny the employees disciplinary due process, as established in the CBA, and permit their summary termination. It has long been settled that a dispute is arbitrable if the arbitration is not barred by \u201cany statutory, constitutional or public policy\u201d and the parties \u201cin fact agreed to arbitrate the particular dispute\u201d <em>(Matter of County of Chautauqua v Civil Serv. Empls. Assn., Local 1000, AFSCME, AFL-CIO, County of Chautauqua Unit 6300, Chautauqua County Local 807, </em>8 NY3d 513, 519 [2007] [internal quotation marks omitted]). We have read the second of these requirements broadly; if there is a \u201creasonable relationship between the subject matter of the dispute and the general subject matter of the CBA,\u201d the dispute is arbitrable <em>(Matter of Board of Educ. of Watertown City School Dist. [Watertown Educ. Assn.], </em>93 NY2d 132, 143 [1999]). The arbitrator can then \u201cmake a more exacting interpretation of the precise scope of the substantive provisions of the CBA, and whether the subject matter of the dispute fits within them\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Under the CBA at issue here between New York State and the New York State Public Employees Federation (PEF), it would not be unreasonable for an arbitrator to conclude that the parties agreed to arbitrate this dispute. As the majority notes, article 34 of the CBA defines a \u201ccontract grievance\u201d as \u201ca dispute concerning the interpretation, application, or claimed violation of a specific term or provision of this Agreement\u201d (\u00a7 34.1 [a]). Because PEF, Lanterman, and Ortiz claim that the employers violated the procedural mandates of article 33 of the CBA, their claims fall under this definition. Notably, prior to these two matters, the State and PEF had a long-standing practice of following the disciplinary process set forth in article 33 whenever state agencies sought to terminate employees for lack of credentials. Whether article 33\u2019s disciplinary procedure applies here is undoubtedly a dispute over the application of a term of the CBA and, therefore, it should be resolved by the arbitrator, not a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">This result is buttressed by our traditionally expansive reading of CBA arbitration clauses as a means of resolving public sector labor disputes. Generally, if a court \u201cdetermine[s] that the arbitration clause is broad enough to encompass the subject matter of the dispute, \u2018[t]he question of the scope of the substantive provisions of the contract is itself a matter of contract interpretation and application, and hence it must be deemed a matter for resolution by the arbitrator\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number><em>Educ. of Watertown City School Dist. v Watertown Educ. Assn., </em>74 NY2d 912, 913 [1989], quoting <em>Board of Educ. of Lakeland Cent. School Dist. of Shrub Oak v Barni, </em>49 NY2d 311, 314 [1980]). This is true even where the substantive merits of a claim are weak <em>(Matter of Franklin Cent. School [Franklin Teachers Assn.], </em>51 NY2d 348, 357 [1980]).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (GA-SAS), the Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS), and the Governor\u2019s Office of Employee Relations (GOER) argue that Ortiz and Lanterman\u2019s terminations were not based on \u201cmisconduct or incompetence\u201d and, thus, were not disciplinary actions. However, this \u201cincompetency or misconduct\u201d language comes from Civil Service Law \u00a7 75, which article 33 of the CBA supplants. Instead, the CBA provides that discipline may be imposed for \u201cjust cause.\u201d It would certainly be reasonable for an arbitrator to determine that, as Lanterman and Ortiz argue, failure to maintain a license constitutes \u201cjust cause\u201d for discipline under the CBA. Because addressing this claim requires an interpretation of the CBA and the arbitrator alone has the power to determine the scope of the contract provisions, the dispute should be arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In holding otherwise, the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Matter of Felix v New York City Dept. of Citywide Admin. Servs. </em>(3 NY3d 498 [2004]) is misplaced, since that case did not involve a CBA or any language of comparable breadth to that used in article 34. In <em>Felix, </em>we interpreted a provision of the Administrative Code of the City of New York requiring a municipal employee to maintain a residence within the city and the statutory language of Civil Service Law \u00a7 75. The majority asserts that because article 33 replaces the procedure of Civil Service Law \u00a7 75, the contract language should be interpreted as we interpreted section 75 in <em>Felix, </em>where we distinguished between failure to comply with requirements that define eligibility and acts of misconduct or incompetence. In these cases, however, we are interpreting contractual language, including a provision specifying that any disputes regarding the interpretation of that language are themselves arbitrable. Moreover, section 12-120 of the New York City Administrative Code\u2014the employment requirement at issue in Felix\u2014expressly provides that failure to maintain residency constitutes a forfeiture of employment <em>(id. </em>at 502, citing Administrative Code of City of NY \u00a7 12-120). Here, because no specific statutory provision calls for automatic forfeiture of employment upon the loss of certification, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>arbitrator would have discretion to fashion a remedy. Furthermore, the notice and opportunity to contest procedures contained in the Administrative Code satisfied due process concerns in <em>Felix, </em>but are not available here.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Since I believe that the parties agreed to arbitrate these disputes, it is necessary to consider whether any public policy precludes the arbitration. I know of no such policy and, contrary to the Appellate Division\u2019s dispositive finding in <em>Lanterman, </em>do not think that the public policy of having well-qualified, certified teachers precludes arbitration here. A dispute is nonarbitrable if a court can \u201cconclude, without engaging in any extended factfinding or legal analysis that a law [or policy] prohibits, in an absolute sense, the particular matters to be decided\u201d by arbitration <em>(County of Chautauqua, </em>8 NY3d at 519, quoting <em>Matter of New York City Tr. Auth. v Transport Workers Union of Am., Local 100, AFL-CIO, </em>99 NY2d 1, 8-9 [2002] [internal quotation marks and brackets omitted]). \u201cPut differently, a court must stay arbitration where it can conclude, upon examining the parties\u2019 contract and the implicated statute on their face, \u2018that the granting of <em>any </em>relief would violate public policy\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>quoting <em>Matter of City of New York v Uniformed Fire Officers Assn., Local 854, IAFF, AFL-CIO, </em>95 NY2d 273, 284 [2000]). Here, although the law clearly prohibits the parties\u2019 continued employment in their current positions without the requisite licensing, it does not require their termination; other remedies may be available.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In Lanterman\u2019s case, OCFS and GOER argue that arbitration of Lanterman\u2019s termination was barred by public policy,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but they fail to demonstrate that any relief granted by the arbitrator would violate public policy <em>(see Matter of Committee of Interns &amp; Residents [Dinkins], </em>86 NY2d 478, 484 [1995]; <em>County of Chautauqua, </em>8 NY3d at 519). For example, in keeping with the expansive powers of an arbitrator, Lanterman could have been suspended without pay<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> until she received her certification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>or she could have been reassigned to a non-teaching position.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the regulations of the Education Department provide that \u201c[a]ll professional instructional personnel shall have the required certificates as set forth in Part 80 of this Title\u201d (8 NYCRR 116.3 [b]), the law nowhere expresses that a lapsed certificate will result in immediate termination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Indeed, in previous cases where we have found that public policy favors termination of a tenured civil servant without a hearing, the applicable statute or regulation has made that policy clear. For example, the federal Hatch Act expressly provides that an employee employed in connection with a program financed by federal funds is subject to discharge if he or she becomes a candidate for partisan elected office (5 USC \u00a7\u00a7 1502-1506). Similarly, Public Officers Law \u00a7 30 provides for the forfeiture by law of employment for conviction of a felony, and section 12-120 of the New York City Administrative Code expressly provides that failure to maintain residency constitutes a forfeiture of employment <em>(see Felix, </em>3 NY3d at 502). Here, in stark contrast, no specific statutory provision calls for the automatic forfeiture of employment upon a loss of certification. Thus, the public policy exception to arbitrability of a dispute should not apply here and we should maintain our clear policy of discouraging judicial interference with public sector arbitration, as contemplated by the Taylor Law (Civil Service Law art 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Therefore, in <em>Lanterman, </em>I would reverse the order of the Appellate Division, dismiss the petition to stay arbitration, and grant the cross motion to compel arbitration. In <em>Ortiz, </em>I would affirm the Appellate Division order that dismissed the petition to stay arbitration and granted the cross motion to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Judges Graffeo, Read, Pigott and Jones concur with Judge Smith; Judge Ciparick dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Chief Judge Lippman concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>In <em>Matter of New York State Off. of Children &amp; Family Serus. v Lanterman: </em>Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Judges Graffeo, Read, Pigott and Jones concur with Judge Smith; Judge Ciparick dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion in which Chief Judge Lippman concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">In <em>Matter of New York State Off. of Alcoholism &amp; Substance Abuse Servs. v </em>Ortiz: Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-7\">. OASAS and GOER do not press a public policy argument in the Ortiz case, but merely contend that the dispute is not arbitrable as a contract grievance under article 34 of the CBA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\">. OCFS maintains that article 33 of the CBA prohibits the suspension of Lanterman without pay pending the resolution of a disciplinary proceeding. Article 33 provides that OCFS may suspend an employee pending a full hearing before an arbitrator where OCFS determines that probable cause exists that the employee\u2019s \u201ccontinued presence on the job . . . would severely interfere with operations\u201d (\u00a7 33.4 [a] [1]). Of course, an arbitrator can address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>whether the lack of professional certification constitutes \u201csevere interference\u201d with operations and what, if any, remedy is appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b347-9\">. Article 33 of the CBA contemplates this remedy and provides that \u201c[w]here the appointing authority has determined that an employee is to be temporarily reassigned pursuant to this Article, the employee shall be notified in writing of the location of such temporary reassignments and . . . such reassignment may involve the performance of out-of-title work\u201d (\u00a7 33.4 [b] [1]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b347-10\">. Similarly, OASAS\u2019 automatic dismissal of Ortiz from service for failure to maintain a required credential may not be appropriate under the circumstances and there may be other available remedies for an arbitrator to fashion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
