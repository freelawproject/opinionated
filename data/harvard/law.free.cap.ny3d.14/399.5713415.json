We hold that the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>of the parties\u2019 agreement, read in context, shows that the buyer did assume those liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">In 1970, American Standard, Inc. sold its Kewanee Boiler division to Kewanee Boiler Corp., now known as OakFabco, Inc. (OakFabco). The parties entered an asset purchase and sale agreement which described the purpose of the transaction in the following words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">\u201cSeller desires to sell, and Buyer desires to purchase, substantially all the assets of Seller, real and personal, tangible and intangible belonging to it, which are used in connection with Seller\u2019s [Kewanee Boiler] business and operations . . . subject to all debts, liabilities, and obligations connected with or attributable to such business and operations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">The agreement said that OakFabco would purchase \u201cKewanee Assets\u201d subject to \u201cKewanee Liabilities.\u201d The term \u201cKewanee Liabilities\u201d was defined as \u201call the debts, liabilities, obligations and commitments (fixed or contingent) connected with or attributable to Kewanee existing and outstanding at the Closing Date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">The boilers manufactured by Kewanee had been insulated with asbestos, and as a result many tort claims were brought in the years and decades following the purchase of the business. Some of those claims were brought by plaintiffs who had suffered injuries after the closing of the transaction, allegedly attributable to boilers manufactured and sold before the closing. In this declaratory judgment action brought by American Standard against OakFabco, the issue is whether liabilities for such injuries were among the \u201cKewanee Liabilities\u201d that OakFabco assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">On cross motions for summary judgment, Supreme Court held that these liabilities were assumed by OakFabco, and entered a declaratory judgment accordingly <em>(American Std., Inc. v Oakfabco, Inc., </em>26 Misc 3d 1216[A], 2008 NY Slip Op 52705[U]). The Appellate Division affirmed Supreme Court\u2019s declaration with minor changes, and also granted American Standard\u2019s request \u201cto permanently enjoin [OakFabco] from relitigating its assumption of the aforementioned obligations in any forum\u201d <em>(American Std., Inc. v Oakfabco, Inc., </em>58 AD3d 485, 486 [1st Dept 2009]). We granted leave to appeal (12 NY3d 712 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>[2009]), and now affirm the Appellate Division\u2019s declaration, but modify its order by vacating the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">American Standard\u2019s position\u2014that OakFabco assumed all tort liabilities arising out of boilers manufactured by the Kewanee Boiler division, whether the injury was suffered before or after American Standard sold the division\u2014is strongly supported by the purpose of the transaction, as described in the agreement itself: It was a purchase and sale of substantially all the assets of the Kewanee Boiler business \u201csubject to all debts, liabilities, and obligations connected with or attributable to such business and operations.\u201d Nothing in the nature of the transaction suggests that the parties intended OakFabco, which got all the assets, to escape any of the related obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">OakFabco, however, argues that the definition of \u201cKewanee Liabilities\u201d\u2014the liabilities OakFabco assumed\u2014is less broad than the purpose of the transaction would imply. It stresses the words \u201cexisting and outstanding\u201d in the definition\u2014\u201call the debts, liabilities, obligations and commitments . . . <em>existing and outstanding </em>at the Closing Date\u201d (emphasis added). According to OakFabco, a tort claim cannot be \u201cexisting and outstanding\u201d before the tort plaintiff has been injured, because until then it is not possible for a tort lawsuit to be brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">If the words \u201cliabilities . . . existing and outstanding\u201d were read in isolation, OakFabco\u2019s interpretation of them would be plausible. Indeed, we adopted a similar interpretation of similar language, \u201cliabilities . . . which exist at the Closing Date,\u201d in <em>Grant-Howard Assoc. v General Housewares Corp. </em>(63 NY2d 291, 295 [1984]). But the transaction at issue in <em>Grant-Howard </em>was of a different kind from the one we are now considering.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">The defendant in <em>Grant-Howard, </em>General Housewares Corporation, had entered into a \u201cReorganization Agreement\u201d with Holt Howard Associates, Inc. by which General Housewares bought substantially all of Holt Howard\u2019s assets, but carefully limited its assumption of liabilities. The agreement provided that General Housewares would not \u201cbe liable for any damages, claims, losses, liabilities or expenses . . . with respect to any liabilities, obligations or other commitments not assumed\u201d <em>(id.). </em>By contrast, the agreement in this case shows that OakFabco simply took over all of American</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Standard\u2019s Kewanee Boiler business; nothing in the purchase and sale agreement suggests an intention to leave any obligations related to that business behind.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">That there was no such intention is made clear by a clause in the agreement relating to certain obligations owed to the boiler division\u2019s customers. The agreement said that the buyer would deliver at the closing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">\u201cAn executed undertaking wherein the Buyer will assume and agree to pay, and defend and hold Seller harmless against, all Kewanee Liabilities, including, by way of specification but not limitation, the following: . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">\u201c(iii) warranty, service, repair and return obligations of Kewanee and other claims and complaints arising out of or in connection with any products manufactured, sold, leased or installed by Kewanee on or prior to the Closing Date . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">This language clearly meant that the buyer would deal with any problems customers had after the closing date with boilers that had been installed previously. It would have been absurd for OakFabco to tell a customer whose boiler failed after the closing that, since the customer\u2019s claim was not \u201cexisting and outstanding\u201d on the closing date, it was not OakFabco\u2019s problem. By including warranty, service, repair and return claims of this kind in the definition of \u201cKewanee Liabilities,\u201d the parties demonstrated that they were not reading the words \u201cexisting and outstanding\u201d as OakFabco would have us read them.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">We therefore agree with the Appellate Division that the liabilities assumed by OakFabco include claims brought by tort claimants injured after the closing date by boilers installed before that date. The Appellate Division erred, however, in enjoining OakFabco from ever relitigating this issue. As a general rule, parties are allowed to take any position they like in litigation, as long as they can make a good faith argument for it, and we see no reason to make an exception to that rule here. It may well be that our decision today will <em>preclude </em>OakFabco from relitigating the issue we decide, in the sense that any attempt to relitigate it should be rejected; but OakFabco should not be <em>enjoined </em>from arguing otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified by vacating the award of injunctive relief and as so modified affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
