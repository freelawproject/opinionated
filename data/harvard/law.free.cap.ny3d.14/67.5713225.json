There is no legal basis for application of any toll or extension of the statute of limitations other than the one-year extension provided in CPLR 210 (a), which, in this case, was not needed. <em>(Pierson v City of New York, </em>56 NY2d 950; <em>Cohen v Pearl Riv.

Corp. </em>(78 NY2d 687 [1991]) is not available for personal injury claims. We therefore affirm the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Plaintiff Eugenia Brennan Heslin is the administrator of the estate of the decedent, Egypt Phillips. Egypt, born in May 2001, lived with her two young sisters and their mother Tanya Rose. Egypt\u2019s biological father, a convicted felon, had abandoned her. In early 2004, Rose\u2019s boyfriend, James Smith, moved in with the family. In May and again in August 2004, Egypt was taken to health care facilities for treatment of various injuries, including a broken clavicle and head trauma. According to plaintiff, these instances of suspected abuse were reported to defendants County of Greene, County of Greene Mental Health, County of Greene Department of Social Services and/or County of Greene Child Protective Services (collectively, the County defendants). Following the August incident, Smith was apparently ordered to leave the family home. However, on November 21, 2004, Egypt died tragically as a result of injuries intentionally inflicted upon her by Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">About two weeks later, Smith and Rose were each charged in connection with Egypt\u2019s death. Rose pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide and was subsequently sentenced to a prison term of 1\u2153 to 4 years. Following a jury trial, Smith was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to a term of 25 years to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">In December 2004, shortly after Egypt\u2019s death, plaintiff was appointed as the attorney for the children, Egypt\u2019s sisters, in connection with an abuse and neglect proceeding pending in Family Court against Smith and Rose. In addition to serving as attorney for the children (formerly referred to as a law guardian) in Family Court, Surrogate\u2019s Court appointed her as the administrator of Egypt\u2019s estate in October 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">Until plaintiff\u2019s application, no one had petitioned Surrogate\u2019s Court to handle the administration of Egypt\u2019s estate under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>SCPA 1001 and 707. Rose and the biological father were each disqualified because of their felony status <em>(see </em>SCPA 707 [1] [d]). Although the task would have ordinarily fallen to Egypt\u2019s siblings under the priority of decedent\u2019s relatives established in SCPA 1001 (1), they too were ineligible based on their infancy <em>(see </em>SCPA 707 [1] [a]). Because no other relative sought to be appointed guardian for the siblings under article 17 of the SCPA, they had no adult representative who could function as the administrator or consent to anyone else assuming that role <em>(see </em>SCPA 1001 [2], [6]). Out of concern for the fate of Egypt\u2019s siblings, plaintiff pursued appointment as administrator pursuant to the fallback provision of SCPA 1001 (8) (b), allowing any qualified \u201cpetitioner\u201d to become an administrator in the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">In the course of fulfilling her duties as attorney for the children and administrator of Egypt\u2019s estate, plaintiff determined that Egypt\u2019s siblings had potential claims against the County defendants and private individuals based on their alleged negligence contributing to Egypt\u2019s death at the hands of Smith. On November 16, 2006, plaintiff served a notice of claim on the County defendants in her capacity as administrator of Egypt\u2019s estate. Five days later, plaintiff commenced this action against the County defendants alleging causes of action for wrongful death and personal injury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Any damages recovered would ultimately benefit the siblings as Egypt\u2019s sole distributees by intestacy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff simultaneously moved pursuant to General Municipal Law \u00a7 50-e (5) for leave to file a late notice of claim for the personal injury cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Supreme Court granted the motion and extended the time to serve the notice of claim to November 16, 2006, the date it was actually filed (15 Misc 3d 1102[A], 2007 NY Slip Op 50464[U]). Initially, the court determined that the wrongful death claim was timely because the notice of claim was filed within 90 days from plaintiff\u2019s appointment as administrator and the action was commenced within two years of Egypt\u2019s death, as required by statute <em>(see </em>General Municipal Law \u00a7 50-e [1] [a]; \u00a7 50-i [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Turning to the personal injury cause of action, the court found that the notice of claim was untimely because it was not filed within 90 days after the claim arose. Recognizing that it lacked the discretion to extend the time beyond the expiration of the applicable one-year-and-90-day limitations period, the court relied on our decision in <em>Hernandez v New York City Health &amp; Hosps. Corp. </em>(78 NY2d 687 [1991]) to conclude that the toll afforded by CPLR 208 applied, based on the infancy of Egypt\u2019s siblings, and, as a result, the statute of limitations did not begin to run until plaintiffs appointment as administrator in October 2006. In <em>Hernandez, </em>this Court held that the CPLR 208 infancy toll applies when an infant is the sole distributee in a wrongful death action. Relying on the factors in General Municipal Law \u00a7 50-e (5), the court granted plaintiff leave to file the late notice of claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The Appellate Division reversed and dismissed the personal injury claim, but agreed that the wrongful death claim was timely (53 AD3d 996 [3d Dept 2008]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court held that Supreme Court lacked discretion to enlarge the time to serve the late notice of claim because the personal injury claim was time-barred, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">\u201cSupreme Court\u2019s reliance on the infancy toll of CPLR 208, on behalf of decedent\u2019s infant distributees, to extend the statute of limitations on the personal injury claim was not proper inasmuch as such a claim is brought on behalf of decedent and is personal to her, not her surviving infant distributees\u201d (i<em>d. </em>at 998).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">We granted plaintiff leave to appeal (12 NY3d 702 [2009]).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">EPTL 11-3.2 (b), referred to as the \u201csurvival statute,\u201d provides that \u201c[n]o cause of action for injury to person or property is lost because of the death of the person in whose favor the cause of action existed. For any injury an action may be brought or continued by the personal representative of the decedent.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a condition precedent to initiating a personal injury action against a municipality, a notice of claim must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>served within 90 days after the claim arises <em>(see </em>General Municipal Law \u00a7 50-e [1] [a]). The action must also be commenced within the statutorily prescribed one-year-and-90-day limitations period <em>(see </em>General Municipal Law \u00a7 50-i [1]). Although a court is authorized to extend the filing of a notice of claim beyond the 90-day period, the time for filing may not be extended beyond the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations <em>(see </em>General Municipal Law \u00a7 50-e [5]).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">In this case, Egypt first sustained injuries at some point in early 2004 and died on November 21, 2004. Since a notice of claim was not filed within 90 days of her death, leave to file a late notice was necessary. The personal injury claim accrued no later than the date of her death and, absent the application of a toll, the one-year-and-90-day limitations period expired in February 2006. Because the request for leave to file a late notice was not made within that time frame, as mandated by General Municipal Law \u00a7 50-e (5), an extension of time to file such notice is not statutorily authorized unless the limitations period was tolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Plaintiff asserts that the statute of limitations for the personal injury cause of action was tolled under CPLR 208 due to the infancy of Egypt\u2019s sole distributees\u2014her sisters.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In particular, plaintiff submits that Supreme Court appropriately applied the rationale of <em>Hernandez, </em>which held that CPLR 208 tolls the statute of limitations where the sole distributee in a wrongful death action is an infant, to this personal injury claim. While the dissent adopts this position, we cannot agree based on the fundamental distinction between the natures of the two claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">In <em>Hernandez, </em>the decedent died intestate in April 1987 in a facility operated by defendant New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, leaving her infant son as her sole distributee. Letters of guardianship were issued to the infant\u2019s grandmother in December 1987 and an administrator of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>estate was appointed with the guardian\u2019s consent later that month. In February 1988, the administrator was granted leave to file a late notice of claim. But she did not commence a wrongful death action until December 1988, more than one year and 90 days after decedent\u2019s death.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant moved to dismiss the wrongful death action as time-barred. On appeal, a majority of this Court concluded that the action was timely by virtue of the CPLR 208 infancy toll, holding that where the only distributee is an infant, the distributee\u2019s infancy serves to toll the limitations period \u201cuntil the earliest moment there is a personal representative or potential personal representative who can bring the action,\u201d which the Court stated would occur upon the \u201cappointment of a guardian or majority of the distributee, whichever occurs first\u201d (78 NY2d at 693).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In reaching this result in <em>Hernandez, </em>we were careful to limit our analysis to wrongful death actions authorized by EPTL 5-4.1, emphasizing that such claims belong to a decedent\u2019s distributees rather than the estate standing in place of the decedent. For example, we observed that \u201cany damages recovered are exclusively for the benefit of the decedent\u2019s distributees\u201d and that \u201cthe cause of action is not part of and bears no legal relationship to decedent\u2019s estate\u201d <em>(id. </em>[internal quotation marks and citations omitted]). Moreover, any damages must be \u201cmeasured by the effect of the wrongful act on the distributees\u2014the pecuniary loss suffered by the individual distributees as a result of decedent\u2019s death\u201d <em>(id.). </em>In contrast, we noted that a personal injury action brought under EPTL 11-3.2 (b) seeks damages for an injury to the decedent and belongs to the estate. Finally, we stressed that in a wrongful death case involving a sole infant distributee, it is the \u201cinfant child who has suffered any loss recognized by law\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Hence, even though CPLR 208 applies when the \u201cperson entitled to commence an action is under a disability because of infancy\u201d\u2014and the person entitled to bring a wrongful death claim under EPTL 5-4.1 is the estate\u2019s \u201cpersonal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>representative\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\u2014in <em>Hernandez </em>we employed the CPLR 208 toll based on the infancy of the distributee himself. In that unique context, where no personal representative was otherwise available, it was reasonable to look to the distributee\u2019s infancy status because the wrongful death claim belonged to him and would compensate him for damages that he directly sustained as a result of his mother\u2019s death. As we put it, the distributee was \u201cthe only person . . . whose interests are at stake in bringing this [wrongful death] action\u201d (78 NY2d at 693). In effect, we treated the distributee as the plaintiff under the tolling statute because, for all intents and purposes, the claim was his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Following <em>Hernandez, </em>Appellate Division case law has consistently declined to extend the toll rule fashioned in <em>Hernandez </em>outside the wrongful death context <em>(see Matter of Hidalgo v New York City Health &amp; Hosps. Corp., </em>210 AD2d 481, 482-483 [2d Dept 1994]; <em>Kemp v City of New York, </em>208 AD2d 684, 686 [2d Dept 1994]; <em>see also Baker v Bronx Lebanon Hosp. Ctr., </em>53 AD3d 21, 23 [1st Dept 2008]).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These courts recognized that, unlike a wrongful death claim that directly compensates a decedent\u2019s distributees for their own damages, a personal injury claim is designed to compensate the decedent for injuries suffered and is personal to the deceased\u2014in other words, it is a claim assumed by the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">In the present case, the Appellate Division acted in accord with these precedents <em>(see Heslin v County of Greene, </em>53 AD3d 996, 998 [3d Dept 2008]), and we believe it correctly drew a distinction between the two causes of action in holding that <em>Hernandez </em>should be limited to the wrongful death arena. As we explained in <em>Hernandez </em>itself, a wrongful death action belongs to the decedent\u2019s distributees and is designed to compensate the distributees themselves for their pecuniary losses as a result of the wrongful act <em>(see </em>EPTL 5-4.3). The proceeds are paid directly to the distributees in the proportions directed by the court, determined by their respective monetary injuries <em>(see </em>EPTL 5-4.4). In comparison, a personal injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>action on behalf of the deceased under EPTL 11-3.2 (b) seeks recovery for the conscious pain and suffering of the deceased and any damages awarded accrue to the estate <em>(see Ratka v St. Francis Hosp., </em>44 NY2d 604, 609 [1978]). Such a claim is personal to the deceased and belongs to the estate, not the distributees. The types of damages that are recoverable are different and the calculations of damages for the two claims are based on separate factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Moreover, because it is the estate that recovers in a personal injury action, any proceeds will first be applied to outstanding liens, debts or expenses <em>(see </em>EPTL 4-1.1, 13-1.3; SCPA 1811). Only after the obligations of the estate are fulfilled would any remaining funds be paid to beneficiaries or distributees. This is in stark contrast to the damages recoverable in a wrongful death action, where any proceeds are generally not subject to the claims of the estate\u2019s creditors <em>(see </em>9 Warren\u2019s Heaton, Surrogate\u2019s Court Practice \u00a7 122.02 [4] [c], at 122-42 [7th ed]). In short, the two causes of action are \u201cpredicated on essentially different theories of loss which accrue to different parties\u201d <em>(Ratka, </em>44 NY2d at 609).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Unlike the infant distributee in <em>Hernandez, </em>who was the only party that \u201csuffered any loss recognized by law\u201d as the beneficiary of a wrongful death claim <em>(Hernandez, </em>78 NY2d at 693), the infant distributees here do not seek to recover their own damages through a personal injury claim. Rather, they hope to inherit through intestacy any damages that their sister would have been entitled to had she survived. The rationale underlying Hernandez\u2014that a court may take into account the infancy of the distributee because the wrongful death claim belongs to and is for the \u201csole benefit\u201d of the distributee <em>(id. </em>at 694 n 5)\u2014 simply does not apply here, despite the sympathetic plight of Egypt\u2019s siblings. Put differently, the necessary connection between infant distributees and a personal injury action brought on behalf of the deceased under EPTL 11-3.2 (b) is missing since such a claim redresses a wrong suffered by the deceased, not the distributees.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Plaintiff nevertheless urges that the tolling rule adopted by <em>Hernandez </em>should apply with equal force to personal injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>actions because EPTL 11-3.2 (b), like EPTL 5-4.1, authorizes a \u201cpersonal representative\u201d to bring the action and, in this case, Egypt\u2019s siblings would be the ultimate beneficiaries of any damages recovered under either claim. Plaintiff points out that no personal representative existed to bring the personal injury action until her appointment as administrator in October 2006, after the statute of limitations had expired. Despite that unfortunate occurrence, we cannot disregard the fundamental legal distinction between the two causes of action, and the argument of the plaintiff and dissent would result in a rule that is unsupported by the key jurisprudential underpinning of <em>Her</em>nandez\u2014the unique status of a distributee as the direct beneficiary and source of a wrongful death claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In fact, it is notable that EPTL 11-3.1, a catchall provision, similarly enables a \u201cpersonal representative\u201d to commence all other types of action that survive the decedent\u2019s death. Taken to its logical conclusion, plaintiffs position would result in the application of the CPLR 208 toll to any cause of action belonging to a decedent\u2014adult and infant alike\u2014who leaves only infant distributees. A decedent\u2019s personal claims could potentially be pursued more than a decade later on the basis that an infant distributee would be entitled to any damages recovered by the estate through intestate succession.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The adoption of such a rule, impinging on the settled policies underlying statutes of repose, must be made by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">We therefore conclude that Supreme Court improperly relied on the CPLR 208 toll to permit a late notice of claim for the personal injury action based on the infancy of the decedent\u2019s siblings. Because the applicable statute of limitations expired before the filing of a late notice of claim, the Appellate Division correctly denied the motion and dismissed the personal injury claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-7\">.

Before 1935, although a decedent\u2019s claims based in contract and injury to property survived and could be maintained by the estate\u2019s representative, any personal injury cause of action abated upon death <em>(see Herzog v Stern, </em>264 NY 379, 383 [1934], <em>cert denied </em>293 US 597 [1934]; <em>see also </em>former Decedent Estate Law \u00a7\u00a7 116, 117, 118, 119, 120). Recognizing the inequity in treating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>personal injury claims differently, the Legislature amended the relevant statutes in 1935 to provide that such claims also survive a decedent\u2019s death (see L 1935, ch 795; <em>see also </em>former Decedent Estate Law \u00a7\u00a7 118, 119, presently codified at EPTL 11-3.2). Consequently, all tort and contract actions that belonged to a decedent may now be maintained by the estate\u2019s personal representative (see EPTL 11-3.1, 11-3.2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b134-12\">. CPLR 208 provides, in relevant part: \u201cIf a person entitled to commence an action is under a disability because of infancy ... at the time the cause of action accrues, and the time otherwise limited for commencing the action . . . is less than three years, the time shall be extended by the period of disability.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b135-7\">.

We, too, have declined to read <em>Hernandez </em>broadly. Notably, we did not see fit to apply the <em>Hernandez </em>toll on behalf of infant beneficiaries of a wrongful death claim where the decedent\u2019s will named an executrix who could have timely commenced an action on the infants\u2019 behalf (see <em>Baez v New York City Health &amp; Hosps.

The dissent criticizes our reliance on <em>Ratka </em>in emphasizing that wrongful death claims are materially different from personal injury actions.

For example, suppose the adult decedent in <em>Hernandez </em>possessed a breach of contract claim against XYZ Corporation.

But the distributee\u2019s infancy should be irrelevant under CPLR 208, which provides a toll based on the plaintiffs infancy, not the infancy of a distributee who inherits through intestacy any damages accruing to the estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b138-8\">Ciparick, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"Ave\">Because I believe that plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>administrator of the estate of the infant decedent whose sole distributees are her infant sisters, is entitled to the infancy toll pursuant to CPLR 208 in this personal injury action as we applied it in <em>Hernandez v New York City Health &amp; Hosps. Corp. </em>(78 NY2d 687 [1991]), I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Here, as in <em>Hernandez, </em>the decedent died intestate, survived only by infant distributees. However, the majority opines that the rule we announced in <em>Hernandez </em>cannot apply to a personal injury cause of action for conscious pain and suffering because of the \u201cfundamental distinction between the natures\u201d of personal injury claims and wrongful death claims (majority op at 74). The majority observes that the two claims are predicated on different theories of loss and are compensable by different measures of damages <em>(see id. </em>at 76-77). Specifically, the majority states that a personal injury cause of action for conscious pain and suffering is \u201cpersonal to the deceased and belongs to the estate, not the distributees\u201d <em>(id.). </em>The majority concludes that the adoption of a rule expanding <em>Hernandez </em>to claims other than wrongful death must be accomplished by the Legislature <em>(see id. </em>at 78). I disagree because I believe the statutory scheme and the rationale of <em>Hernandez </em>compel a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The survival statute, EPTL 11-3.2 (b), provides, in relevant part: \u201cNo cause of action for injury to person or property is lost because of the death of the person in whose favor the cause of action existed. For any injury an action may be brought or continued by the personal representative of the decedent.\u201d Thus, pursuant to the plain language of the survival statute, a personal injury claim survives the decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">CPLR 208 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">\u201cIf a person <em>entitled to commence an action </em>is under a disability because of infancy ... at the time the cause of action accrues, and the time otherwise limited for commencing the action is three years or more and expires no later than three years after the disability ceases, or the person under the disability dies, the time within which the action must be commenced shall be extended to three years after the disability ceases or the person under the disability dies, whichever event first occurs; if the time otherwise limited is less than three years, the time shall be extended by the period of disability\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Notably, CPLR 208 does not limit the toll to causes of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>that are \u201cpersonal\u201d to the infant (majority op at 77). Rather, the person under the disability of infancy must only be \u201centitled to commence [the] action\u201d (CPLR 208).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">In <em>Hernandez, </em>we considered the difficult circumstance presented by \u201c[t]he confluence of the pertinent EPTL, SCPA and CPLR provisions\u201d in a wrongful death case where the sole distributee of an estate was an infant (78 NY2d at 693). We eschewed the \u201cunnecessarily harsh result\u201d reached by a \u201cmechanical application of CPLR 208\u201d and instead applied the infancy toll \u201cuntil the earliest moment there is a personal representative or potential personal representative who can bring the action, whether by appointment of a guardian or majority of the distributee, whichever occurs first\u201d <em>(id,). </em>We determined in <em>Hernandez </em>that what \u201c[ultimately\u201d tipped the balance in favor of extending the CPLR 208 toll to permit the wrongful death claim to proceed was \u201cthe infancy of the sole distributee\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 694). That same consideration should tip the scale here, where no person was entitled to commence the action other than the infant distributees until the appointment of Heslin as administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The existing statutory scheme supports the conclusion that the personal injury claim be permitted to move forward. EPTL 11-3.2 (b), the survival statute, contemplates the transfer of a cause of action to another\u2014i.e., the decedent\u2019s personal representative <em>(see also Matter of Meng, </em>227 NY 264, 277 [1919] [cause of action \u201cbelongs to or is vested in the person or persons who has or have the lawful right to prosecute it\u201d]). The practical consequence of the survival statute is to sever a personal injury claim from the decedent and transfer it to the personal representative. <em>Ratka v St. Francis Hosp. </em>(44 NY2d 604, 609 [1978]), a case relied on by the majority, is not to the contrary. <em>Ratka </em>drew a distinction between personal injury and wrongful death causes of action for the purpose of determining finality when considering our jurisdiction and concluded that the two causes of action were \u201cmaterially separate and distinct\u201d and \u201cpredicated on essentially different theories of loss which accrue to different parties\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 609).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Ratka </em>never drew the distinction for purposes of applying an infancy toll, which we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>draw here. Of course, there is no question that the two causes of action are different and are \u201cpredicated on . . . different theories\u201d (44 NY2d at 609). The question here is whether, for the purposes of applying the CPLR 208 infancy toll as we did in <em>Hernandez, </em>there is any legal or logical basis to treat the causes of action differently. I submit there is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Egypt\u2019s infant sisters, who would have priority to serve as personal representatives of the decedent here <em>(see </em>EPTL 1-2.13; SCPA 1001)\u2014and who would thus be \u201centitled to commence [the] action\u201d (CPLR 208)\u2014are unable to serve in that capacity by virtue of their infancy. In <em>Hernandez, </em>we remedied that unique legal situation by applying the CPLR 208 infancy toll until the appointment of a guardian or the majority of the distributee. We did that because the only person \u201cwhose interests [we]re at stake in bringing th[e] action\u201d was the sole infant survivor of the decedent (78 NY2d at 693). Here, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertions, the only real parties in interest to both the personal injury claim and the wrongful death claim are Egypt\u2019s infant sisters\u2014the only persons who can inherit from her estate and who will benefit from the outcome of both the personal injury and wrongful death claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The practical consequences of allowing a personal injury claim to go forward, other than the possibility of a larger damages award to the infant distributees, are minimal. The infant distributees are no differently situated with respect to the personal injury claim than they are with respect to the wrongful death claim. For both causes of action, they will be the sole beneficiaries of any damages. The majority would deny the infant plaintiffs the benefit of the CPLR 208 toll, as we applied it in <em>Hernandez, </em>merely because any damages must first pass through the estate. It is interesting to note that the plaintiff in <em>Hernandez </em>was also the personal representative of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The majority draws a line where the statutory structure does not support one, apparently out of concern that applying <em>Hernandez </em>to personal injury claims will lead to \u201cthe application of the CPLR 208 toll to any cause of action belonging to a decedent\u2014adult and infant alike\u2014who leaves only infant distributees\u201d (majority op at 78). However, certain causes of action already continue after death by reason of legislative act <em>(see </em>EPTL 11-3.2 [b]), and there exists a legislative determination that those under the disability of infancy are entitled to a toll of the statute of limitations to protect their interests. No purpose is thus served by denying this very narrow class of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>claimants\u2014infants who are the sole distributees of a decedent\u2014 the benefits of these legislative determinations. I respectfully dissent and would reverse the order of the Appellate Division and reinstate the order of Supreme Court granting plaintiff\u2019s motion, pursuant to General Municipal Law \u00a7 50-e (5), for leave to file a late notice of claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Judges Read, Smith and Pigott concur with Judge Graffeo; Judge Ciparick dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Chief Judge Lippman and Judge Jones concur. Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\"> The finality analysis we employed in <em>Ratka </em>is no longer good law (see <em>Burke v Crosson, </em>85 NY2d 10, 16-17, 17 n 3 [1995] [\u201cwhere a negligence cause of action has been dismissed but there remain other claims for relief based on the same transaction or transactions, the doctrine of implied severance is not available\u201d]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
