The decision of the court below should be reversed because it undermines the public policy of promoting arbitral resolution of public sector labor disputes.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b182-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b182-6\">Chief Judge Lippman.</author>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The New York City Transit Authority (Transit Authority) sought to terminate an employee in connection with allegations that the employee assaulted a member of the public on a subway platform. Pursuant to the grievance procedures of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) entered into by the Transit Authority and the employee\u2019s union, Transport Workers Union of America, Local 100 (TWU), the matter was ultimately referred to an arbitrator. The arbitrator modified the penalty the Transit Authority sought to impose, and we are asked to determine whether the arbitrator\u2019s award must be vacated on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded the power given to him by the CBA. We conclude that the arbitrator did not exceed his power.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">The Transit Authority employee involved has been employed as a conductor since 1985. On April 14, 2006, the employee had a heated exchange with a member of the public regarding the availability of express train service on a particular subway train line. According to the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings, during the course of this dialogue, \u201cnot without some provocation from the complainant,\u201d the employee \u201cforcefully \u2018laid hands\u2019 on the complainant.\u201d The parties on this appeal do not dispute the arbitrator\u2019s finding that the employee assaulted a Transit Authority customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">That an assault was involved in the underlying grievance affects the arbitrator\u2019s task under the CBA. Article II, \u00a7 2.1 (C) (19) (c) of the CBA provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">\u201cIf there is presented to the [arbitrator] for decision any charge which, if proved in Court, would constitute a felony, or any charge involving assault, . . . the question to be determined by the [arbitrator] shall be with respect to the fact of such conduct. Where such charge is sustained by the [arbitrator], the action by the Authority, based thereon, shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>affirmed and sustained by the [arbitrator] except if there is presented to the [arbitrator] credible evidence that the action by the Authority is clearly excessive in light of the employee\u2019s record and past precedent in similar cases. It is understood by the parties that this exception will be used rarely and only to prevent a clear injustice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">As his written opinion demonstrates, the arbitrator plainly understood that article II, \u00a7 2.1 (C) (19) (c) applied given the nature of the allegations against the Transit Authority employee. The arbitrator explained that the Transit Authority presented to him as \u201cpast precedent\u201d five prior arbitration awards where other arbitrators had upheld termination decisions, and he discussed each of those matters in his written opinion. The arbitrator also discussed the record of the employee before him whom the Transit Authority sought to terminate. At the close of his five-page opinion, the arbitrator concluded: \u201cI find the substantive differences between this case, and those relied upon by the Authority as \u2018precedent\u2019 render the [employee] worthy of the \u2018exception\u2019, regarding which arbitrators have judgmental discretion under the Agreement provision cited [above].\u201d Based on this finding, the arbitrator modified the employee\u2019s penalty from termination to reinstatement without back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The Transit Authority then commenced this CPLR article 75 proceeding seeking to vacate the arbitration award. Supreme Court concluded, inter alia, that the arbitrator had exceeded his power in modifying the penalty and granted the Transit Authority\u2019s petition. The Appellate Division affirmed, with two Justices dissenting (60 AD3d 1 [2d Dept 2008]). This appeal as of right, pursuant to CPLR 5601 (a), followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Of the three \u201cnarrow grounds\u201d that may form the basis for vacating an arbitrator\u2019s award\u2014that it violates public policy, is irrational, or \u201cclearly exceeds a specifically enumerated limitation on the arbitrator\u2019s power\u201d <em>(Matter of United Fedn. of Teachers, Local 2, AFT, AFL-CIO v Board of Educ. of City School Dist. of City of N.Y., </em>1 NY3d 72, 79 [2003], quoting <em>Matter of Board of Educ. of Arlington Cent. School Dist. v Arlington Teachers Assn., </em>78 NY2d 33, 37 [1991])\u2014only the last is argued on this appeal <em>(see </em>CPLR 7511 [b] [1] [iii]). The Transit Authority argues that the arbitrator exceeded his power because the \u201cpast precedent\u201d prong of the article II, \u00a7 2.1 (C) (19) (c) exception was not met, thus the prerequisites necessary for the arbitrator to exercise discretion under that provision were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>satisfied. The Transit Authority notes that the arbitrator distinguished each of the precedential awards it submitted to him and TWU\u2019s submissions did not include any \u201cpast precedent\u201d; thus, it posits, there was no \u201cpast precedent in similar cases\u201d for the arbitrator to rely on in concluding that termination was a \u201cclearly excessive\u201d action by the Transit Authority warranting a modification pursuant to the exception. The courts below agreed with the Transit Authority. We do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The Transit Authority\u2019s view overlooks the settled law in New York that it is \u201cnot for the courts to interpret the substantive conditions of the contract or to determine the merits of the dispute\u201d <em>(Matter of United Fedn. of Teachers, </em>1 NY3d at 82-83, quoting <em>Board of Educ., Lakeland Cent. School Dist. of Shrub Oak v Barni, </em>51 NY2d 894, 895 [1980]; <em>see </em>CPLR 7501 [\u201cIn determining any matter arising under this article, the court shall not consider whether the claim with respect to which arbitration is sought is tenable, or otherwise pass upon the merits of the dispute\u201d]). Under the subject provision of the CBA, after an arbitrator in a case involving assault allegations determines as a matter of fact that an assault did occur, the applicability of the provision\u2019s exception is a question uniquely within the arbitrator\u2019s power to decide. Of course, the CBA provides that the arbitrator in making that decision is to be guided by \u201cpast precedent\u201d and the employee\u2019s record, but it is certainly not the role of the courts to chart a course as to how the arbitrator is to apply \u201cpast precedent\u201d or to determine if the arbitrator strayed from the best route in the guise of declaring that he exceeded his power <em>(see Matter of Board of Educ. of Watertown City School Dist. [Watertown Educ. Assn.], </em>93 NY2d 132, 143 [1999] [\u201cWhile some case records contain enough information for a court to make a penetrating analysis of the scope of the substantive provisions of the CBA, an undertaking of that kind is not the function of the court\u201d]). Under the CBA, the arbitrator had the power to decide if the exception applied. Thus, vacating the arbitrator\u2019s award on the ground asserted by the Transit Authority would not involve a determination that he exceeded his power; rather, it would entail the kind of \u201cinapt flirtation with the merits, or . . . inappropriate use of the judicial scalpel to split the hairs that mark the perimeters of the contractual provisions\u201d that \u201c[h]istory, legislation, and experience,\u201d not to mention our case law, dictate that we refrain from <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Here, article II, \u00a7 2.1 (C) (19) (c) of the CBA required the arbitrator to first determine whether an assault occurred. If an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>assault did occur, the arbitrator was then to sustain the Transit Authority\u2019s action unless an application of the arbitrator\u2019s discretion was warranted under the provision\u2019s exception. Having found that an assault occurred, whether an application of the exception was warranted was the very question submitted to arbitration under the CBA, and the arbitrator here concluded that the exception applied. Even when such \u201cinterpretations and factual findings appear highly debatable\u201d\u2014and we make no comment here on the merits of the arbitrator\u2019s decision in this matter\u2014\u201cwhether we agree with the arbitrator is beside the point\u201d <em>(Matter of United Fedn. of Teachers, </em>1 NY3d at 83).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The Appellate Division majority was correct in describing the CBA as a \u201cdirection to the arbitrator that reflects both the TWU\u2019s and the TA\u2019s intent that once an assault charge is sustained, the TA-imposed penalty must be upheld except in rare cases\u201d (60 AD3d at 8). But, it was the arbitrator who was empowered to make the determination as to whether the matter submitted was one of those rare cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the petition dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b185-7\">Smith, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"Axs\">As I see it, this case turns on what standard of review applies. When an arbitrator interprets an ordinary term in a contract, a court may overturn his decision only if it is irrational, or contrary to public policy; if this were the standard of review here, I would agree with the majority that the arbitrator\u2019s award should be upheld. But the contract clause now in issue is an express limitation on the arbitrator\u2019s power. In such a case, under our precedents, the arbitrator\u2019s ruling is reviewable for clear error, and I believe he clearly erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">CPLR 7511 (b) (1) (iii) says that an arbitrator\u2019s award \u201cshall be vacated\u201d if the arbitrator \u201cexceeded his power.\u201d This means, we have often said, that an award that \u201cclearly exceeds a specifically enumerated limitation on the arbitrator\u2019s power\u201d must be set aside <em>(e.g. Matter of Henneberry v ING Capital Advisors, LLC, </em>10 NY3d 278, 284 [2008], quoting <em>Matter of New York City Tr. Auth. v Transport Workers\u2019 Union of Am., Local 100, AFL-CIO, </em>6 NY3d 332, 336 [2005]). The clause at issue here is just such a \u201cspecifically enumerated limitation.\u201d It is part of the section of the agreement dealing with arbitration, and says that, where a \u201ccharge involving assault\u201d has been substantiated, the Authority\u2019s disciplinary action \u201cshall be affirmed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>sustained by the [arbitrator]\u201d in the absence of \u201ccredible evidence that the action by the Authority is clearly excessive in light of the employee\u2019s record and past precedent in similar cases.\u201d Thus, while as a general matter the parties to an arbitration agreement put themselves very largely at the arbitrator\u2019s mercy, the parties here sought not to do that, but to disable the arbitrator from rejecting the penalty imposed by the Authority for an assault, in the absence of the extraordinary circumstances the agreement describes.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The question before us is whether the award the arbitrator rendered \u201cclearly exceeds\u201d the agreement\u2019s limitation on his power. I conclude that it does. The \u201cemployee\u2019s record\u201d shows that he had previously been suspended for \u201ca customer altercation.\u201d This was 15 years before the incident now in question, but the Authority could surely find that repeated fights with customers, even once a decade, are unacceptable; most of its employees no doubt avoid such incidents for their whole careers. And no \u201cpast precedent in similar cases\u201d imposing a punishment less severe than dismissal was shown to exist. The best the employee could do was to look for distinctions\u2014sometimes rather thin ones\u2014between this case and the many others in which the Authority dismissed employees who assaulted customers. The arbitrator was clearly wrong to find that the Authority\u2019s punishment of this employee was \u201cclearly excessive in light of the employee\u2019s record and past precedent in similar cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Because the arbitrator exceeded a limitation that the parties placed on his power, I would affirm the Appellate Division\u2019s order vacating the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Pigott and Jones concur with Chief Judge Lippman; Judge Smith dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion in which Judge Read concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
