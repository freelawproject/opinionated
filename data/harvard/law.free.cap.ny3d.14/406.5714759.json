We hold that defendant\u2019s display of a gun to the victim and its threatened use constitute clear and convincing evidence that he was armed with a dangerous instrument during the commission of the crime in the context of a SORA hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">In 2003, defendant Avery Pettigrew pleaded guilty to rape in the first degree based on an incident earlier that year in which he forcibly raped a 16-year-old girl, and was sentenced to a term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>of five years\u2019 incarceration followed by five years\u2019 postrelease supervision. In April 2007, prior to defendant\u2019s conditional release, a SORA proceeding was conducted for the purpose of determining his risk level. The Risk Assessment Instrument (RAI) prepared for the hearing assessed defendant 120 points, designating him a presumptive level three sex offender. The Board of Examiners also prepared a case summary prior to the SORA hearing. According to this case summary, while in pursuit of the victim, defendant said to her \u201c[i]f I can\u2019t have you, no one will.\u201d He followed her into the stairwell of her apartment building and choked her. Then, defendant showed the victim a gun sticking out of his waistband, tore her pants down and raped her. Afterwards, defendant informed the victim that he would shoot her if she told anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">At the SORA hearing, defendant disputed the 30 points the Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders assessed under factor 1 for having been armed with a dangerous instrument. Defendant specifically argued that the People failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the gun he possessed during the rape was loaded and operable, proof that some appellate courts have required in first degree robbery cases based on a \u201cuse or the threatened use of a dangerous instrument\u201d theory. Supreme Court rejected defendant\u2019s argument, adopted the Board\u2019s findings, and adjudicated defendant a level three offender. The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed <em>(People v Pettigrew, </em>59 AD3d 276 [2009]). We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">A SORA proceeding, which is civil in nature, determines the risk of reoffense by a person convicted of a qualifying sex offense and requires that individual to register with law enforcement officials according to that risk level <em>(see People v Mingo, </em>12 NY3d 563, 570-571 [2009]). The People \u201cbear the burden of proving the facts supporting the determinations\u201d by clear and convincing evidence (Correction Law \u00a7 168-n [3]). According to the Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders, points in the RAI \u201cshould not be assessed for a factor . . . unless there is clear and convincing evidence of the existence of that factor\u201d (Sex Offender Registration Act: Risk Assessment Guidelines and Commentary, \u00b6 7, at 5 [2006]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, we held that the RAI case summaries, such as the one prepared by the Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders in this case, \u201cmeet the \u2018reliable hearsay\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>standard for admissibility at SORA proceedings\u201d <em>(Mingo, </em>12 NY3d at 573). The risk level suggested by the RAI, however, is merely presumptive, and the assigning of a risk level is within the sound discretion of the SORA court <em>(see </em>Correction Law \u00a7 168-n [3]).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Here, the People proved by clear and convincing evidence that defendant was armed with a dangerous instrument during the commission of the offense. A \"[d]angerous instrument means \u2018any instrument, article or substance, which, under the circumstances in which it is used, attempted to be used or threatened to be used, is readily capable of causing death or other serious physical injury\u2019 \u201d (Sex Offender Registration Act: Risk Assessment Guidelines and Commentary, at 8 [2006], quoting Penal Law \u00a7 10.00 [13]). Defendant\u2019s display of the gun to the victim and threat to shoot her constitute clear and convincing evidence that the gun was a dangerous instrument <em>(see People v Dodt, </em>61 NY2d 408, 415 [1984] [\u201ca threat to use a gun . . . can only be understood as a threat that the weapon is operable\u201d]; <em>see also People v Walker, </em>15 AD3d 692, 692 [3d Dept 2005] [pulling out a gun and placing it to the victim\u2019s head was clear and convincing evidence under the RAI and SORA Guidelines that the defendant was armed with a dangerous instrument]). We therefore reject defendant\u2019s assertion that points should not be assessed under this SORA factor absent evidence that the gun was loaded and operable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, viewing the record as a whole, the People have met their burden that defendant was armed with a dangerous instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Accordingly, the order should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith and Pigott concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\">. \u201cThis evidence can be derived from the sex offender\u2019s admissions; the victim\u2019s statements; ... or from any other reliable source\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b469-9\">. Indeed, if defendant \u201cused, threatened to use or attempted to use\u201d the gun as a bludgeon, it clearly would qualify as a dangerous instrument <em>(see McLaughlin v United States, </em>476 US 16, 18 [1986]; <em>see also People v Colavito, </em>126 AD2d 554 [2d Dept 1987]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
