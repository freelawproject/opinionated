The proof presented by the prosecution was legally insufficient to establish the required elements of aggravated criminally negligent homicide. The trial court erred, as a matter of law, in denying defendant\u2019s motions to dismiss for legal insufficiency and the Appellate Division erred in failing to reverse the trial court and dismiss that charge. <em>(People v Cabrera, </em>10 NY3d 370; <em>People v Gray, </em>86 NY2d 10; <em>People v Badke, </em>21 Misc 3d 471; <em>People v Haney, </em>30 NY2d 328; <em>People v Soto, </em>44 NY2d 683; <em>People v Ricardo B., </em>73 NY2d 228; <em>People v Loughlin, </em>76 NY2d 804; <em>People v Maher, </em>79 NY2d 978; <em>People v Harris, </em>81 NY2d 850; <em>People v Ladd, </em>89 NY2d 893.) II. The Appellate Division erred in holding that defendant had failed to preserve the contention that the evidence was legally insufficient to establish that defendant had the requisite mens rea for criminally negligent homicide; in the event that this Court should hold that this issue is being presented for the first time in this Court, this Court can and should hear the issue on the merits. <em>(People v Fermin, </em>36 AD3d 934; <em>People v Edwards, </em>95 NY2d 486; <em>People v LaPetina, </em>34 AD3d 836; <em>People v Duncan, </em>177 AD2d 187; <em>People v Flores, </em>124 Misc 2d 478; <em>People v Haney, </em>30 NY2d 328; <em>People v Kibbe, </em>35 NY2d 407; <em>People v Le Mieux, </em>51 NY2d 981; <em>People v Gray, </em>86 NY2d 10; <em>People v Bynum, </em>70 NY2d 858.) III. The court erred in granting the People\u2019s motion to disqualify defense counsel and that error deprived appellant of his federal and state constitutional right to counsel of his choice. This constitutional deprivation, without more, mandates reversal and a new trial. <em>(United States v Perez, </em>325 F3d 115; <em>People v Caban, </em>123 AD2d 356; <em>United States v Kliti, </em>156 F3d 150; <em>People v Ortiz, </em>76 NY2d 652; <em>People v Wandell, </em>75 NY2d 951; <em>People v Gomberg, </em>38 NY2d 307; <em>People v Mattison, </em>67 NY2d 462; <em>People v Stewart, </em>126 AD2d 943; <em>People v Arroyave, </em>49 NY2d 264; <em>People v Salcedo, </em>68 NY2d 130.) IV The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>trial court erred in failing to dismiss the indictment based on improper expert testimony and misleading grand jury instructions. <em>(People v Loizides, </em>123 Misc 2d 334; <em>People v Taylor, </em>150 Misc 2d 91; <em>De Long v County of Erie, </em>60 NY2d 296; <em>Kulak v Nationwide Mut.

VI. Defendant\u2019s statement should have been suppressed as his right to counsel under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution and article I, \u00a7 6 of the New York State Constitution had indelibly attached and his rights were violated when the representation afforded him by counsel in dealing with law enforcement authorities was grossly incompetent. <em>(People v Claudio, </em>83 NY2d 76; <em>People v Iucci, </em>61 AD2d 1; <em>United States v Cronic, </em>466 US 648.) VII. The cumulative effect of the errors deprived defendant of the right to a fair trial. <em>(People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230; <em>People v Pyne, </em>223 AD2d 910; <em>People v Kitchen, </em>55 AD2d 575.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-5\"><em>William J.

II. The Appellate Division properly held that defendant failed to preserve his contention that the evidence was legally insufficient to establish that defendant possessed the requisite mens rea for criminally negligent homicide. <em>(People v Gray, </em>86 NY2d 10; <em>People v Hines, </em>97 NY2d 56, 678; <em>People v Bynum, 70 </em>NY2d 858; <em>People v Sweeney, </em>15 AD3d 917, 4 NY3d 891; <em>People v Beige, </em>41 NY2d 60.) III. The court properly disqualified defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>counsel. <em>(People v Gomberg, </em>38 NY2d 307; <em>People v Tineo, </em>64 NY2d 531; <em>People v Wandell, </em>75 NY2d 951; <em>People v Harris, </em>99 NY2d 202; <em>People v McDonald, </em>68 NY2d 1; <em>People v Lombardo, </em>61 NY2d 97; <em>People v Stewart, </em>126 AD2d 943; <em>Wheat v United States, </em>486 US 153; <em>United States v Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 US 140; <em>People v Hall, </em>46 NY2d 873, 444 US 848.) IV The testimony and instructions presented to the grand jury did not impair the integrity of the grand jury or prejudice defendant. <em>(People v Huston, </em>88 NY2d 400; <em>People v Wooten, </em>283 AD2d 931, 96 NY2d 943; <em>People v Caracciola, 78 </em>NY2d 1021; <em>People v Darby, </em>75 NY2d 449; <em>People v Gray, </em>86 NY2d 10; <em>Mallory v Mallory, </em>113 Misc 2d 912; <em>People v McCart, </em>157 AD2d 194, 76 NY2d 861; <em>People v Sims, </em>178 AD2d 993, 79 NY2d 953; <em>People v DaCosta, </em>6 NY3d 181; <em>People v Calbud, Inc., </em>49 NY2d 389.)

VI. County Court did not err in denying suppression of defendant\u2019s statements. <em>(People v Claudio, </em>83 NY2d 76; <em>People v Steward, </em>88 NY2d 496; <em>Kirby v Illinois, </em>406 US 682; <em>People v Stultz, </em>2 NY3d 277; <em>People v Baldi, </em>54 NY2d 137; <em>People v Simmons, </em>167 AD2d 924, 77 NY2d 843; <em>People v Borrell, </em>12 NY3d 365; <em>People v Turner, </em>5 NY3d 476; <em>People v Rivera, </em>71 NY2d 705; <em>People v Droz, </em>39 NY2d 457.) VII. Defendant received a fair trial. <em>(People v Lucie, </em>49 AD3d 1253, 10 NY3d 936.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b383-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b383-6\">Chief Judge Lippman.</author>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">In protecting a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights, a trial court may on occasion properly disqualify the attorney of a defendant\u2019s choosing due to that attorney\u2019s conflicts, actual or potential, even in the face of defendant\u2019s waiver of such conflicts. This is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">In the late afternoon on April 23, 2006, defendant drove away from his home in Onondaga County on his motorcycle. On felony probation at the time, defendant could not own or operate a motor vehicle since he did not have his probation officer\u2019s permission to do so, and he was not licensed to drive a motorcycle in New York State. As defendant traveled west on Route 173 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>toward Jamesville, New York State Trooper Craig Todeschini observed defendant speeding and began to pursue him. Defendant admitted that when he turned left onto Route 91, he saw the trooper\u2019s vehicle behind him with its emergency lights on, but, rather than pulling over to the side of the road, \u201ctook off\u2019 in an attempt to \u201cnot get[ ] caught by the trooper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Various witnesses observed the motorcycle, followed by the trooper\u2019s vehicle, traveling at a high rate of speed, estimated between 90 and 120 miles per hour, and weaving in and out of traffic along the two-lane country roads. As Trooper Todeschini entered the Hamlet of Pompey Hill, still in pursuit of defendant, he was unable to negotiate a turn in the road, lost control of his vehicle, and collided head-on into a tree, resulting in his immediate death. Three days after the accident, defendant voluntarily appeared at the New York State Police barracks for an interview and, after consulting with his attorney, gave an inculpatory statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Defendant was indicted on one count each of reckless driving, aggravated manslaughter in the second degree, and aggravated criminally negligent homicide. A jury acquitted him of the aggravated manslaughter count, but convicted him on the reckless driving and aggravated criminally negligent homicide counts. Defendant was sentenced as a predicate felon to seven years in prison with five years\u2019 postrelease supervision. The Appellate Division affirmed the judgment of conviction (59 AD3d 1112 [2009]). A Judge of this Court granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal from that order (12 NY3d 852 [2009]). We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Defendant first argues that the evidence was legally insufficient to support his conviction for aggravated criminally negligent homicide. In particular, defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence to establish that he acted with the requisite mens rea. This claim, however, is unpreserved. After the People rested, and again at the close of all the proof, defendant moved to dismiss the aggravated criminally negligent homicide count, arguing only that the evidence was insufficient to prove a \u201ccausal connection\u201d between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the trooper\u2019s death. The court denied both motions. At no point did defendant argue, as he does now, that the evidence failed to establish he acted with the requisite mens rea. As we have previously explained, \u201cwhere a motion to dismiss for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>insufficient evidence [is] made, the preservation requirement compels that the argument be \u2018specifically directed\u2019 at the alleged error\u201d <em>(People v Gray, </em>86 NY2d 10, 19 [1995], quoting <em>People v Cona, </em>49 NY2d 26, 33 n 2 [1979]). Given defendant\u2019s failure to argue with particularity that the evidence was legally insufficient to prove that he acted with the requisite mens rea, we are foreclosed from reviewing that claim here.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Defendant also argues that the evidence is legally insufficient to establish a causal connection between his conduct and the death of the trooper. Although plainly preserved, this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In <em>People v DaCosta, </em>we explained the law regarding causation in this context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">\u201cTo be held criminally responsible for a homicide, a defendant\u2019s conduct must actually contribute to the victim\u2019s death by setting in motion the events that result in the killing. Liability will attach even if the , defendant\u2019s conduct is not the sole cause of death if the actions were a sufficiently direct cause of the ensuing death. More than an obscure or merely probable connection between the conduct and result is required. Rather, an act qualifies as a sufficiently direct cause when the ultimate harm should have been reasonably foreseen\u201d (6 NY3d 181, 184 [2006] [internal quotation marks, brackets and citations omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">In that case, we held that the evidence was legally sufficient with respect to causation where a police officer, while chasing the fleeing defendant across a busy expressway, was struck and killed by a vehicle. Similarly, in <em>People v Matos </em>(83 NY2d 509 [1994]), evidence of causation was legally sufficient where a police officer fell down an air shaft to his death in the course of pursuing the fleeing defendant up a ladder and across a roof. These cases establish that where a defendant\u2019s flight naturally induces a police officer to engage in pursuit, and the officer is killed in the course of that pursuit, the causation element of the crime will be satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Defendant argues that the trooper was negligent by excessively speeding and losing control of his vehicle and violated State Police pursuit policy and Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1104, and that these acts were intervening and unforeseeable causative circumstances. However, it is plain that had defendant not fled, the trooper would not have engaged in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>high-speed chase that resulted in his death. Additionally, contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, there is no requirement that a defendant\u2019s vehicle actually make contact with the trooper\u2019s vehicle in order for the causation element to be satisfied. Rather, the essential inquiry is whether defendant\u2019s conduct was a sufficiently direct cause of the trooper\u2019s death, a question we answer in the affirmative. There can be no doubt that defendant\u2019s conduct set in motion the events that led to the trooper\u2019s death, and it was reasonably foreseeable that a fatal accident would occur as a result of defendant leading the trooper on a high-speed pursuit. Accordingly, the evidence was legally sufficient to establish a causal connection between defendant\u2019s conduct and the trooper\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Defendant next argues that County Court erred in granting the People\u2019s motion to disqualify his counsel. When the case was presented to the grand jury, the prosecutor called defendant\u2019s father and girlfriend. One of defendant\u2019s retained attorneys, Mary Gasparini, represented these witnesses and appeared with them in the grand jury room while they gave their testimony. Defendant\u2019s father testified that, on the evening of the accident, defendant returned home after riding his motorcycle and told his father not to let him ride his motorcycle until he was properly licensed because he was nearly pulled over by the police. Defendant also told his father that he had seen flashing lights, yet kept driving. Defendant\u2019s girlfriend testified that he called her shortly after the accident and said he was the motorcyclist the police were looking for and that he thought he was going to jail because the trooper had died. The next day, he called her and told her not to say anything about what he had told her the night before.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">After the case had been presented to the grand jury, and four months before trial, the People moved to disqualify Gasparini and her partner, James Meggesto, on the ground that a potential conflict of interest existed based on Gasparini\u2019s representation at the grand jury of defendant\u2019s father and girlfriend who would be prosecution witnesses at trial. Defendant argued that if there was any conflict at all, it was only potential, and the issue could not be determined until after the testimony of the witnesses. Further, the defense argued that any potential conflict was waivable by defendant. Indeed, in open court, defendant indicated he was willing to waive any conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>At a subsequent court appearance, the court appointed an independent attorney to advise the defendant with respect to the conflict of interest and its implications. After a discussion with defendant, the independent counsel informed the court that defendant understood the conflict and was willing to waive it, after which defendant waived the conflict on the record. Nevertheless, the court granted the People\u2019s motion, concluding that defense counsel \u201cmust be disqualified in order to protect the defendant\u2019s rights to effective assistance of trial counsel and a fair trial free of any conflict of interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Although both defendant\u2019s father and girlfriend were mentioned at jury selection as potential witnesses, in the end neither actually testified. On appeal, the Appellate Division concluded that County Court did not abuse its discretion in granting the People\u2019s motion to disqualify defense counsel. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">When examining a defense counsel\u2019s possible conflict of interest, a court must balance the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel against the defendant\u2019s right to be defended by counsel of his own choosing <em>(see People v Gomberg, </em>38 NY2d 307, 312 [1975]). \u201cA lawyer simultaneously representing two clients whose interests actually conflict cannot give either client undivided loyalty\u201d <em>(People v Ortiz, </em>76 NY2d 652, 656 [1990]), and, in such a case, the constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel may be \u201csubstantially impaired\u201d <em>(Gomberg, </em>38 NY2d at 312). Where there is a question as to a possible conflict, although the court \u201cshould not arbitrarily interfere with the attorney-client relationship,\u201d the court \u201chas a duty to protect the right of an accused to effective assistance of counsel\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 313). Thus, when the court is informed of a potential conflict, it must \u201cascertain, on the record, whether each defendant has an awareness of the potential risks involved in that course and has knowingly chosen it\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 313-314).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">In <em>Gomberg, </em>we explained that it is often difficult to assess these conflicts prospectively, before the court is fully aware of \u201cthe evidence to be adduced, the strategies to be followed and all defenses that may be plausibly asserted\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 314). Thus, a defendant\u2019s willingness to waive the conflict at an early stage does not end the inquiry. As the Supreme Court has explained, even though there is a \u201cpresumption in favor of [the defendant\u2019s] counsel of choice,\u201d that right is not absolute and the court may decline to honor the defendant\u2019s waiver of a conflict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">\u201cUnfortunately for all concerned, a [lower] court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>must pass on the issue whether or not to allow a waiver of a conflict of interest by a criminal defendant not with the wisdom of hindsight after the trial has taken place, but in the murkier pre-trial context when relationships between parties are seen through a glass, darkly. The likelihood and dimensions of nascent conflicts of interest are notoriously hard to predict . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">\u201cFor these reasons we think the [lower] court must be allowed substantial latitude in refusing waivers of conflicts of interest not only in those rare cases where an actual conflict may be demonstrated before trial, but in the more common cases where a potential for conflict exists which may or may not burgeon into an actual conflict as the trial progresses\u201d <em>(Wheat v United States, </em>486 US 153, 164, 162-163 [1988]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Here, the trial court had the independent obligation to ensure that defendant\u2019s right to effective representation was not impaired. Although defendant\u2019s father and girlfriend never testified at trial, at the point in the proceedings when the disqualification motion was made, the parties were operating under the assumption that these witnesses might well be called. Specifically, the defense had indicated that it was possible they would proceed with the theory that defendant was not the person who had been driving the motorcycle. The trial court reasonably concluded that, if the defense chose this strategy at trial, it was highly likely that the prosecution would call defendant\u2019s father and girlfriend, who both possessed damaging evidence indicating that defendant had, indeed, been driving the motorcycle. Further, the court properly found that, if these witnesses were called, defense counsel would have been required to cross-examine them. An \u201cattorney\u2019s decision whether and how best to impeach the credibility of a witness to whom he . . . owe[s] a duty of loyalty necessarily placets] the attorney in a very awkward position, where prejudice to defendant need not be precisely delineated but must be presumed\u201d <em>(People v McDonald, </em>68 NY2d 1, 11 [1986] [internal quotation marks, citation and brackets omitted]). Moreover, had counsel not been disqualified under these circumstances, counsel\u2019s ability to objectively assess the best strategy for defendant to pursue may have been impaired. Defense counsel, obligated to maintain the confidences of the father and the girlfriend, might choose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>strategy least likely to cause the prosecution to call them as witnesses, thereby avoiding the need to cross-examine them. It would be difficult to repose confidence in counsel\u2019s single-minded protection of defendant\u2019s interests in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Our dissenting colleagues embrace a seemingly unworkable test in characterizing the conflict here as \u201cmore theoretical than real\u201d and \u201cnot serious, given the common interest shared by defendant, his girlfriend and his father\u201d (dissenting op at 332). Defendant\u2019s father and girlfriend may well have shared with defendant the desire to see him exonerated and avoid having the prosecutor call them to testify; indeed, that may be why they retained the same lawyers in the first instance. Their identity of interest with defendant would dissolve, however, upon either being called as a witness for the prosecution or, as noted, could have dissolved even earlier if defense counsel opted for a strategy tailored to avoid having to cross-examine them <em>(see People v Wandell, </em>75 NY2d 951 [1990] [excoriating defense counsel and the prosecutor for failing to advise the trial court of defense counsel\u2019s representation of a prosecution witness in a separate civil action]; <em>see e.g. People v </em>Stewart, 126 AD2d 943 [4th Dept 1987] [concluding that a conflict was presented by counsel\u2019s representation of both a father and a son, and ordering a new trial on ineffective assistance of counsel grounds where, as here, the son made incriminating statements to his father who then provided information against his son to authorities]). More fundamentally, the trial court was tasked with considering this potential conflict without the benefit of hindsight, and the approach taken by the dissent would too narrowly limit the \u201csubstantial latitude\u201d <em>(Wheat, </em>486 US at 163) we all agree the trial court possessed in exercising its discretion under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">A review of the record here reveals that the court carefully balanced defendant\u2019s right to counsel of his own choosing against his right to effective assistance of counsel. The court was quite properly reluctant to disqualify counsel, but acted well within the bounds of its discretion in concluding that allowing counsel to continue would \u201cseverely undermine [defendant\u2019s] ability to present a cogent defense.\u201d Further, there is no indication that the prosecution\u2019s disqualification request was manufactured in order to gain a tactical advantage <em>(see Wheat, </em>486 US at 163). We also note that, contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, the court was under no obligation to wait until trial to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>see if defendant\u2019s father and girlfriend would testify. If the court were required to delay resolution of the motion, and these witnesses were called to testify\u2014which was a possibility even when the trial began\u2014a mistrial would likely have been necessary at that late juncture.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Indeed, the circumstances of this case highlight that trial courts faced with a defendant willing to waive a conflict are often placed in the very difficult position of having their decision challenged regardless of the outcome. As the Supreme Court in <em>Wheat </em>explained, if the court honors the waiver, the defendant can later claim he was denied the effective assistance of counsel <em>(see id. </em>at 161). On the other hand, if the trial court refuses to honor the waiver, a defendant may well raise a challenge like the one presented here <em>(see id.). </em>Of course, the rights that must be balanced\u2014the right to counsel of a criminal defendant\u2019s choosing and the right to effective assistance of counsel free of conflicts\u2014both inure to a defendant\u2019s benefit. At times, however, as here, circumstances are such that the attorney a defendant chooses is also conflicted, in which case these rights may not be enforced in perfect harmony. Thus, as we have observed, a trial court\u2019s \u201cdiscretion is especially broad when the defendant\u2019s actions with respect to counsel place the court in the dilemma of having to choose between undesirable alternatives, either one of which would theoretically provide the defendant with a basis for appellate review\u201d <em>(People v Tineo, </em>64 NY2d 531, 536 [1985]; <em>see generally People v </em>Konstantinides, 14 NY3d 1 [2009]). We trust that the trial courts, relying on their experience and sound judgment, will carefully evaluate the circumstances presented in such cases and strike an appropriate balance of the relevant interests. Under the circumstances presented here, the court did not abuse its broad discretion in granting the motion to disqualify defendant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Defendant further argues that his statement to the police should be suppressed because his counsel was ineffective in advising him to give the statement. The record reveals that, when defendant voluntarily arrived at the trooper barracks three days after the accident, he was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Defendant spoke with troopers for a period of time, but then invoked his right to counsel, at which point the questioning immediately ceased. Defendant\u2019s then attorney, David Savlov, faxed a letter to the barracks indicating he represented defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>and appeared at the barracks shortly thereafter. After speaking with defendant, Savlov informed the troopers that defendant was willing to speak with them. The troopers again administered <em>Miranda </em>warnings to defendant, who subsequently gave a statement implicating himself in the motorcycle chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">County Court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the statement, and the Appellate Division affirmed, holding that \u201csuppression was not required inasmuch as defendant received meaningful representation\u201d (59 AD3d at 1114 [citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Even assuming, without deciding, the right to effective assistance of counsel attached prior to defendant\u2019s inculpatory statement and that suppression is the appropriate remedy where a statement is given as the result of ineffective assistance of counsel <em>(see People v Claudio, </em>83 NY2d 76 [1993]), defendant here has failed to establish that he received ineffective assistance. In determining whether a defendant has been deprived of effective assistance of counsel, we must examine whether \u201cthe evidence, the law, and the circumstances of a particular case, viewed in totality and as of the time of representation, reveal that the attorney provided meaningful representation\u201d <em>(People v Baldi, </em>54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]). \u201c[A]ll of the evidence must be weighed in context and as of the time of representation to assess the alleged deficient representation\u201d <em>(People v Hobot, </em>84 NY2d 1021, 1022 [1995]). Although rare, a single, substantial error by counsel may \u201cso seriously compromise[ ] a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial [that] it will qualify as ineffective representation\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Only where the single error is sufficiently \u201cegregious and prejudicial\u201d will counsel be deemed ineffective <em>(People v Caban, </em>5 NY3d 143, 152 [2005]).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The record reveals that, after arriving at the police barracks, Savlov was told by representatives of the District Attorney\u2019s Office that the District Attorney would look favorably upon defendant if he voluntarily gave a statement. Further, Savlov \u201cwas also told that the police had received information that the defendant was in fact the person being sought [and] . . . the names of other persons who had spoken to the defendant.\u201d Thus, this case is distinguishable from <em>Claudio </em>(83 NY2d at 78), in which we noted that defendant\u2019s counsel was grossly incompetent for advising defendant to give a statement despite that the police had indicated they had insufficient evidence against defendant and the prosecutor had informed the attorney that no plea bargain would be offered. Here, Savlov made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>strategic decision to encourage defendant to cooperate in order to receive favorable treatment once charges were brought. Under all the relevant circumstances, we cannot say that defendant received less than meaningful representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">We have considered defendant\u2019s other challenges to his conviction and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b392-8\">Pigott, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AAe\">Because, in my view, County Court committed reversible error in disqualifying defendant\u2019s counsel, I respectfully dissent. The court disqualified counsel based upon its finding that a potential conflict of interest\u2014which was more theoretical than real\u2014would, in its opinion, infringe upon defendant\u2019s right to the effective assistance of trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">It is hornbook law that, the right to counsel being a fundamental one, courts must \u201ccarefully scrutinize[ ]\u201d the \u201cjudicial restriction or governmental intrusion\u201d upon its exercise <em>(People v Tineo, </em>64 NY2d 531, 536 [1985]). While a trial court should be accorded \u201csubstantial latitude\u201d in refusing a defendant\u2019s waiver of even a potential conflict <em>(Wheat v United States, </em>486 US 153, 163 [1988]), it is evident from this record that any potential conflict (which never came to fruition) was simply not serious, given the common interest shared by defendant, his girlfriend and his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">When the court questioned defendant about his waiver, he remained steadfast that he wished to waive any potential conflict. The court then appointed an experienced criminal lawyer as independent counsel to meet with defendant to explain the ramifications of this choice. She met with defendant twice and sent him a letter explaining his rights, including the risks and benefits of waiving the conflict. That attorney reported to the court that it was her view that defendant understood the risks of waiving the conflict and still wished to do so. Notwithstanding these facts, County Court disqualified counsel. What is remarkable here is that no one seems to have had an objection to defendant retaining his counsel other than his adversary and the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">An element of a defendant\u2019s federal and state constitutional right to counsel (US Const 6th Amend; NY Const, art I, \u00a7 6) \u201cis the right of [the] defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him\u201d <em>(United States v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number><em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 US 140, 144 [2006]; <em>see People v Arroyave, </em>49 NY2d 264, 270 [1980]). When a defendant is wrongly deprived of that right, the deprivation is \u201ccomplete\u201d at the time the defendant is erroneously prohibited from being represented by the counsel of his choice, and such error is considered a \u201cstructural\u201d one not subject to harmless error analysis <em>(Gonzalez-Lopez </em>at 148, 150).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">In support of its holding here, the majority relies on <em>People v Ortiz </em>(76 NY2d 652 [1990]) and <em>People v Gomberg </em>(38 NY2d 307 [1975]), both of which are \u201cmultiple representation\u201d cases. The former case involved a garden-variety drug trial where defense counsel\u2019s loyalties were divided between the defendant he was representing and a testifying witness whose interests diverged from those of the defendant; the latter case involved a situation where the same attorney represented three defendants who were on trial for arson, and the defense asserted by one of the defendants allegedly shifted the blame to the other defendants. Of course, as the United States Supreme Court has recognized, \u201cmultiple representation of criminal defendants engenders special dangers of which a court must be aware\u201d <em>(Wheat, </em>486 US at 159). But that is not the situation we are presented with here, where neither defendant\u2019s father nor his girlfriend was facing a criminal charge, nor were they targets of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The Supreme Court has recognized \u201ca presumption in favor of [a defendant\u2019s] counsel of choice\u201d which may be overcome by either a showing of actual conflict or \u201ca serious potential for conflict\u201d <em>(Wheat, </em>486 US at 164). It is undisputed in this instance that, at most, there was a potential conflict because defendant\u2019s interests might have placed defense counsel under inconsistent duties in the future had defendant\u2019s father and girlfriend been called as witnesses at trial <em>(United States v Perez, </em>325 F3d 115, 125 [2d Cir 2003], citing <em>United States v Kliti, </em>156 F3d 150, 153 n 3 [2d Cir 1998]). But such a conflict, waivable so long as the court is satisfied that it is knowing and intelligent <em>(Perez, </em>325 F3d at 125), could hardly be considered serious, and clearly not enough to overcome the presumption in favor of affording defendant his constitutional right to counsel of his own choosing.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">The majority and the People latch onto the premise that, at the time of the disqualification motion, it was the defense\u2019s theory of the case that defendant was not the operator of the motorcycle, and that the \u201cdamaging\u201d testimony by defendant\u2019s father and girlfriend before the grand jury all but ensured that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>they would be called as witnesses. However, the defense advised the court that, without discovery, it had yet to determine its trial strategy. Moreover, a simple reading of the grand jury testimony of defendant\u2019s father and girlfriend, who were not called to testify before the second grand jury,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> indicates that their testimony was not substantially different from the statement defendant made to the police just three days after the crash. If anything, the testimony of defendant\u2019s father and girlfriend was no more damaging than defendant\u2019s own statement to the police which, upon a fair reading, rendered it unlikely that defendant would be pursuing a \u201cmistaken identity\u201d defense as the court surmised in its decision and order disqualifying defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In matters where there is an apparent conflict, the trial courts have a duty to protect a defendant\u2019s right to the effective assistance of counsel without concomitantly \u201carbitrarily interfering] with the attorney-client relationship\u201d (Gomberg, 38 NY2d at 313). Where, as here, the potential conflict is theoretical at best because the witnesses are united with the defendant and the defendant has been adequately apprised of the risks of waiving any potential conflict and agrees to do so, the defendant should not be deprived of his fundamental right to counsel of his own choosing. Absent any institutional concerns, such as where the attorney\u2019s representation would jeopardize the integrity of the judicial proceedings, courts should not \u201cassume too paternalistic an attitude in protecting the defendant from himself\u201d <em>(Perez, </em>325 F3d at 126, quoting <em>United States v Curcio, </em>694 F2d 14, 25 [2d Cir 1982]).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">There being no indication that allowing disqualified counsel to represent defendant in these circumstances would jeopardize the integrity of the proceedings, I would reverse the order of the Appellate Division and grant defendant a new trial with counsel of his choosing.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read and Jones concur with Chief Judge Lippman; Judge Pigott dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Judge Smith concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-9\"> The second grand jury proceeding occurred in September 2006 after disqualification of defense counsel, the indictment from the first grand jury proceeding having been dismissed due to the alleged conflict.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
