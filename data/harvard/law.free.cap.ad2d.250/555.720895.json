The plaintiffs alleged that the Elks had a duty to maintain the property in a reasonably safe condition, and that the Elks had notice of the alleged defect. They further alleged that the City had a duty to compel the Elks to install a sidewalk, and that the City should have maintained the sidewalk in proper condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-3\">To establish a prima facie case of negligence in a slip and fall case, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant either created the defect which caused the plaintiff\u2019s fall or had actual or constructive notice of it <em>(see, Kraemer v K-Mart Corp., </em>226 AD2d 590). In their respective motions for summary judgment, the City and the Elks made a prima facie showing that they did not create or have actual or constructive notice of the \u2022 alleged defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The evidence presented by the plaintiffs in opposition to the motions for summary judgment failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether the defendants either created or had prior .actual or constructive notice of the alleged defect <em>(see, Katz v City of New York, </em>87 NY2d 241; <em>see also, Poirier v City of Schenectady, </em>85 NY2d 310; <em>Gordon v American Museum of Natural History, </em>67 NY2d 836; <em>see also, Putnam v Stout, </em>38 NY2d 607, 612; <em>Landau v Town of Ramapo, </em>207 AD2d 384; <em>McMullen v State of New York, </em>199 AD2d 603). Furthermore, contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention, the City is not under an affirmative duty to compel a landowner to install a sidewalk <em>(see, </em>Administrative Code of City of NY \u00a7 19-152 [c]; <em>St. Jacques v City of New York, </em>88 NY2d 920, 922). Therefore, the Supreme Court - did not err in granting the respondents\u2019 respective motions for summary judgment. Bracken, J. P., O\u2019Brien, Santucci and Altman, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
