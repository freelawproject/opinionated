Defendant was not deprived of a fair trial by the complainant\u2019s blurting out of prior bad acts evidence contrary to the court\u2019s prior ruling excluding such evidence. The court properly exercised its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s application for a mistrial <em>(see, People v Young, </em>48 NY2d 995), because \u201cthe statement was cut off in midstream by the court\u2019s prompt intercession, minimizing any prejudicial effect it might have\u201d <em>(People v Blackshear, </em>112 AD2d 1044, 1045), and because the testimony was stricken and, in both the preliminary and final charge, the court directed the jury to disregard stricken testimony, an instruction the jury is presumed to have followed <em>(see, People v Roman, </em>210 AD2d 45, <em>lv denied </em>84 NY2d 1037). We note that defendant refused the court\u2019s offer of further curative instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">We reject defendant\u2019s argument that his conviction on the count of tampering with a witness (Penal Law \u00a7 215.11) relating to a December 28, 1993 telephone call was against the weight of the evidence. In assessing whether the statement constituted an attempt to instill fear, the jury was entitled to draw inferences based on the surrounding events, including subsequent threats made by defendant <em>(see, People v Ingram, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>71 NY2d 474).
