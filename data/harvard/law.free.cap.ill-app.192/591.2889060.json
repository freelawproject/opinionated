The account between the parties was kept as follows: Defendant had a book to which plaintiff had access, wherein was written, by the person making the delivery, the amount of bread delivered and the price thereof, and also the payments made therefor upon account. The book was not produced at the trial and there was no satisfactory evidence tending to show what became of it. In the usual course of business the book was retained by defendant. Defendant conceded that there was a balance due plaintiff when the parties ceased doing business in 1897. Proof offered by plaintiff tended to show that the amount of said balance was $360.05. Defendant was unable to state the amount of the balance. From June 12, 1902, to July 12, 1905, defendant made seven payments of $10 each to apply upon the balance due, and he also testified to a further payment of $45.30 on July 18, 1904. Plaintiff testified that the latter payment was made on July 18, 1907. The date upon receipt given for such payment appeared to have been changed. It was conceded that the payment of $45.30 was the last payment made by defendant. Two payments of $10 each were made by him in May and July, 1905.</p><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b616-8\" pgmap=\"616\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b616-9\" pgmap=\"616\">Account stated, \u00a7 25<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence sufficient to support judgment.

The payment was made by a check of the Illinois Steel Company,, which defendant had acquired from the original payee, and was the only available fund which defendant had on his person when demand for payment was made. The receipt then given by plaintiff was on account, not in full. Defendant offered no explanation as to why this was so.</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b616-5\" pgmap=\"616\">L. W.
