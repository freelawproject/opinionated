The evidence for plaintiff tends to show that she was rendered unconscious by the fall for a very short period; that she was conveyed to the County Hospital on the night of her injury, and remained there until ten o\u2019clock the following morning, when she was taken to the University Hospital, where she remained about two weeks; that she sustained superficial bruises on her breast, on the left side of her head, on her left hip and her right knee; that she sustained a more severe bruise about and above her left eye which developed a slight scar above her eye; that her malar or cheek bone was slightly depressed, or possibly fractured, with some resulting injury to the facial nerves; that she developed some symptoms of neurasthenia, which her own physicians were unable to testify was referable to the injuries sustained by her; that she suffered considerable pain, and has had occasional attacks of headache; that her sight is somewhat impaired, but whether such impairment of her sight was occasioned by her injuries was not disclosed by the evidence; that one of her teeth was broken and she had discharges of offensive matter from her nasal passages into her mouth; that she has \u201ca numb feeling\u201d on the left side of her face; that she was confined to her home for three months, during which time she was unable to do any housework; that up to the time of the trial she had been unable to do any washing or ironing.</p><headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b623-9\" pgmap=\"623\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b623-10\" pgmap=\"623\">1.
