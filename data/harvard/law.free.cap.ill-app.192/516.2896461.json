Roberts, defendant, based on attorney\u2019s lien for $100 claimed by plaintiff on a judgment obtained by James E. Tate against defendant.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-6\" pgmap=\"541\">Plaintiff alleged that defendant had paid $1,000 in satisfaction of such judgment after notice of his lien.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-7\" pgmap=\"541\">For defendant it was contended that she did not make such payment in her personal capacity but as executrix of the last will and testament of James Corlett, deceased, and under order of the Probate Court, and had no knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s contractual relations with Tate.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-8\" pgmap=\"541\">The evidence disclosed the following facts: James E. Tate obtained a judgment against defendant for $850. Later he also obtained a decree in chancery setting aside a deed from defendant to her father, James Corlett, of certain real estate, and authorizing a sale thereof under an execution upon said judgment, and directing payment from the proceeds of sale, first of $4000 to said Corlett, and then the judgment of $850 to Tate, unless the latter sum with interest was paid by some of the parties defendant to said decree. Nothing appears to have been done under said decree, but later Corlett died, leaving a will appointing defendant as his executrix. Pursuant to an order of the Probate Court, defendant, as such executrix, sold said real estate for payment of the debts of Corlett\u2019s estate.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-9\" pgmap=\"541\">The order required, first, the payment of certain liens, including the lien of Tate\u2019s judgment as established by said decree, then the payment of debts of the said estate. The amount of said lien was fixed in said order at $1,000 and defendant paid the same from the proceeds of the sale as directed.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-10\" pgmap=\"541(34) 542(158)\">One Brown was Tate\u2019s attorney in both the law and chancery proceedings above referred to. Afterwards, according to Heron\u2019s testimony, Tate came to him and said that Brown, his attorney, had taken the matter from the Superior Court to the Appellate Court to have a bill of review reviewed, or something of that sort, and that he wished Heron to loan him $25 for costs already incurred in printing briefs and abstracts and to assist Brown in every way possible in the Appellate Court, and that if he ever got any money out of that judgment against the Roberts family, he would pay Heron $100. Heron testified that his services were for assisting Brown \u201cin that matter\u201d and paying $25 for the printing, etc., and that shortly afterwards he served a notice of an attorney\u2019s lien on defendant. The evidence showed that he had nothing whatever to do with the Probate Court proceedings, and it did not appear that the proceeding in which he was engaged to assist Brown had anything to do with the cause of action in which the lien on Corlett\u2019s real estate was procured.</p><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b542-9\" pgmap=\"542\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b542-10\" pgmap=\"542\">1.
