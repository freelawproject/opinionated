The district in which the plant is located is essentially a manufacturing district, wherein are located the plants of the Liquid Carbonic Company, the McCormick branch of the International Harvester Company, the National Malleable Castings Company, the Pilsen Brewing Company, the C. F. Massey Company and other extensive manufacturing plants. To the east and immediately across Sacramento avenue are located the Bridewell and the dog pound.

There are some dwelling houses one or two blocks west on Whipple street and Albany avenue and northeast on Sacramento avenue. The plant of the Pilsen Brewing Company is north and west.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ARPc\" pgmap=\"485\">In the process of distillation of crude coal tar the tar is pumped into a horizontal still where it is heated until it commences to vaporize, and heat is continued to be applied until sufficient vapor has been formed to leave a residue of thin liquid pitch in the still. The vapor is drawn from the still through condensers, where it is transformed into a liquid known as ordinary creosote oil. When distillation is complete the temperature of the pitch in the still is between 500 and 600 degrees Fahrenheit. The pitch is then transferred by steam pressure from the still into coolers where the temperature of the pitch is lowered to about 350 deg\u2019rees Fahrenheit, when it is permitted to run into concrete receptacles known as \u201cpitch bays.\u201d In the last process mentioned some vapor and fumes arise from the pitch as it leaves the coolers and flows into the \u201cpitch bays.\u201d The presence of these vapors and fumes in the atmosphere constitutes the alleged violation by defendant of the section of the ordinance in question.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b486-6\" pgmap=\"486\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b486-7\" pgmap=\"486\">1.
