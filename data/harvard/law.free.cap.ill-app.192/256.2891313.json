To this statement of claim the defendants filed an affidavit of merits in which it was alleged that they were not indebted to plaintiff in any sum, but that on the contrary plaintiff was indebted to them in the sum of $25; that about June 30, 1913, plaintiff repreeexited to defendants that he would procure for them a certain building on West 26th street in Chicago, for the sum of $4,800, upon payment to him of $100 for his services to be rendered in procuring said building; that defendants agreed to purchase said building for said sum of $4,800, and thereupon paid plaintiff $25 with the understanding that if plaintiff procured said building for them defendants would pay plaintiff the additional sum of $75, but that if paintiff did not procure said building plaintiff would return to defendants said sum of $25; and that defendants were ready, willing and able to purchase said building for said sum of $4,800, but that plaintiff was unable to procure said building and has not returned to defendants said sum of $25. The defendants also filed a statement of claim for set-off for said $25. To this claim of set-off plaintiff filed an affidavit of merits in which plaintiff admitted that such sum of $25 was so paid plaintiff, and that the property on West 26th street was not delivered by plaintiff to defendants, but plaintiff alleged that said sum of $25 was afterwards, at the request of defendants, \u201cApplied upon a prior indebtedness of defendants to plaintiff of $100.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-5\" pgmap=\"281(128) 282(47)\">Upon the above statements of claims and answers thereto, the cause came on for trial March 5, 1914, before the court without a jury. Before the trial was concluded plaintiff, on March 9,1914, filed an amended statement of claim in which he seemingly abandoned his claim for an account stated, and in which he alleged that about May 1, 1913, defendants promised to pay plaintiff, \u201cacting as a salesman for Joseph Streska, real estate broker in the City of Chicago,\u201d the sum of $100 for \u201clooking up for them any real estate bargain which should be approved by them and put through\u201d; that plaintiff did look up and put through with defendants\u2019 approval a \u201creal property bargain from one Alois Slunecko\u201d and defendants became indebted \u201cto plaintiff\u2019s principal\u201d in the sum aforesaid, which sum defendants refuse to pay; that plaintiff \u201cis the actual bona fide owner of aforesaid claim, same having been duly assigned to him about June 30, 1913\u201d; and that there is now due plaintiff from defendants the sum of $75.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-4\" pgmap=\"282\">To this amended statement of claim the defendant, Salzberg, filed an affidavit of merits on behalf of both defendants in which he alleged that plaintiff did not perform any services for defendants at their request, that plaintiff is not a licensed broker as required by the Chicago Code, secs. 192-198 inclusive; that plaintiff was not acting as a salesman for Joseph Streska in negotiating said real estate transaction between defendants and said Alois Slunecko, and that said Streska was not a licensed real estate broker in Chicago; that in the transaction referred to plaintiff acted as the agent for said Slunecko and not for defendants; that the alleged claim of said Streska against defendants was not assigned to plaintiff; and that plaintiff is indebted to defendants in the sum of $25 for cash paid as more fully set forth in defendants\u2019 claim of set-off.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\" pgmap=\"282\">On March 21, 1914, the trial court found the issues against defendants and assessed plaintiff\u2019s damages at $75, and entered judgment against defendants on the finding, from which they bring error.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-6\" pgmap=\"282\">Shulman &amp; Shulman, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-7\" pgmap=\"282\">No appearance for defendant in error.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b283-14\" pgmap=\"283\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
