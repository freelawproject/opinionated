McLean for $62.20, and on April 24th, following, an execution issued on said judgment was served on said McLean by the bailiff of the Municipal Court, who then notified McLean that he must, within ten days thereafter, file a schedule of his property, if he desired to avail himself of the benefit of the exemption laws. On May 1st, following, McLean executed what purported to be a schedule of his personal property, wherein he set forth that he was the head of a family consisting of a wife and one child, and resided with the same, and stated that he desired to avail himself of the benefit of the act relating to exemptions. The property schedule was described therein, as follows: \u201cA small stock of groceries and meats not to. exceed One Hundred Dollars ($100.00); one suit of clothes. Cash on hand, None; Debts due and owing me, None.\u201d On May 2nd, following, the attorney for McLean went to the office of the bailiff of the Municipal Court and handed the schedule to a deputy bailiff at the window there, and told him that he (the attorney) had a schedule here. The deputy bailiff took the schedule, examined it, folded it up and stamped it: \u201cDeceived\u2014First District. Thomas M. Hunter, Bailiff of the Municipal Court of Chicago, this 2nd day of May, A. D. 1911.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-5\" pgmap=\"475\">After the filing of the said schedule in the office of the bailiff, the attorney for the judgment creditor was notified thereof, and he then informed the chief deputy bailiff that the manner of the description of the property in the schedule rendered the same illegal and void for uncertainty. Upon the execution by the judgment creditor of an indemnifying bond, the bailiff levied the execution upon certain specifically described property, consisting of more than one hundred separate items of property, such as are ordinarily included in a stock of groceries and meats, and being the same property which was claimed by McLean to be exempt. McLean then procured a writ of replevin to be issued out of the Municipal Court for the recovery of said property from the bailiff and said property was taken under said writ by the sheriff and returned to McLean.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-6\" pgmap=\"475\">Upon the trial of the replevin suit in the Municipal Court, a jury having been waived, the court found the issues in favor of the defendant, Thomas M. Hunter, bailiff, and judgment was entered upon such finding for the return of said property to said defendant and against the plaintiff, McLean, for costs. This writ of error is prosecuted to reverse such judgment.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b476-7\" pgmap=\"476\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b476-8\" pgmap=\"476\">1.

A schedule under which the debtor claims exemptions, which describes the property claimed as exempt as \u201cA small stock of groceries and meats not to exceed One Hundred Dollars ($100.00); one suit of clothes.

The schedule in which exemptions are claimed should list separately each article of a distinct kind or of a distinct quality, and the filing of a schedule claiming exemptions which does not do so is not a compliance with the statute (J. &amp; A. f[ 5584), which provides that the debtor \u201cshall make a schedule of every kind and character.\u201d</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b476-10\" pgmap=\"476\">3.
