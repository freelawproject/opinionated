Where, upon a motion for a new trial after a verdict for plaintiff for somewhat less than the amount of her claim, the trial court held that an item of plaintiff\u2019s claim had been improperly submitted to the jury, its action in permitting the plaintiff to remit the amount of the objectionable items and thereupon deny a new trial, upon the assumption that the jury allowed an item properly submitted as well as the improper item, was not erroneous, where from the items of plaintiff\u2019s claim and the amount of the verdict the court was able to determine with reasonable certainty what items were included in the verdict.</headnotes><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-3\" pgmap=\"89\">All of the above items of the plaintiff\u2019s claim were submitted to the jury, although the defendant contended that it was improper to submit the \u201cGales-burg claim\u201d item to the jury for the reason that the alleged contract relating to the same was against public policy and void. On the motion for a new trial, the trial court assumed that the jury by its verdict of $500 allowed the plaintiff $400 for the \u201cGalesburg claim\u201d item and $100 for the \u201cJanesville claim\u201d item and disallowed the other two items of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and the court held that it was error to submit the \u201cGalesburg claim\u201d item to the jury for the reason that the alleged contract between the plaintiff and defendant in reference to the \u201cGalesburg claim\u201d was against public policy and void, and the court stated that if the plaintiff wonld remit $400 from the amount of the verdict, he would overrule the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial and enter judgment for $100, and over the objection of the defendant, the plaintiff was allowed to enter a remittitur for $400 and thereupon the motion for a new trial was overruled and judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff for $100, from which defendant appeals.</p><attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b89-4\" pgmap=\"89\">Charles J.
