L. Halperin against Louis Dultz in the Municipal Court of Chicago to recover rent of a certain store belonging to the plaintiff, for the months of November, 1911, to February, 1912, inclusive, at the rate of thirty-seven dollars per month. The defendant had rented the premises in question by parol lease at thirty-seven dollars per month for a certain period. Defendant sold the business conducted by him in the store to other parties. The plaintiff consented to this and gave them a lease. The parties to whom the defendant sold remained on the premises under the lease to them from the plaintiff for a while but moved out before the term of the lease expired without the consent of the plaintiff. Plaintiff testified that at the time the defendant proposed that he lease the premises to these parties and at the time he leased it to them he told the defendant that he would look to him for any loss and that the defendant agreed to this.
