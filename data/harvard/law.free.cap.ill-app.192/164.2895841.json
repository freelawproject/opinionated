The original declaration in four counts was filed August 10, 1911. A demurrer to this declaration and each count thereof having been sustained,' an amended declaration in four counts was filed November 10, 1911. In each of the counts of this amended declaration it was charged that the defendant, the Chicago City Railway Company, on May 14, 1911, by its negligence caused the death of Ella Wende, a girl of the age of nine years, while she was attempting to cross the tracks of the defendant at or near the intersection of Sixty-Ninth and Justine streets in the city of Chicago.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-9\" pgmap=\"188\">The first count charged that the defendant \u201cby its servants so carelessly, negligently and improperly . drove,, managed and propelled a certain trolley car that it ran down and killed Ella Wende.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-10\" pgmap=\"188(60) 189(25)\">The second count specified the alleged negligence in managing the car to be \u201cthat the servants in charge of said car in approaching the said crossing known as' Justine street failed to ring the gong or give any warning of the approach of said car at or near the said crossing\u201d; that the motorman of said car \u201cfailed to give warning of the approach of said car to those who were then and there about to cross said tracks at or near Justine street.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-5\" pgmap=\"189\">The third count alleged \u201cthat the said defendant by its servants were then and there driving in an easterly direction a certain trolley car along the said West 69th street * * * and while the said deceased, Ella Wende * * * with the due care and diligence of a child of nine years of age was * * * attempting to cross the tracks of the said defendant, said Ella Wende fell directly in front of the fender in front of the said car,\u201d and \u201cthat at the time aforesaid there was a valid existing ordinance of the said City of Chicago which made it the duty of the defendant to provide a useful and efficient and serviceable fender, and that at the said time and place there were valid existing city ordinances, which ordinances are in the words as follows:</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-9\" pgmap=\"189\">\u201cSec. 1963. Fenders. Every person or corporation controlling, operating or owning any street railway in the City shall equip and provide each and every car used on such street railway with fenders of steel and of the basket kind, which said fenders shall be substantially attached to the front end of such car so as to guard passengers or pedestrians from being\u2019 injured or thrown under the wheels of the car in case of a collision or other accident, provided, however, that where such cars are operated in trains or where such car is attached to a grip car or other car such fender need only be provided upon the grip car or front car of such train. \u2019 \u2019</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-10\" pgmap=\"189\">Also:</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-11\" pgmap=\"189\">\u201cAn Ordinance Authorizing the Chicago City Railway Co. to construct, maintain and operate a system of Street Railways in Streets and Public Ways of the City of Chicago.

All cars shall be equipped with efficient and serviceable fender devices, headlights and sandboxes;\u201d and that \u201cit hecame and was the duty of the defendant to observe and conform to the said City ordinances and to have upon its said car a proper, useful and serviceable and efficient fender;\u201d that \u201cif the said defendant had complied with the ordinances aforesaid and had had such a fender upon the car, Ella Wende would not have been killed or seriously injured; that on the contrary such a fender would have protected and saved the deceased;\u201d but that the defendant \u201cfailed to comply with the terms of the said city ordinances and had then and there upon the said car an old, defective, useless and non-efficient fender,\u201d and \u201cthe said fender when the deceased struck it failed to work properly, whereby the body of plaintiff\u2019s intestate was permitted to get under the trucks and other parts of the car and thereby the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was killed.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-5\" pgmap=\"190\">The fourth count, which alleged defects in the roadbed of the defendant, was, during the trial, withdrawn by an order of discontinuance as to the same, made at the instance of the plaintiff.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-6\" pgmap=\"190\">On April 2, 1913, leave was given to the plaintiff \u201cto amend the third amended count in the declaration filed in said cause\u201d and a paper was filed entitled in the cause and headed: \u201cAmendment to 3rd Amended Count.\u201d It proceeded:</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-7\" pgmap=\"190\">\u2018 On page 8, last paragraph extending on page 9 of Amended Declaration strike out the following:</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-8\" pgmap=\"190\">Sec. 1963.

Fenders : Every person or corporation controlling, operating or owning any street railway in the city shall equip and provide each and every car used on such'street railway with fenders, which shall be of a type and design satisfactory to the Commissioner of Public Works and which shall be securely attached to the front end of such car so as to guard passengers or pedestrians from being injured or thrown under the wheels of such car in case of a collision or other accident.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-5\" pgmap=\"191\">Defendant filed a plea of the statute of limitations to \u201cthe third count of the amended declaration as amended, \u2019 \u2019 to which plea plaintiff filed a demurrer.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-6\" pgmap=\"191\">An order overruling plaintiff\u2019s demurrer to defendant\u2019s plea of the statute of limitations was entered September 15, 1913, before the beginning of the trial, as follows:</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-7\" pgmap=\"191\">\u201cOn motion for defendant it is ordered that the demurrer of the plaintiff to the Plea of the Statute of Limitations filed by the defendant April 4 is overruled.

On motion of attorney for defendamt suit dismissed as to the amendment to the third amended count filed by plaintiff on April 2, 1913, and issues being joined herein it is ordered that a jury come, etc.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-8\" pgmap=\"191\">During the trial objections to evidence concerning fenders were made by the defendant\u2019s counsel on the ground that the third count of the amended declaration was no longer in the case, but they were overruled by the trial judge. On the hearing of the motion for a new trial, counsel for the defendant insisted on the point, but the Court replied to him that the \u201cplaintiff tried to amend the third count but did not amend it. The plea of the statute was sustained as to that amendment. * * * The plaintiff did not attempt to draw an amended third count. He simply attempted to file an amendment to the third amended count. You already had a plea of the general issue to the third amended count.\u201d After an extended discussion the Court said:</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-10\" pgmap=\"191\">\u201cThere is no question that the Court held the third amended count of that date was still in the case. The case was tried on that theory. * * * It was assumed all through the case that the third amended count was in the case. \u2019 \u2019</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-12\" pgmap=\"191\">After full consideration of the matter by the trial judge he entered the following order October 18, 1913:</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-4\" pgmap=\"192\">\u201cOn motion of the attorney for plaintiff the order made and entered September 15,' 1913, by the Court is hereby amended and corrected so as to read as follows :</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-5\" pgmap=\"192\">On motion of defendant it is ordered that the demurrer of the plaintiff filed May 12, 1913, to the plea of the statute of limitation filed April 4, 1913, is overruled, to which ruling the plaintiff excepts and elects to stand by his demurrer.</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-6\" pgmap=\"192\">Defendant asks for judgment on the plea of the Statute of Limitation filed April 4, 1913, and that the suit be dismissed as to the third amended count filed November 10, 1911, as amended April 2, 1913, and the Court denies the motion of the defendant to dismiss the suit as to third amended count filed November 10, 1911, as amended April 2, 1913, to which ruling defendant excepts and the Court dismissed the suit as to the amendment to the third amended count filed April 2, 1913; and the Court further orders that the third amended count filed November 10, 1911, and the plea of the general issue of defendant thereto and the replication of the plaintiff thereto stand, to which the defendant excepts and thereupon the defendant moves the Court to vacate the foregoing order, which motion is by the Court continued.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-7\" pgmap=\"192\">November 28, 1913, the motion last referred to was denied in a \u201cjudgment order\u201d entered on that day, which reads in the transcript of record before us as follows:</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-8\" pgmap=\"192\">\u201cAugmste Wende, Administratrix of the Estate of Ella Wende, deceased,</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b192-9\" pgmap=\"192\">vs. Case No. 306672.</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-10\" pgmap=\"192\">Chicago City Eailway.</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-11\" pgmap=\"192\">On motion of attorney for plaintiff motion of deft, to vacate order of Oct. 18, 1913, denied.

The evidence concerning the fender was that it was of the approved and required style. Plaintiff contended that if it did not work properly it was the fault of that particular fender which rendered it \u201cunserviceable and inefficient;\u201d that the car was just coming from the barn and should have been properly equipped.</p><p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-8\" pgmap=\"193(56) 194(60)\">Defendant contended that the fender was in order, and it introduced evidence to the effect that this automatically working fender had actually worked as it was intended to when it had struck the body of the child; that the \u201capron,\u201d that part which strikes the object on the tracks, had been thrown back and had caused the basket part of the fender, designed to pick the object from the tracks before the wheels could pass over it, to be thrown down and to lie upon the rails. It contended also that the probable reason that the girl\u2019s body went under it was that her hand or foot had fallen into a depression between the tracks.</p><headnotes data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b194-9\" pgmap=\"194\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b194-10\" pgmap=\"194(102) 195(25)\">1.

Where, in. an action for the death of a child, alleged to have been caused by defendant\u2019s negligence in operating its car, in running it at an improper rate of speed and not .ringing its gong, the weight of the evidence shows that the motorman was attending properly to his duties; that the car was not running at an improper rate of speed; that, even if the gong was not sounded, the circumstances were not such as to make the omission to ring it negligence; that when the child\u2019s danger was known to the motorman, the motorman tried to warn her and made every possible effort to stop the car, defendant cannot be held negligent</headnotes><p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-4\" pgmap=\"194\">The evidence was conflicting concerning the fender and its situation immediately after the accident. Witnesses for the plaintiff testified that the fender was \u2018/up,\u2019,\u2019 not \u201cdown,\u201d after the accident, which amounted in effect to saying that it \u201chad failed to work,\u201d which indeed was the definite statement of one witness,.which statement, however, was stricken out by the court as a conclusion and incompetent.
