Kier such goods as Kier might want from time to time, agreeing to become fully responsible to plaintiffs for any balance, either upon open account or promissory notes, which Kier might from time to time owe plaintiffs, not exceeding the sum of $400 for such purchases. All notice necessary to charge him as guarantor in case plaintiffs should call upon him to pay any deficiency was acknowledged by defendant in the writing, and he agreed that said writing should be construed as a continuing guaranty. In plaintiffs\u2019 statement of the claim, to which a copy of the guaranty was attached, it was alleged, in substance, that plaintiffs\u2019 open account against said Kier amounted to the total sum of $384.86, for merchandise delivered to him, and that defendant owed plaintiffs said sum.</p><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b144-10\" pgmap=\"144\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b144-11\" pgmap=\"144\">Guaranty, \u00a7 1<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence sufficient to establish.
