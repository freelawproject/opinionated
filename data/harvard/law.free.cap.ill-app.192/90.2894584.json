I will, to the best of my knowledge, give you below the names and amounts of the various people that I have collected from, asking\u2019 your kind indulgence in giving me one more chance to make a man of myself and again gain your valued confidence. 1 will try my utmost to repay and be a valuable man to your house if given this one chance.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-9\" pgmap=\"115\">Again begging you for your kind indulgence, I remain,</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-10\" pgmap=\"115\">Sincerely yours,</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-11\" pgmap=\"115\">Emanuel Zuckerman.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-12\" pgmap=\"115\">Below the signature are given the names of twenty-nine persons and opposite each name there is written certain figures, and underneath the column of figures is written the total sum, \u201c$1,689.60,\u201d and underneath this total sum is again \u201cEmanuel Zuckerman.\u201d It is further alleged in the statement of claim in which the instrument is set out that\u20181 said writing was given to \u2022 evidence an indebtedness created by the false embezzlement, misappropriation and defalcation of the said Zuckerman while acting in a fiduciary capacity, to-wit: as agent and collector in the employ of the plaintiff.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-13\" pgmap=\"115\">In a second count plaintiff claimed an additional sum of $316.09.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-14\" pgmap=\"115(75) 116(221)\">On August 28, 1911, on motion of defendant, the court ordered that the plaintiff file an amended statement of claim within ten days, and that defendant file an affidavit of merits within ten days thereafter. On September 13, 1911, plaintiff moved that this order be vacated and set aside, and the court ordered that said motion be entered, to be taken up on notice. On January 13, 1912, the court overruled plaintiff\u2019s motion, but ordered that \u201cleave be given to plaintiff to file an amended second count to statement of claim within thirty days,\u201d and that defendant file an affidavit of merits thereto within thirty days thereafter. Plaintiff never filed an amended second count, nor made any attempt at the trial to sustain by proof its said additional claim of $316.09. Before the time had expired for plaintiff to file said amended second count, defendant filed an affidavit of merits, in which he alleged: (1) That plaintiff\u2019s cause of action as stated in its statement of claim did not accrue to the plaintiff within five years before the commencement of the action; and (2) that \u201cwhen the paper, a copy of which is set out in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, was signedhe was in plaintiff\u2019s office and was falsely charged by representatives of plaintiff with having embezzled money from plaintiff and threatened with arrest unless he signed the paper; that he was there promised by plaintiff\u2019s representatives that upon an accounting being had he would be credited with certain commissions, to which he was entitled, but that no accounting was ever had, and that \u20181 at the time of the signing of the said paper\u201d he was in fact not indebted to plaintiff in any sum whatsoever.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-6\" pgmap=\"116(134) 117(146)\">On February 5, 1913, defendant filed an amended affidavit of merits in which he made the same allegations as in his original affidavit of merits, and further alleged, by way of set-off to plaintiff\u2019s claim, that there was due him from plaintiff, a balance for commissions earned by him from May 1, 1901, to March 14, 1903, and that from March 14, 1903, until June 17, 1903, he rendered services for plaintiff and was entitled to receive therefor a sum in excess of $1,000, but that during said time plaintiff deducted and kept from his weekly advancements the sum of $140, and also kept the advancement of $40 due defendant for the last week of his employment, as well as all of defendant\u2019s commissions, amounting for the last named period to a sum in excess of $1,000, and that there was due defendant from plaintiff, at the time of the commencement of this suit, a sum in excess of $3,000, over and above any claim of plaintiff. And defendant further alleged, in substance, that while he was not in fact guilty of any embezzlement, yet he signed the paper, not for the reason that he was indebted to plaintiff, but because of the threats on the part of plaintiff\u2019s representatives to arrest him, and that thereafter plaintiff refused to credit him with the commissions due him, and proceeded to prosecute him criminally for embezzlement, relying on said writing to procure defendant\u2019s conviction, which conviction plaintiff unjustly procured. To this amended affidavit of merits plaintiff filed a replication, alleging that the several items of set-off therein claimed by defendant did not accrue within five years, etc.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-5\" pgmap=\"117(202) 118(104)\">On the trial defendant was called as a witness for plaintiff under section 33 of the Municipal Court Act (J. &amp; A. ft 3345), and he admitted that he signed and swore to the amended affidavit of merits filed in the cause. A copy of the instrument in writing was introduced in evidence, it appearing that the original thereof had been lost since the time it was introduced in evidence on the trial of the ease of People v. Zuckerman in the Criminal Court of Cook county in the year 1904. The defendant was the only witness called in his behalf and gave certain testimony regarding his alleged claim of set-off, but practically all of his testimony relative thereto was subsequently stricken from the record by the court, with the exception of that tending to show that during the fourteen weeks he remained in plaintiff\u2019s employ after March 14, 1903, certain deductions were made from his salary, amounting in all to about $180, under an agreement between the parties that the deductions should be applied as a credit on said sum of $1,689.60. The plaintiff in rebuttal offered testimony tending to show that no such deductions or agreement were made, and the court finally gave to the jury the following instructions: \u201cThe jury are instructed that the only question for you to decide is whether or not subsequent to March 14, 1903, any deductions were made from the defendant\u2019s salary which were by agreement between the parties to be applied upon defendant\u2019s indebtedness to plaintiff, admitted by writing of March 14, 1903; that if you believe from the evidence that there was no agreement that deductions should so apply, your verdict should be for the sum of $2,523.93, but at all events your verdict should be for $2,223.93.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-5\" pgmap=\"118\">During the trial, at the request of attorney for defendant, it was stipulated that the Supreme Court opinion (Zuckerman v. People, 213 Ill. 114) might be introduced and read as a part of the evidence in the cause. From this opinion it appears that a jury had found Zuckerman guilty of larceny by embezzlement and found the amount taken to be $285.09; that he was sentenced by the Criminal Court of Cook county in accordance with the verdict, and that in December, 1904, the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of said Criminal Court. Other facts, as disclosed from said opinion, are as follows:</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-6\" pgmap=\"118(142) 119(88)\">\u201cThe plaintiff in error was employed by the Grossfeld &amp; Roe Company, a corporation engaged in selling groceries at wholesale in Chicago, as an outside salesman, taking orders and collecting money from customers. He made collections from various customers which he did not account for or turn over to his employer, and on March 14, 1903, he furnished to the officers of the corporation a list of such customers and the amounts collected from them, aggregating $1,689.60, and signed two written statements confessing that he had collected said sums from customers of the corporation without accounting for them or paying the same over after demand and without the knowledge of the corporation. He was continued in the employ of the corporation afterward and collected from customers and retained other sums up to June 17, 1903, when he told the officers of the corporation that he had collected money amounting to about $300 which he had not turned over. He was then arrested and was subsequently indicted for larceny and embezzlement. On his trial under the indictment he admitted the collection of $316.09, specified in sundry receipts, which he had not paid to his employer. The only controversy as to matter of fact was whether he was authorized by his contract of employment to retain the sums of money collected and not turned over.\u201d</p><headnotes data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Ad6\" pgmap=\"119\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-9\" pgmap=\"119\">1. Municipal Court of Chicago, \u00a7 13<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when statement of claim sufficient to support judgment. In an action in the Municipal Court of Chicago, plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim consisted of two counts, claiming two distinct indebtednesses. On motion of defendant, plaintiff was ordered to file an amended statement of claim, but the record did not show that the first count of the statement was stricken from the record. By a later order, plaintiff was given leave to file an amended second count to its statement of claim, but never did so. Before the time had expired in which plaintiff might file it, defendant filed an affidavit of merits and later filed an amended affidavit of merits to said first count. It was held that the statement of claim was not stricken from the record and by filing its affidavit of merits, defendant joined issue on the first count.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-11\" pgmap=\"119(43) 120(15)\">2.
