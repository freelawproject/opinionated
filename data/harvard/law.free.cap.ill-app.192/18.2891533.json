In an action for breach of building contracts, where at the time the contracts were offered in evidence it was contended that plaintiffs had declared on a contract signed and executed by the plaintiffs, held that an objection, predicated upon the theory that the contracts offered in evidence were not the ones described in the statement of claim, was without merit on the question of variance, since the statement did not allege that the contracts were signed by the plaintiffs.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b42-16\" pgmap=\"42(9) 43(81)\">2.

In an action for damages for breach of building contracts by husband and wife, the fact that the wife did not sign the contracts offered in evidence, becomes immaterial where she accepted and adopted the written contracts and assented to their terms and conditions so as to be bound by them, and defendants treated and dealt with her throughout the entire transaction as a party to the contracts.</headnotes><p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"AhC\" pgmap=\"42\">(Not to be reported in full)</p><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-8\" pgmap=\"42\">Appeal from the Municipal Court of Chicago; the Hon.

In an action by husband and wife for breach of building contracts, where defendants treated and consulted the wife as a real party to the transaction, with some legal or equitable right in the property in question, held that the defendants were not in a position to assert that she had no interest in the suit such as to preclude her joining with her husband in the action.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b43-5\" pgmap=\"43\">4.

In an action for breach of building contracts where a contractor and builder of twenty years\u2019 experience testified in behalf of plaintiffs that the difference between the value of the building as constructed and the value of the building if it had been constructed according to the contract was $2,560, and an architect of twenty-four years\u2019 experience in behalf of plaintiffs placed the difference at $2,935, and defendants did not introduce any evidence bearing on the question of damages, the finding of the trial court of damages in the sum of $2,560 is held to be justified.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
