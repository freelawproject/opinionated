Lande, one for $200 and the other for $133; that on July 21, 1906, executions were issued on both said judgments and placed in Snyder\u2019s hands for service; that on July 31st, following, said Snyder levied upon and carried away certain described jewelry, clocks, watches, fountain pens and store furnishings belonging to Israel Benjamin, of the value of $2,000; that said Benjamin, before or at the time of said levy, informed said Snyder that he, Benjamin, was the owner of said goods and chattels and protested against said Snyder levying upon and taking and carrying away the same or any part thereof.

Benjamin is the owner of this property;\u201d that on the signs in front of the store, whereon appeared the name \u201cT. D.
