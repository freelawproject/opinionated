Hedmark, plaintiff, against Chicago Railways Company, a corporation, defendant, for damages alleged to have been sustained by defendant\u2019s negligence.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aqgq\" pgmap=\"608\">On motion of defendant at close of plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the court instructed the jury to return a verdict . for defendant and entered judgment thereon.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-4\" pgmap=\"609\">To reverse the judgment plaintiff prosecutes this writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-5\" pgmap=\"609\">The evidence showed that plaintiff was driving an automobile owned by him east on Monroe street in the city of Chicago, the automobile being entirely closed, front and sides. It had a mohair top and side curtains of cloth and isinglass, and, according to plaintiff\u2019s testimony, three-fourths at least of the side curtains was of isinglass, and it was possible to see through it.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-6\" pgmap=\"609\">Monroe street runs east and west and Fortieth avenue runs north and south. The accident occurred at the intersection of these streets. On the northwest corner of the streets was a vacant lot, which had a fifty foot frontage on Monroe street and it extended back sixty feet on Fortieth avenue. North of this vacant lot and sixty feet from the Monroe street building line there was a building. On the southwest corner there was a building which was back thirty-five or thirty-six feet from the curbstone on Monroe street, and the width of the sidewalk nine or ten feet from the curbstone on Fortieth avenue.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-7\" pgmap=\"609(165) 610(63)\">Plaintiff testified that when he was a block west of Fortieth avenue he was going about fourteen miles an hour and slackened up a little, and that when he got somewhere in the neighborhood, perhaps a little west of the vacant lot, he looked north to see if there was a car coming and did not see any; that then he let his machine coast along and looked towards the south to see if a car was coming from that direction, and as he \u201cstraightened up, the street car was right on to me,\u2014nearly.\u201d He testified that when he first saw the car he was not on the car track, but was very close to it and the car was .between eight to ten feet from him; that he then reached for his reverse lever, but before he could reach it the street car hit the left side of the front end of the automobile, throwing it southwest, The plaintiff further stated that when be was five feet from the street car track he was going probably eight or ten miles an hour, and that going at that speed he could have stopped his automobile within three or four feet in an emergency. There were three other witnesses to the accident besides the plaintiff. There was no controversy in the evidence offered on behalf of the plaintiff.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-5\" pgmap=\"610\">It was urged in behalf of the plaintiff as a ground of reversal that the question of contributory negligence was one of fact and should have been submitted to the jury.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-6\" pgmap=\"610\">One of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, Sullivan, who was a pedestrian crossing Monroe street at Fortieth avenue at the time of the accident, first saw the automobile when it was about fifty feet west of Fortieth avenue. The machine was then slowed down, and, after running ten feet or a little further, it was started up' again, being at that time about thirty-five or forty feet from the point of collision. He testified \u201cas he started up, I \u2018hollered\u2019 at him, but do not know whether he heard me or not. I saw that he could not make it across the street before he was hit by the street car which I saw coming from the north.\u201d He further testified that when he saw the car it was about seventy-five or eighty feet from the point of collision. When he was asked as to the speed of \"the car, he said: \u201cWell, just as I designated to you before,' I had not the rate of the street car nor automobile. I could not tell you what rate they were going, but I should judge, \u2014well, it was going at pretty fair speed, as I said before.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-7\" pgmap=\"610\">Another witness, who was with Sullivan at the time, testified that he heard Sullivan \u201choller, \u2019 \u2019 and he looked up and saw an automobile approaching from the west and a street car coming from the north, \u201cboth of them going at a pretty fair rate of speed,\u2014in just about twenty seconds the street car struck the automobile.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-8\" pgmap=\"610(8) 611(56)\">He further stated that the 'automobile was about thirty-five or forty feet west of the point of collision, and the car about seventy-five to eighty feet north of it when he first saw them. On cross-examination the witnesses said that the street car was in front of the vacant lot when the automobile was thirty or forty feet west of the place of collision.</p><headnotes data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b611-11\" pgmap=\"611\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b611-12\" pgmap=\"611(32) 612(22)\">1.
