Dee Company to recover a balance of two hundred dollars alleged to be due under a written agreement for the sale of an engine and generator. From a judgment for two hundred dollars against defendant in favor of plaintiff, defendant brings error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-10\" pgmap=\"38(47) 39(122)\">Plaintiff shipped an engine and a generator to defendant for which three hundred dollars was to be paid at the signing of the contract and the balance of two hundred dollars to .be paid when engine and generator were tested and found to be in satisfactory condition. Shortly after the receipt of the machine defendant tested the same and notified the plaintiff that it was not in a satisfactory condition, stating that it would put it in a satisfactory condition at the expense of plaintiff. The defendant not hearing from the plaintiff thereafter expended two hundred dollars in rewinding the armature of the generator and putting the machine in a satisfactory condition. Defendant never offered to rescind the contract of sale or to return the engine and generator to the plaintiff and it has since continued to operate the same at its place of business. Plaintiff sued to recover the unpaid balance of two hundred dollars alleged to be due under the contract of sale.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b39-7\" pgmap=\"39\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b39-8\" pgmap=\"39\">1.

Where a contract expressly provided that a balance of two hundred dollars was to be paid when an engine and generator were tested and found to be in satisfactory condition and the plaintiff failed to deliver the machine in a satisfactory condition, there was a breach of warranty on the part of the plaintiff so that under the circumstances the defendant was not required to rescind the contract and to return the machine, but had the right to recoup the damages sustained by reason of the breach in an action for the balance due on the machine.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b40-5\" pgmap=\"40\">5.
