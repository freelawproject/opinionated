J. Brogren, J. A. Ferguson and S. C. Ferguson, defendants, to quiet title to certain property purchased by complainant from Charles B. Wakeley.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-4\" pgmap=\"606\">To reverse a judgment for complainant, defendants prosecute this writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-5\" pgmap=\"606\">The defendants were served with summons and appeared. Defendant Brog\u2019ren answered the bill on June 28, 1910. The two Fergusons demurred to the' bill. Defendant Brogren filed a cross-bill against Dell and the two Fergusons and Charles R. Wakeley. Wakeley answered the cross-bill.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-6\" pgmap=\"606\">On March 13, 1911, the demurrers of the Fergusons to the bill were sustained and complainant Dell was given ten days to amend. April 15, 1911, after the time to amend had passed, the solicitor for defendants Fergusons appeared in court and, without notice to opposing counsel, obtained an order dismissing the original bill as to themselves. Six days later an amendment to the bill was filed, the only purpose of which was to change the word \u201cwarranty\u201d to \u201cquitclaim\u201d and bring into the bill copies of certain deeds as exhibits.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-7\" pgmap=\"606\">On November 23,1911, the solicitors for complainant Dell gave notice of a motion to vacate the order dismissing the bill as to the Fergusons, to be heard when the cause should be reached for trial. The Fergusons were then in the case as defendants to the cross-bill of defendant Brogren, and remained in said case as such defendants until the final decree.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-8\" pgmap=\"606\">On the day on which the cause was reached for trial, as appears by the final decree, the cross-complainant below, defendant Brogren, failed to appear and the cause was heard and the decree of June 25, 1912, was entered.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-9\" pgmap=\"606\">Subsequently, on July 1, 1912, defendant Brogren, and the Fergusons as defendants to the cross-bill, moved to vacate the decree. This motion was denied on July 6th. Later the court granted leave to the same parties to file a motion for rehearing and to vacate the decree. This motion was also denied.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-10\" pgmap=\"606(11) 607(129)\">Assignments of error Nos, 1, 2, 12 and 15 seek to raise the question as to the jurisdiction of the Honorable Jesse A. Baldwin, one of the judges of the Circuit Court, to hear and determine the cause, growing out of what is alleged to be the fact in the briefs that the cause was regularly on the trial calendar of Honorable Kickham Scanlan, who was regularly assigned to hear chancery cases in the Circuit Court, and that without any order or proceeding entered of record, the cause was put upon a trial calendar to be heard and determined by his Honor, Judge Baldwin. In support of the position that Judge Baldwin had no right to hear and decide the cause and enter the decree in question, the rules of the Circuit Court of Cook county were cited.</p><headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b607-9\" pgmap=\"607\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b607-10\" pgmap=\"607\">1.
