Plaintiff mentioned the property to one Beilley, who wished to purchase a house in that vicinity, and about March 18, 1913, plaintiff showed Beilley the premises and house. Beilley made an offer of seven thousand dollars, which defendant refused. Subsequently plaintiff got Beilley to make an offer of seventy-one hundred dollars, but defendant also refused this offer and plaintiff so told Beilley. Thereupon plaintiff ceased his negotiations with Beilley, and, according to Beilley\u2019s testimony, he (Beilley) gave up the idea of buying the house and commenced looking for another house. Subsequently one Takken, another real estate broker, who had been trying to sell Beilley a house in a different location upon being informed by Beilley that he (Beilley) had previously looked at defendant\u2019s property but had given up the idea of purchasing it because of the price, entered negotiations with Reilley and defendant and shortly procured from Reilley an offer of seventy-two hundred dollars, (two-thonsand dollars down and balance in deferred payments) for the property which he finally succeeded in getting defendant to accept. The contract of sale was presented to both parties by Takken and signed by them, and defendant paid Takken one hundred and eighty dollars as commissions.</p><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b152-9\" pgmap=\"152\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b152-10\" pgmap=\"152\">Brokers, \u00a7 88<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence insufficient to establish right to commission.
