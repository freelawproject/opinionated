Meyer and Samuel S. Hess copartners trading as Meyer, Hess &amp; Company, plaintiffs, against Wakem &amp; McLaughlin, Inc., a corporation, defendant, to recover the value of certain articles alleged to have been contained in packing cases delivered to defendant as warehouseman and lost through its negligence.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-6\" pgmap=\"110\">Testimony was given by plaintiffs\u2019 employee, who .packed one of the cases, that he unpacked it when it was returned and found that certain articles he had put into it were missing; that the box was broken and appeared to have been tampered with. The latter part of his testimony was corroborated by one of plaintiffs. There was no testimony covering the period of time intervening the delivery of the case to plaintiffs\u2019 teamster and its delivery to plaintiffs. Another of plaintiffs\u2019 teamsters received the other case and delivered it to another firm. One of the latter\u2019s clerks testified that he checked its contents with plaintiffs\u2019 invoice and that some of the articles were missing, The invoice was not produced nor was competent proof made of the contents of the box. A memorandum, purporting to be a copy made by the witness from plaintiffs\u2019 books, of a list of the articles packed in the box was received as evidence of its contents over defendant\u2019s objection. The books themselves were not produced nor the correctness of their entries shown by any competent evidence.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-7\" pgmap=\"110(69) 111(65)\">Defendant\u2019s foreman testified that he personally received the cases for storage and superintended the piling of them away; that he personally delivered each to plaintiffs \u2019 respective teamsters, taking their receipts therefor, which stated the goods were received by them in good order; that he personally knew they were in the same condition when delivered to said teamsters as when received by defendant; that he had personal charge of the warehouse while it was open, and knew of no theft committed therein. Plaintiffs admitted that four of defendant\u2019s employees who helped to pile the cases would, if present, testify that they worked around the warehouse and that the cases were not tampered with in any way and were in the same condition when delivered as when received by defendant.</p><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b111-9\" pgmap=\"111\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b111-10\" pgmap=\"111\">Warehousemen, \u00a7 27<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence insufficient to show negligence.
