Hilton for separate maintenance. Defendant filed a cross-bill for a divorce. A decree for separate maintenance was entered in favor of the complainant, and the defendant\u2019s cross-bill was dismissed for want of equity. To reverse a part of the decree, defendant brings error.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b53-8\" pgmap=\"53\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b53-9\" pgmap=\"53\">1. Husband and wife, \u00a7 267<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014necessity of preserving evidence to support decree of separate maintenance. The party in whose favor a decree for separate maintenance is entered, to maintain it must in some way preserve the evidence, by a certificate of evidence or otherwise, or the decree must find specific facts, proven at the hearing, sufficient to support it, the duty not devolving upon the party against whom such decree is rendered.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b53-10\" pgmap=\"53\">2. Husband and wife, \u00a7 267*\u2014necessity for preserving evidence for review of decree of separate maintenance. Where the complainant failed to preserve in the record a certificate of the evidence upon which a decree for separate maintenance was entered and the decree did not recite a specific finding of facts, simply finding \u201cthat the allegations in the said bill contained are true, as therein stated; and that the equities of this cause are with the complainant,\u201d held the findings were insufficient to sustain an order for separate maintenance.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b53-11\" pgmap=\"53\">3. Husband and wife, \u00a7 267*\u2014necessity of finding specific facts to support decree of separate maintenance. The fact that the certificate of the clerk shows that the transcript is not complete will not give rise to a presumption that a decree is properly supported by the evidence in the absence of a recital of a finding of specific facts sufficient to support the decree.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b53-12\" pgmap=\"53(22) 54(27)\">4. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1035*\u2014necessity of assignments of error. Where defendant does not assign any error for the dismissal of his cross-bill for divorce, in his appeal from a decree for separate maintenance, the court will not review the dismissal of the cross-bill by the trial court.</headnotes><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-4\" pgmap=\"53\">The record did not contain a certificate of evidence.
