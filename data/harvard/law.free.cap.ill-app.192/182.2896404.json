Curry at Allston, Massachusetts, signed a document presented to him by a firm of renting agents at Allston consisting of George F. Taft and Norman S. Waite. The document was headed \u201cBental Application and Agreement.\u201d The essential parts of the face of the document, which was signed at the foot of said face, as follows:</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b206-9\" pgmap=\"206\">\u201cSignature of applicant, J.

In the event that Lessee desires to vacate premises at that date, written notice must be given to the Lessor on or before Aug. 1, 1910. Failing so to do, lessee is holden for rent until Sept. 1,1911. If Lessee desires to vacate premises at last mentioned date, written notice must be given to Lessor on or before August. 1, 1911. Failing so to do, Lessee is holden for rent until thirty days notice is given as above outlined, to take effect on September 1, in any year, but this lease shall terminate in any event in twenty years from the date when rent commences.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-11\" pgmap=\"207\">The Lessor may terminate this agreement upon 30 days written notice, to take effect on September 1, in any year at or after Sept. 1, 1910, but without waiving any right of the Lessor to terminate for a breach of any of the other terms and conditions specified herein. \u2019 \u2019</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-12\" pgmap=\"207(79) 208(17)\">The evidence further shows that after the execution of this document, Jacob O. Curry, whose family at the time consisted of himself, his wife, his son, Oakley Curry, his daughter, Elsie Curry, and a widowed daughter, Mrs. Blair, and her two children, moved into the premises. He lived there with the family before described until April 6,1911, when he, and his wife and daughter Elsie Curry left the premises and came to Chicago, bringing their household goods with them. He left in the premises his son Oakley and his daughter Mrs. Blair with her children.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-5\" pgmap=\"208\">Jacob O. Curry when about to leave told Mr. Taft that business called him to Chicago and he and his wife were going there; that he might be gone one month and he might be gone six months, and that the rent in the meantime would be paid by his son, and if it was not, he (Jacob O. Curry) was perfectly good for it.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-6\" pgmap=\"208\">Jacob O. Curry did not return to the premises, but his son and Mrs. Blair and her children continued to occupy the apartments until September 1, 1913. Up to September 1, 1912, the rent was paid by the son or daughter. Monthly bills were sent each month to Jacob O. Curry, suite 1\u201436 Linden Street, Allston, and the son, Mr. Taft testified, \u201cused to drop in occasionally and either say he was short or else he would pay.\u201d From September 1, 1912, to September 1, 1913, at which last mentioned date Oakl.ey Curry and Mrs. Blair and family moved out, no rent was paid.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-7\" pgmap=\"208\">In answer to the question put to Mr. Taft: \u201cWill you state the circumstances under which tlie occupation of the premises ceased on September 1, 1913, by Mr. Curry\u2019s children?\u201d he answered, \u201cThey simply moved.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-8\" pgmap=\"208\">Jacob O. Curry never at any time gave a notice of his election to terminate the lease in accordance with its provisions, and no arrangement was made by the plaintiff or by any one for him with anybody but Jacob O. Curry regarding the tenancy in question.</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b208-9\" pgmap=\"208\">To reverse a judgment for plaintiff for $564, defendants prosecute this writ of error.</p><attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b208-10\" pgmap=\"208\">James L.

Insane persons, \u00a7 7<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when order to conservator to appear and defend action against ward proper. Where a conservator has been duly appointed by the Probate Court of Cook county to be the conservator of a person adjudged to be feeble-minded and \u201cauthorized and required to have the care of his person and estate\u201d and has duly qualified under the appointment, an. order of the court that he appear and defend as conservator, an action brought against his incompetent in the Municipal Court of Chicago before his appointment, is sufficient, even though it does not in terms make the conservator \u201ca party defendant.\u201d \u2022</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b209-7\" pgmap=\"209\">2. Principal and agent, \u00a7 189*\u2014when lease by agent ratified by owner. Where the owner of the property allows one entering into a lease with the owner\u2019s agents, which the tenant signs, to take possession under the lease and recognizes his tenancy, there is a sufficient ratification of the agents\u2019 act, even though the lease is signed not by the owner, but in the name of the agents, followed by the words \u201cagents for the owners.\u201d</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b209-8\" pgmap=\"209\">3.
