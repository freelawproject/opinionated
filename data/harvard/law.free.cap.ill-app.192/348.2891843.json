Trial, \u00a7 246<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when defendant cannot object to verdict as uncertain. Where in an action against a defendant, hoth as an individual and as trustee under a will, the court at the close of plaintiff\u2019s evidence instructed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant as trustee, and while the cause was not formally dismissed as to defendant as trustee, the subsequent conduct of both the court and defendant\u2019s counsel showed that both were of the opinion that the suit had been in effect dismissed as to defendant in such capacity, the defendant cannot insist in the Appellate Court that a verdict finding the \u201cdefendant guilty\u201d was uncertain, because it did not show whether it was against him individually or as trustee, or in both capacities.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b373-5\" pgmap=\"373\">2. Landlord and tenant, \u00a7 230*\u2014when required to keep stairways and halls in safe condition. A landlord who leases separate portions of the same building to different tenants, reserving the halls, stairways or other approaches for the use of his tenants, is under an implied duty to the tenants, their boarders, agents and servants to use reasonable diligence to keep such halls, stairways or approaches over which he has reserved control, in a reasonably safe condition.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b373-6\" pgmap=\"373\">3. Landlord and tenant, \u00a7 232*\u2014when notice of defect must be shown. A landlord is chargeable with negligence in failing to keep the common passages and stairways in repair, only after notice of the existence of the dangerous condition, or after the defect has continued for such a length of time as to charge him with constructive notice.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b373-10\" pgmap=\"373\">4. Landlord and tenant, \u00a7 232*\u2014when landlord chargeable with constructive notice of defect. Where in an action against a landlord for injuries sustained by a member of the tenant\u2019s household caused by the defective condition of a stairway used in common in an apartment house, there are facts and circumstances in evidence from which the jury may reasonably infer that defendant in the exercise of reasonable diligence could have discovered the defective condition, the defendant may be charged with constructive notice thereof.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b373-13\" pgmap=\"373\">5. Landlord and tenant, \u00a7 258*\u2014when will admissible in action against landlord for injury. In an action for personal injuries against the lessor of premises in his capacity as trustee under a will and as an individual, the will is properly admitted in evidence to show that defendant had control of the property, although the action was dismissed against him in his capacity as trustee.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
