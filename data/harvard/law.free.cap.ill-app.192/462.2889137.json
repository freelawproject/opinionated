Molthrop was summoned as garnishee. Judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff ag'ainst Carlo Lazzarini for $352.23. Carlo Lazzarini then filed a motion to vacate and set aside said judgment and for leave to file his affidavit of defense within five days. The motion was overruled by the court and the defendant filed a second motion setting forth the matters contained in the first motion more in detail, which was also overruled. To reverse the judgment in favor of the plaintiff, the defendant brings error.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b487-7\" pgmap=\"487\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b487-8\" pgmap=\"487\">1. Attachment, \u00a7 98<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when affidavit not void. A defective affidavit for attachment which is not objected to in the lower court, if amendable in such court, is not void.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b487-9\" pgmap=\"487\">2.

Judgment, \u00a7 142*\u2014when affidavit to vacate insufficient. It is not error for the court to overrule a motion to vacate and set aside a judgment and for leave to defend upon the merits when the affidavit in support of the same fails to state any fact in support of the motion which should have moved the court to grant the same.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b487-11\" pgmap=\"487\">4. Judgment, \u00a7 135*\u2014when second motion to vacate properly denied. A party to an action cannot make a second motion to vacate and set aside a judgment when the matters set forth in his affidavit in support of such motion were all within his knowledge at the time he made his affidavit in support of his first motion to have such judgment vacated and set aside.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b487-12\" pgmap=\"487(23) 488(48)\">5. Appeal and errob, \u00a7 1319*\u2014when evidence presumed sufficient. In the absence of a certificate by the trial judge that the bill of exceptions contains all the evidence offered and received upon the hearing of certain motions of the defendant, the presumption may properly be indulged, in support of the action of the court that the court had before it other and sufficient evidence, such as the oral testimony of witnesses.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b487-4\" pgmap=\"487\">Alberto N.
