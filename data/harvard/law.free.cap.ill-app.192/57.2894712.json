Since the Municipal Court Act (J. &amp; A. \u00b6 3371) requires the trial court to take judicial notice of general ordinances of the City of Chicago, where the record fails to show that the court did not take judicial notice of an ordinance, the court on review will presume that it did.'</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b82-5\" pgmap=\"82\">2.

It is the duty of a party seeking to have a judgment of the Municipal Court reviewed on error to prepare and submit a document containing such facts as were before the trial court, whether such facts were offered in evidence or only considered in evidence under the rule of judicial notice obtaining in the Municipal Court, and it will therefore be presumed that facts omitted from the statement were sufficient to justify the ruling below.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b82-6\" pgmap=\"82\">3. Appeal anq error, \u00a7 1275*\u2014when presumed that evidence showed violation of ordinance. In a prosecution in the Municipal Court for the violation of an ordinance, as against a contention that the record fails to show a violation of the ordinance because the ordinance was not incorporated in the record, it will be presumed that the evidence was sufficient to sustain a finding of the violation of the ordinance, it being the duty of the trial court under the Municipal Court Act (J. &amp; A. If 3332) to take judicial notice of city ordinances, and the burden being upon the plaintiff in error to prepare a statement showing all matter passed upon below.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b82-7\" pgmap=\"82\">4.

Where in a prosecution by the City of Chicago for the sale of intoxicants in violation of Chicago Code of 1911, sec. 1539, the court stated that it would take judicial notice that a bottle and glasses in evidence contained less than a gallon, its action is not subject to review where defendant made no objection and failed to attempt to disprove the court\u2019s contention.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b83-3\" pgmap=\"83\">7.
