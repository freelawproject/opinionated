B. Brumbaugh against Emma M. Candler on a check for six hundred and fifty dollars and on an account stated for one hundred dollars. In response to an advertisement by the plaintiff in a newspaper that he was selling out the contents of a furnished house, the defendant called at the house and selected certain pieces of furniture which were delivered to the defendant who gave plaintiff her check, payment of which was subsequently stopped, and promised to pay one hundred dollars additional. The defendant claimed that she had been deceived as to the character of the goods inasmuch as they were not permanent furnishings of a residence but were replaced from time to time by new goods as sales were made.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-9\" pgmap=\"289\">The evidence showed that notwithstanding the misleading character of the advertisement, the defendant knew the kind and quality of the goods purchased, that the furniture was in fact new and was not the used furniture of a \u201cfashionable house.\u201d From a judgment against defendant for seven hundred and fifty dollars, she brings error.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-10\" pgmap=\"289\">McEwen, Weissenbach, Shrimski &amp; Meloan, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-11\" pgmap=\"289\">MoInerney, Power &amp; Byrnes, for defendant in error.</attorneys><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b290-5\" pgmap=\"290\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b290-6\" pgmap=\"290\">Sales, \u00a7 411<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when misleading advertisement not available.
