Evidence, \u00a7 476<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what considered in determining preponderance. The number of witnesses testifying to a particular fact or state of facts is an important element to be considered in determining where the preponderance of evidence lies, but where in many important and material particulars the testimony of such witnesses is contradictory, inconsistent with established facts and inherently improbable, these elements should also be considered in determining the preponderance of the evidence.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b489-8\" pgmap=\"489\">2. Instructions, \u00a7 151*\u2014when properly refused as covered. It is not improper to refuse an instruction when the instruction refused is sufficiently covered by other instructions given to the jury.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b489-9\" pgmap=\"489\">3. Evidence, \u00a7 410*\u2014when opinion proper as to cause of condition. In an action of negligence where the inquiries on the examination of the attending physician have reference to the relation between certain injuries, which the plaintiff unquestionably received as a result of her fall, and her physical condition as manifested in attacks of partial paralysis, and do not have reference to whether or not the plaintiff is permanently injured as a result of that accident, the inquiries are proper.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b489-10\" pgmap=\"489\">4. Words and phrases,-\u2014what is meaning of word \u201cliable\u201d.

Evidence, \u00a7 410*\u2014when opinion as to probabilities improper. The opinion of a physician that the plaintiff was \u201cliable\u201d to have recurrent attacks of paralysis and that the degenerative state of the nerve tissue and its surrounding connective tissues might lead to developments that are \u201cliable\u201d to bring about a paralytic stroke is objectionable. The statement of a mere probability of the recurrence is not sufficient.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b489-12\" pgmap=\"489(20) 490(17)\">6.

Evidence, \u00a7 410*\u2014when opinion as to time elapsing between injury and condition proper. In an action for personal injuries, in the examination of a physician, where the subject-matter of the inquiry then under consideration was whether paralysis, if produced by an injury, would necessarily follow almost immediately, and also whether or not an injury such as the plaintiff claimed to have sustained was capable of producing paralysis, it was held competent for the witness to express his opinion thereon and to state his reasons for such opinion.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
