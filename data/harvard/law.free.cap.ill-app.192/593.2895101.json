Landlord and tenant, \u00a7 226<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence insufficient to show that negligence of landlord was proximate cause of death of tenant\u2019s child. In an action against a landlord by an administrator to recover for the death of a tenant\u2019s child, alleged to have been caused by defendants\u2019 negligence as to sanitary arrangements whereby fecal matter infected with typhoid germs leaked fronr the drain pipes and infected \"vegetables in a garden used by the tenants, which were eaten by plaintiff\u2019s intestate who thereby contracted typhoid fever which caused her death, the evidence examined and held not sufficient to show that such negligence was the proximate cause of the death.</headnotes><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-4\" pgmap=\"619\">There was no direct proof tending to show that the vegetables which were grown in said tract of ground were infected with typhoid fever germs, nor that plaintiff\u2019s intestate contracted typhoid fever from eating said vegetables. The evidence showed that fecal matter discharged by a typhoid fever patient usually contained the germs of said disease; that when such fecal matter in the ground comes in contact with growing vegetables, it is possible that any typhoid fever germs in said fecal matter may lodge upon and adhere to said vegetables; that a person eating vegetables which are thus infected with said germs may thereby contract typhoid fever.</p><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b619-5\" pgmap=\"619\">Benjamin F.
