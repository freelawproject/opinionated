In an action to recover a balance claimed to be due for wages, where under the terms of the employment plaintiff was charged with certain accounts which defendant claimed were unpaid and for which plaintiff admitted his responsibility, claiming they had been paid, but introducing no proof beyond his mere assertion of collection, the persons owing them not having been called, and there being no evidence shown by whom they were collected or that the money collected was paid over to defendant, the evidence was held insufficient to sustain a judgment in favor of plaintiff.</headnotes><p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-3\" pgmap=\"634\">Statement of the Case.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-4\" pgmap=\"634\">Action by Tom Kilovas against Nick Kilovas to recover a balance of $190 claimed to be due as wages and as ascertained upon an accounting between them October 13, 1911. Defendant admitted an accounting was had, but claimed it was on November 30,1911, and that another was had at a still later date. His book of account was received in evidence to show that the account as it stood November 30th was assented to by plaintiff\u2019s putting his signature thereto, when it showed a balance in plaintiff\u2019s favor of $46.73. After-wards there was charged to plaintiff $187.70, representing some unpaid accounts made in the course of his employment for which he seems to have been responsible, and for which he admitted his liability, and which, with other credits and debits unquestioned, changed the account to a balance against him of $142.21.
