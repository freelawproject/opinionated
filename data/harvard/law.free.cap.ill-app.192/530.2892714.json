Challenger, plaintiff, against Merchants &amp; Miners Bank, a corporation, defendant, First National Bank of Chicago being summoned as garnishee, to recover the sum of $815, principal and interest alleged to be due upon a certain check which defendant had certified.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-10\" pgmap=\"554(85) 555(301)\">The evidence showed that in the latter part of September, 1913, one Heider, representing the Commonwealth Corporation (a Delaware corporation, with office in Detroit, Michigan), went to Calumet, Michigan, for the purpose of selling certain of the capital stock and bonds of that company. Among others he called upon Norman MacDonald, Dr. William T. King and Harry E. King. MacDonald and Dr. King and- the wife of Harry E. King were all stockholders of the Metropolitan State Bank of Detroit, Michigan. Heider falsely represented to said parties that the Commonwealth Corporation was affiliated with said Metropolitan State Bank and was organized by said bank for the purpose of handling a certain class of investments which the bank could not deal in under Michigan laws. As a result of Heider\u2019s negotiations with said parties separately, MacDonald agreed to purchase thirty shares of the capital stock of the Commonwealth Corporation and a bond of the company, with the understanding that said securities would be sent to defendant for delivery to MacDonald upon payment of the agreed price; Dr. King purchased fifteen shares of stock and a bond of the company, received a certificate for said shares and the bond, and gave a New York draft of the defendant for $1,500 in payment therefor; and Harry E. King purchased eight shares of stock and a bond of the company, received a certificate for eight shares and the bond, and delivered to Heider his (King\u2019s) personal check for $800, dated October 1, 1913, drawn on the defendant, and payable to the order of the Commonwealth Corporation. Heider at once presented said check for certification and the same was certified by the defendant on October 1,1913, and returned to Heider. This is the check sued on in the present action. The Commonwealth Corporation transferred it by indorsement to the Hanover Bank of Lucey &amp; Company, of Hanover, Michigan, and that bank indorsed and sent it to the La Salle Street Trust &amp; Savings Bank of Chicago, which bank indorsed it and forwarded it to the defendant for collection and remittance, but said defendant refused to pay the check, caused it to be protested and returned it to said La Salle Street Bank of Chicago, which bank returned it to said Hanover Bank.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-4\" pgmap=\"555(33) 556(49)\">Subsequently the Hanover Bank indorsed and delivered the check to the plaintiff, Elmer E. Challenger. Plaintiff testified that the Hanover Bank was indebted to him for certain legal services rendered; that upon his making demand of payment for said.services a representative of that bank suggested his taking said check in payment of his services; that after investigation he accepted the check in payment of said services, and that he never had any dealings or relations with the Commonwealth Corporation!</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"An-\" pgmap=\"556\">On October 2,1913, the day after Harry E. King had delivered said check to Heider, King learned that Heider\u2019s representations that the Metropolitan State Bank was affiliated with the Commonwealth Corporation were false. King had been induced on the strength of those representations to purchase said eight shares of stock and the bond. He immediately communicated with W. B. Anderson, vice-president and general manager of the defendant, and requested him to stop payment of said check and \u201cto try and recover the same.\u201d About the same time MacDonald and Dr. King received the same information and they also communicated with Anderson. On October 3,1913, Anderson, as such vice-president and general manager, wrote the following letter to the Commonwealth Corporation, which that company received but to which it made no reply:</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-6\" pgmap=\"556\">\u201cYou will find enclosed certificate #115 for 30 shares of the capital stock of the Commonwealth Corporation in the name of Norman MacDonald, and bond #512 for $3,000.00, received by mail from your Mr. Heider, for the account of Mr. Norman MacDonald. Mr. MacDonald has requested us to say to you that he does not wish to take said securities.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-7\" pgmap=\"556(85) 557(16)\">\u201cYour Mr. Heider sold to Dr. William T. King of Ahmeek $1,500.00 of securities issued by your corporation, and he also sold to Mr. Harry E. King, of Laurium, $800.00 of said securities. These three gentlemen have requested us to say to you that said securities were sold to them under false representations, and we were requested to stop payment of our New York draft for $1,500.00 issued in payment of securities sold to Dr. William. T. King, and payment has also been stopped on certified check issued in payment of securities sold to Mr. Harry E.
