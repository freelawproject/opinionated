Hajicek filing an intervening petition.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aod\" pgmap=\"137\">The evidence shows that defendant obtained from plaintiff a loan of six hundred and fifty dollars, for the purpose of making a deposit on a bid which defendant was making on a contract to be awarded by the school district. Plaintiff deposited the amount in the Cicero State Bank in defendant\u2019s name, whereupon he drew a check for the amount, dated August 10,1911, payable \u201cto the order of Otto F. Heller, Sec\u2019y School Dist. No. 99,\u201d which was certified by the bank and delivered by defendant to Heller for the purpose of deposit on the bid. On the failure of defendant to secure the bid, the check was returned to him by Heller without indorsement, on August 25, 1911. The garnish ee in this action was served on the same day, but before the return of the check to defendant. On the following day, defendant and two others indorsed it and the check was cashed by the intervening petitioner\u2019s cashier, who testified that he knew and relied upon the additional indorsers and made no inquiry as to the lack of Heller\u2019s indorsement.</p><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b138-8\" pgmap=\"138\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b138-9\" pgmap=\"138\">1.

The mere drawing by a depositor of a check payable to the order of a third person and its certification by the drawee bank do not pass the title to the fund, from the depositor to the payee where there is merely a conditional delivery of the check to the payee and the check is returned by the payee to the depositor.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b138-10\" pgmap=\"138\">2.

After the drawee bank had been served with garnishee summons against the drawer of a check payable to a third person, which it had certified, the drawer of the check and two others indorsed it and, without having the payee\u2019s indorsement, a third person relying on the additional indorsements, cashed it.
