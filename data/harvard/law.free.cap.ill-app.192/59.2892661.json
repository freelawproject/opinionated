Swett against the City of Chicago and the Illinois Tunnel Company, a corporation, to recover damages in the sum of $50,000. To an amended declaration filed by the plaintiff, each defendant filed a separate general demurrer. The defendant, Illinois Tunnel Company, was afterwards given leave to withdraw its demurrer and to file certain pleas to the declaration. The demurrer of the defendant, City of Chicago, was sustained by the trial court, and the plaintiff electing to stand by its declaration as to the defendant, City of Chicago, the suit as to the last named defendant was dismissed and a judgment for costs in favor of the said City and against the plaintiff was entered. The plaintiff excepted to this action of the trial court, and prayed an appeal from the said judgment and afterwards, on February 26, 1914, filed this writ of error in this court.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b84-8\" pgmap=\"84\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b84-9\" pgmap=\"84\">Appeal and error, \u00a7 1117<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when writ of error dismissed for want of prosecution.
