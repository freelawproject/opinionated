Because the court of appeals did not err in denying the requested extraordinary relief, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">{\u00b6 2} Zidonis was employed by Columbus State from 1998 until May 2010, when her employment was terminated. From late 2005 through early 2008, Zidonis was a member of the Columbus State records-retention committee. She attended meetings at which the records-retention policy was reviewed and discussed and offered input about records management in her work division. One of the committee\u2019s meeting agendas indicated that Zidonis would be gathering information for a taxonomy that would organize all inventories to make searching for records more efficient. From January 2007 to May 2010, Zidonis was the program coordinator for the academic-quality-improvement plan, which required her to develop effective communication methods and ensure that essential information and evidence were identified, stored, and communicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">{\u00b6 3} After Zidonis\u2019s termination from employment with Columbus State, her counsel, who represented her in the appeal of her discharge in the State Personnel Board of Review, submitted multiple requests to Columbus State seeking access to various records under R.C. 149.43, the Public Records Act. Columbus State promptly provided access to nearly 400 pages of the requested records, including the personnel files of Zidonis and two other college employees. Zidonis also requested and received a copy of the college\u2019s records-retention schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">\n<em>Request for Copies of E-Mails</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">{\u00b6 4} By letter dated June 30, 2010, Zidonis, through counsel, requested \u201c[cjopies of e-mails sent between Sunday Zidonis and Deborah Coleman (i.e., those sent to Ms. Coleman from Ms. Zidonis, and those sent to Ms. Zidonis from Ms. Coleman).\u201d By letter dated July 13, Columbus State, through its in-house counsel, Assistant Attorney General Jackie DeGenova, responded by specifying that the request was overly broad and that the college could not identify the specific records being requested. DeGenova invited Zidonis\u2019s counsel to contact her to assist in identifying the records being sought and to revise or clarify the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">{\u00b6 5} Instead of replying to DeGenova as requested, Zidonis\u2019s counsel sent letters dated July 21 and August 9, 2010, to the vice president of human resources, asking him to describe \u201cthe nature by which staffs\u2019 electronic e-mails are stored at Columbus State and how they may be retrieved\u201d so that a follow-up request could be made. On August 24, DeGenova sent Zidonis\u2019s counsel a letter reiterating that the request for copies of e-mails between Zidonis and Coleman was overly broad and that the college was unable to identify the records sought. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>DeGenova repeated her invitation to discuss the matter with Zidonis\u2019s counsel to assist in narrowing the request. He claims that he did call her, but the phone record he provided as evidence reflects a call to a phone number substantially different from the number DeGenova provided in her letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">{\u00b6 6} On September 3, 2010, Zidonis\u2019s counsel sent DeGenova a letter in which he stated that after reviewing the Columbus State public-records retention policy, he assumed that \u201cat some point, e-mails are printed off into paper form and then each printed e-mail is placed in the appropriate category within the [Columbus State] retention schedule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">{\u00b6 7} At a September 8, 2010 status conference in Zidonis\u2019s administrative appeal, DeGenova again advised Zidonis\u2019s counsel that the request for e-mails was overly broad and still needed to be revised to reasonably identify particular records. DeGenova informed Zidonis\u2019s attorney that the college retains, organizes, and accesses its records based on the content of the records and asked if he could narrow the request to more clearly identify the requested records by specifying the year or the subject matter of the e-mails. Zidonis\u2019s attorney replied that he would provide DeGenova with the requisite \u201cnames and dates\u201d to narrow the scope of the e-mails he was seeking, but he did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">{\u00b6 8} In mid-July 2010, i.e., around the same time that Columbus State first rejected Zidonis\u2019s request for e-mails between Zidonis and Coleman as overbroad, DeGenova discussed with the college\u2019s network administrator whether it was technically possible to search for all e-mails sent between two employees. The administrator said that there were no such means in the normal manner of organizing, maintaining, and accessing electronic records at the college and that programming a special search would take a substantial amount of time. At DeGenova\u2019s request, the network administrator proceeded to recover the pertinent e-mails from the college\u2019s disaster-recovery system back to July 2008. In August and September 2010, the administrator created a special file and program for DeGenova to review the e-mails to make potential redactions, and DeGenova proceeded with her review.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">\n<em>Request to Inspect Complaint and Litigation Files</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">{\u00b6 9} In his September 3, 2010 correspondence, Zidonis\u2019s counsel asked \u201cto look at records IUC-HR-10-04 (complaint files), and IUC-LEG-20-01 (litigation files).\u201d The references in this request were to Inter-University Council of Ohio (\u201cIUC\u201d) code designations listed in Columbus State\u2019s records-retention schedule. The schedule described \u201cComplaint Files\u201d as \u201c[r]ecord[s] of staff or student grievances based on equal opportunity and affirmative action regulations,\u201d which are \u201carranged alphabetically.\u201d The schedule listed \u201cLitigation Files,\u201d but did not describe them. Under the retention schedule, complaint and litigation files are to be retained for six years after they were last active.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>{\u00b6 10} Although Zidonis\u2019s counsel asked whether there was a way \u201cto look at these records for certain periods of time (e.g., over the past year),\u201d he never revised the request to include a specific time period. Instead, Zidonis\u2019s counsel sent subsequent requests on September 14 and 22, 2010, in which he asked when he could come to Columbus State to review the requested complaint and litigation files. He emphasized in these requests that the \u201crecord retention period for these documents is six years from their active life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">{\u00b6 11} At the September 8 status conference in Zidonis\u2019s administrative appeal, DeGenova told Zidonis\u2019s counsel that she would respond to his records request. DeGenova stated in a subsequent letter to Zidonis\u2019s counsel that she had informed him at the September 8 conference that Columbus State retains, organizes, and accesses its records based on content.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\n<em>Mandamus Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">{\u00b6 12} In October 2010, Zidonis filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County for a writ of mandamus to compel Columbus State to provide her with access to the requested complaint files, litigation files, and e-mail records. Zidonis also requested statutory damages and reasonable attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">{\u00b6 13} On November 3, 2010, Columbus State sent Zidonis\u2019s counsel a letter reiterating its denial of her request for all e-mails between Zidonis and Coleman as ambiguous and overly broad and stating that the college was \u201cunable to reasonably identify the specific records, subject matter, time-frame or any other reasonable aspect of specificity by which to identify the e-mails.\u201d Columbus State noted that \u201ceach employee of the College has the ability to create documents and folders as part of the e-mail system and the particular records series to which the records belong, according to their individual needs. For example, if you request to review certain e-mails in the folders created by Ms. Zidonis or [her supervisor] Dr. Coleman, it is likely the College can search by this method. The College is unable to and is not required to provide access to entire record series or categories.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">{\u00b6 14} Nevertheless, Columbus State provided with this letter a CD containing redacted copies of e-mails retrieved by use of the special program created at DeGenova\u2019s instructions to search for e-mails from Zidonis\u2019s and Coleman\u2019s computers. The CD contained approximately 200 e-mails and attachments, including 59 e-mails between Zidonis and Coleman in 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">{\u00b6 15} In this letter, Columbus State also denied Zidonis\u2019s request for complaint and litigation files as ambiguous and overly broad. DeGenova noted that she had previously provided Zidonis\u2019s counsel with a copy of the Columbus State records-retention schedule as part of her explanation regarding how the records are maintained and accessed and that she was \u201cunable to reasonably identify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>specific records which are being requested for this inspection and again, the College is unable to and is not required to provide access to entire record series or categories.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">{\u00b6 16} Columbus State again offered in this letter to discuss the requests with Zidonis\u2019s counsel, but no further discussions were conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">{\u00b6 17} After the court of appeals denied Columbus State\u2019s motion to dismiss Zidonis\u2019s mandamus petition, the parties submitted evidence and briefs. In December 2011, the court of appeals denied the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">{\u00b6 18} This cause is now before the court upon Zidonis\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">\n<em>Mandamus</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cMandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel compliance with R.C. 149.43, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Physicians Commt. for Responsible Medicine v. Ohio State Univ. Bd. of Trustees, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 288, 2006-Ohio-903, 843 N.E.2d 174, \u00b6 6; R.C. 149.43(C)(1). We construe the Public Records Act liberally in favor of disclosure of public records. <em>State ex rel. Rocker v. Guernsey Cty. Sheriff\u2019s Office, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 224, 2010-Ohio-3288, 932 N.E.2d 327, \u00b6 6. But the relator must still establish entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief by clear and convincing evidence. <em>State ex rel. Doner v. Zody, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 446, 2011-Ohio-6117, 958 N.E.2d 1235, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">\n<em>Complaint and Litigation Files</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">{\u00b6 20} Zidonis asserts that the court of appeals erred in denying the requested writ of mandamus to compel Columbus State to provide access to its complaint files and litigation files on the basis that her request for these records was overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">{\u00b6 21} Zidonis requested broad categories of records \u2014 complaint files and litigation files. The request covered a lengthy period of time \u2014 at least six years and potentially much longer, because for both records categories, she specified the college\u2019s records-retention schedule period of six years from when these files were last active. \u201c \u2018[I]t is the responsibility of the person who wishes to inspect and/or copy records to identify with reasonable clarity the records at issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Morgan v. New Lexington, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 33, 2006-Ohio-6365, 857 N.E.2d 1208, \u00b6 29, quoting <em>State ex rel. Fant v. Tober, </em>8th Dist. No. 63737, 1993 WL 173743, *1 (Apr. 28, 1993), <em>affirmed, </em>68 Ohio St.3d 117, 623 N.E.2d 1202 (1993). In identifying records for purposes of presenting a viable request, the Public Records Act \u201cdoes not contemplate that any individual has the right to a complete duplication of voluminous files kept by government agencies.\u201d <em>State ex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number><em>rel. Warren Newspapers, Inc. v. Hutson, </em>70 Ohio St.3d 619, 624, 640 N.E.2d 174 (1994), citing <em>State ex rel. Zauderer v. Joseph, </em>62 Ohio App.3d 752, 577 N.E.2d 444 (1989). In <em>Zauderer, </em>the court held that a request that a city police chief, county sheriff, and highway patrol superintendent provide access to \u201call traffic accident reports of record\u201d was improper because it was \u201cfirst, unreasonable in scope and, second, if granted, would interfere with the sanctity of the recordkeeping process itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">{\u00b6 22} This court has held that comparable requests for broad categories of records were overbroad. For example, in <em>State ex rel. Glasgow v. Jones, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 391, 2008-Ohio-4788, 894 N.E.2d 686, \u00b6 19, we examined a request for all the work-related e-mail messages, text messages, and correspondence of a state representative during her entire tenure. We held that the request was overbroad because it impermissibly sought what approximated a \u201ccomplete duplication\u201d of the representative\u2019s files. We so held even though the representative had been in office for only six months when these records were requested. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 4. And more recently, in <em>State ex rel. Dehler v. Spatny, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 312, 2010-Ohio-5711, 939 N.E.2d 831, this court held that a request for all records relating to a prison quartermaster\u2019s orders for and receipt of clothing and shoes for a period of over seven years was also an improper, overbroad request. <em>See also State ex rel. Davila v. Bellefontaine, </em>3d Dist. No. 8-11-01, 2011-Ohio-4890, 2011 WL 4435567 (request for all reel-to-reel tapes made for the entire 15 years that the recording system was in daily use was overly broad).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">{\u00b6 23} Similarly, Zidonis\u2019s request, which sought whole categories of complaint and litigation files without any limitation as to content or time period, was overbroad as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">{\u00b6 24} Zidonis asserts that her request was sufficiently specific because (1) she offered to narrow her request to inspect Columbus State\u2019s complaint and litigation files to shorter periods of time, e.g., over the past year, and (2) her request followed the language of Columbus State\u2019s own records-retention schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">{\u00b6 25} These assertions, however, lack merit. Although Zidonis\u2019s September 3, 2010 request asked whether there was a way to look at the requested records for specific, limited periods of time, she never revised her request to specify a shorter period than the retention schedule\u2019s six years from a file\u2019s last activity. <em>See State ex rel. Dehler v. Spatny, </em>11th Dist. No. 2009-T-0075, 2010-Ohio-3052, 2010 WL 2636552, \u00b6 24 (rejecting as inadequate the requester\u2019s offer to limit a records request to the preceding three years because, inter alia, requester never indicated that he was actually modifying his request), <em>affirmed, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 312, 2010-Ohio-5711, 939 N.E.2d 831. Instead, Zidonis reiterated in her September 14 and 22, 2010 requests that the \u201crecord retention period for these documents is six years from their active life,\u201d which was reasonably interpreted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>by Columbus State to mean that Zidonis had not narrowed her original request to a shorter, more definite period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">{\u00b6 26} Moreover, the court of appeals correctly held that a \u201crecords request is not specific merely because it names a broad category of records listed within an agency\u2019s retention schedule.\u201d 2011-Ohio-6817, 2011 WL 6930336, at \u00b6 5. For example, the retention schedule for the administrative records of Ohio courts includes broad categories like \u201ccorrespondence and general office records,\u201d \u201cemployee history and discipline records,\u201d \u201cfiscal records,\u201d and \u201cpayroll records.\u201d Sup.R. 26.01(F), (J), (K), and (M). Requests for each of these record categories without any temporal or content-based limitation would likely be overbroad even though the categories are so named in the schedule. Manifestly, each request \u2014 \u2022 and each retention category when the request is structured after such a category- \u2014 -must be analyzed under the totality of facts and circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">(\u00b6 27} Therefore, the court of appeals properly denied Zidonis\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus to compel Columbus State to provide her with access to the requested complaint and litigation files because her request was overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">\n<em>E-Mails</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">{\u00b6 28} Zidonis next asserts that the court of appeals erred in denying her request for a writ of mandamus to compel Columbus State to provide her with copies of all e-mails between herself and her supervisor during her employment at the college. Zidonis claims that R.C. 149.43(B)(2) imposes a duty on Columbus State to maintain its e-mail records so that they can be retrieved based on sender and recipient status.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">{\u00b6 29} R.C. 149.43(B)(2) provides that \u201c[t]o facilitate broader access to public records,- a public office or the person responsible for public records shall organize and maintain public records in a manner that they can be made available for inspection or copying in accordance with division (B) of this section.\u201d Under R.C. 149.43(B)(1), \u201call public records responsive to the request shall be promptly prepared and made available for inspection to any person at all reasonable times during regular business hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">{\u00b6 30} R.C. 149.43(B)(2) does not expressly require public offices to maintain email records so that they can be retrieved based on sender and recipient status. \u201c \u2018It is axiomatic that in mandamus proceedings, the creation of the legal duty that a relator seeks to enforce is the distinct function of the legislative branch of government, and courts are not authorized to create the legal duty enforceable in mandamus.\u2019 (Emphasis deleted.)\u201d <em>State ex rel. Patton v. Rhodes, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 182, 2011-Ohio-3093, 950 N.E.2d 965, \u00b6 17, quoting <em>State ex rel. Pipoly v. State Teachers Retirement Sys., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 327, 2002-Ohio-2219, 767 N.E.2d 719, \u00b6 18; <em>see also State ex rel. Bardwell v. Cleveland, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 195, 2010-Ohio-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>3267, 931 N.E.2d 1080 (court of appeals was not authorized to create duty on the part of the city and its police chief to require pawnbrokers to submit certain reports on regular paper rather than on index cards when there was no such requirement under R.C. 149.43(B)(2)). While it may be preferable for public offices to include a program that would permit easier searching of work-related emails bas\u00e9d on sender and recipient \u2014 which Columbus State eventually did here to retrieve pertinent e-mails responsive to Zidonis\u2019s request \u2014 -we cannot require that they do so when R.C. 149.43(B)(2) does not require it.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">{\u00b6 31} Zidonis\u2019s citation of <em>State ex rel. Toledo Blade Co. v. Seneca Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 372, 2008-Ohio-6253, 899 N.E.2d 961, to support her claim is misplaced. The responding agency in that case made no claim that the request for e-mail records was overbroad. Instead, our holding was limited to the appropriate factors for determining when a public office has a duty under R.C. 149.43(B) to recover and provide access to e-mails that were unlawfully deleted. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19. There is no issue in this case relating to deleted e-mails, and <em>Toledo Blade </em>is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">{\u00b6 32} Therefore, the court of appeals did not err in denying Zidonis\u2019s request for e-mails based on her claim that Columbus State had violated R.C. 149.43(B)(2) by not initially organizing its records so that work-related e-mails could be retrieved based on sender and recipient status. The mere fact that the court of appeals\u2019 denial may have been premised on an incorrect rationale<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> does not require a different result. <em>In re G.T.B., </em>128 Ohio St.3d 502, 2011-Ohio-1789, 947 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 7 (\u201cwe will not reverse a correct judgment simply because it was based in whole or in part on an incorrect rationale\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\n<em>R.C. 11943(B)(2) Requirement to Inform Requester of the Manner in which Records are Maintained and Accessed</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">{\u00b6 33} R.C. 149.43(B)(2) requires the office or person responsible for public records, when faced with an overbroad request, to \u201cprovide the requester with an opportunity to revise the request by informing the requester of the manner in which records are maintained by the public office and accessed in the ordinary course of the public office\u2019s or person\u2019s duties.\u201d Zidonis claims that the court of appeals erred in failing to find that Columbus State violated this requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>with regard to her requests for complaint files, litigation files, and e-mails between herself and her supervisor. <em>See, e.g., State ex rel. ESPN, Inc. v. Ohio State Univ., </em>132 Ohio St.3d 212, 2012-Ohio-2690, 970 N.E.2d 939, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">{\u00b6 34} For the following reasons, however, the court of appeals did not err in rejecting Zidonis\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">{\u00b6 35} First, there is evidence that Columbus State explained at a September 8, 2010 status conference in Zidonis\u2019s administrative appeal, which was about a month before she filed her public-records mandamus action, that the college retains, organizes, and accesses its records based on content.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">{\u00b6 36} Second, before Zidonis requested the college\u2019s complaint files, the college provided her with a copy of its records-retention schedule, which defined these files as records of \u201cstaff or student grievances based on equal opportunity and affirmative action' regulations\u201d with the \u201c[fjiles arranged alphabetically.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">{\u00b6 37} Third, Zidonis\u2019s counsel indicated in the record requests that he understood how the requested e-mails were maintained and accessed. For example, in the September 3, 2010 request, Zidonis\u2019s counsel stated that based on his review of the college\u2019s records-retention schedule, he assumed that e-mails are printed onto paper and then each printed e-mail is placed in the appropriate records category in the retention schedule. And her counsel ultimately revised a comparable request for e-mails between Zidonis and a different college employee to limit the request to a specific time period and subject-matter, with the result that the college was able to produce several responsive records.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">{\u00b6 38} Fourth, from her prior employment, Zidonis already had knowledge of how the college maintained and accessed certain records. <em>State ex rel. Vaughn v. Money, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 322, 2004-Ohio-6561, 819 N.E.2d 681, \u00b6 11 (mandamus will not lie to compel a respondent to give the relator something he already has).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">{\u00b6 39} Fifth, notwithstanding Zidonis\u2019s failure to pose a viable request, Columbus State proceeded to create a program to search for the requested e-mails and ultimately provided copies of them to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">{\u00b6 40} Finally, Zidonis ignored Columbus State\u2019s multiple invitations to contact its in-house counsel to help Zidonis refine her overbroad requests. <em>See State ex rel. Morgan v. Strickland, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 600, 2009-Ohio-1901, 906 N.E.2d 1105, \u00b6 18 (\u201cR.C. 149.43 contemplates that the requester and the public-records custodian cooperate in fulfilling a request\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">{\u00b6 41} Consequently, the court of appeals did not err in determining that Columbus State had complied with R.C. 149.43(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">{\u00b6 42} Based on the foregoing, Zidonis did not establish by the requisite clear and convincing evidence that Columbus State violated R.C. 149.43 by denying her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>record requests. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals denying the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AXy\">James J. Leo Law Office, and James J. Leo, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A2t\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, and Jeffery W. Clark and Holly LeClair, Assistant Attorneys General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Judgment affirmed,</p>\n<judges id=\"b409-6\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-8\">. The court of appeals concluded that Zidonis\u2019s request for e-mails was improper because she did not \u201cidentify e-mails related to the organization, function, policy, decision, procedures, operation or work-related activity\u201d of Columbus State. 2011-Ohio-6817, 2011 WL 6930336, at \u00b6 11. Zidonis correctly observes that a request for e-mails that does not specify that it seeks \u201cwork-related\u201d emails is not necessarily defective. And Columbus State is simply wrong in arguing that an \u201ce-mail does not become a public record when it appears on a server in a public office\u201d and that e-mail becomes a public record only when it is placed in an electronic subject-matter folder or is printed on paper.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
