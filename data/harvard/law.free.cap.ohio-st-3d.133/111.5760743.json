County, contests the tax-year 2007 valuation of its property as found by the auditor, as retained by the Licking County Board of Revision (\u201cBOR\u201d), and as affirmed by the Board .of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d). On the merits, LTC contends that the auditor overvalued its property by predicating his cost-based valuation on the cost schedule for nursing homes and private hospitals rather than on the cost schedule for apartment buildings with 20 to 39 rental units. LTC hypothesizes that had the auditor used the cost schedule for apartments as a starting point, his ultimate conclusion of value would have been lower. In addition, LTC alleges a procedural error in the BTA\u2019s denial of LTC\u2019s request for a continuance of the evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>{\u00b62} Because we disagree with both of LTC\u2019s arguments, we affirm the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 3} For tax year 2007, the Licking County auditor, an appellee, assigned a true value of $1,975,000 to Chestnut House Assisted Living, which consists of 2.43 acres, improved with a 25,824 square-foot building and a paved parking area. The auditor\u2019s land value was $307,400, and the value of improvements was $1,667,600. The property record card indicates that the auditor used the \u201cnursing home\u201d cost schedule, which attributed a cost-based value of $92.50 per square foot for the building. The county also applied a grade-factor adjustment of 110 percent, to derive a \u201creplacement-cost-new\u201d figure of $2,627,590. Next, the county applied a 25 percent reduction for obsolescence, which led to a costless-depreciation figure of $1,970,694 for the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">{\u00b6 4} But obsolescence was merely one adjustment. The actual amount of cost value assigned to the building was $1,653,130 (i.e., $1,667,600 minus the cost of the paved area, which was $14,470). That number reflects a substantial reduction from the $1,970,694 figure previously determined to be the cost-less-depreciation associated with the facility. Thus, the auditor\u2019s obsolescence adjustment, together with additional adjustments, lowered the original square-footage computation by 37 percent \u2014 from $2,627,590 to $1,653,130. Indeed, the valuation of the building represents almost a 31 percent reduction from the figure derived by multiplying the nursing-home cost figure of $92.50 per square foot by the 25,824 square feet of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant, LTC Properties, Inc., filed a valuation complaint on March 24, 2008, with the BOR, seeking a reduced value of $1,000,000. The Newark City Schools Board of Education (\u201cschool board\u201d) filed a countercomplaint on April 28, and the BOR held a hearing on May 20, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">{\u00b6 6} At the hearing, LTC presented the testimony<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of William McVeigh, the property tax manager for Assisted Living Concepts, the parent of LTC. McVeigh asserted that Chestnut House is an assisted-living facility with 39 efficiency-apartments, 38 of which were then occupied. McVeigh offered an income-capitalization analysis that estimated the facility\u2019s value at $54 per square foot, for a true value of approximately $1,380,000 for the facility as a whole. The auditor\u2019s valuation of $1,975,000, by contrast, reflects a valuation of some $76 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>square foot. On cross-examination, McVeigh explained that the rent number was generated by market-driven surveys \u201cfor this specific purpose.\u201d McVeigh also distinguished the $1,200 to $1,800 per month that residents actually pay as \u201cservice fees,\u201d only a portion of which can properly be characterized as rent that relates to the value of the realty. Additionally, McVeigh contested the propriety of the auditor\u2019s using the nursing-home and private-hospital category for cost-valuation purposes. On cross-examination, McVeigh conceded that he was neither an employee nor an owner of the taxpayer and that he was not a certified appraiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">{\u00b6 7} By order dated July 3, 2008, the BOR retained the auditor\u2019s valuation of the property, and LTC appealed to the BTA on July 10, 2008. On November 14, 2008, the school board filed a motion to compel discovery of LTC\u2019s witnesses and exhibits, which recited that the school board had served interrogatories and document requests on LTC on September 12 and had followed up with LTC twice. On December 9, 2008, the BTA denied the motion to compel on the grounds that it had been filed more than 120 days after the filing of the appeal, which is outside the time limit for seeking the board\u2019s involvement in discovery pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 5717-1-11. But the BTA order also admonished LTC that ignoring the discovery request could lead to exclusion of its evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">{\u00b6 8} The BTA set the case for hearing on April 5, 2010. The county and the school board filed disclosures of witnesses and/or exhibits on March 19 and 22, 2010, pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 5717-1-15(1), which requires such disclosure at least 14 days before the scheduled hearing. LTC made no such disclosures. Then, on March 26, 2010,10 days before the scheduled hearing, LTC sent a letter requesting continuance of the hearing. The letter tersely stated, \u201cOur appraiser is Richard Racek\u201d and that he was \u201cunavailable on [April 5],\u201d without offering any reason for the appraiser\u2019s unavailability or for the failure to disclose the appraiser and his report previously. On March 29, the county filed a memorandum opposing the continuance, to which LTC responded on March 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">{\u00b6 9} By order dated March 30, 2010, the BTA denied the continuance. The BTA noted that LTC had ignored discovery and that the school board\u2019s witness disclosure had objected to any witnesses or exhibits for LTC because of LTC\u2019s disregard of the discovery requests seeking that very information. The BTA next noted that LTC was in violation of both the 14-day disclosure rule and division (C) of Ohio Adm.Code 5717-1-15, which requires a continuance request to be filed no later than 14 days before the scheduled hearing. Based on the multiple rule violations and the failure to state good cause, the BTA denied the continuance. With respect to the request that LTC witnesses and exhibits be excluded, the BTA deferred judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>{\u00b6 10} The three parties \u2014 LTC, the county, and the school board \u2014 appeared through counsel at the April 5 hearing. Counsel for LTC read aloud portions of McVeigh\u2019s testimony to the BOR and presented two exhibits, one showing cost per square foot used by the county for apartments, the other showing property record cards of other assisted-living facilities. The BTA received the exhibits over objection of the county and the school board. The BTA then entertained briefs from the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 11} On June 7, 2011, the BTA issued its decision. As for McVeigh\u2019s presentation to the BOR, the BTA declined to adopt his conclusions because \u201cthere is no data included to support the conclusions reached.\u201d <em>LTC Properties, Inc. v. Licking Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>BTA No. 2008-A-1010, 2011 WL 2306065, *2 (June 7, 2011). With respect to LTC\u2019s contention that the auditor should have used the apartment cost schedules as the starting point, the BTA held that although it had in the past \u201cadopted, at least in part, many appraisals of assisted living facilities that have relied upon comparisons of the subject facilities to apartment complexes, there is no requirement that such comparisons be made.\u201d <em>Id., </em>*4. Acknowledging that \u201cthe particular code that a county assigns to a property may impact its valuation, it is clearly not the only factor that determines the valuation to be assigned,\u201d and as a result, \u201cany appraisal of an assisted living facility that is based on rates attributable to an alternative code may require adjustments, which it appears were made by the county herein.\u201d <em>Id., </em>*5. The BTA found that LTC had \u201cfailed to demonstrate that the value which it seeks has a basis in the market, as of the tax lien date in question\u201d and that the taxpayer had thereby not satisfied its burden of proof. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the BTA retained the county\u2019s valuation. <em>Id. </em>We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">{\u00b6 12} Because the true value of property is a \u201cquestion of fact, the determination of which is primarily within the province of the taxing authorities,\u201d we have held that we will \u201cnot disturb a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals with respect to such valuation unless it affirmatively appears from the record that such decision is unreasonable or unlawful.\u201d <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision v. Fodor, </em>15 Ohio St.2d 52, 239 N.E.2d 25 (1968), syllabus. .Moreover, because the BTA as the finder of fact has \u201cwide discretion in granting weight to evidence and credibility to witnesses,\u201d we will not reverse the BTA\u2019s determination of evidentiary weight and credibility \u201cunless we find an abuse of this discretion.\u201d <em>Natl. Church Residence v. Licking Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>73 Ohio St.3d 397, 398, 653 N.E.2d 240 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\n<em>1. The BTA did not abuse its discretion when it denied LTC\u2019s request for continuance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">{\u00b6 13} With respect to its contention that the BTA ought to have granted its request for a continuance of the April 5, 2010 hearing, the case law establishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>and LTC agrees that the standard for our review is abuse of discretion. <em>Coats v. Limbach, </em>47 Ohio St.3d 114, 116, 548 N.E.2d 917 (1989), quoting <em>Akron v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>5 Ohio St.2d 237, 241, 215 N.E.2d 366 (1966). As a result, we will not reverse the BTA\u2019s determination without a showing that the board\u2019s \u201cattitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>See J.M. Smucker, L.L.C. v. Levin, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 337, 2007-Ohio-2073, 865 N.E.2d 866, \u00b6 16. Did the BTA abuse its discretion in this instance?</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">{\u00b6 14} We acknowledge at the outset the established principle that \u201ccourts liberally continue cases because denying a continuance would deny a litigant his day in court.\u201d <em>Coats </em>at 116, citing <em>State ex rel. Buck v. McCabe, </em>140 Ohio St. 535, 538, 45 N.E.2d 763 (1942). Nonetheless, we hold that under the circumstances presented, the BTA was well justified in denying a continuance, even if the BTA indulges (as LTC suggests) in a common practice of granting a first continuance. In so holding, we focus on the requirement that an application for continuance be \u201cmade in good faith,\u201d one of the enumerated criteria for evaluating such motions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 15} The BTA\u2019s denial is justified because LTC\u2019s request for continuance arises in the context of its violation of the BTA\u2019s procedural rules in three pertinent respects. First, LTC violated Ohio Adm.Code 5717-1-11, which authorizes discovery, by willfully ignoring discovery requests that it disclose its witnesses and exhibits. Second, LTC violated Ohio Adm.Code 5717-1-15(1) by failing to make disclosure of its witnesses and exhibits 14 days or more before the scheduled hearing. Third, LTC failed to comply with the requirement of Ohio Adm.Code 5717-1-15(C) that a request for continuance be filed 14 days or more before the scheduled hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 16} In addition, LTC\u2019s request for continuance states no cause other than the vague \u201cunavailability\u201d of the named appraiser. Nor does it advance any reason why LTC should be excused from the operation of the rules it transgressed. Finally, it is not wholly irrelevant that the better part of two years had already elapsed since the filing of the appeal. Under all these circumstances, the BTA could reasonably have concluded within the exercise of its discretion that the request lacked good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">{\u00b6 17} This situation contrasts starkly with the facts in <em>Coats, </em>47 Ohio St.3d 114, 548 N.E.2d 917, and <em>Strongsville Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>53 Ohio St.3d 254, 559 N.E.2d 1351 (1990), two cases in which we did find an abuse of discretion. In <em>Coats, </em>the BTA declined to convene a supplemental hearing for the purpose of hearing the testimony of an accountant, where the appellant had herself appeared at the first hearing and had explained that the accountant was ill. In finding an abuse of discretion, we noted that (1) the record corroborated the claim of the witness\u2019s ill health, (2) the witness\u2019s testimony was critical to the taxpayer\u2019s case, (3) the request was made in good faith, (4) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>witness would likely have attended a future hearing, and (5) appellee had not objected to the continuance. <em>Id. </em>at 117. Similarly in <em>Strongsville, </em>we held that the Strongsville Board of Education had \u201cproceeded with diligence when advised of the unavailability of his witness\u201d in several enumerated respects. <em>Id. </em>at 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">{\u00b6 18} Quite simply, the conduct of LTC here presents the very antithesis of diligence: a series of refusals to disclose its evidence that culminated in a failure to offer a good-cause explanation for the rule violations or to give any actual reasons for the witness\u2019s absence. While the BTA could have decided to grant the continuance, we hold that under these circumstances, the board did not abuse its discretion in deciding not to.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\n<em>2. Using the nursing-home/private-hospital cost schedules as a starting point for valuing an assisted-living facility was not an abuse of discretion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">{\u00b6 19} We turn now to the issue of the auditor\u2019s use of cost schedules in valuing LTC\u2019s property. Here, LTC acknowledges that its facility does not neatly fit into any of the rule-prescribed classifications set forth in Ohio Adm.Code 5703-25-10, so that some degree of improvisation on the auditor\u2019s part is necessary. But LTC asserts that the auditor\u2019s discretion in this regard is constrained by the principle that \u201cthe valuation of the realty portion of congregate care facilities in comparison to conventional apartment buildings has been the standard since <em>Chippewa Place [Dev. Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>BTA No. 91-P-245, 1993 WL 384198 (Sept. 24, 1993)].\u201d <em>Karrington of Kenwood, Ltd. v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>BTA No. 2006-M-2329, 2009 WL 4015361, *4 (Nov. 10, 2009). Under LTC\u2019s theory, this passage means that assisted-living facilities must be treated as apartment buildings for purposes of determining which cost schedule to use. We disagree for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">{\u00b6 20} First, the principle that LTC cites and relies on would appear to have little or no application to the cost approach. <em>Karrington of Kenwood </em>demonstrates the point. In that case, \u201cthe board accord[ed] the cost approach very little weight.\u201d <em>Id., </em>*5, fn. 1. More significant were the income and comparable-sale approaches, and the issue was whether to compare the subject property with other congregate-care facilities or with apartment buildings. The proper choice was apartment buildings, because under the comparable-sale approach, the comparison to other congregate-care facilities \u201cdid not accurately capture the value of the subject property\u201d on account of \u201cthe sales [being] too remote in time and distance.\u201d The same was true under the income approach, because \u201cthe income earned by an individual comparable\u201d was found to be \u201ctoo closely tied to the operating business of eldercare to be indicative of the value of the real property.\u201d <em>Id., </em>*3. <em>See also Dublin Senior Community L.P. v. Franklin Cty. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number><em>Bd. of Revision, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 455, 460, 687 N.E.2d 426 (1997) (because a congregate-care center \u201ccomprises a combination of real estate and business activities,\u201d charging as it does both rental for the apartments and fees for ancillary services, \u201cthe two activities must be kept separate\u201d when the real estate is being valued). These considerations led the board to conclude that \u201cthe use of congregate care facilities to compare either sale prices or income earned\u201d would contravene the requirement \u201cto base value for ad valorem tax purposes on value in exchange and not value in use.\u201d <em>Farrington, </em>*3.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">{\u00b6 21} We do not think that these concerns directly apply in the cost-valuation context. When sale prices are compared, the sale price of a congregate-care facility may include elements of business value that relate to the provision of ancillary services as opposed to the rental of realty; likewise, when income is capitalized to determine value, the income of a congregate-care facility must be analyzed into its rental and service-fee components in order to determine that portion of income that relates to realty. <em>Both </em>these considerations militate toward using apartment buildings as a point of comparison when valuing the real property of a congregate-care facility under the sales-comparison or income-capitalization approaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">{\u00b6 22} By contrast, the application of cost schedules to a particular facility <em>inherently relates to the realty: </em>the items being \u201ccosted\u201d are elements of a permanent improvement to the land that qualifies as part of the real-property tax base. <em>See </em>R.C. 5701.02 (defining real property to include \u201call buildings, structures, improvements, and fixtures of whatever kind on the land, and all rights and privileges belonging or appertaining thereto\u201d). Under this definition, Ohio tax law regards as real property \u201cany property attached to land\u201d unless the statutes otherwise establish the item to constitute personal property. <em>Thomas Steel Strip Corp. v. Limbach, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 340, 341, 575 N.E.2d 114 (1991); <em>compare Funtime, Inc. v. Wilkins, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 74, 2004-Ohio-6890, 822 N.E.2d 781, \u00b6 14-16. Moreover, the distinction between the cost schedules for the nursing-home/private-hospital category and that for \u201capartments \u2014 20 to 39 rental units\u201d in no way relates to a distinction between real property value and business value, but to the costs of different kinds of structures adapted for particular purposes. As a result, the decision of which cost category to employ does not appear to correlate with the issue of segregating business value from real property value, and LTC has cited no authority indicating that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 23} Our second area of disagreement with LTC\u2019s argument relates to the potential dissimilarities between assisted-living facilities and ordinary apartments on the one hand, together with similarities between assisted-living facilities and nursing homes from the design standpoint. Unlike ordinary apartments, assisted-living units typically lack full kitchens in the apartments and instead have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>congregate dining areas, and the bathrooms and hallways have handrails for support and are extra wide to permit the passage of wheelchairs. <em>See Karrington, </em>BTA No. 2006-M-2329, 2009 WL 4015361, *2. These features, which add expense and are likely to be encountered in nursing homes and private hospitals as well, indicate the relevance of nursing-home/private-hospital costs in valuing assisted-living facilities. <em>Accord Harbor Court Ltd. Partnership v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>BTA No. 92-T-1054, 1994 WL 269639 (June 10, 1994), *10 (an appraisal\u2019s cost approach correctly used the cost manual\u2019s \u201chomes for the elderly\u201d category as opposed to the \u201cconventional apartment buildings\u201d category, given the similarity of structural characteristics).</p>\n<p id=\"Av8\">{\u00b6 24} The similarity of the amenities incorporated into an assisted-living facility to those incorporated into a nursing home or private hospital makes it appropriate, under the cost approach, to include the cost elements that relate to those amenities in the valuation of the property. That is so because the cost approach is driven by the \u201cprinciple of substitution, which states that a rational, informed purchaser will pay no more for a property than the cost of acquiring an acceptable substitute with like utility.\u201d International Association of Assessing Officers, <em>Property Assessment Valuation </em>127 (2d Ed.1996). Indeed, given that the goal of the cost valuation is to establish the high-end cap for what a buyer would be willing to pay for a facility <em>with the same utility, </em>it makes sense that the county auditor in this case would have used nursing-home costs as a starting point and adjusted downward to determine the value of LTC\u2019s facility. <em>See Dayton-Montgomery Cty. Port Auth. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 281, 2007-Ohio-1948, 865 N.E.2d 22, \u00b6 12 (\u201cBy determining the cost to replace existing improvements, the auditor establishes an upper limit to the amount a buyer would be willing to pay for an existing structure\u201d), citing <em>Dinner Bell Meats, Inc. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>12 Ohio St.3d 270, 272, 466 N.E.2d 909 (1984); <em>Meijer, Inc. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 181, 187, 661 N.E.2d 1056 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 25} Finally, we note that LTC characterizes the county\u2019s 25 percent reduction for obsolescence (plus the additional downward adjustment) as a \u201cfudge factor\u201d that does not justify using the nursing-home/private-hospital cost schedule. It is true that the basis for these reductions has not been explained by the county, but under the case law, the county does not bear the burden of offering such an explanation. <em>See Colonial Village, Ltd. v. Washington Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 268, 2009-Ohio-4975, 915 N.E.2d 1196, \u00b630 (\u201cwe reiterate that the county does <em>not </em>have the affirmative burden to establish as a general matter the accuracy of any appraisals that underlie its valuation of the property\u201d [emphasis sic]). In this regard, LTC\u2019s citation of <em>Dayton-Montgomery Cty. Port Auth., </em>113 Ohio St.3d 281, 2007-Ohio-1948, 865 N.E.2d 22 <em>(\u201cPort Auth.\u201d) </em>is unavailing. As we explained in <em>Colonial Village, Port Auth. </em>presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>an exception to the usual rule because \u201cthe developed record before the BTA negated the validity of the county\u2019s valuation of the property.\u201d <em>Colonial Village, </em>\u00b6 24. Specifically, the taxpayer in <em>Port Auth. </em>had presented actual-cost evidence that negated the application of a 1.6 grade-factor adjustment to the cost figure from the schedules. <em>Port Auth., </em>\u00b6 7, 14, 16. By contrast, LTC\u2019s evidence does not rise to the level of placing the burden on the county to explain its computation.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">{\u00b6 26} For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the BTA\u2019s decision to affirm the county\u2019s use of the nursing-home/private-hospital cost schedule as a starting point in performing a cost valuation of LTC\u2019s assisted-living facility was neither unreasonable nor unlawful and that the BTA did not abuse its discretion by denying a continuance. We therefore affirm the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b397-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-10\">. The BOR hearing was transcribed by a court reporter, and the transcript does not show that McVeigh was sworn. Nor does the transcript show any objection to his giving unsworn testimony. We will regard the absence of an objection to the testimony on account of the witness\u2019s not having been sworn as a waiver of the point. <em>See Stores Realty Co. v.

I write separately as a cautionary tale for practitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">{\u00b6 28} All property owners and their counsel know that they have a heavy burden to overcome when challenging a valuation. So why, as in this case, make the situation worse by ignoring simple and obvious requirements? Continuances are routinely granted in tax cases, but not when the party seeking the continuance disregards well-established procedure, such as requesting the continuance in a timely fashion and disclosing its witnesses and exhibits. And if a corporate entity wants to challenge a valuation, it should send a certified appraiser or other qualified expert, not an employee, however experienced. It is well known that the only nonexperts competent to testify as to valuation are owners. Finally, the best way to challenge a valuation is with a proper appraisal, which was not submitted in this case. Little wonder that the property owner was unable to establish that the board of revision abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">{\u00b6 29} I am sympathetic to the property owner in this case. The valuation method used by the auditor to determine the value of a congregate-care assisted-living facility is questionable. It seems more reasonable to base the cost on that of an apartment complex than on a nursing home or hospital. But for a variety of reasons, the corporate property owner was not able to adequately prove its case.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ACV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Wayne E.
