Royer did not deposit this check or any subsequent payments made by Celestino into his client trust account prior to earning the fee, in violation of DR 9-102(A) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>and Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a) and (c) (requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients in an interest-bearing client trust account, separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property, and to deposit into a client trust account legal fees and expenses that have been paid in advance).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">{\u00b6 5} Celestino also paid Royer an additional $4,500 for costs associated with pursuing her malpractice claim. Royer failed to maintain records to account for these costs and failed to render an account to his client, in violation of a number of rules governing professional conduct: DR 9-102(B)(3) (requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all client property coming into the lawyer\u2019s possession and render appropriate accounts to each client) and Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a)(2) (requiring a lawyer to maintain a record for each client on whose behalf funds are held), 1.15(a)(3) (requiring a lawyer to maintain a record for the lawyer\u2019s client trust account, setting forth the name of the account, the date, the amount, and the client affected by each credit and debit and the balance in the account), and 1.15(a)(4) (requiring a lawyer to maintain all bank statements, deposit slips, and canceled checks, if provided by the bank, for each bank account). Royer also lost evidence that was vital to the malpractice claim, in violation of Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a) (requiring a lawyer to preserve the identity of client funds and property and promptly deliver funds or other property that the client is entitled to receive).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Walters Matter</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">{\u00b6 6} On three occasions, Paul Walters retained Royer to file applications for a patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. On March 18, 1999, Royer filed a provisional application for a patent in the patent office. Walters instructed Royer to also prepare and file a patent application that would claim priority from the provisional application if filed by March 18, 2000. Royer failed to timely file the application and did not advise his client of his failure. He eventually filed the application on November 17, 2000, but because of the delay, Walters was not able to claim priority from the previously filed provisional application. Royer admitted neglecting a legal matter entrusted to him in violation of DR 6-101(a)(3) (prohibiting neglect of an entrusted legal matter).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">{\u00b6 7} In September 2001, Walters again retained Royer to prepare and file an application for another invention. Despite Walters\u2019s numerous inquiries between November 14, 2001, and October 10, 2006, Royer did not file the application until August 28, 2008. He admitted neglecting a legal matter entrusted to him, in violation of DR 6-101(A)(3) and Prof.Cond.R. 1.3 (requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence in representing a client).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">{\u00b6 8} On August 24, 2006, Royer filed a design patent application for another Walters invention. A month later, the patent office issued a notice of missing parts, but Royer failed to timely respond to it. Consequently, on May 21, 2008, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>the patent office declared the application abandoned. Royer did not notify Walters about the notice or the abandonment. Instead, he told Walters on February 25, 2009, that the application \u201cwas taken care of.\u201d Royer admitted that he had neglected a legal matter entrusted to him, in violation of DR 6 \u2014 101(A)(3) and Prof.Cond.R. 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">{\u00b6 9} In addition, Royer admitted that he had failed to maintain complete records of all funds and other properties that he received from Walters and had failed to render an appropriate account to him in violation of DR 9-102(B)(3) and Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a)(2), (3), and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">{\u00b6 10} In considering an appropriate sanction for this misconduct, the board weighed the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B). The board also considered sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>See Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">{\u00b6 11} In aggravation, the board concluded that Royer had committed multiple offenses with respect to the Walters matter and that both clients were vulnerable in that they relied upon him to represent their interests and to care for their funds. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(d) and (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">{\u00b6 12} In mitigation, the board took into consideration that Royer had no prior disciplinary record during his 46 years of practice and had no dishonest motive and that he had made restitution to his clients. In addition, Royer fully cooperated in the disciplinary process and showed remorse for his conduct. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (b), (c), and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">{\u00b6 13} Under similar circumstances, we imposed a six-month suspension from the practice of law and stayed the suspension on conditions in a case in which the respondent failed to file a divorce complaint for a client and failed to deposit the unearned portion of his legal fees from the client into his trust account. <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Rutherford, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 159, 2006-Ohio-6526, 858 N.E.2d 417. For two other clients, the respondent had either failed to file a bankruptcy petition or filed the petition without the necessary schedules and also failed to deposit the unearned fees into his trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-12\">{\u00b6 14} Similarly, we imposed a one-year suspension from the practice of law, with the entire suspension stayed on conditions, for an attorney\u2019s failure to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing two clients and failure to promptly deliver the file to a client when her services were terminated. <em>Akron Bar Assn. v. Holda, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 140, 2010-Ohio-1469, 926 N.E.2d 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">{\u00b6 15} This is Royer\u2019s only disciplinary proceeding in a long career. His ethical violations lack a dishonest motive and appear to be the result of bad time management and recordkeeping. Consequently, we suspend Royer from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>practice of law for one year, with the entire suspension stayed on the conditions that he (1) serve a two-year period of monitored probation without further violations of the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct, (2) retain a certified public accountant within two months of the final disposition of his case to review his bookkeeping procedures with respect to his client trust account, and (3) provide an accountant\u2019s report to the bar association within six months of the final disposition showing compliance with Prof.Cond.R. 1.15. If Royer fails to comply with these conditions, the stay will be revoked and he will serve the full one-year suspension. Costs are taxed to Royer.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ATJ\">Michael A.

Relator charged respondent with misconduct under applicable rules for acts occurring before and after February 1, 2007, the effective date of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which supersede the Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Although both the former and current rules are cited for the same acts, the allegations comprise a single continuing ethical violation. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v.
