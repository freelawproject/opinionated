Blanton, for a writ of mandamus. Blanton asked that appellee, Ottawa County Municipal Court Judge Frederick C. Hany II, be ordered to vacate his judgment dismissing a misdemeanor case against Blanton. The dismissal allowed the state to seek a felony indictment against him. Blanton also seeks a hearing to consider Blanton\u2019s \u201ccounterclaim\u201d against dismissal. Blanton appealed the dismissal of the municipal court case. The appeal was dismissed but has been reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">{\u00b6 2} Blanton had an adequate legal remedy by way of his reinstated appeal from the judgment dismissing his case. Mandamus will not issue when the relator has an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. R.C. 2731.05; <em>see also State ex rel. Nickleson v.
