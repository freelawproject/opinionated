Because the court of appeals erred in granting the writ of mandamus to compel the special election, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals in that regard and grant a writ of mandamus to compel the board of elections to accept the filed petitions and conduct the November 6, 2012 election for the judges of the Sandusky County Court. We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals insofar as the court held that a portion of the pertinent legislation is unconstitutional, but hold that the unconstitutional portion of the statute may not be properly severed. We also affirm the judgment of the court of appeals that appellants are not entitled to a writ of prohibition and that appellants are not entitled to an award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">{\u00b6 2} The Sandusky County Court comprises two districts, which are referred to as Sandusky County Court District No. 1, based in Clyde, and Sandusky County Court District No. 2, based in Woodville.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> http://www.sandusky-county. org/Clerk/Co\u00fanty% 20Courts. These districts have part-time judges, R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>1907.11(A), with Judge John P. Kolesar serving in District No. 1 and Judge Herbert Adams serving in District No. 2. <em>See </em>http://www.sandusky-county.org/ Elected% 20Officials/County% 20Courts/default.asp. Judge Adams has reached the age of 70, and under the Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 6(C),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he cannot be reelected or reappointed judge. The judges are serving six-year terms, R.C. 1907.13, which are scheduled to expire in the absence of the legislation challenged here on December 31, 2012, and January 1, 2013. Former R.C. 1907.11(A), 2010 Sub.H.B. No. 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">{\u00b6 3} In June 2012, the General Assembly enacted 2012 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 509 (\u201cH.B. 509\u201d), which abolishes the Sandusky County Court and establishes the Sandusky County Municipal Court effective January 1, 2013. R.C. 1907.11(A) (\u201cUntil December 31, 2006, in the Sandusky county county court, two part-time judges shall be elected in 1994, terms to commence on January 1, 1995, and January 2, 1995, respectively. The judges elected in 2006 shall serve until December 31, 2012. The Sandusky county county court shall cease to exist on January 1, 2013\u201d); R.C. 1901.01(H) (\u201cEffective January 1, 2013, there is hereby established a municipal court within Sandusky county in any municipal corporation or unincorporated territory within Sandusky county, except the municipal corporations of Bellevue and Fremont and Ballville, Sandusky, and York townships, that is selected by the legislative authority of that court\u201d); R.C. 1901.02(A)(30) (\u201cThe municipal court established within Sandusky county in any municipal corporation or unincorporated territory within Sandusky county, except the municipal corporations of Bellevue and Fremont and Ballville, Sandusky, and York townships, that is selected by the legislative authority of that court and that, beginning January 1, 2013, shall be styled and known as the \u2018Sandusky county municipal court\u2019 \u201d); and R.C. 1901.02(B) (\u201cBeginning January 1, 2013, the San-dusky county municipal court has jurisdiction within all of Sandusky county except within the municipal corporations of Bellevue and Fremont and Ballville, Sandusky, and York townships\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">{\u00b6 4} H.B. 509 further amended R.C. 1901.08 to specify that the part-time judges of the Sandusky County Court will serve as part-time judges of the new Sandusky County Municipal Court for a one-year term when the new court is established and the old court is abolished effective January 1, 2013, and that the six-year term for the new full-time municipal court judgeship will be decided at an election held in 2013:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>In the Sandusky county municipal court, one full-time judge shall be elected in 2013. Beginning on January 1, 2013, the two part-time judges of the Sandusky county county court that existed prior to that date shall serve as part-time judges of the Sandusky county municipal court until December 31, 2013. If either judgeship becomes vacant before January 1, 2014, that judgeship is abolished on the date it becomes vacant, and the person who holds the other judgeship shall serve as the full-time judge of the Sandusky county municipal court until December 31, 2013.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">{\u00b6 5} The effective date of H.B. 509 was September 28, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">{\u00b6 6} On July 10, 2012, appellants, Roy Whitehead, Michael Benton, Gregory S. Gerwin, and Richard A. Harman, filed a complaint in prohibition and mandamus and for a declaratory judgment in an expedited election matter in the Court of Appeals for Sandusky County. Appellants are Sandusky County taxpayers and are the chiefs of police and mayors of Woodville and Gibsonburg, which are within the territorial jurisdiction of both the existing county court and the municipal court established by H.B. 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">{\u00b6 7} Appellants sought a declaratory judgment holding H.B. 509 to be unconstitutional, a writ of prohibition to prevent appellee Sandusky County Board of Commissioners from expending funds for the municipal court created by H.B. 509, and a writ of mandamus to order appellee Sandusky County Board of Elections to accept petitions for the office of judge of the Sandusky County Court and to hold an election in November 2012, which is the regular election cycle for the county court.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">{\u00b6 8} After the court of appeals granted an alternative writ and ordered appellees to file a response to appellants\u2019 complaint, appellants filed a motion for summary judgment in which they introduced evidence that three candidates had submitted petitions to run for the two judicial seats for the Sandusky County Court. Judge Kolesar submitted a petition for the District No. 1 seat that he currently occupies, and Beth Tischler and Mary Beth Fiser submitted petitions to run for the District No. 2 seat currently occupied by Judge Adams. The board of elections rejected all of the petitions, presumably because of H.B. 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">{\u00b6 9} Following the submission of briefs pursuant to an expedited schedule, on September 27, the court of appeals declared that the amendment in H.B. 509 (R.C. 1901.08) providing for the one-year appointment of the two existing, part-time county court judges to the newly created municipal court on January 1, 2013 is unconstitutional because it provides for the legislative appointment of the judges to the new judgeship.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">{\u00b6 10} The court determined that the unconstitutional amendment to R.C. 1901.08 is severable from the constitutional amendments to R.C. 1907.11(A) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>abolishing the Sandusky County Court and to R.C. 1901.01 and 1901.02 creating the Sandusky County Municipal Court. The court also determined that the unconstitutional portion of R.C. 1901.08 providing for the one-year appointment of the county court judges to the municipal court is severable from the constitutional portion of the statute providing for a 2013 election for the one full-time judge of the municipal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">{\u00b6 11} For its remedy, the court of appeals granted a writ of mandamus to compel the board of elections and the board of commissioners to hold a special election prior to January 1, 2013, to elect one full-time judge for the first year of the newly created municipal court, with an election for a full six-year term to be held in November 2013. The court of appeals also denied appellants\u2019 request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">{\u00b6 12} Five days later, on October 2, appellants filed this appeal. The next day, this court granted appellants\u2019 request for an expedited briefing schedule and invited the attorney general to file a brief expressing his views. 133 Ohio St.3d 1405, 2012-Ohio-4560, 975 N.E.2d 1024. The court later granted appellants\u2019 motion for a stay of the court of appeals\u2019 judgment ordering the special election pending the court\u2019s resolution of this appeal. 133 Ohio St.3d 1407, 2012-Ohio-4662, 975 N.E.2d 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">{\u00b6 13} The parties submitted briefs, and the attorney general declined the court\u2019s invitation to submit a brief. This cause is now before the court for our consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">\n<em>Preliminary Matters</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">{\u00b6 14} Initially, we have jurisdiction to address the merits of this appeal even though the court of appeals did not expressly rule on appellants\u2019 prohibition claim. The judgment of the court of appeals fully complied with R.C. 2505.02 and Civ.R. 54(B) notwithstanding its failure to specifically address appellants\u2019 prohibition claim. The judgment granting the writ of mandamus affected a substantial right and determined the action. R.C. 2505.02(B)(1). Appellants sought the writ of prohibition to prevent the board of commissioners from spending funds for personnel for the newly created Sandusky County Municipal Court. By granting a writ of mandamus to compel the board of elections and the board of commissioners to conduct a special election to elect a judge for the new municipal court for a one-year term commencing on January 1, 2013, the court of appeals in effect denied or rendered moot appellants\u2019 prohibition claim because it recognized the viability of the municipal court and its associated funding. And \u201c \u2018even though all the claims or parties are not expressly adjudicated by the trial court, if the effect of the judgment as to some of the claims is to render moot the remaining claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>or parties, then compliance with Civ.R. 54(B) is not required to make the judgment final and appealable.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. A &amp; D Ltd. Partnership v. Keefe, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 50, 57, 671 N.E.2d 13 (1996), quoting <em>Gen. Acc. Ins. Co. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>44 Ohio St.3d 17, 21, 540 N.E.2d 266 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">{\u00b6 15} Further, appellants\u2019 claims are not barred by laches, as appellees suggest. Appellees waived this claim because they did not file a cross-appeal from the court of appeals\u2019 judgment raising laches, and they admitted in their answer filed below that appellants acted with the utmost diligence in filing their case.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">{\u00b6 16} The court of appeals also properly denied appellants\u2019 claim for a writ of prohibition to prevent the board of commissioners from expending funds on personnel working for the Sandusky County Municipal Court created by H.B. 509. Appellants did not establish that the board of county commissioners either exercised or is about to exercise judicial or quasi-judicial power when it appropriates funding for the new municipal court. <em>See State ex rel. Bell v. Pfeiffer, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 114, 2012-Ohio-54, 961 N.E.2d 181, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">{\u00b6 17} Moreover, insofar as appellants\u2019 request could be considered a request for a prohibitory injunction rather than a claim for a writ of prohibition, courts of appeals lack original jurisdiction in prohibitory injunction. <em>State ex rel. Chattams v. Pater, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 119, 2012-Ohio-55, 961 N.E.2d 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">{\u00b6 18} Therefore, the court of appeals did not err by in effect denying appellants\u2019 request for a writ of prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">\n<em>Mandamus: Appellants\u2019 Constitutional Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">{\u00b6 19} In their complaint in the court of appeals, appellants requested a declaratory judgment that H.B. 509 is unconstitutional. \u201c[N]either this court nor the court of appeals has original jurisdiction over claims for declaratory judgment.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Ministerial Day Care Assn. v. Zelman, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 347, 2003-Ohio-6447, 800 N.E.2d 21, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">{\u00b6 20} Nevertheless, it is appropriate for the court to consider the propriety of appellants\u2019 constitutional claim concerning H.B. 509 in the context of their mandamus claim because an action for a declaratory judgment would not be sufficiently speedy in this expedited election case. <em>See generally State ex rel. Watson v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 239, 242, 725 N.E.2d 255 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">{\u00b6 21} Therefore, we must first determine whether \u2014 as the court of appeals held \u2014 H.B. 509, insofar as it appoints two judges from the Sandusky County Court to a one-year term on the newly created Sandusky County Municipal Court beginning on January 1, 2013, is unconstitutional. R.C. 1901.08 is unconstitutional because the General Assembly does not have power to appoint judges under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>the Ohio Constitution. <em>Kovachy v. Cleveland, </em>166 Ohio St. 388, 389, 143 N.E.2d 579 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">{\u00b6 22} In addition, R.C. 1901.08 is unconstitutional because the judges of the county court were never elected to serve on the municipal court. The General Assembly has a constitutional duty to provide for the election of a judge upon its creation of any additional court. Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 6(A)(4) (\u201cTerms of office of all judges shall begin on the days fixed by law, and laws shall be enacted to prescribe the times and mode of their election\u201d); <em>Ex Parte Logan Branch of State Bank of Ohio, </em>1 Ohio St. 432, 434 (1853) (\u201cit is perfectly clear that, upon the creation of any additional court by the Legislature, the judicial officer must be elected, as such, by the electors of the district for which such court is created; and it is not within the competency of the Legislature to clothe with judicial power any officer or person, not elected as a judge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">{\u00b6 23} Finally, this statute is also unconstitutional because it provides a one-year term for the first judges on the municipal court. <em>See </em>Ohio Constitution, Article XVII, Section 1 (\u201cThe term of office of all judges shall be as provided in Article IV of this constitution or, if not so provided, an even number of years not exceeding six as provided by law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">{\u00b6 24} Therefore, the court of appeals properly determined that appellants had met their burden of establishing that H.B. 509 is, in part, unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">\n<em>Mandamus: Court of Appeals\u2019Remedy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">{\u00b6 25} The court of appeals granted a writ of mandamus to compel appellees, the board of elections and the board of commissioners, to hold a special election prior to January 1, 2013, to elect a judge for the newly created municipal court. Appellants claim that the court of appeals erred in ordering this special election and that the court should have granted their requested writ of mandamus to compel the appellees to conduct an election for the two county court part-time judgeships for the six-year terms beginning on January 1 and 2, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">{\u00b6 26} To be entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus, appellants must establish a clear legal right to the requested relief, a corresponding clear legal duty on the part of appellees to provide it, and the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. <em>State ex rel. Waters v. Spaeth, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 55, 2012-Ohio-69, 960 N.E.2d 452, \u00b6 6. Because of the proximity of the expiration of the terms of the current judges of the Sandusky County Court and any election necessary to elect judges to new terms on that court, appellants lack an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">{\u00b6 27} For the remaining requirements, appellants claim that because H.B. 509 is unconstitutional and the pertinent constitutional portions of it cannot be severed, the board of \u00e9lections and the board of commissioners have a clear legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>duty under the preexisting law to conduct elections for the next six-year terms of the two part-time judges of the county court, beginning on January 1 and 2, 2013. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cWhen this court holds that a statute is unconstitutional, severance may be appropriate. * * * Severance is suitable, however, only where it satisfies our well-established standard.\u201d <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, \u00b6 94; <em>see also </em>R.C. 1.50. Under the applicable three-part test, the court must answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-6\">\u201c(1) Are the constitutional and the unconstitutional parts capable of separation so that each may be read and may stand by itself? (2) Is the unconstitutional part so connected with the general scope of the whole as to make it impossible to give effect to the apparent intention of the Legislature if the clause or part is stricken out? (3) Is the insertion of words or terms necessary in order to separate the constitutional part from the unconstitutional part, and to give effect to the former only?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-7\"><em>Geiger v. Geiger, </em>117 Ohio St. 451, 466, 160 N.E. 28 (1927), quoting <em>State v. Bickford, </em>28 N.D. 36, 147 N.W. 407 (1913), paragraph nineteen of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">{\u00b6 29} The court of appeals determined that the portion of R.C. 1901.08 appointing the existing county court part-time judges to a one-year term as judges of the newly created municipal court was unconstitutional but severable from the remaining amended provisions in H.B. 509. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">{\u00b6 30} The court of appeals\u2019 remedy fails for several reasons. First, the special election ordered is not included in H.B. 509, and courts are forbidden to add a nonexistent provision to the plain language of legislation. <em>State ex rel. Steffen v. Court of Appeals, First Appellate Dist., </em>126 Ohio St.3d 405, 2010-Ohio-2430, 934 N.E.2d 906, \u00b6 26 (\u201cwe are forbidden to add a nonexistent provision to the plain language of [a statute]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">{\u00b6 31} Second, courts cannot create the legal duty that is enforceable in mandamus; the creation of this duty is a legislative and not a judicial function. <em>State ex rel. Zidonis v. Columbus State Community College, </em>133 Ohio St.3d 122, 2012-Ohio-4228, 976 N.E.2d 861, \u00b6 30, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">{\u00b6 32} Third, in applying the third prong of the severance test, the court cannot add language to the challenged legislation to sever the constitutional part from the unconstitutional part. <em>See Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, \u00b6 98 (in severing a portion of the felony-sentencing provisions to save the constitutional part, the court emphasized that \u201c[w]e add no language, and the vast majority of S.B. 2, which is capable of being read and of standing alone, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>left in place\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Maurer v. Sheward, </em>71 Ohio St.3d 513, 524, 644 N.E.2d 369 (1994) (court excised unconstitutional portion of statute affecting governor\u2019s powers of commutations and reprieves, but retained provisions concerning governor\u2019s power to pardon after determining that the court \u201cneed not add any other language in order to give effect to its regulatory scheme\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">{\u00b6 33} Finally, the court of appeals\u2019 special election for a one-year term violates the Ohio Constitution, Article. XVII, Section 1, which requires that if a term of office for a judge is not provided in Article IV, the term shall be for \u201can even number of years not exceeding six.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\"><em>Application of </em>Geiger</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">{\u00b6 34} Applying the <em>Geiger </em>tripartite severance test, we must first determine whether the constitutional and unconstitutional parts of H.B. 509 relating to the Sandusky County Court and the Sandusky County Municipal Court are capable of separation. The pertinent unconstitutional parts of the legislation involve the appointment of the county court judges to act as municipal court judges for 2013. The General Assembly is authorized to abolish nonconstitutional inferior courts like the Sandusky County Court and to create the Sandusky County Municipal Court. <em>See </em>Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 1. The General Assembly is also authorized to require a November 2013 election for judge of the newly created municipal court as set forth in amended R.C. 1901.08. <em>See </em>Ohio Constitution, Article XVII, Section 1 (\u201cElections for state and county officers shall be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in even numbered years; <em>and all elections for all other elective officers shall be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in the odd numbered years\u201d </em>[emphasis added]); <em>State ex rel. Higley v. Shale, </em>137 Ohio St. 311, 313, 29 N.E.2d 214 (1940) (municipal court judge is not a state or county officer for purposes of Article XVII, Section 1); R.C. 1901.06 (\u201cthe first election of any newly created office of a municipal judge shall be held at the next regular municipal election occurring not less than one hundred days after the creation of the office\u201d); R.C. 3501.01(B) (\u201c \u2018Regular municipal election\u2019 means the election held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in each odd-numbered year\u201d); <em>see also </em>R.C. 1901.08 (setting elections in specific odd-numbered years for municipal courts).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">{\u00b6 35} Nevertheless, after excision of the January 1, 2013 date for abolishing the Sandusky County Court and creating the Sandusky County Municipal Court and the provision that the county court judges serve as judges of the municipal court in 2013, the remainder of the amended statutes cannot stand by themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">{\u00b6 36} Appellees suggest that simply replacing the January 2013 date with January 2014 would allow the statutes to stand. Although \u201cthe institution of a new municipal court shall take place on the first day of January next after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>first election for the court\u201d under R.C. 1901.06 and the November 2013 election is specified in amended R.C. 1901.08, the statutes do not specify January 1, 2014, as the date of the court\u2019s establishment. With the phrase \u201cJanuary 1, 2013,\u201d excised from the amended R.C. 1907.11(A), leaving the mere statement that \u201c[t]he Sandusky county county court shall cease to exist,\u201d there is no existing statutory provision that would supply the date of January 1, 2014, as the end date for the existing county court.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">{\u00b6 37} For the second part of the severance test, the unconstitutional part of H.B. 509 relating to Sandusky County is so connected to the general scope of that county\u2019s entire legislation as to make it impossible to give effect to the apparent intention of the General Assembly if that part is stricken. The preeminent intent of the General Assembly in enacting this legislation is to abolish the Sandusky County Court and its part-time judges and to replace it with the newly created Sandusky County Municipal Court and its full-time judge <em>on the specified date of January 1, 2013. </em>To substitute January 1, 2014, as the applicable date contravenes that manifest intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">{\u00b6 38} Finally, severance fails to satisfy the third part of the test. Much like the court of appeals\u2019 remedy, the remedy advocated by appellees adds language to the statute. We cannot replace the statutory language and hold that severance is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">{\u00b6 39} This result is supported by precedent. In <em>Franklin Cty. Bd. of Elections v. State ex rel. Schneider, </em>128 Ohio St. 273, 191 N.E. 115 (1934), we affirmed a judgment granting a writ of mandamus to compel a board of elections and its members to hold a regular election for county recorder for a two-year term in light of the unconstitutionality of a statute that extended the term of incumbent recorders for two years with four-year terms thereafter. Although the latter provision for county recorders to be elected to four-year terms was constitutional by itself, because it was inseparably connected with the unconstitutional two-year unelected extension of incumbent county recorders\u2019 original two-year terms, the entirety of the amendments fell:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-8\">If it were not for the fact that the two sections when considered together do away with the election of 1934, tenable argument could be advanced favoring the constitutionality of section 2750, General Code; but the sections are so \u2018inseparably connected\u2019 that both must fall, and the repealing section must fall with them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">{\u00b6 40} Similarly, although the portion of H.B. 509 abolishing the Sandusky County Court and replacing it with the Sandusky County Municipal Court after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>an election for judge of the municipal court at the regular municipal election in November 2013 would be constitutional, that portion of the enactment is inseparably connected to the unconstitutional part of H.B. 509 specifying the date of January 1, 2013, as the date that the municipal court will replace the county court and further legislatively appointing the two judges of the county court to serve a one-year term as judges of the newly created municipal court in 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">{\u00b6 41} Therefore, the entire part of H.B. 509 addressing the abolition of the Sandusky County Court and its replacement with the newly created Sandusky County Municipal Court is inseparable into constitutional and unconstitutional parts and must be stricken as unconstitutional. But the General Assembly is free to revisit this issue and to enact a new act to validly abolish the county court and to replace it with the municipal court on January 1, 2014. <em>See, e.g., Schneider, </em>at paragraph five of the syllabus (\u201cAn act of the General Assembly, which was unconstitutional at the time of enactment, can be revivified only by reenactment\u201d); <em>Geisinger v. Cook, </em>52 Ohio St.2d 51, 57, 369 N.E.2d 477 (1977) (\u201cIf the court is properly abolished by the General Assembly, the term of one holding the office of judge of that court is terminated\u201d); <em>Greene v. Cuyahoga Cty., </em>195 Ohio App.3d 768, 2011-Ohio-5493, 961 N.E.2d 1171, \u00b6 35-38 (power to abolish an office is as unrestricted as the power to create an office, and an office can be abolished midterm).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">{\u00b6 42} Thus, the Sandusky County Court remains in existence, and appellants are entitled to a writ of mandamus to compel the regularly scheduled election on November 6, 2012, for the part-time judges of the two districts for the specified six-year terms. <em>See </em>R.C. 1907.13 (\u201cJudges shall be elected by the electors of the county court district at the general election in even-numbered years as set forth in section 1907.11 of the Revised Code for a term of six years commencing on the first day of January following the election for the county court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">{\u00b6 43} Therefore, the court of appeals erred in ordering a special election for a one-year term for the newly created municipal court and in not granting a writ of mandamus ordering the board of elections to conduct the regular November 6, 2012 election for the Sandusky County Court. H.B. 509, insofar as it addresses the abolition of the Sandusky County Court and its replacement by the newly created Sandusky County Municipal Court on January 1, 2013, is unconstitutional, and the constitutional part is inseparable from the unconstitutional part.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">\n<em>Attorney Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">{\u00b6 44} The court of appeals did not err in denying appellants\u2019 request for attorney fees under R.C. 309.13 and 2335.39.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">{\u00b6 45} The civil action contemplated by R.C. 309.12 and 309.13 is one in prohibitory injunction, which that court lacks original jurisdiction to consider. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number><em>See Chattams, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 119, 2012-Ohio-55, 961 N.E.2d 186; <em>State ex rel.

And the court of appeals in effect denied appellants\u2019 sole preventive claim that it had original jurisdiction to consider \u2014 their claim for a writ of prohibition to prevent the board of commissioners\u2019 expenditure of funds for the newly created municipal court.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AQWy\">Mayle, Ray &amp; Mayle, L.L.C., Andrew R.

Ohio Liberty Council v. Brunner, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 1510, 2010-Ohio-3331, 930 N.E.2d 330; <em>State ex rel. Myles v. Brunner, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 1413, 2008-Ohio-6166, 897 N.E.2d 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">{\u00b6 47} Based on the foregoing, the court of appeals correctly held that H.B. 509 is unconstitutional insofar as it appoints judges of the Sandusky County Court to the newly created Sandusky County Municipal Court for 2013. The court of appeals erred, however, in granting a writ of mandamus to compel appellees to conduct a special election for judge of the Sandusky County Municipal Court for a one-year term in 2013. Appellants have established their entitlement to a writ of mandamus to compel appellees to conduct the November 6, 2012 election for the two part-time judgeships for the Sandusky County Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">{\u00b6 48} Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals insofar as it grants a writ of mandamus to compel a special election for judge of the municipal court for the one-year term commencing January 1, 2013. We grant a writ of mandamus to compel the board of elections to accept the filed candidate petitions for the two offices of judge of the Sandusky County Court and to conduct the November 6, 2012 election for the county court. Finally, we affirm the judgment denying appellants\u2019 requests for a writ of prohibition and for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b849-10\">Pfeifer, Acting C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, McGee Brown, and Sundermann, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b849-11\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., not participating.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b849-12\">J.
