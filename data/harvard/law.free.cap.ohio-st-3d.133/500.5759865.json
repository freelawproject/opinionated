Judge Elum has served as a Massillon Municipal Court judge since 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-16\">{\u00b6 2} On April 11, 2011, relator, disciplinary counsel, charged Judge Elum in a two-count complaint with multiple violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct and the Rules of Professional Conduct. Judge Elum answered, and in August 2011, the parties submitted a consent-to-discipline agreement pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(ll)(A)(3)(c) and BCGD Proc.Reg. 11. A three-member panel of the Board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline rejected the agreement, including the jointly recommended sanction of a public reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">{\u00b6 3} In September 2011, the three-member panel conducted a hearing, where Judge Elum testified and the parties submitted stipulated facts, exhibits, and violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct and the Rules of Professional Conduct, and a recommended sanction of public reprimand. The panel adopted the parties\u2019 stipulated facts, exhibits, and rule violations, but rejected the stipulated sanction, recommending instead that Judge Elum receive a six-month suspension with the entire suspension stayed. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended sanction. No objections have been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">{\u00b6 4} We accept the board\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law and agree that a six-month suspension, with the entire six months stayed, is an appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">Count One \u2014 The Dunn Case</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">{\u00b6 5} On January 11, 2010, Judge Elum found Cody Dunn, who was already on probation for domestic violence and underage alcohol consumption, guilty of a misdemeanor offense involving an underage person. Judge Elum suspended Dunn\u2019s 180-day jail sentence, provided that Dunn serve probation and comply with several conditions, including payment of all fines and costs by March 31, 2010. Dunn failed to timely pay the fines and costs, and on April 5, 2010, when Dunn appeared at the Massillon Municipal Court to meet with his probation officer, the probation department could have processed him for a probation violation and transferred him to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">{\u00b6 6} Judge Elum, however, \u201cinterceded\u201d by asking the probation department to take Dunn into his courtroom. Judge Elum thereafter conducted what he describes as \u201cprobation review\u201d with Dunn, during which he made the following remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-11\">\u2022 Cody, quit screwing up. * * * Quit fucking up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-12\">\u2022 You have a bad case of D.H. Dickheaditis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-13\">\u2022 You\u2019re screwing off. You can\u2019t keep continuing to screw off or you\u2019ll be like the rest of the dickheads at the Stark County Jail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-15\">{\u00b6 7} Neither Dunn\u2019s counsel nor counsel from the Massillon city prosecutor\u2019s office was present in Judge Elum\u2019s courtroom for this \u201cprobation review.\u201d Other members of the public, however, were there. Judge Elum then issued an entry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>indicating that Dunn had failed to comply with his probation terms and allowing Dunn more time to pay the outstanding fines and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">{\u00b6 8} The parties stipulated, the board found, and we agree that Judge Elum\u2019s conduct violated Jud.Cond.R. 1.2 (a judge shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary and shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety) and 2.8(B) (a judge shall be patient, dignified, and courteous to litigants) and Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">{\u00b6 9} Disciplinary counsel also charged Judge Elum with a violation of Jud. Cond.R. 2.11(A) (a judge shall disqualify himself or herself from any proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned). The board recommends that we dismiss this charge for insufficient evidence. We adopt the board\u2019s findings and hereby dismiss the charge alleging a violation of Jud. Cond.R. 2.11(A) with respect to this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Count Two \u2014 The Farnsworth Case</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">{\u00b6 10} On November 29, 2009, Nancy Farnsworth was charged with operating a vehicle while impaired, two drug-related offenses, and failure to control her vehicle. At some point after her arrest, the arresting officer from the Massillon Police Department reportedly sent Farnsworth 88 text messages, 15 nude and sexually explicit pictures, and one sexually explicit video. Farnsworth and her attorney reported the officer\u2019s conduct to the Massillon city prosecutor\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">{\u00b6 11} On December 15, 2009, Judge Elum held a pretrial hearing on Farnsworth\u2019s criminal case. Laboratory tests showed Farnsworth\u2019s blood-alcohol level to have been 0.00, and the prosecutor requested additional time to obtain results from other tests. Accordingly, Judge Elum scheduled a second pretrial hearing for January 15, 2010. Farnsworth\u2019s counsel also informed Judge Elum about the arresting officer\u2019s text and picture messages. At that time, Judge Elum had a \u201chistory of conflicts and/or disagreements\u201d with the Massillon Police Department and, specifically, Police Chief Robert Williams. Judge Elum was alarmed at the arresting officer\u2019s alleged conduct and, for \u201creligious and moral reasons,\u201d did not want his name associated with the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">{\u00b6 12} At the January 15, 2010 pretrial hearing, the prosecutor again indicated that she was not prepared to move forward with the criminal charges against Farnsworth and she needed more time for investigation. Judge Elum was afraid that the public might perceive further delay as the court\u2019s being \u201cunconcerned about the arresting officer\u2019s conduct.\u201d Judge Elum was also afraid that the police department\u2019s internal response might be to sweep the allegations against the arresting officer \u201cunder the rug and nothing would be done.\u201d Consequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Judge Elum issued an order finding that the Massillon Police Department was \u201cdelaying the prosecution of this matter.\u201d Judge Elum\u2019s order further required the police department, the prosecutor, and defense counsel to \u201cprovide the Court, in a sealed envelope,\u201d all transcripts and copies of the arresting officer\u2019s text and picture messages so that Judge Elum could \u201creview whether the prosecution has been compromised and wasted the court\u2019s time.\u201d The parties were to submit the materials to Judge Elum\u2019s bailiff by January 20, 2010. Neither party in Farnsworth\u2019s case requested Judge Elum\u2019s assistance in obtaining this material, and at the time of the January 15 order, Judge Elum was aware that the Massillon Police Department had already begun an internal investigation into the allegations against the arresting officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">{\u00b6 13} On January 20, 2010, the prosecutor requested reconsideration of Judge Elum\u2019s January 15 order, arguing that the prosecution\u2019s case against Farnsworth had not been compromised by the arresting officer\u2019s subsequent misconduct, that the text and picture messages were not exculpatory, and that Farnsworth had the power to subpoena the messages if they were relevant, which she had not done. The prosecutor further informed the court that the state of Ohio intended to dismiss the drug-related charges because Farnsworth\u2019s blood and urine tested negative. Finally, the prosecutor informed the court that defense counsel had \u201cno objection to these charges being dismissed without the \u2018sealed envelope\u2019 being submitted for inspection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">{\u00b6 14} At the January 21, 2010 pretrial hearing, Judge Elum, after learning that the text and picture messages had not been delivered to his bailiff, recessed the court so that the parties could submit the \u201csealed envelope.\u201d Judge Elum also informed the parties that \u201cproceedings in contempt\u201d would be held later that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">{\u00b6 15} When the court reconvened, the prosecutor informed Judge Elum that she had been unable to obtain all the text and picture messages. Judge Elum then singled out the \u201ctotal neglect and disregard\u201d of the Massillon Police Department for failing to comply with his January 15 order. Judge Elum specifically directed his comments to Chief Williams, who was present in the courtroom. Judge Elum then addressed Farnsworth and stated: \u201cI just want to make sure that everybody understands that the administrative justice at this point was jeopardized * * *. I want the defendant to know and her family to know that the Court was not a party of, no [ \u2014 ] or did not participate in any cover up * * Judge Elum explained that he \u201cwanted those records to be sealed\u201d so that Farnsworth\u2019s family would \u201cknow that there\u2019s a second set somewhere in the event the investigation was not resolved to [her] satisfaction.\u201d Judge Elum apologized to Farnsworth \u201cfrom [sic] behalf of the Court system\u201d and declared, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>\u201c[T]hat officer does not work for the Massillon Municipal Court[.] * \u25a0 * * [H]e is under direct control and supervision of Chief Williams* * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">{\u00b6 16} Judge Elum then dismissed the drug-related charges against Farnsworth, but found her guilty of failure to control her vehicle, to which she had pled no contest. Though the case was resolved, Judge Elum indicated that he would proceed to enforce his January 15 order. The following day, the prosecutor filed a motion to vacate the order to enforce Judge Elum\u2019s January 15 order because' the criminal and traffic charges against Farnsworth had already been resolved. Judge Elum vacated his January 15 order that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">{\u00b6 17} At some point in the following month, The Independent, a newspaper in Massillon, interviewed Judge Elum. In that interview, Judge Elum is quoted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-7\">The chief doesn\u2019t like me and I understand that, OK? That\u2019s his prerogative. My position as a citizen taxpayer and as a judge, I\u2019ve watched that department go down hill since he\u2019s been chief. He is ineffective. Period. That\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">Judge Elum is also quoted as calling a specific police officer \u201clazy\u201d and rarely prepared for court. Judge Elum further claims, according to the article, that he is a target of Chief Williams: \u201cThey are out to get me, but that\u2019s fine. That goes along with the territory here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">{\u00b6 18} Judge Elum has since acknowledged that there was no cover-up by the Massillon Police Department of the arresting officer\u2019s conduct in the Farnsworth case and that he used a \u201cbad term\u201d in describing the situation. Judge Elum has admitted that through his January 15 order, he placed himself in the middle of an administrative investigation into the arresting officer\u2019s conduct and stepped outside his role as a judge. Judge Elum has recognized that his threat of contempt proceedings at the January 20 pretrial hearing had been a \u201cbad choice of words\u201d because contempt would not have been appropriate under the circumstances. And Judge Elum has agreed that he issued an unenforceable order on January 21 when he continued to pursue the submission of the text and picture messages after the criminal and traffic charges against Farnsworth had been resolved. Finally, Judge Elum admits making statements to the newspaper about the Massillon Police Department, alleging ineffective leadership.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">{\u00b6 19} The parties stipulated, the board found, and we agree that Judge Elum\u2019s conduct with respect to Count Two violates Jud.Cond.R. 1.2, 2.2 (a judge shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>uphold and apply the law and shall perform all duties of the judicial office fairly and impartially), 2.8(B), and 2.11(A) and Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">{\u00b6 20} In determining the appropriate sanction for Judge Elum\u2019s violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct and the Rules of Professional Conduct, we consider the duties violated, the injury caused, Judge Elum\u2019s mental state, the existence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances listed in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B), and precedent. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Campbell, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 150, 2010-Ohio-3265, 931 N.E.2d 558, \u00b6 53, citing <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Sargeant, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 322, 2008-Ohio-2330, 889 N.E.2d 96, \u00b6 28, and <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Evans, </em>89 Ohio St.3d 497, 501, 733 N.E.2d 609 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">{\u00b6 21} Judges are subject to the highest standards of ethical conduct. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Russo, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 437, 2010-Ohio-605, 923 N.E.2d 144, \u00b6 13, citing <em>Mahoning Cty. Bar Assn. v. Franko, </em>168 Ohio St. 17, 23, 151 N.E.2d 17 (1958). Judge Elum has committed six violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct and two violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. By using vulgar and intemperate language, Judge Elum behaved in an undignified, unprofessional, and discourteous manner towards litigants in his courtroom. He also needlessly injected himself into an administrative investigation, impairing the independence of the judiciary. Judge Elum allowed his history of conflicts with the Massillon Police Department to cloud his judgment, resulting in a failure to fairly and impartially apply the law. Rather than promoting the evenhanded administration of justice, these actions have served to erode public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">{\u00b6 22} The parties presented no evidence regarding Judge Elum\u2019s mental state at the time of these disciplinary violations. Therefore, we \u201c \u2018presume that he was healthy and unhindered in that regard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Campbell, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 150, 2010-Ohio-3265, 931 N.E.2d 558, \u00b6 56, quoting <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Sargeant, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 322, 2008-Ohio-2330, 889 N.E.2d 96, \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">{\u00b6 23} The board found that, as mitigating factors, Judge Elum (1) has not been the subject of previous discipline, (2) did not act with a dishonest motive, (3) has made a full and free disclosure to the board and displayed a cooperative attitude during the proceedings, and (4) has a good reputation in the community, demonstrating his commitment to the judicial system and the citizens he serves. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (b), (d), and (e). Indeed, Judge Elum submitted many letters of reference attesting to his commitment to his community and his devotion to the law. Those submitting letters included the chief of police of Perry Township, the former chief executive officer of a drug-and-alcohol counsel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>ing agency, a director of Habitat for Humanity, the clerk of the Massillon Municipal Court, the Stark County sheriff, and other attorneys and judges. As an aggravating factor, the board noted that Judge Elum had engaged in a pattern of misconduct, as set forth in Count Two. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">{\u00b6 24} For precedent, the board considered several disciplinary cases involving judges. The sanctions ranged from public reprimands in <em>Ohio State Bar Assn. v. Goldie, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 428, 2008-Ohio-4606, 894 N.E.2d 1226 (three violations of the Canons of the former Code of Judicial Conduct<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for violating litigants\u2019 due process rights), and <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Runyan, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 43, 2006-Ohio-80, 840 N.E.2d 623 (five violations of the Canons of the former Code of Judicial Conduct and one violation of the Disciplinary Rules<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for attempting to take \u201ccorrective action\u201d against a detective whose actions led the judge to declare a mistrial, ordering the prosecutor to post bond to cover costs of the retrial, and attempting to broker a \u201cdeal\u201d with the prosecutor that went well beyond the judge\u2019s authority), to six-month fully stayed suspensions in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Hoague, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 321, 725 N.E.2d 1108 (2000) (one violation of the Canons of the former Code of Judicial Conduct for writing a letter on court letterhead to individuals whom the judge observed driving recklessly, and having them appear in his courtroom) and <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Gaul, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 16, 2010-Ohio-4831, 936 N.E.2d 28 (three violations of the Canons of the former Code of Judicial Conduct and one violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct by making highly prejudicial and unnecessary remarks against a defendant and misusing the Amber Alert System to locate a witness and solicit media involvement).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">{\u00b6 25} On the other hand, we imposed partially stayed suspensions in <em>Campbell, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 150, 2010-Ohio-3265, 931 N.E.2d 558 (one-year suspension with six months stayed for 14 violations of the Canons of the former Code of Judicial Conduct and two violations of the Disciplinary Rules for misconduct involving improper investigation of a defendant, undignified language toward counsel, failure to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant, improper remarks from the bench about county commissioners, use of his position as a judge to obtain access to a prosecutor\u2019s file, and improperly placing a defendant in a holding cell) and <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Ferreri, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 649, 710 N.E.2d 1107 (1999) (18-month license suspension with 12 months stayed for multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>violations of the Canons of the former Code of Judicial Conduct and the Disciplinary Rules for making false statements to the media on three separate occasions. Judge Ferreri had said that the opinion of a court of appeals was \u201cpolitical\u201d and had been written and made by a law clerk. He also claimed that a juvenile center\u2019s staff \u201croutinely\u201d beat inmates, that the administrative judge was engaged in a conspiracy to \u201ccover up\u201d the beatings, and that a juvenile judge and a court administrator were the \u201cmost entrenched and incompetent bureaucrats at the courthouse\u201d and had lied to federal government officials).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AMP\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Robert R. Berger, Senior Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">{\u00b6 26} The board found, and we agree, that Judge Elum\u2019s misconduct does not rise to the level of Judge Ferreri\u2019s and was closer to Judge Campbell\u2019s. But Judge Elum\u2019s violations were neither as numerous nor as persistent as those committed by Judge Campbell. <em>Campbell </em>involved nine counts of misconduct compared to the two counts here, and therefore, a lesser sanction is justified. Moreover, the combination of aggravating and mitigating factors present in this case, as well as Judge Elum\u2019s acknowledgement of the wrongful nature of his conduct, warrants a less severe sanction than that imposed in <em>Campbell. </em>However, as in <em>Hoague, </em>in which the judge also received a six-month fully stayed suspension, Judge Elum\u2019s understandably strong feelings about the arresting officer\u2019s conduct in the Farnsworth case \u201c \u2018do not excuse a judge from complying with the judicial canons and the Disciplinary Rules.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hoague, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 324, 725 N.E.2d 1108, quoting <em>Ferreri, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 654, 710 N.E.2d 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">{\u00b6 27} Based upon the foregoing, we conclude that the sanction recommended by the board is reasonable and appropriate. Accordingly, Judge Edward Joseph Elum is hereby suspended from the practice of law in the state of Ohio for six months, with the entire six-month suspension stayed on the condition that he commit no misconduct during the suspension. If Judge Elum fails to meet this condition, the stay will be lifted and Judge Elum will serve the entire six-month suspension. Costs are taxed to Judge Elum.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b785-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b785-9\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"ARqU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>George D.
