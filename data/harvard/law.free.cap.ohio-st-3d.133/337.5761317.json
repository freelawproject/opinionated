We dismiss as untimely those portions of his appeal that challenge the court of appeals\u2019 judgments dated January 13 and March 5, 2012. <em>See </em>S.Ct.Prac.R. 2.2(A)(1)(a) (\u201cTo perfect an appeal from a court of appeals to the Supreme Court, other than in a certified conflict case, which is addressed in S.Ct.Prac.R. 4.1, the appellant shall file a notice of appeal in the Supreme Court within forty-five days from the entry of the judgment being appealed\u201d). McGrath\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motions for relief from judgment did not extend his time to appeal the court of appeals\u2019 judgment denying the writs of mandamus and prohibition and declaring him to be a vexatious litigator. <em>State ex rel. Manuel v. Stenson, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 52, 2010-Ohio-2673, 930 N.E.2d 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">{\u00b6 2} In addition, insofar as McGrath timely challenges the court of appeals\u2019 April 10, 2012 judgment denying his second Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment, we affirm the judgment because McGrath used the motion to raise claims that he could have raised in a timely appeal from the judgment denying the writs. McGrath could not use Civ.R. 60(B) as a substitute for a timely appeal. <em>Id.; State ex rel. Albourque v.
