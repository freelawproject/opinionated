Blanchester, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 287, 2012-Ohio-780, 964 N.E.2d 414. There, we held that property owners asserting a regulatory-taking claim lack standing to bring a mandamus action against a municipality to compel appropriation when the affected property is outside the municipality\u2019s corporate limits. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 24 and 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">{\u00b6 2} In this appeal, we are presented with a more complex question. The appellants here are property owners who allege that a foreign municipality rezoned land that lies in the municipality, but that is also adjacent to their property in another municipality, for the benefit of private enterprise rather than public health. They allege violations of due process and equal protection, as well as a regulatory taking for which they are entitled to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">{\u00b6 3} Consistent with our decision in <em>Clifton, </em>we hold that the property owners do not have standing to bring a mandamus action to compel a municipality to appropriate property outside the municipality\u2019s jurisdiction. But, for the reasons that follow, we hold that the property owners do have standing to bring a declaratory-judgment action to challenge the constitutionality of the ordinances. Accordingly, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court for additional proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">{\u00b6 4} Because the claims were resolved on motions to dismiss for lack of standing and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, we accept as true all material allegations in the appellants\u2019 complaint and construe all reasonable inferences in their favor. <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 501, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975); <em>Mitchell v. Lawson Milk Co., </em>40 Ohio St.3d 190, 192, 532 N.E.2d 753 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">{\u00b6 5} Appellants, Lori A. and Matthew E. Moore (\u201cthe property owners\u201d), own property in Monroe, Ohio, that is adjacent to a parcel of property that lies wholly in Middletown, Ohio. The Middletown property, known as the Martin-Bake property, is central to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">{\u00b6 6} The Martin-Bake property includes 157 acres of land. Before August 2008, the Martin-Bake property was zoned only for low-density residential use. Although one side of the parcel abuts space zoned for industrial use, the Martin-Bake property is largely bordered by nonindustrial properties, such as residential housing, a church, a school, and a nursing facility. But through two enactments, Ordinance No. 02008-63 and Ordinance No. 02008-64, Middletown rezoned the Martin-Bake property into a general industrial zone and revised a setback provision that had required all industrial activities to be 600 feet from the property line, eliminating that requirement for activities that are \u201cincidental or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>ancillary\u201d to the manufacturing process. By doing so, Middletown permitted the Martin-Bake property to be transformed dramatically.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">{\u00b6 7} A general industrial zone in Middletown, called an \u201c1-2 District,\u201d is \u201cintended to accommodate those industrial uses which cannot entirely eliminate certain objectionable features and influences, but which must, nevertheless, be accommodated within the urban area.\u201d Middletown Zoning Code 1258.01. As an 1-2 District, the Martin-Bake property could be used for a wide array of pursuits, including the manufacturing, compounding, processing, packaging, or assembly of electric and gas appliances, as well as the manufacturing of acid, asphalt, bleach, concrete, helium, hydrogen, insecticides, lye, oxygen, \u201cpoison of any kind,\u201d radium, \u201csoda ash or caustic soda or similar chemical products,\u201d fuel briquettes, fertilizers, gelatin, animal glue, turpentine, rubber, and soap. Middle-town Zoning Code 1258.02(b)(1), (3), (4), and (10). It also could house a foundry, junk yard, or power-generating station. Middletown Zoning Code 1258.02(b)(5) and (c)(4) and (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">{\u00b6 8} The property owners, however, allege that the ordinances cleared the way for construction of a coke plant that would be owned and operated by SunCoke Energy for the benefit of AK Steel Corporation, one of Middletown\u2019s biggest employers. Ordinance No. 02008-64 makes clear that the ordinance is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">an emergency measure to make immediately available additional developable industrial land in the City, and necessary for the immediate preservation of the public health, safety and general welfare, to wit: to permit the development of a proposed project on the property which would stabilize the security of over two-thousand jobs in the City and create new jobs in the City, thereby increasing the City\u2019s tax base.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">{\u00b6 9} Following the enactment of the ordinances, the property owners brought suit alleging that the rezoning ordinances were not for the benefit of the public, were \u201carbitrary, capricious, unreasonable and unconstitutional,\u201d ignored the \u201ccoke plant\u2019s close proximity to both a school and a nursing home, as well as the serious pollution produced by such [a] plant resulting in the substantial impairment of public health and safety of persons, as well as the drastic diminution in value of surrounding low intensity residentially zoned property.\u201d In addition, they alleged that Middletown had passed the ordinance as an emergency measure \u201cfor the purpose of denying citizens of Middletown who opposed such unlawful legislation the opportunity to vote on such action pursuant to referendum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">{\u00b6 10} The complaint sought both a declaratory judgment and a writ of mandamus. The property owners requested a declaration that the ordinances are arbitrary, capricious, and unconstitutional and violate the Due Process and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 16. In their request for a writ of mandamus, they claimed that Middletown\u2019s action constituted a taking of their private property and unlawfully deprived them of \u201cproperty rights consistent with their investment backed expectations,\u201d and entitled them to compensation for the taking. Thus, they claimed, Middletown had a clear legal duty to commence appropriation proceedings pursuant to R.C. Chapter 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">{\u00b6 11} Middletown moved to dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(1) and (6), asserting that the appellants lacked standing to bring their claims, that they failed to state claims upon which relief could be granted, and that the common pleas court lacked jurisdiction over the claims. After briefing and a hearing, the trial court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">{\u00b6 12} On the issue of standing, the trial court ruled that R.C. 2721.03 confers standing on the property owners to bring a declaratory-judgment action because they are persons affected by the municipal ordinance. Notably, the trial court expressly rejected Middletown\u2019s assertion that the property owners lacked standing to bring their due process and equal protection claims against Middletown because their property is in Monroe. It wrote, \u201cthis Court does not find that a jurisdictional boundary extinguishes Plaintiffs\u2019 standing to bring the instant action. In the present case, the Plaintiffs have alleged a legally protected interest in the rezoning of the Martin-Bake property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">{\u00b6 13} Instead, the trial court held that the property owners\u2019 claims failed because although they \u201cmake a broad allegation that Defendant\u2019s zoning is unconstitutional as it has no relation to the health, safety or welfare of the City of Middletown,\u201d they had not alleged sufficient facts to overcome the presumption that the ordinances are constitutional. Thus, the court concluded that they failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">{\u00b6 14} Turning to the takings claim, the court held that the claim must fail because the regulation was not directed at the property owners\u2019 property, and thus no regulation burdened that property. And it held that even if there had been a taking, mandamus to appropriate the land was unavailable as a matter of law because Middletown could not appropriate land outside its jurisdictional limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">{\u00b6 15} On the property owners\u2019 appeal, the court of appeals heard arguments and then ordered supplemental briefs on the issue of standing. <em>Moore v. Middletown, </em>12th Dist. No. CA2009-08-205, 2010-Ohio-2962, 2010 WL 2573817. A divided panel affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling. In so doing, however, it held that the property owners lacked standing to bring their claims, without distinguishing between the declaratory-judgment and mandamus claims. The court of appeals recognized that the complaint was both for a declaratory judgment and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>writ of mandamus, but decided the standing issue based solely on R.C. 2721.03, which, the court held, merely represents a legislative grant of jurisdiction to Ohio courts to hear declaratory-judgment actions. Whether a particular party has standing to sue is a separate question not answered by the statute. The court held that a nonresident contiguous property owner has no standing to bring an action against an adjacent political subdivision seeking compensation for rezoning property located solely within the political subdivision\u2019s boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">{\u00b6 16} Because of its broad holding that there was no standing, the court of appeals recognized that it did not need to reach any other issue in the appeal. But it nevertheless proceeded, ultimately holding that dismissal was proper even if the property owners had standing. With respect to the due process and equal protection claims, it relied on the property owners\u2019 allegation that the ordinances had been enacted for the benefit of AK Steel Corporation. The court characterized that allegation as an \u201cadmission that the ordinances were passed for the benefit of one of Middletown\u2019s most prominent employers,\u201d which in turn was a basis for finding that the ordinances were not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">{\u00b6 17} It then held that no regulatory taking had occurred because the property owners alleged only a diminution in value of their property. And like the trial court, it held that a municipality cannot appropriate property beyond its jurisdictional boundary. It concluded that even if the property owners had standing, the court did not err in dismissing their complaint because they failed to state claims upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">{\u00b6 18} We accepted the property owners\u2019 discretionary appeal soon after accepting the discretionary appeal in <em>Clifton. </em>See <em>Moore v. Middletown, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 1616, 2010-Ohio-5101, 935 N.E.2d 854; <em>Clifton v. Blanchester, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 1597, 2010-Ohio-4928, 935 N.E.2d 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">{\u00b6 19} We adhere to our holding in <em>Clifton </em>and affirm the appellate court\u2019s conclusion that the property owners lack standing to assert a mandamus claim for appropriation of land outside the territorial limits of a municipality. But that holding does not control the analysis of the property owners\u2019 other constitutional claims. For the reasons that follow, we hold that they do have standing to assert the due process and equal protection claims in the declaratory-judgment action and, accordingly, reverse the portion of the appellate court\u2019s judgment that held otherwise. We remand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">\n<em>Standing Generally</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">{\u00b6 20} Standing determines \u201c \u2018whether a litigant is entitled to have a court determine the merits of the issues presented.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Teamsters Local </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>Union No. 436 v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>132 Ohio St.3d 47, 2012-Ohio-1861, 969 N.E.2d 224, \u00b6 10, quoting <em>Ohio Contrs. Assn. v. Bicking, </em>71 Ohio St.3d 318, 320, 643 N.E.2d 1088 (1994). Whether a party has established standing to bring an action before the court is a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. State, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 59, 2006-Ohio-6499, 858 N.E.2d 330, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">{\u00b6 21} In <em>Clifton, </em>we set forth Ohio\u2019s general law on standing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">\u201cIt is well established that before an Ohio court can consider the merits of a legal claim, the person seeking relief must establish standing to sue.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers v. Sheward </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 451, 469, 715 N.E.2d 1062. \u201c \u2018Standing\u2019 is defined at its most basic as \u2018[a] party\u2019s right to make a legal claim or seek judicial enforcement of a duty or right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ohio Pyro, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 375, 2007-0hio-5024, 875 N.E.2d 550, \u00b627, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 1442. \u201c \u2018 \u201c[T]he question of standing depends upon whether the party has alleged such a \u2018personal stake in the outcome of the controversy * * * \u2019 as to ensure that \u2018the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of judicial resolution.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State ex rel. Dallman v. Franklin Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1973), 35 Ohio St.2d 176, 178-179, 64 O.O.2d 103, 298 N.E.2d 515, quoting <em>Sierra Club v. Morton </em>(1972), 405 U.S. 727, 732, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636, quoting <em>Baker v. </em>Carr (1962), 369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663, and <em>Flast v. Cohen </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 83, 101, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\"><em>Clifton, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 287, 2012-Ohio-780, 964 N.E.2d 414, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">{\u00b6 22} To succeed in establishing standing, plaintiffs must show that they suffered (1) an injury that is (2) fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct, and (3) likely to be redressed by the requested relief. <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). These three factors \u2014 injury, causation, and redressability \u2014 constitute \u201cthe irreducible constitutional minimum of standing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560; <em>see also Sheward, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 469-470, 715 N.E.2d 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">{\u00b6 23} It is well settled that standing does not depend on the merits of the plaintiffs contention that particular conduct is illegal or unconstitutional. Rather, standing turns on the nature and source of the claim asserted by the plaintiffs. <em>Warth, </em>422 U.S. at 500, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343. We therefore move from the law of standing generally to the law of standing that is specific to the property owners\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>\n<em>Standing for Regulatory Takings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">{\u00b6 24} We first address the property owners\u2019 standing to bring a mandamus action to compel Middletown to appropriate their land and compensate them for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">{\u00b6 25} As we recognized in <em>Clifton, </em>\u201cIn the context of the regulatory-taking jurisprudence, whether a regulation constitutes a taking depends in large part upon the degree to which the regulation burdens private property.\u201d <em>Id., </em>131 Ohio St.3d 287, 2012-Ohio-780, 964 N.E.2d 414, \u00b6 19. The greater the burden a regulation imposes upon private property, the more likely it is that the regulation will constitute a regulatory taking. <em>State ex rel. Shelly Materials, Inc. v. Clark Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 337, 2007-Ohio-5022, 875 N.E.2d 59, \u00b6 17. If the burden the zoning imposes becomes too great, a total taking may occur. <em>See, e.g., State ex rel. Gilmour Realty, Inc. v. Mayfield Hts., </em>119 Ohio St.3d 11, 2008-Ohio-3181, 891 N.E.2d 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">{\u00b6 26} But in order to establish standing to make a regulatory-taking claim, the plaintiff bears a heightened burden. As the Supreme Court explains,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">When * * * a plaintiffs asserted injury arises from the government\u2019s allegedly unlawful regulation (or lack of regulation) of <em>someone else, </em>much more is needed. In that circumstance, causation and redressability ordinarily hinge on the response of the regulated (or regulable) third party to the government action or inaction \u2014 and perhaps on the response of others as well. The existence of one or more of the essential elements of standing \u201cdepends on the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the courts and whose exercise of broad and legitimate discretion the courts cannot presume either to control or to predict,\u201d <em>ASARCO, Inc. v. Kadish, </em>490 U.S. 605, 615, 109 S.Ct. 2037, 104 L.Ed.2d 696 (1989) * * *, and it becomes the burden of the plaintiff to adduce facts showing that those choices have been or will be made in such manner as to produce causation and permit redressability of injury. Thus, when the plaintiff is not himself the object of the government action or inaction he challenges, standing is not precluded, but it is ordinarily \u201csubstantially more difficult\u201d to establish. <em>Allen [v. Wright], </em>468 U.S. [737], 758, 104 S.Ct. [3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-9\"><em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 561-562,112 S.Ct. 2130,119 L.Ed.2d 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">{\u00b6 27} Under this \u201csubstantially more difficult\u201d standard, causation and redressability are critical, if not dispositive, determinations. For example, in <em>Clifton, </em>we intimated that the property owner had not sufficiently alleged causation. <em>See Clifton, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 287, 2012-Ohio-780, 964 N.E.2d 414, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u00b6 31. But essential to our holding was the fact that the property owner could not establish that his mandamus claim would provide him with redress for any injury he suffered, because Ohio law holds that a municipality has no authority to appropriate property outside its jurisdictional limits. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 29; <em>Britt v. Columbus, </em>38 Ohio St.2d 1, 309 N.E.2d 412 (1974), paragraph one of the syllabus (holding that there is no power of eminent domain beyond the geographical limits of the municipality under the Ohio Constitution, Article XVIII, Section 3). Thus, we held that the property owner could not establish redressability, and in turn, standing. <em>Clifton </em>at \u00b6 27-29, 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">{\u00b6 28} On the authority of <em>Clifton, </em>we affirm the portion of the appellate court\u2019s judgment holding that the property owners in this cause have no standing to bring their partial takings claim because mandamus will not lie to compel Middletown to appropriate property in Monroe. <em>B\u00f1tt. </em>But the court of appeals was far too expansive in holding that <em>Clifton </em>controlled all of the property owners\u2019 claims. It does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">{\u00b6 29} In fact, we expressly cautioned in <em>Clifton </em>that the decision should not be construed too broadly beyond the facts and posture of that case. As we said in concluding that opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">Applying our holding to the facts of this case, we conclude that Clifton lacks standing to bring a takings claim against the village. However, we emphasize that we do not hold that an adjoining property owner may never have standing. Instead, we hold that a property owner lacks standing under the facts and circumstances presented here. The zoning at issue applies to J &amp; M\u2019s property, not Clifton\u2019s. Therefore, the zoning imposes no limitation on Clifton\u2019s use of his property whatsoever. Further, the alleged diminution in value of Clifton\u2019s property is not a direct result of the village\u2019s zoning, but instead is caused by J &amp; M\u2019s use of its property, as allowed by the rezoning. Finally, the rezoning that changed part of J &amp; M\u2019s property from \u201cbusiness industrial\u201d to \u201cgeneral industrial\u201d merely expanded a similar, existing, permitted use. Under these particular facts, we hold that there is an insufficient nexus between the rezoning of J &amp; M\u2019s property and the alleged diminution in value of Clifton\u2019s adjacent property to indicate that Clifton is a proper party to bring a regulatory-taking claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">Furthermore, because Clifton\u2019s property is outside the village limits, the village has no authority to appropriate his property for an alleged regulatory taking. Accordingly, Clifton also has no redressable claim against the village for a regulatory taking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number><em>Clifton, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 287, 2012-Ohio-780, 964 N.E.2d 414, at \u00b6 30-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">{\u00b6 30} Despite the breadth of wording in Clifton\u2019s syllabus, we make clear that that decision does not stand for the proposition that a property owner always lacks standing to bring a mandamus claim against a municipality when the affected property is outside the municipality\u2019s corporate limits. Rather, <em>Clifton </em>must be understood in conjunction with the unique facts and circumstances upon which it rests, <em>see State ex rel. Shelly Materials v. Clark Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 337, 2007-Ohio-5022, 875 N.E.2d 59, \u00b6 28-29, including the fact that it was a mandamus claim against a foreign municipality by a property owner who attempted to challenge the rezoning of contiguous land from one industrial use to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">{\u00b6 31} Having clarified the scope of <em>Clifton, </em>we hold that it applies in full force to the mandamus portion of the property owners\u2019 complaint (count two), which seeks a writ to compel Middletown to appropriate property in Monroe and compensation for the appropriation. Accordingly, we affirm the portion of the appellate court\u2019s holding that held that the property owners lacked standing to bring that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">{\u00b6 32} But as set forth below, there are critical differences between <em>Clifton </em>and the property owners\u2019 other constitutional claims. We hold that those claims are not foreclosed on standing grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">\n<em>Standing to Challenge Zoning Decisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">{\u00b6 33} Our precedent already makes clear that when a municipality rezones a property, the owner of the adjacent property has standing to challenge the constitutionality of the zoning decision if the property owner lives in the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">{\u00b6 34} In <em>Midwest Fireworks Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Deerfield Twp. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 174, 179, 743 N.E.2d 894 (2001), we held that a plaintiff whose property was adjacent to property that had been rezoned to permit a fireworks manufacturer to construct a large building was an aggrieved person within the meaning of R.C. 519.15 and thus had standing to appeal the township\u2019s decision to permit construction. There, a township zoning inspector issued Midwest Fireworks a zoning certificate permitting it to build a new structure on a site that had been destroyed by a fire 15 years earlier. <em>Id. </em>at 175-176. The owner of the property directly across a two-lane highway from Midwest Fireworks\u2019 property appealed to the board of zoning appeals, which ruled in his favor and revoked the certificate. <em>Id. </em>at 176. Midwest Fireworks appealed to the court of common pleas, which affirmed. <em>Id. </em>But the court of appeals subsequently reversed that decision, reasoning that the property owner did not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>standing. <em>Id. </em>at 176-177. We disagreed and concluded that the risks inherent in the business created a real and serious threat to property and persons, including the property owner, and that he thus was an aggrieved person within the meaning of R.C. 519.15 and had standing to appeal the township\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 178-179.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">{\u00b6 35} We recognize that <em>Midwest Fireworks </em>concerned an administrative appeal rather than a declaratory-judgment action. But either vehicle is an appropriate means to challenge a zoning resolution, and we find its rationale instructive in cases in which property owners allege that their rights are adversely affected by a zoning ordinance targeting adjacent property. <em>See Joseph Airport Toyota, Inc. v. Vandalia, </em>2d Dist. No. 18904, 2002 WL 313158 (Mar. 1, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">{\u00b6 36} In so holding, we are particularly cognizant of the fundamental rights at issue in property-use cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">{\u00b6 37} The rights to acquire, use, enjoy, and dispose of property are among the most revered in our nation\u2019s law and traditions and are integral to our theory of democracy and notions of liberty. <em>Norwood v. Homey, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 353, 2006-Ohio-3799, 853 N.E.2d 1115, \u00b6 34.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">[T]he founders of our state expressly incorporated individual property rights into the Ohio Constitution in terms that reinforced the sacrosanct nature of the individual\u2019s \u201cinalienable\u201d property rights, Section 1, Article I, which are to be held forever \u201cinviolate.\u201d Section 19, Article I.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">(Footnote omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">{\u00b6 38} Zoning ordinances directly affect, and often limit, property owners\u2019 rights. In most cases, those limitations are proper. But it must be remembered that a government\u2019s authority to intrude on the individual\u2019s right to property by enacting zoning ordinances is predicated on the proper use of police powers, for the public welfare. <em>Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., </em>272 U.S. 365, 387, 47 S.Ct. 114, 71 L.Ed. 303 (1926). Property owners in Ohio therefore have the right to bring cases contesting the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance, including claims that the government action is clearly arbitrary and unreasonable and has no substantial relation to public health or safety. <em>Goldberg Cos., Inc. v. Richmond Hts. City Council, </em>81 Ohio St.3d 207, 690 N.E.2d 510 (1998). <em>See also Mayfield-Dorsh, Inc. v. S. Euclid, </em>68 Ohio St.2d 156, 161, 429 N.E.2d 159 (1981) (\u201ca successful declaratory judgment challenge must demonstrate, beyond fair debate, that the zoning classification is unconstitutional, unreasonable and not substantially related to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>{\u00b6 39} Here, the property owners are attempting to do just that \u2014 mount a challenge to Middletown\u2019s zoning ordinance based on the property owners\u2019 belief that the ordinance rezoning the Martin-Bake property is unconstitutional (i.e., it violates their due process and equal protection rights), unreasonable, and not substantially related to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. The question before us in this appeal is whether they have <em>standing </em>to do so, not whether they will succeed in their efforts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">{\u00b6 40} In so holding, our touchstone is respect for the revered constitutional principles that protect the people\u2019s rights to acquire, enjoy, use, and dispose of property. Courts honor the people and their Constitution by giving careful consideration to property owners\u2019 challenges to the propriety of government actions that affect their property. We will not limit property owners\u2019 standing to raise constitutional claims simply because our law prevents them from raising a takings claim or because they face a difficult battle in marshalling sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption that the ordinance is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">{\u00b6 41} Our holding today comports with our understanding of the reverence for property rights in our Constitution and case law, as well as the experience and wisdom of our sister courts, which have previously reached the same issue and concluded that standing is extant.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">{\u00b6 42} The seminal case on this subject, <em>Cresskill v. Dumont, </em>15 N.J. 238, 104 A.2d 441 (1954), is particularly instructive and helpful. There, more than 50 years ago, the New Jersey Supreme Court rejected the view that a municipality\u2019s responsibility for zoning halts at the municipal boundary lines. <em>Id. </em>at 247. It held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>[at] the very least [the municipality] owes a duty to hear any residents and taxpayers of adjoining municipalities who may be adversely affected by proposed zoning changes and to give as much consideration to their rights as they would to [its own] residents and taxpayers * * *. To do less would be to make a fetish out of invisible municipal boundary lines * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">{\u00b6 43} <em>Cresskill </em>quickly became the dominant view and was adopted by an array of diverse state courts. <em>See Scott v. Indian Wells, </em>6 Cal.3d 541, 99 Cal.Rptr. 745, 492 P.2d 1137 (1972) (holding that nonresident property owners had standing to challenge a conditional-use permit issued by a neighboring city because the property owners\u2019 land was adjacent to the lot subject to the conditional-use permit); <em>Adams Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. Thornton, </em>629 P.2d 605 (Colo.1981) (en banc) (city has standing to challenge rezoning of land adjacent to city property). <em>See also Hamelin v. Wallingford Zoning Bd., </em>19 Conn.Supp. 445, 117 A.2d 86 (1955); <em>Whittingham v. Woodridge, </em>111 Ill.App.2d 147, 249 N.E.2d 332 (1969); <em>Koppel v. Fairway, </em>189 Kan. 710, 371 P.2d 113 (1962); <em>Allen v. Coffel, </em>488 S.W.2d 671 (Mo.App.1972); <em>Dahman v. Ballwin, </em>483 S.W.2d 605 (Mo.App. 1972); <em>Bagley v. Sarpy Cty., </em>189 Neb. 393, 202 N.W.2d 841 (1972); <em>Roselle Park v. Union Twp., </em>113 N.J.Super. 87, 272 A.2d 762 (1970). The <em>Cresskill </em>view continues to be applied by state courts. <em>See, e.g., Smagula v. Hooksett, </em>149 N.H. 784, 789, 834 A.2d 333 (2003) (\u201c[0]wners of property, wherever located, may contest a decision made by a municipality\u2019s zoning board of adjustment or planning board so long as they have a \u2018sufficient interest\u2019 in the outcome\u201d); <em>Provco Partners v. Limerick Twp. Zoning Hearing Bd., </em>866 A.2d 502 (Pa. Commw.2005) (holding that a municipal line has no effect on the status of a property owner as a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d by the treatment of property in another municipality).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">{\u00b6 44} The weight of authority remains in accord with <em>Cresskill, </em>and we now adopt it as well. We decline to limit standing to residents of the municipality that zoned or rezoned the land. Walls do not separate our political subdivisions. We hold that property owners whose property is adjacent to property rezoned by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>foreign municipality may use a declaratory-judgment action to challenge the constitutionality of the zoning action. Several reasons compel this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">{\u00b6 45} First, the declaratory-judgment chapter of the Revised Code broadly authorizes plaintiffs to bring actions for a declaration of \u201crights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.\u201d R.C. 2721.02. It is well settled that \u201c[a]ctions for declaratory judgment may be predicated on constitutional or nonconstitutional grounds.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Ohio Civ. Serv. Emps. Assn., AFSCME, Local 11, AFL-CIO v. State Emp. Relations Bd., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 122, 2004-Ohio-6363, 818 N.E.2d 688, \u00b6 13. And we have previously addressed declaratory-judgment actions in which plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of a municipality\u2019s zoning decision, including arguments that the municipality\u2019s ordinance did not establish legitimate interests. <em>See, e.g., Shemo v. Mayfield Hts., </em>88 Ohio St.3d 7, 10, 722 N.E.2d 1018 (2000). <em>See also State ex rel. Shemo v. Mayfield Hts., </em>96 Ohio St.3d 379, 2002-0hio-4905, 775 N.E.2d 493, \u00b6 1, 10. As the trial court in this case correctly recognized, \u201c \u2018[pjersons whose property rights are directly affected by a statute or ordinance are entitled to obtain a declaratory determination as to the validity of the statute or ordinance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moore v. Middletown, </em>Butler C.P. No. CV 2008 09 4191, at 5, quoting <em>Wilson v. Cincinnati, </em>171 Ohio St. 104, 108, 168 N.E.2d 147 (1960). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">{\u00b6 46} In so holding, we observe that \u201c[a] primary purpose of the declaratory-judgment action is to serve the useful end of disposing of uncertain or disputed obligations quickly and conclusively.\u201d <em>Ohio Farmers Indemn. Co. v. Chames, </em>170 Ohio St. 209, 213, 163 N.E.2d 367 (1959). It is in the interest of all parties, as well as the public, that zoning decisions are resolved as expeditiously as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">{\u00b6 47} Second, and judges are cautioned to remember, standing is not a technical rule intended to keep aggrieved parties out of court. \u201c \u2018Rather, it is a practical concept designed to insure that courts and parties are not vexed by suits brought to vindicate nonjusticiable interests and that judicial decisions which may affect the rights of others are forged in hot controversy, with each view fairly and vigorously represented.\u2019\u201d <em>Fort Trumbull Conservancy, L.L.C. v. Alves, </em>262 Conn. 480, 486, 815 A.2d 1188 (2003), quoting <em>Maloney v. Pac, </em>183 Conn. 313, 320, 439 A.2d 349 (1981). Here, we cannot say that those principles were honored.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">{\u00b6 48} The court of appeals in this case asserted that R.C. 2721.03 merely represents a legislative grant of jurisdiction to Ohio courts to hear declaratory-judgment actions and that the statute does not answer the separate question of whether the plaintiff has standing to sue. Although it is true that R.C. Chapter 2721 is the legislative source of a cause of action for declaratory relief, we do not necessarily agree that the statute does not confer standing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, standing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>can be created by legislation. <em>Middletown v. Ferguson, </em>25 Ohio St.3d 71, 75, 495 N.E.2d 380 (1986). But aside from whether the statute itself confers standing, our cases make clear that we are generous in considering whether a party has standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">{\u00b6 49} Our precedent also makes clear that declaratory relief is available to a plaintiff who can show that (1) a real controversy exists between the parties, (2) the controversy is justiciable, and (3) speedy relief is necessary to preserve the rights of the parties. <em>Haig v. Ohio State Bd. of Edn., </em>62 Ohio St.3d 507, 511, 584 N.E.2d 704 (1992); <em>Burger Brewing Co. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm., </em>34 Ohio St.2d 93, 97, 296 N.E.2d 261 (1973). Courts have the duty to ensure that plaintiffs plead these elements for purposes of declaratory-judgment actions and that the complaint sufficiently avers injury, causation, and redressability. Thus, our generosity is tempered by an insistence on sufficiency in the pleadings. If a party fails to establish any of the necessary showings to bring the claims, the judge must dismiss the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">{\u00b6 50} Judges begin with the presumption that a zoning ordinance is constitutional. <em>Cent. Motors Corp. v. Pepper Pike, </em>73 Ohio St.3d 581, 583-584, 653 N.E.2d 639 (1995). But that presumption is rebuttable.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cThe Courts of this country have been extremely zealous in preventing the constitutional rights of citizens being frittered away by regulations passed by virtue of the police power.\u201d <em>Cincinnati v. Cornell, </em>141 Ohio St. 535, 539, 49 N.E.2d 412 (1943).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">Respecting, as we do, the legislative authority of the city council and its right to determine what ordinances shall be passed, yet when an act of such body is challenged we must determine whether the act conforms to rules of fundamental law designed to curb and check the unwarranted exercise of unreasonable and arbitrary power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">{\u00b6 52} If a property owner challenging the ordinance proves, beyond fair debate, that the ordinance is \u201cclearly arbitrary and unreasonable and without substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the community,\u201d the court must declare the ordinance unconstitutional. <em>Goldberg Cos., Inc. v. Richmond Hts. City Council, </em>81 Ohio St.3d 207, 214, 690 N.E.2d 510 (1998). \u201cWhere the amendment of a zoning ordinance is clearly an arbitrary and unreasonable action on the part of the city council and not authorized or contemplated by the zoning statute, it is of no force and effect.\u201d <em>Clifton Hills Realty Co. v. Cincinnati, </em>60 Ohio App. 443, 450, 21 N.E.2d 993 (1938), citing <em>Michigan-Lake Bldg. Corp. v. Hamilton, </em>340 Ill. 284, 172 N.E. 710 (1930). And</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">[i]f the landowner has challenged the constitutionality of zoning and also alleged that it constitutes a taking of the property, the case is terminated if the zoning is found to be unconstitutional, because the landowner is free of the zoning that restricted the use of the land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-8\"><em>Goldberg Cos. </em>at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">{\u00b6 53} Thus, the property owners clearly have the potential for a remedy separate and apart from mandamus relief. Because they have a potential remedy, the dissent is mistaken in its conclusion that the property owners cannot establish sufficient redressability to have standing to bring their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">{\u00b6 54} The trial court properly found that the allegations of the complaint based on equal protection and due process theories pleaded a real, justiciable controversy over zoning regulations enacted by Middletown that affected the plaintiffs\u2019 rights within the meaning of R.C. 2721.03. As our opinion makes clear, the property owners cannot succeed in a mandamus claim. But we also make clear that it is too soon to tell whether their other constitutional claims are viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">{\u00b6 55} In so holding, we intimate no opinion on the merits of the property owners\u2019 due process, equal protection, and police-power claims. We simply hold that the property owners have a right to pursue discovery on those claims. If they are not able to marshal facts to support their theories, summary judgment\u2014 not a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim \u2014 is an appropriate way to resolve the declaratory-judgment action in an efficient, fair manner. We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals to the extent that it held that the property owners did not establish standing to bring their due process and equal protection claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">{\u00b6 56} We hold that property owners whose property is adjacent to property rezoned by a foreign municipality may use a declaratory-judgment action to challenge the constitutionality of the zoning action if the owner pleads that he has suffered an injury caused by the rezoning that is likely to be redressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">{\u00b6 57} Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals in part and reverse it in part, and we remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b348-8\">Pfeifer, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b348-9\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-8\">. We must indulge all reasonable inferences from the complaint in favor of the property owners. <em>Worth, </em>422 U.S. at 501, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343. Upon reviewing the property owners\u2019 complaint, it is clear that in addition to the takings claim the complaint asserts claims that Middletown enacted the ordinances in violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the federal and Ohio Constitutions and that Middletown did not enact the ordinances through the valid exercise of police power for the benefit of the public, but rather, did so for the benefit of one of its corporate community members. The dissent conflates the property owners\u2019 claims for a taking with their claims that the government acted unconstitutionally and unreasonably. It is unfairly reductionist to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Although the two claims are related, they are pleaded in separate counts and governed by separate constitutional theories and separate analyses of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">We intimate no opinion on the validity of the property owners\u2019 assertions. We simply hold that at this preliminary stage in the proceedings, we cannot say, as a matter of law, that Middletown\u2019s boundaries shield it from <em>all </em>of the property owners\u2019 constitutional claims and that there is no constitutional theory that will ultimately afford them relief. Those questions are for another day, in another appeal, after the property owners are given an opportunity to prove their claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b344-8\">.

Grove City, </em>486 F.Supp.2d 696 (S.D.Ohio 2007). Rather, the ease turned on whether the plaintiffs \u2014 corporate taxpayers who challenged a tax abatement program for hotels\u2014 demonstrated that they had suffered a cognizable injury. That court properly noted that the declaratory-judgment statute created the right to bring the action, but did not \u201ccreate the appropriate plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 700, citing <em>Walgash v. Monclova Twp. Bd. of Trustees, </em>6th Dist. No. L-80-105,1981 WL 5518, *4 (\u201cWhile R.C. 2721.03 creates the right to bring a declaratory-judgment action to determine the validity of an ordinance, the requirements of justiciability, including standing and ripeness, must still be met before a court can entertain the action\u201d). The court ultimately denied standing to the plaintiffs in <em>AaHi Hospitality </em>because it found that the only alleged injury upon which they relied \u2014 that the tax abatement gave Aarti a grossly unfair competitive advantage in the local hotel market \u2014 was insufficient as a matter of law. Because no injury was alleged, there was no standing. Nothing we have said here, or in <em>Clifton, </em>is to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b348-10\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"APH\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">{\u00b6 58} I concur in judgment in part with respect to holding that property owners do not have standing to bring a mandamus action to compel a municipality to appropriate property outside the municipality\u2019s jurisdiction. But I dissent from the majority\u2019s creation of new law in holding that the nonresident property owners in this case have standing to bring a declaratory-judgment action to challenge another municipality\u2019s ordinances on due process and equal protection grounds. I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that these constitutional claims survive.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">{\u00b6 59} It is difficult to see how the majority can hold that the Moores have standing to challenge ordinances by way of a declaratory-judgment action when the majority also holds that there has been no taking, i.e., no injury that may be redressed. In disposing of the claim for a writ of mandamus, the majority follows the principle that \u201c[a] property owner lacks standing to bring a regulatory-taking claim against a municipality when the affected property is outside the municipality\u2019s corporate limits.\u201d <em>Clifton v. Blanchester, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 287, 2012-0hio-780, 964 N.E.2d 414, syllabus. <em>Clifton </em>thus prohibits use of a mandamus action to force Middletown to undertake proceedings to compensate the Moores for an appropriation of their property. Although the majority holds that there can be no taking under the rule of <em>Clifton, </em>it permits nonresidents\u2019 use of a declaratory-judgment action to challenge the constitutionality of ordinances of another municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>{\u00b6 60} The issue of standing turns on the nature and source of the claim asserted by the plaintiffs. <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 500, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). The first cause of action of the complaint sets forth the constitutional claims regarding the ordinance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">For its First Cause of Action, Plaintiffs/Relators state that the CITY OF MIDDLETOWN\u2019S action in the rezoning of the Martin/Bake property was arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, and unconstitutional as applied to said property, having no substantial relation to, nor the substantial advancement of, the public health, safety, and welfare of said City, and that the effect of such action upon Plaintiffs/Relators\u2019 property violates the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">{\u00b6 61} With regard to this cause of action, the Moores asked that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">the Court render declaratory judgment declaring that the CITY OF MIDDLETOWN\u2019S rezoning of the Martin/Bake property and the amendment of the setback ordinance are arbitrary, unreasonable and unconstitutional as applied to Plaintiffs/Relators\u2019 property, having no substantial relation to public health, safety and welfare.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cA declaratory judgment action lies when a party challenges a zoning ordinance as it applies to a specific parcel of property to proscribe the owner\u2019s proposed use of the property.\u201d <em>Karches v. Cincinnati, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 12, 16, 526 N.E.2d 1350 (1988). \u201cThe overall constitutionality of a zoning ordinance as applied to a particular parcel of property is the central question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the Moores have not alleged that the rezoning and setback ordinances were directed to their property, and thus they lack standing to challenge them. At most, the Moores have pled a potential diminishment in the value of their property as a result of Middletown\u2019s rezoning. The majority cites an example of an adjacent property owner who was held to have standing to object to rezoning in an administrative appeal. <em>Midwest Fireworks Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Deerfield Twp. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 174, 179, 743 N.E.2d 894 (2001). But the case is distinguishable not only because the issue was whether the complainant had standing to appeal to a township board of zoning appeals as a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d under R.C. 519.15, but also because it did not involve a declaratory-judgment action. Its rationale does'not apply to the appellants in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>{\u00b6 63} The Moores do not reside in Middletown, pay no city taxes, do not vote in city elections, and are not subject to the city\u2019s jurisdiction. I cannot see how they have asserted a redressable injury in order to claim a due process or equal protection violation. The ordinance is \u201capplied to\u201d property in which they have no interest. An enactment or amendment of a zoning ordinance by a city is the exercise of a legislative power that belongs exclusively to the governing body of the city. The corollary is that only those who are legally a part of the city may participate in that process. The parties cite no cases in which a court has sanctioned an effort to confer upon nonresident, legally disinterested individuals the right to participate in the legislative process of a city in enacting a local law. A plaintiff challenging municipal legislation must show that he is \u201cwithin the purview of [the] ordinance or will be affected by its operation.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Brown, </em>13 Ohio St.2d 53, 55, 233 N.E.2d 584 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">{\u00b6 64} I also do not believe that the Moores have shown that they have standing to challenge the ordinance through a declaratory-judgment action.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">[Sjtanding to attack the constitutionality of a legislative enactment exists only where a litigant \u201chas suffered or is threatened with <em>direct and concrete injury in a manner or degree different from that suffered by the public in general, </em>that the law in question has caused the injury, and that <em>the relief requested will redress the injury.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">(Emphasis added.) <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. State, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 59, 2006-Ohio-6499, 858 N.E.2d 330, \u00b6 22, quoting <em>State ex rel. Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers v. Sheward, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 451, 469-470, 715 N.E.2d 1062 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">{\u00b6 65} R.C. 2721.03 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">[A]ny person whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a * * * municipal ordinance * * * may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under the * * * ordinance * * * and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations under it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">{\u00b6 66} In their claim for declaratory relief, the Moores failed to plead any direct and concrete injury that is different in kind or in degree from that suffered by the public in general. Instead, they simply assert that Middletown failed to follow proper procedures in adopting the zoning ordinance. Specifically, they have pled that Middletown failed to consider disadvantages of the rezoning as required by a Middletown ordinance; that the rezoning generally fails to advance the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare; that the rezoning fails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>adhere to common, accepted land-use locational principles; and that Middletown violated a setback requirement codified in an existing Middletown ordinance. In their declaratory-judgment action, the Moores do not allege that Middletown\u2019s failure to properly enact the zoning ordinance affects them in any unique, concrete way. Instead, they generally assert that Middletown\u2019s actions, as applied to the Martin-Bake property, violate the Moores\u2019 constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. If it in fact occurred, this violation is a general one, affecting the rights of all residents of Middletown, and is not sufficient to confer standing upon the Moores.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">{\u00b6 67} We have held that \u201csurrounding property owners\u201d have no legal interest in the outcome of a declaratory-judgment action challenging the constitutionality of zoning as applied to another parcel of real property. <em>Driscoll v. Austintoum Assoc., </em>42 Ohio St.2d 263, 273, 328 N.E.2d 395 (1975) (\u201csurrounding property owners <em>may have a practical interest </em>in the outcome of a declaratory judgment action attacking the constitutionality of zoning as it applies to a specific parcel of property, but they <em>have no legal interest </em>in the outcome\u201d (Emphasis added.)). While the Moores may have a practical interest in the land surrounding their property, they have not alleged a legal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">{\u00b6 68} The majority cites <em>Cresskill v. Dumont, </em>15 N.J. 238, 104 A.2d 441 (1954), as the seminal case on this area of the law. Notably, <em>Cresskill </em>does not stand for the proposition that nonresidents have standing to bring declaratory-judgment actions challenging municipal zoning ordinances. Instead, it provides that municipalities have the duty to give nonresidents who may be adversely affected by proposed zoning changes an opportunity to be heard and to give due consideration to those nonresidents. <em>Id. </em>at 247. The Moores do not allege that Middletown denied them the opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">{\u00b6 69} The majority further cites the Ohio cases of <em>Goldberg Cos., Inc. v. Richmond Hts. City Council, </em>81 Ohio St.3d 207, 214, 690 N.E.2d 510 (1998), and <em>Clifton Hills Realty Co. v. Cincinnati, </em>60 Ohio App. 443, 450, 21 N.E.2d 993 (1938), as support for its assertion that the Moores have potential for a declaratory remedy. These cases are factually distinct from the present one. Both <em>Goldberg Cos. </em>and <em>Clifton Hills Realty </em>arose from zoning challenges brought by the owners of the affected property, not nonresident landowners. No Ohio decision until today has granted nonresidents standing to challenge a municipality\u2019s zoning laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">{\u00b6 70} In essence, this case represents an anticipatory nuisance claim in reaction to the coke plant proposed for the Martin-Bake property. While any landowner can sympathize with the situation the Moores find themselves in, sympathy is not sufficient to grant the Moores standing that is otherwise unprecedented in Ohio law. While there are potentially multiple pre- and post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>rezoning methods for addressing any potential damage to the Moores\u2019 property arising from the potential coke plant, a declaratory-judgment action against Middletown is not one of them. By allowing nonresidents to bring a declaratory-judgment claim that could potentially result in the overturning of municipal zoning ordinances that have the approval of the residents of the municipality, the majority opens the gates to perhaps numerous challenges to zoning ordinances by nonresidents. It is my belief that the Moores have no legally protected rights that have been affected by the Middletown ordinances. I respectfully dissent and would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals dismissing this case in its entirety under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) for lack of standing and failure to state a claim.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ADl\">Jay C.
