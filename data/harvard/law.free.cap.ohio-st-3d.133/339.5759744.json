Ebbing, appeals from a judgment denying his request for a writ of quo warranto to oust appellee, Belinda Ricketts, from the office of fiscal officer of the village of New Miami, Ohio, and to reinstate him to that office. Ebbing also contests certain rulings on various motions in the quo warranto case and an award of reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred by Ricketts in responding to Ebbing\u2019s motion for declaratory judgment. We affirm the judgment denying the writ of quo warranto and most of the challenged rulings on various motions in the case, reverse the judgment awarding reasonable attorney fees and expenses, and remand the cause for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">{\u00b6 2} In December 2005, the New Miami Village Council ratified the mayor\u2019s appointment of Ebbing as the village fiscal officer. In June 2006, the village council confirmed the mayor\u2019s reappointment of Ebbing as the New Miami fiscal officer to serve indefinitely. The resolutions specified that Ebbing\u2019s service as fiscal officer \u201cshall be in accordance with Ohio Revised Code 733.262(D)[,] which provides that the village fiscal officer may be removed without cause either by the mayor with the consent of a majority of the members of the village legislative authority or by a three-fourths vote of the village legislative authority with or without the consent of the mayor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">{\u00b6 3} In January 2008, Patti J. Hanes became mayor of New Miami. As a result of an investigation by the state auditor, Hanes discovered that Ebbing had failed to properly perform his duties as village fiscal officer by, among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>things, authorizing checks that resulted in overpayment to him for holiday overtime hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">{\u00b6 4} At a January 17, 2008 village council meeting, the council voted four to two to pass a resolution terminating Ebbing\u2019s employment as fiscal officer without cause pursuant to the most recent village resolution appointing Ebbing and R.C. 733.262. The village council\u2019s action was precipitated by Mayor Hanes\u2019s desire to fire Ebbing. Following the council\u2019s vote, the mayor advised Ebbing that he was done, asked the sheriffs deputy to escort him from the meeting and out of the building, and changed the locks on Ebbing\u2019s office, refusing to let Ebbing return.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">{\u00b6 5} On February 25, 2008, Mayor Hanes appointed appellee, Belinda Ricketts, as the new village fiscal officer. The village council confirmed the mayor\u2019s appointment of Ricketts.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">{\u00b6 6} On January 18, 2011, Ebbing filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Butler County for a writ of quo warranto ousting Ricketts from the office of New Miami fiscal officer and reinstating him as village fiscal officer. After Ricketts filed a motion for summary judgment and the parties submitted evidence, the court of appeals granted Ricketts\u2019s motion and denied the writ. The court of appeals also awarded Ricketts $1,231.93 for reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred by her in responding to Ebbing\u2019s motion for declaratory judgment and memorandum in support.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">{\u00b6 7} This cause is now before the court on Ebbing\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">\n<em>Quo Warranto</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">{\u00b6 8} Quo warranto is the exclusive remedy to litigate the right of a person to hold a public office. <em>State ex rel. Johnson v. Richardson, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 120, 2012-Ohio-57, 961 N.E.2d 187, \u00b6 15. \u201cTo be entitled to the writ of quo warranto, the relator must establish that the office is being unlawfully held and exercised by respondent and that relator is entitled to the office.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Zeigler v. Zumbar, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 240, 2011-Ohio-2939, 951 N.E.2d 405, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">{\u00b6 9} Mayor Hanes and the New Miami Village Council fired Ebbing without cause pursuant to R.C. 733.262(D), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-12\">The village fiscal officer may be removed without cause either by the mayor with the consent of a majority of the members of the village legislative authority or by a three-fourths vote of the village legislative authority with or without the consent of the mayor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>{\u00b6 10} Ebbing asserts that because Mayor Hanes did not remove him from office before the vote of less than three-fourths of the New Miami Village Council, he was not properly removed from office pursuant to R.C. 733.262(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">{\u00b6 11} We agree, however, with the court of appeals that Ebbing\u2019s assertion relies \u201cupon a distinction without a difference\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">It is not important whether the support of a majority of council came before or after the mayor\u2019s decision to terminate; what is important is that a majority of council supported the mayor\u2019s decision. Because the mayor and a majority of council supported [Ebbing\u2019s] removal, he is not entitled to the office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">{\u00b6 12} It is uncontroverted that the mayor decided to remove Ebbing as village fiscal officer and that a majority of council members approved of that decision. The mayor then effectuated the removal of Ebbing from the office by ordering his physical removal from the building, barring his return, and appointing Ricketts to the vacant office. Under these circumstances, the court of appeals properly held that Ebbing could not establish either that the office of village fiscal officer is being unlawfully held by Ricketts or that Ebbing is entitled to the office. Therefore, the denial of the requested extraordinary relief in quo warranto was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">\n<em>Motions to Strike</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">{\u00b6 13} Ebbing claims that the court of appeals erred in its rulings on various motions to strike filed by the parties. The determination of a motion to strike is within the court\u2019s broad discretion. <em>State ex rel. Dawson v. Bloom-Carroll Local School Dist., </em>131 Ohio St.3d 10, 2011-Ohio-6009, 959 N.E.2d 524, \u00b6 23. A court\u2019s ruling on a motion to strike will be not reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State ex rel. Mora v. Wilkinson, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 272, 2005-Ohio-1509, 824 N.E.2d 1000, \u00b6 10. A decision constitutes an abuse of discretion when it is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>State ex rel. Striker v. Cline, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 214, 2011-Ohio-5350, 957 N.E.2d 19, \u00b6 11. For the reasons that follow, the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in its challenged rulings on the motions to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">{\u00b6 14} First, the court of appeals properly denied Ebbing\u2019s motion to strike Ricketts\u2019s Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss. Although the motion was untimely because it was filed after Ricketts filed an answer, the court of appeals could have treated the motion as a Civ.R. 12(C) motion for judgment on the pleadings. <em>See Whaley v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>92 Ohio St.3d 574, 581, 752 N.E.2d 267 (2001) (\u201cA Civ.R. 12(C) motion for judgment on the pleadings has been character<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>ized as a belated Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Holloman v. Phillips, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 70, 2003-Ohio-5063, 796 N.E.2d 524, \u00b6 8, fn. 3 (respondent-appellee\u2019s \u201cbelated Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion should have been treated as a Civ.R. 12(C) motion for judgment on the pleadings\u201d). And although the motion was ultimately denied as lacking merit, the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in determining that it need not be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">{\u00b6 15} Second, the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in granting Ricketts\u2019s motion to strike Ebbing\u2019s reply to Ricketts\u2019s answer and Ebbing\u2019s agreed statement of facts. Notwithstanding R.C. 2733.12, which allows a plaintiff in a quo warranto action to file a reply to an answer, Civ.R. 7(A) specifies that \u201c[n]o other pleading shall be allowed, except that the court may order a reply to an answer or a third-party answer.\u201d <em>See State ex rel. Yeagley v. Harden, </em>68 Ohio St.3d 136, 137, 624 N.E.2d 702 (1993) (court applies Rules of Civil Procedure to quo warranto actions notwithstanding the \u201carchaic pleading references * * * contained in R.C. 2733.12\u201d). And Ebbing\u2019s filing titled \u201cAgreed statement of facts and or stipulation of facts\u201d was never agreed to by Ricketts.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">{\u00b6 16} Third, the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in denying Ebbing\u2019s motion to strike Ricketts\u2019s motion for summary judgment, affidavits, and exhibits. Ricketts\u2019s motion was properly filed and supported by Civ.R. 56(C) evidence. As the court of' appeals concluded, \u201c[t]he existence of opposing affidavits and allegations is not cause for striking a motion for summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">{\u00b6 17} Fourth, the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in denying Ebbing\u2019s motion to strike Ricketts\u2019s motion to quash Ebbing\u2019s subpoenas issued to current and former village council members and Mayor Hanes, or in the alternative, to stay the depositions until a determination of Ricketts\u2019s pending motion for summary judgment and Ebbing\u2019s motion for sanctions against Ricketts\u2019s counsel for filing the motion to quash. Ebbing did not establish that Ricketts\u2019s motion was, as he argued in the court of appeals, \u201cimpertinent, folly, false, and a sham.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">{\u00b6 18} Therefore, we affirm the court of appeals\u2019 rulings on the parties\u2019 motions to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">\n<em>Motion to Stay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">{\u00b6 19} Ebbing next claims that the court of appeals erred in granting Ricketts\u2019s motion to stay the depositions noticed by Ebbing until Ricketts\u2019s summary-judgment motion was resolved. Trial court decisions on discovery matters like this are generally reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>State v. Morris, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 337, 2012-Ohio-2407, 972 N.E.2d 528, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>{\u00b6 20} A review of the pertinent factors supports the court of appeals\u2019 stay. The length of the delay was minimal \u2014 less than seven months elapsed from the time that the court of appeals granted the stay until the court granted summary judgment. Ricketts, unlike Ebbing, had neither sought nor been granted any prior continuances, and she did not contribute to any delay. The additional discovery requested by Ebbing was unnecessary to resolve Ricketts\u2019s pending summary-judgment motion. <em>See State ex rel. Sawyer v. Cuyahoga Cty. Dept. of Children &amp; Family Servs., </em>110 Ohio St.3d 343, 2006-Ohio-4574, 853 N.E.2d 657, \u00b610.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">{\u00b6 21} Therefore, the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in granting the requested stay of discovery pending its resolution of Ricketts\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>See Thomson v. Ohio Dept. of Rehab. &amp; Corr., </em>10th Dist. No. 09AP-782, 2010-Ohio-416, 2010 WL 438138, \u00b6 32 (\u201cA trial court acts within its discretion when it grants a stay of discovery pending the resolution of a dispositive motion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">\n<em>Motion for Declaratory Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">{\u00b622} Notwithstanding Ebbing\u2019s argument to the contrary, the court of appeals acted properly by not granting his motion for declaratory judgment. \u201c[C]ourts of appeals lack original jurisdiction over claims for declaratory judgment.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Shimko v. McMonagle, </em>92 Ohio St.3d 426, 430, 751 N.E.2d 472 (2001); <em>State ex rel. Ministerial Day Care Assn. v. Zelman, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 347, 2003-Ohio-6447, 800 N.E.2d 21, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">\n<em>Award of Reasonable Attorney Fees and Expenses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">{\u00b6 23} Finally, Ebbing asserts that the court of appeals erred in granting Ricketts\u2019s request for an award of reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred by her in responding to Ebbing\u2019s motion for declaratory judgment and memorandum in support and in awarding Ricketts $1,231.93 in fees and expenses. Ebbing is incorrect when he claims that Ricketts never requested an award of attorney fees and expenses. She specifically requested such an award pursuant to Civ.R. 11 in her motion to strike Ebbing\u2019s motion for declaratory judgment and memorandum in support.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">{\u00b6 24} Nevertheless, in cases in which Civ.R. 11 sanctions are imposed, courts have held that an evidentiary hearing is required. <em>See generally Bikkani v. Lee, </em>8th Dist. No. 89312, 2008-Ohio-3130, 2008 WL 2536983, \u00b6 31 (\u201cif an arguable basis exists for an award of sanctions under Civ.R. 11, a trial court must hold a hearing on the motion\u201d); <em>T.M. v. J.H., </em>6th Dist. Nos. L-10-1014 and L-10-1034, 2011-Ohio-283, 2011 WL 320910, \u00b6 98 (\u201cIt is an abuse of discretion to award attorney fees [under Civ.R. 11 and R.C. 2323.51] without [an evidentiary] hearing\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number><em>Burnett v. Burnett, </em>11th Dist. No. 2010-A-0035, 2011-Ohio-2839, 2011 WL. 2415389, \u00b6 26.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ArHl\">Joseph P. Ebbing, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ATR\">Schroeder, Maundrell, Barbiere &amp; Powers, Lawrence E. Barbiere, and Scott A. Sollmann, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">{\u00b6 25} Because Ricketts sought and was granted an award of fees and expenses pursuant to Civ.R. 11, the court of appeals erred in imposing sanctions under the rule without holding an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">{\u00b6 26} Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals denying the requested extraordinary relief in quo warranto and its rulings on the parties\u2019 motions to strike, Ricketts\u2019s motion to stay discovery, and Ebbing\u2019s motion for declaratory judgment. Because there was no evidentiary hearing, we reverse the portion of the judgment of the court of appeals awarding Ricketts $1,231.93 in attorney fees and expenses incurred by her in responding to Ebbing\u2019s motion for declaratory judgment and memorandum in support, and we remand the cause to the court of appeals for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b622-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
