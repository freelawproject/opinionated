Castro v. Corrigan, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 342, 2011-Ohio-4059, 952 N.E.2d 497, \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-13\">{\u00b6 3} Muhammad claims on appeal that an internal prison policy prevented him from personally enclosing the required prison cashier\u2019s statement with his petition when it was sent to the clerk of the court of appeals for filing, and thus any error must have been made by prison officials. Muhammad waived this argument on appeal, however, by failing to specifically raise this claim in his objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision in the court of appeals. <em>State ex rel. Maroon v. Ohio State Hwy. Patrol Retirement Sys., </em>132 Ohio St.3d 287, 2012-Ohio-2679, 971 N.E.2d 918, \u00b6 2, citing Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)(iv) and Loc.R. 12(M)(1) of the Tenth District Court of Appeals; <em>see also </em>Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)(ii) (\u201cAn objection to a magistrate\u2019s decision shall be specific and state with particularity all grounds for objection\u201d). Nor did Muhammad present any evidence in the court of appeals supporting this contention. <em>See State ex rel. Wells v. Jefferson Cty.
