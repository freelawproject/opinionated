For the reasons that follow, we hold that because upgrading involves construction and design, such upgrading is a governmental, not a proprietary, function. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals that holds otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">{\u00b6 2} Appellees, Barbara Coleman and Robert Coleman, own real property in Rootstown, Ohio. They sued appellant, the Portage County Engineer, complaining that their property was flooded in 1982, 1989, 2003, 2005, and 2009 and the water caused damage to their real and personal property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Colemans averred, \u201con information and belief,\u201d that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-11\">the flooding is a result of the defendant collecting drainage water from drainage ditches along State Route 44 in Rootstown, and discharging same through a piping system that runs across the adjacent Rootstown Public School System. The piping system is unable to accommodate all the drainage water, and accordingly the water overflows from the culverts in front of and behind the plaintiffs [sic] residence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">They further alleged that their property will continue to be flooded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-13\">due to the fact that the defendant has neglected or failed to construct a drainage plan or water drainage system to properly discharge the water and prevent it from collecting on the plaintiffs [sic] property and causing significant damages. The defendant also has failed to maintain the piping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>system that runs through the adjacent Rootstown Public School property to the storm sewer next to the Property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Whether Portage County has improperly maintained the storm sewers or failed to appropriately upgrade them has not been investigated. At oral argument, the parties agreed that the cause of the storm-sewer backup is unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">{\u00b6 3} The first count of the Colemans\u2019 complaint alleges that Portage County \u201cbreached the duty of due care owed to the plaintiffs in designing, constructing and maintaining the water piping system that collects and discharges water on the plaintiffs property.\u201d The Colemans also asserted that \u201c[defendant has been notified on numerous occasions that they [sic] created a nuisance causing flooding upon plaintiffs [sic] property, and defendant has refused, continues to refuse, and has been unwilling to abate the nuisance and resolve the repetitive flooding on the plaintiffs [sic] property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">{\u00b6 4} The second count pleaded that \u201cthe defendants [sic] be directed to make modifications to the water piping system that is necessary to protect the plaintiff [sic] from further flooding\u201d and that \u201cthe court enjoin defendant, and require the defendant to install adequate pipes and culverts, in order to prevent future and continued damage from flooding to plaintiffs\u2019 property by defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">{\u00b6 5} The Portage County Engineer moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the Colemans had \u201cfailed to show that the [county engineer] is not immune from their claims\u201d and \u201chave failed to show that they have pled sufficient facts to show negligent maintenance of the pipeline.\u201d The county engineer asserted that even assuming that the drainage system was improperly designed, constructed, or installed, he is entitled to immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744, which addresses political-subdivision liability for torts. The trial court agreed, holding, \u201cThe Portage County Engineer is immune from litigation based upon claims for negligent planning, design, and construction of the water pipelines referred to the in the Plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">{\u00b6 6} On the Colemans\u2019 appeal from that order, the Eleventh District Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part. In affirming in part, the court wrote, \u201c[The Colemans] argue that the trial court erred in dismissing their claim in Count I alleging negligent design, planning, and construction of the pipeline based on political-subdivision immunity because, they suggest, this claim alleged the negligent performance of a proprietary function, which is an exception to political subdivision immunity pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(B)(2). However, [the Colemans] fail to cite any authority for the proposition that the design, planning, or construction of a sewer system is a proprietary function, in violation of App. R. 16(A)(7). Moreover, [the Colemans] present no argument that the same constitutes a proprietary function, in violation of the same appellate rule. For this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>reason alone, [the Colemans\u2019] argument is not well taken.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Portage Cty. Engineer, </em>191 Ohio App.3d 32, 2010-Ohio-6255, 944 N.E.2d 756, \u00b6 18 (11th Dist.).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">{\u00b6 7} The court of appeals also relied on its own precedent, <em>Moore v. Streetsboro, </em>11th Dist. No. 2008-P-0017, 2009-Ohio-6511, 2009 WL 4756421, \u00b6 42, in holding that the county engineer cannot be held liable in tort in this case. Applying R.C. Chapter 2744, which immunizes certain governmental functions, including the decision whether to upgrade inadequate sewers, from tort liability, the court held that upgrading storm sewers is a governmental function. <em>Coleman </em>at \u00b6 20. Therefore, the Portage County engineer \u201cis immune from liability for [his] alleged failure to design and construct an adequate storm-sewer system.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">{\u00b6 8} Nevertheless, the court of appeals agreed with the Colemans that their claim was not barred by political-subdivision immunity to the extent that the county had negligently maintained the sewer system. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 32. For this holding, the court relied on <em>Moore </em>and R.C. 2744.01(G)(2)(d), which includes as a political subdivision\u2019s proprietary function the \u201cmaintenance, destruction, operation, and upkeep of a sewer system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">{\u00b6 9} We accepted the Portage County Engineer\u2019s discretionary appeal, <em>Coleman v. Portage Cty. Engineer, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 1458, 2011-Ohio-1829, 945 N.E.2d 522, which asserts a single proposition of law: \u201cA political subdivision\u2019s failure to upgrade the capacity of an inadequate sewer system is not a proprietary function within the meaning of R.C. 2744.01(G)(2)(d) so as to subject a political subdivision to liability under R.C. 2744.02(B)(2). The upgrade of sewer system capacity is an immune governmental function under R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(i). (R.C. 2744.01(G)(2)(d) and R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(i) interpreted and applied).\u201d We agree that upgrading a sewer system is construction and design, not upkeep, and accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">\n<em>Ohio\u2019s Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. Chapter 2744, Ohio\u2019s Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act, has been in place for more than 25 years and confers broad immunity on the state\u2019s political subdivisions. R.C. 2744.02(A)(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-11\">Except as provided in division (B) of this section, <em>a political subdivision is not liable in damages in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to person or property </em>allegedly caused by any act or omission of the political subdivision or an employee of the political subdivision <em>in connection with a governmental or proprietary function.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">{\u00b6 11} But the legislature has imposed exceptions to this general rule. Relevant here is the exception in R.C. 2744.02(B)(2), which declares that as a rule,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by the negligent performance of acts by their employees <em>with respect to proprietary functions of the political subdivisions.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">{\u00b6 12} R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(1) identifies as a governmental function \u201cthe provision or nonprovision, planning or design, construction, or reconstruction of a public improvement, including, but not limited to, a sewer system,\u201d making these responsibilities immune from political-subdivision liability. By contrast, R.C. 2744.01(G)(2)(d) identifies \u201cthe maintenance, destruction, operation, and upkeep of a sewer system\u201d as a proprietary function for which civil liability may attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">{\u00b6 13} We often have interpreted and explained the purpose of this statutory scheme:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-10\">\u201c[T]he protections afforded to political subdivisions and employees of political subdivisions by this act are urgently needed in order to ensure the continued orderly operation of local governments and the continued ability of local governments to provide public peace, health, and safety services to their residents.\u201d Am.Sub.H.B. No. 176, Section 8, 141 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1733. We noted in <em>Hubbell [v. Xenia], </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N.E.2d 878, that \u201c \u2018[t]he manifest statutory purpose of R.C. Chapter 2744 is the preservation of the fiscal integrity of political subdivisions.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 23, quoting <em>Wilson v. Stark Cty. Dept. of Human Servs. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 450, 453, 639 N.E.2d 105.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-11\"><em>Summerville v.

Early resolution of the issue of whether a political subdivision is immune from liability pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2744 is beneficial to both of the parties. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>appellate court holds that the political subdivision is immune, the litigation can come to an early end, with the same outcome that otherwise would have been reached only after trial, resulting in a savings to all parties of costs and attorney fees. Alternatively, if the appellate court holds that immunity does <em>not </em>apply, that early finding will encourage the political subdivision to settle promptly with the victim rather than pursue a lengthy trial and appeals. Under either scenario, both the plaintiff and the political subdivision may save the time, effort, and expense of a trial and appeal, which could take years.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) [Hubbell] at \u00b6 25, quoting <em>Burger v. Cleveland Hts. </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 188, 199-200, 718 N.E.2d 912 (Lundberg Stratton, J., dissenting).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><em>Summerville, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">{\u00b6 15} Our legislature has generally shielded political subdivisions from tort liability. <em>Greene Cty.

But that immunity is not absolute, and one exception to immunity is the political subdivision\u2019s \u201cmaintenance, destruction, operation, and upkeep of a sewer system,\u201d which is identified as a proprietary function. R.C. 2744.01(G)(2)(d). R.C. 2744.02(B)(2) provides that political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or property loss caused by the subdivision\u2019s employees\u2019 \u201cnegligent performance with respect to proprietary functions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">{\u00b6 16} With the statutory framework in mind, we turn to the specific issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\n<em>Governmental Function or Proprietary Function?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c \u2018Functions which can be categorized as either governmental or proprietary * * * are clearly intended for use as a guide in determining whether, in a particular case, the activity attributed to a subdivision falls with the ambit of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spitzer v. Mid Continent Constr. Co., Inc., </em>8th Dist. No. 89177, 2007-Ohio-6067, 2007 WL 3377212, \u00b6 18, quoting <em>Franks v. Sandusky Bd. of Trustees, </em>6th Dist. No. S-91-18, 1992 WL 66561, *3 (Mar. 31, 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">{\u00b6 18} The question is whether failure to keep a storm-sewer system functional is a \u201cdesign, construction, or reconstruction * * * [of] a sewer system\u201d and therefore a governmental function that is immunized from tort lawsuits under R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(1), or sewer \u201cmaintenance, * * * operation, and upkeep\u201d under R.C. 2744.01(G)(2)(d), a proprietary function for which political-subdivision tort liability is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">{\u00b6 19} Our courts of appeals have developed a body of law holding that subdivisions are immune from claims that flow from the design and construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>of a sewer system. <em>Spitzer </em>at \u00b6 20 (\u201cOhio courts have found that municipalities are immune from suit when flooding to private property was a result of an improperly designed sewer that was inadequate to handle increased storm runoff\u2019). <em>See also Ferguson v. Breeding, </em>4th Dist. No. 99 CA 22, 2000 WL 1234262, *6 (Aug. 25, 2000). Reviewing the Colemans\u2019 claims for relief, the court of appeals held, \u201c Tt is clear that the city is immune from its failure to design and construct an adequate sewer system.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coleman, </em>191 Ohio App.3d 32, 2010-Ohio-6255, 944 N.E.2d 756, \u00b6 19, quoting <em>Moore, </em>2009-Ohio-6511, 2009 WL 4756421, \u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">{\u00b6 20} To the extent that the court of appeals in this case held that the county enjoyed immunity for the claims arising from the Colemans\u2019 assertions that the county was negligent in the design, planning, and construction, we affirm. But we disagree with the appellate court\u2019s reasoning in holding that the Colemans\u2019 claims of failure to upgrade the sewer system were not barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">{1121} In so holding, the court of appeals rejected the county\u2019s assertion that a \u201cnegligent-maintenance claim necessarily refers to a failure to install a larger pipeline system,\u201d which is a governmental function. <em>Coleman, </em>191 Ohio App.3d 32, 2010-Ohio-6255, 944 N.E.2d 756, \u00b6 44. It held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">\u201cIf, indeed, the city is responsible for that pipeline, then \u2018the failure to upgrade sewers that are inadequate to service upstream property owners despite sufficient notice of the inadequacy can be best be described as a failure to maintain or upkeep the sewer.\u2019 <em>H. Hafner &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Cincinnati Metropolitan Sewer Dist. </em>(1997), 118 Ohio App.3d 792, 797 [694 N.E.2d 111]; see, also, <em>Hedrick v. Columbus </em>(Mar. 30, 1993), 10th Dist. Nos. 92AP-1030 and 92AP-1031 [1993 WL 104713]. \u2018If proven, this failure would constitute the breach of a duty arising out of a proprietary function and would expose the city to liability under R.C. 2744.02(B)(2).\u2019 * * * <em>Id.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-7\"><em>Coleman, </em>\u00b6 45, quoting <em>Moore, </em>2009-Ohio-6511, 2009 WL 4756421, \u00b6 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">{\u00b6 22} We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">{\u00b6 23} Initially, we observe that the General Assembly did not use the term \u201cupgrade\u201d in writing R.C. Chapter 2744. Courts must abstain from inserting words into a statute that were not placed there by the General Assembly. <em>State ex rel. Carna v. Teays Valley Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>131 Ohio St.3d 478, 2012-Ohio-1484, 967 N.E.2d 193, \u00b6 18, citing <em>State ex rel. Cassels v. Dayton City School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>69 Ohio St.3d 217, 220, 631 N.E.2d 150 (1994).

To upgrade means \u201c[t]o exchange a possession for one of greater value or quality; trade up.\u201d <em>American Heritage Unabridged Dictionary </em>1890 (4th Ed.2000). \u201cUpkeep,\u201d however, means \u201c[mjaintenance in proper operation, condition, and repair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our courts of appeals have recognized this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">{\u00b6 25} For example, in <em>Murray v. Chillicothe, </em>a landscaper sued the city after his foot fell through a storm-sewer grate located in a public street. The landscaper claimed that the grate had been poorly maintained. 164 Ohio App.3d 294, 2005-Ohio-5864, 842 N.E.2d 95, \u00b6 1, 3. He brought a negligence claim against the city, but the trial court granted summary judgment in the city\u2019s favor, holding that the city was immune from liability. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">{\u00b6 26} The Fourth District Court of Appeals affirmed, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">Murray argues that his injury occurred because of the city\u2019s failure to maintain the storm-sewer grate. The city disagrees, arguing that the injury stems from the design of the storm-sewer grate. It contends that Murray\u2019s injury occurred because of the width of the grate\u2019s openings, which is \u201csimply a matter of the design of the grate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">Webster\u2019s Dictionary defines \u201cmaintenance\u201d as the \u201cact of maintaining or state of being maintained.\u201d Webster\u2019s New College Dictionary (1999) 660. It defines \u201cmaintain\u201d as \u201cTo preserve or keep in a given existing condition, as of efficiency or good repair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The deposition testimony presented indicates that the accident in this case occurred because the openings in the storm-sewer grate were too wide. There is no evidence that the four-inch openings existed because the grate was in a state of disrepair. Rather, the evidence indicates that the grate was designed with four-inch openings. Because Murray\u2019s injury did not result from the catch-basin grate\u2019s being in a state of disrepair, we cannot say that this case involves the maintenance of a storm-sewer system. In most instances, the government\u2019s duty to maintain a structure does not include the duty to upgrade it to current construction standards. See <em>Treese v. Delaware </em>(1994), 95 Ohio App.3d 536, 543 [642 N.E.2d 1147], stating in the context of highways that maintenance involves only the preservation of existing facilities, and not the initiation of substantial improvements (but leaving unanswered the issue of whether maintenance may include upgrading where a nuisance condition has arisen). See, also, <em>Thomas v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>Sept. 30, 1993, Cuyahoga County Court of Appeals Case No. 62949, 1993 WL 389781, stating that the board had no duty to upgrade a highway median barrier as technology developed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">{\u00b6 27} The Fourth District recognized that injury resulting from an antiquated storm-sewer design has different legal significance from injury resulting from improper storm-sewer maintenance. The design, pursuant to R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(1), is a governmental function, and under R.C. 2744.02, no liability can attach to the political subdivision for obsolete design. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 18. Put another way, \u201ca private sewer system with a design flaw does not convert that design flaw into a maintenance responsibility.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">{\u00b6 28} The analysis in <em>Murray </em>is consistent with that in <em>Zimmerman v. Summit Cty., </em>9th Dist. No. 17610, 1997 WL 22588 (Jan 15, 1997). There, homeowners sued the county, alleging that the county had dumped sewage into a creek that ran through their property. <em>Id. </em>at *1. The county admitted that during severe rain storms, it pumped rain water and sewage from its sewer system into the creek to prevent sewage backups into basements. <em>Id. </em>at *2. It contended that \u201cperiodic pumping was necessary because the sewer system, as it was designed and constructed over twenty years before, could not handle all the rain water and sewage that currently pass through it\u201d and noted that it had a permit from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to pump the sewage into the stream. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">{\u00b6 29} The trial court rejected the county\u2019s claim of immunity, but the court of appeals reversed. It held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed injuries and losses * * * were not caused by [the county\u2019s] maintenance and operation of its sewer system. Unlike other cases in which Ohio courts have recognized that actions taken with respect to sewer systems were proprietary in nature, plaintiffs\u2019 claimed injuries and losses did not arise from [the county\u2019s] failure to repair damage to the system, to inspect it, to remove obstructions, or to remedy general deterioration. See <em>Doud v. Cincinnati </em>(1949), 152 Ohio St. 132 [87 N.E.2d 243] (city allegedly failed to detect deterioration of sewer system) and <em>Nice v. Marysville </em>(1992), 82 Ohio App.3d 109 [611 N.E.2d 468] (city faded to detect and repair damage to sewer system). Instead, they resulted from [the county\u2019s] original design and construction of the sewer system. As evidenced by [the county\u2019s environmental services director\u2019s] affidavit, [the county\u2019s] decision to pump sewage and rain water into the stream was a response to the sewer system\u2019s inability as designed and constructed to handle the volume of materials that currently pass through it. This was not a problem that [the county] could remedy through routine mainte<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>nance. It would require extensive redesigning and reconstructing of the system to meet current demands.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"AJc\">UAW-GM Legal Services Plan and Darrell D.

Portsmouth, </em>4th Dist. No. 09CA3325, 2010-Ohio-4837, 2010 WL 3852247] at \u00b6 32. But the complaint presents a design or construction issue if \u2018remedying a problem would require a [political subdivision] to, in essence, redesign or reconstruct the sewer system.\u2019 <em>Essman </em>at \u00b6 32-33.\u201d (Brackets sic.) <em>Guenther v.

We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">{\u00b6 31} Although creative, the Colemans\u2019 attempt to characterize their claims as ones based on maintenance fails. For purposes of R.C. Chapter 2744, a claim based on a failure to upgrade is a claim based on a failure of design and construction, for which political subdivisions enjoy immunity, and not a claim based on a failure to properly maintain, for which political-subdivision liability may be extant.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">{\u00b6 32} In so holding, we are not unmindful that damages suffered by homeowners like the Colemans can be devastating to property and possessions, as well as physical and mental health. But the same is true for many other claims for which immunity attaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">{\u00b6 33} And we recognize that property owners have little control over the quality of storm and sewer systems to which their homes are attached. But absent amendment to R.C. Chapter 2744 or other legislative action, relief does not lie in suits against political subdivisions based on a failure to upgrade the sewer system.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b315-11\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b315-12\">Pfeifer, J., dissents and would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"A8C\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Mazanec, Raskin &amp; Ryder Co., L.P.A., John T.
