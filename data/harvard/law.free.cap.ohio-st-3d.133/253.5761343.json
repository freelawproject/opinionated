Respondent, Deb Timmerman-Cooper, warden of the London Correctional Institution, countered that Hollingsworth\u2019s plea of no contest in the underlying criminal case constituted a waiver of his right to the effective assistance of counsel. Hollingsworth objected, arguing that under Ohio law, the state may not use his no-contest plea and resulting conviction against him, including using the plea as evidence that he waived his right to effective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-16\">{\u00b6 2} Finding that there was no controlling precedent on the admissibility of a no-contest plea in a habeas proceeding, the federal district court certified the following question for our resolution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-17\">Do Ohio R. Crim. P. 11(B)(2) and Ohio R. Evid. 410(A)(2), which prohibit the use of a defendant\u2019s no contest plea against the defendant \u201cin any subsequent civil * * * proceeding\u201d apply to prohibit the use of such a plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>in a subsequent ciyil proceeding which is a collateral attack on the criminal judgment which results from the no contest plea, such as a petition for post-conviction relief under Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2953.21, or a federal habeas corpus action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">(Ellipsis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">{\u00b6 3} Today we answer the question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">\n<em>Crim.R. 11(B)(2) and Evid.R. 110(A)(2)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">{\u00b6 4} Crim.R. 11(B)(2) states, \u201cThe plea of no contest is not an admission of defendant\u2019s guilt, but is an admission of the truth of the facts alleged in the indictment, information, or complaint, and the plea or admission shall not be used against the defendant in any subsequent civil or criminal proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">{\u00b6 5} Evid.R. 410(A)(2) states that evidence of a plea of no contest \u201cis not admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding against the defendant who made the plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">{\u00b6 6} In <em>Elevators Mut. Ins. Co. v. J. Patrick O\u2019Flaherty\u2019s, Inc., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 362, 2010-Ohio-1043, 928 N.E.2d 685, at \u00b6 14, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-12\">The purpose behind the inadmissibility of no-contest pleas in subsequent proceedings is to encourage plea bargaining as a means of resolving criminal cases by removing any civil consequences of the plea. <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Mapes, </em>19 Ohio St.3d [108] at 111, 19 OBR 318, 484 N.E.2d 140 [1985]; <em>Rose v. Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. </em>(C.A.10, 2000), 219 F.3d 1216, 1220. The rule also protects the traditional characteristic of the no-contest plea, which is to avoid the admission of guilt. Id. The prohibition against admitting evidence of no-contest pleas was intended generally to apply to a civil suit by the victim of the crime against the defendant for injuries resulting from the criminal acts underlying the plea. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Simansky </em>(1998), 45 Conn.Supp. 623, 628, 738 A.2d 231.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">{\u00b6 7} The purposes served by these two rules are of limited applicability in the present case. The present case involves a habeas action, not a civil suit by a victim. In postconviction proceedings, there is no risk of subsequent civil liability or even of enhanced criminal liability. The worst-case scenario for a defendant in a postconviction proceeding is the status quo.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>\n<em>Application of Crim.R. 11(B)(2) and Evid.R. ilO in Other Cases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">{\u00b6 8} In <em>State v. Mopes, </em>19 Ohio St.3d 108, 484 N.E.2d 140 (1985), the defendant, on trial for an Ohio murder, had pled \u201cnon vult,\u201d the equivalent of no contest, to an earlier murder charge in New Jersey. <em>Id. </em>at 111. In the Ohio proceeding, the trial court allowed police officers from New Jersey to testify that the defendant had been convicted of a murder in that state. <em>Id. </em>This evidence was introduced to establish a death specification pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). <em>Id. </em>This court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">Crim.R. 11(B)(2) and Evid.R. 410 prohibit only the admission of a no contest plea. These rules do not prohibit the admission of a conviction entered upon that plea when such conviction is made relevant by statute. The trial court was correct in admitting the evidence of the prior conviction as it was not equivalent to the admission of the no contest plea and it was not introduced by the prosecution for any purpose other than establishing the specification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">{\u00b6 9} In <em>Elevators Mut. Ins. Co., </em>a business was damaged by fire. 125 Ohio St.3d 362, 2010-Ohio-1043, 928 N.E.2d 685, \u00b6 3. One of the owners pled no contest to arson and insurance fraud and was convicted. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 5. The insurer brought an action seeking a declaration of no coverage and recovery of $30,000 advanced on the owners\u2019 claim. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 4. The trial court refused to allow the insurer to use the owner\u2019s plea of no contest against him on the basis that doing so would contradict the goal of Evid.R. 410. But the court held that the convictions based on the no-contest plea were admissible to prove that the owner had intentionally set the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">{\u00b6 10} The court of appeals reversed and remanded, rejecting the trial court\u2019s distinction between a no-contest plea and a conviction based on that plea. The court further held that the limited exception to inadmissibility in <em>Mopes </em>did not apply. The plea was inadmissible. This court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">{\u00b6 11} <em>Elevators Mut. </em>illustrates perfectly the intended application of Crim.R. 11(B)(2) and Evid.R. 410(A)(2). The result is in keeping with the goal of removing the civil consequences of a no-contest plea, thereby encouraging plea bargaining as a means of resolving criminal cases. It also preserves the traditional characteristic of the plea, which is to avoid an admission of guilt. Admission of the no-contest plea against the defendant in that case would have thwarted both goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>\n<em>Application of Crim.R. 11(B)(2) and Evid.R. IplO to This Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">{\u00b6 12} We turn now to a consideration of the applicability of the general rule barring the use of no-contest pleas in habeas corpus proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">{\u00b6 13} Respondent argues that a no-contest plea is admissible in the context of habeas corpus. She contends that a habeas action is not a \u201csubsequent civil or criminal proceeding\u201d within the meaning of Crim.R. 11(B)(2). Nor is it a proceeding distinct from the proceeding at which the petitioner pled no contest. Citing <em>State v. Lloyd, </em>8 Ohio App.2d 155, 156, 220 N.E.2d 840 (4th Dist.1966), respondent asserts that a habeas action is instead a collateral proceeding, a \u201ccontinuation of the criminal action itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">{\u00b6 14} Hollingsworth argues that the rules are unambiguous and therefore'not susceptible of interpretation. <em>Sears v. Weimer, </em>143 Ohio St. 312, 55 N.E.2d 413 (1944), paragraph five of the syllabus (\u201cAn unambiguous statute is to be applied, not interpreted\u201d). He asserts that the language of the two rules is sweeping and absolute and that <em>Elevators Mut. </em>controls the issue before us. Thus, neither the plea nor the resulting conviction is admissible in habeas as evidence of waiver of the right to effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">{\u00b6 15} At its core, a habeas action is a collateral attack on the underlying conviction. <em>Wall v. Kholi, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 131 S.Ct. 1278, 1284, 179 L.Ed.2d 252 (2011). In the instant case, the conviction was the result of a no-contest plea. To prohibit the state from using the no-contest plea to defend the validity of the conviction that resulted from the plea would render the state mute. The state has no defense if the no-contest plea is not in play. As noted earlier, the clear purposes of Crim.R. 11(B)(2) and Evid.R. 410(A)(2) are to encourage the use of plea bargaining by removing the civil consequences of the plea and to avoid an admission of guilt. Prohibiting the state from introducing evidence of a no-contest plea in a habeas action to show that the petitioner has waived his claim of ineffective counsel does nothing to advance those purposes, and permitting use of the plea does not frustrate them. The plea is not being used to impose liability on the petitioner or to prove his guilt. There is no risk of subsequent civil liability or even of enhanced criminal liability. The worst-case scenario for a defendant in a postconviction proceeding such as habeas corpus is the status quo. As we stated in <em>Mapes, </em>the purposes of the two rules \u201care not disserved\u201d here. 19 Ohio St.3d at 111, 484 N.E.2d 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">{\u00b6 16} We conclude that neither Crim.R. 11(B)(2) nor Evid.R. 410(A)(2) prohibits the use of a defendant\u2019s no-contest plea in a subsequent proceeding in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>the defendant collaterally attacks the criminal conviction that resulted from the no-contest plea.
