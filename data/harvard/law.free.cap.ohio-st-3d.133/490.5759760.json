(\u201cPPI\u201d) challenges the tax commissioner\u2019s decision to increase PPI\u2019s personal property tax assessments for 2004 and 2005. In amending the assessments, the commissioner recomputed the value of PPI\u2019s inventory based on the FIFO (first in, first out) accounting method rather than the LIFO (last in, first out) method, which PPI had used on its books. The Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d) affirmed the commissioner\u2019s amended assessments, and PPI\u2019s main contention here is that the commissioner lacked an individualized evidentiary basis for issuing and upholding the amended assessments against PPI. As a result, the assessments were, in PPI\u2019s view, illegal and did not invoke a presumption of validity at the BTA. Additionally, PPI challenges the BTA\u2019s finding that collateral estoppel barred PPI\u2019s FIFO/LIFO claim on the grounds that the issue had already been litigated and decided against PPI in the tax-year 2003 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>{\u00b6 2} Because 2004 and 2005 were separate and distinct tax years presenting potentially different facts from tax year 2003, we disapprove the BTA\u2019s determination that collateral estoppel applied to PPI\u2019s appeal for the 2004 and 2005 tax years. On the merits, we conclude that the BTA erred by upholding the commissioner\u2019s assessments .for the tax years before us. Namely, the tax commissioner substituted FIFO for LIFO based not upon the content of the taxpayer\u2019s return or taxpayer-specific evidence, but rather upon a general proposition that FIFO should be used to value inventory. Consistent with R.C. 5711.18, R.C. 5711.21, and the general proposition that the tax commissioner cannot confer the force of law on an accounting method without promulgating it as an administrative rule, we hold that the substitution of FIFO for LIFO was impermissible under the circumstances of this case. We therefore reverse the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">{\u00b6 3} In dispute is whether the tax commissioner was justified, when auditing PPI\u2019s property tax returns, in substituting FIFO (the first-in, first-out method of accounting for inventory) for LIFO (the last-in, first-out method). These methods are two of the four accepted methods of assigning value to inventory items for accounting purposes. <em>See </em>Larson &amp; Miller, <em>Fundamental Accounting Principles </em>486-490 (13th Ed.1993). Unlike \u201cspecific-invoice inventory pricing\u201d or \u201caverage inventory pricing,\u201d FIFO and LIFO each assume that inventory is reduced in a particular order in relation to acquisition or manufacture of the items. <em>Id. </em>FIFO assumes that \u201cthe items in the beginning inventory are to be sold first,\u201d with additional sales being made in the order that the items were acquired. <em>Id. </em>at 488. By contrast, LIFO makes the opposite assumption: under LIFO, \u201cthe cost of the last goods received are charged to cost of goods sold and matched with revenue from sales.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">A. The commissioner\u2019s substitution of FIFO for LIFO in computing inventory value for tax year 2003 was upheld by the Eighth District</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">{\u00b6 4} The issuance of amended assessments for 2004 and 2005 occurred against the backdrop of the commissioner\u2019s audit and review for tax year 2003, and the statutory transcript reflecting the 2003 tax-year proceedings before the tax department has been made part of the record of this case. In that case, the tax audit agent\u2019s remarks referred to the 1986 Ohio Personal Property Tax Manual for the proposition that, because \u201cthe effect of LIFO is to assign old costs to new inventory, it is not acceptable for reporting inventory values for property tax purposes.\u201d Under the heading \u201cConclusion and Reasons,\u201d the agent stated that he had \u201cadded the LIFO Reserve back into the computation of inventories for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>each month in the audit period,\u201d noted that the \u201cultimate goal of the assessment is a determination of the true value of the property taxed,\u201d and stated that the LIFO method \u201ccan give rise to an unrealistic picture of inventory value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AAO\">{\u00b6 5} On June 22, 2006, the commissioner issued his final determination for tax year 2003, in which he addressed PPI\u2019s contention that the substitution of FIFO for LIFO was unjustified. In that determination, the commissioner observed that under LIFO, \u201cthe last items purchased are considered to be sold first, leaving older inventory items as considered unsold and comprising the value of inventory on hand.\u201d Because of this, the commissioner reasoned that the LIFO method did not properly value the inventory because \u201cthe most recent purchases of inventory are a more accurate indicia [sic] of true value as such purchases were made closer to the tax listing date than the older purchases * *</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">{\u00b6 6} PPI appealed the tax-year 2003 determination to the BTA, which affirmed the commissioner, noting that the \u201ccritical inquiry\u201d for purposes of personal property tax is the \u201cvalue of the inventory on hand.\u201d <em>Progressive Plastics, Inc. v. Wilkins, </em>BTA No. 2006-M-1043, 2008 WL 2072355, *2 (May 13, 2008). Citing and relying on <em>Champion Spark Plug Co. v. Lindley, </em>6 Ohio St.3d 56, 451 N.E.2d 514 (1983), the BTA rejected PPI\u2019s contention that the commissioner had to accept book value in the absence of a finding, based on evidence specific to the taxpayer, that book value did not reflect the true value of the assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">{\u00b6 7} The BTA considered the affidavit of PPI\u2019s chief operating officer, who stated that based on his knowledge of PPI\u2019s inventory flow, \u201cthe true value of Progressive Plastics inventory is not based exclusively on the FIFO valuation method.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at *5. The BTA accorded little weight to this testimony because PPI did not provide corroborating evidence. Accordingly, the BTA affirmed the FIFO/LIFO aspect of the commissioner\u2019s final determination in the tax-year 2003 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">{\u00b6 8} PPI then appealed the BTA\u2019s decision in the 2003 tax-year case to the Eighth District Court of Appeals. On April 30, 2009, that court issued a decision affirming the BTA. <em>Progressive Plastics, Inc. v. Levin, </em>8th Dist. No. 91614, 2009-Ohio-2033, 2009 WL 1156725. With respect to the FIFO/LIFO issue, the court observed that, because LIFO assumes that the last merchandise purchased or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>manufactured is sold before the sale of the older merchandise in stock is sold, and because FIFO relies on the opposite assumption, \u201cFIFO generally better reflects the current replacement costs of the inventory than LIFO because the average inventory values under the FIFO method will be based on the acquisition costs of the most newly acquired inventory, rather than the earliest acquired inventory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 2, fn. 1. Based on the ease law, the appeals court rejected PPI\u2019s theory that a departure from book value must be justified by evidence relating to the particular taxpayer. The appeals court also brushed aside PPI\u2019s contention that the commissioner had made no proper finding, holding that the final determination\u2019s assertion of the usual superiority of FIFO as an indicator of value constituted such a finding. PPI attempted a further appeal, but this court declined to accept jurisdiction. <em>Progressive Plastics, Inc. v. Levin, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 1408, 2009-Ohio-5031, 914 N.E.2d 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">B. The 2004 and 2005 tax-year assessments</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">{\u00b6 9} Against the backdrop of the commissioner\u2019s audit and review for tax year 2003, the commissioner issued amended preliminary assessments in the current case for tax years 2004 and 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">{\u00b6 10} For both tax years, PPI submitted its county return of taxable personal property, which listed an average value of manufacturing inventory of $2,499,652 and $2,521,590, respectively, in accordance with the LIFO method. Once the assessment percentage of 23 percent was applied, the returns reported a listed value of $563,420 and $579,966, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">{\u00b6 11} Substituting FIFO for LIFO, the tax commissioner issued amended preliminary assessment certificates for both tax years on July 21, 2006. For each tax year the amended \u00e1ssessment recomputed the value of PPI\u2019s manufacturing inventory and thereby increased the actual assessed values of that inventory to $810,140 and $915,370 \u2014 an increase of 43'percent for 2004 and 58 percent for 2005. PPI contested the commissioner\u2019s action by filing its petition for reassessment (covering both years) on September 22, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">{\u00b6 12} During the audit for 2004 and 2005, PPI asked that the commissioner postpone action for those years pending final disposition of litigation concerning the 2003 tax year. The commissioner, facing the statutory deadline for completing the tax-year 2004 assessment, declined to do so. <em>See </em>R.C.' 5711.25 (the preliminary or amended assessment certificate issued by the tax commissioner becomes final on the second Monday of August of the second year after filing the return). The tax commissioner\u2019s agent accordingly proceeded to complete the assessment based on information already in the commissioner\u2019s possession. The agent estimated LIFO reserves for later years based on a percentage extrapolated from earlier years.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>C. The final determination and the BTA appeal for 2004 and 2005</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">{\u00b6 13} On December 26, 2007, the commissioner issued his final determination in the present case, which rejected PPI\u2019s argument that its LIFO accounting should be used to value inventory for tax years 2004 and 2005. The final determination again emphasized the superiority of FIFO for purposes of determining inventory value. PPI again appealed to the BTA, which issued its decision on September 20, 2011. <em>Progressive Plastics, Inc. v. Levin, </em>BTA No. 2008-A-241, 2011 WL 4437290 (Sept. 20, 2011). In that decision, the BTA (1) rejected PPI\u2019s contention that the commissioner may not rely on findings and evidence generated during the audit of a prior tax year, <em>id. </em>at *2, (2) reiterated its 2003 tax-year finding that PPI \u201cdid not provide this board with any corroborating evidence demonstrating its personal property\u2019s value in conjunction with the description of its business practices,\u201d <em>id. </em>at *3, and (3) held that collateral estoppel barred relitigation of the FIFO/LIFO issue. <em>Id. </em>at *4. The BTA affirmed the commissioner\u2019s final determination, and PPI appealed. We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">II. LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">{\u00b6 14} The fair market value of property for tax purposes has been held to present \u201c\u2018 \u201ca question of fact, the determination of which is primarily within the province of the taxing authorities, and this court will not disturb a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals with respect to such valuation unless it affirmatively appears from the record that such decision is unreasonable and unlawful.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Rich\u2019s Dept. Stores, Inc. v. Levin, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 15, 2010-Ohio-957, 925 N.E.2d 951, \u00b6 13, quoting <em>EOP-BP Tower, L.L.C. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 1, 2005-Ohio-3096, 829 N.E.2d 686, \u00b6 17, quoting <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision v. Fodor, </em>15 Ohio St.2d 52, 239 N.E.2d 25 (1968), syllabus. Moreover, the tax commissioner\u2019s findings \u201c \u2018are presumptively valid, absent a demonstration that those findings are clearly unreasonable or unlawful.\u2019 \u201d <em>Satullo v. Wilkins, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 399, 2006-Ohio-5856, 856 N.E.2d 954, \u00b6 15, quoting <em>Nusseibeh v. Zaino, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 292, 2003-Ohio-855, 784 N.E.2d 93, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">{\u00b6 15} PPI confronts the court, however, with a claim of legal error involving the proper construction and application of R.C. 5711.18 and 5711.21. A dispute over the meaning of statutes presents a question of law, and our review in that regard is not deferential but de novo. <em>Akron Centre Plaza, L.L.C. v. Summit Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 145, 2010-Ohio-5035, 942 N.E.2d 1054, \u00b610.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">A. Collateral estoppel did not bar PPI\u2019s challenge in this case</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">{\u00b6 16} PPI\u2019s third proposition of law challenges the BTA\u2019s decision to apply collateral estoppel as a bar to its FIFO/LIFO claim. The tax commissioner concedes that the BTA\u2019s determination is incorrect in this regard, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>{\u00b6 17} We have acknowledged \u201ca narrow range of applicability of collateral estoppel in tax proceedings.\u201d <em>Olmsted Falls Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 134, 2009-Ohio-2461, 909 N.E.2d 597, \u00b6 17. Collateral estoppel \u201cprecludes the relitigation, in a second action, of an issue that has been actually and necessarily litigated and determined in a prior action.\u201d <em>Whitehead v. Gen. Tel. Co., </em>20 Ohio St.2d 108, 112, 254 N.E.2d 10 (1969). But the estoppel operates \u201conly when there is an identity of issues and an identity of parties or their privies in both the first and the second suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">{\u00b6 18} As for the identity of issues, our decision in <em>Olmsted Falls </em>is completely dispositive: there, we stated that \u201cthe ultimate issue of tax value in one tax year does not constitute the \u2018same issue\u2019 as the ultimate issue of tax value in a different year\u201d for purposes of applying collateral estoppel. <em>Olmsted Falls </em>at \u00b6 17. By that logic, the ultimate issue of inventory value for tax year 2003 is not the same issue as the issue of inventory value in 2004 and 2005, and collateral estoppel simply does not apply. Quite simply, each tax year may or may not present a different set of facts from those presented for any other tax year, with the result that the determination of facts for one year does not preclude a determination of new facts for the other year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">B. The commissioner may not broadly require the use of a particular accounting convention to value property except through a rule</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">{\u00b6 19} Because the BTA held that PPI\u2019s FIFO/LIFO argument was barred by collateral estoppel, it did not subject the claim to the fuller analysis it employed in the 2003 tax-year case. But the BTA did find that for 2004 and 2005 as well as for 2003, PPI \u201cdid not provide this board with any corroborating evidence demonstrating its personal property\u2019s value in conjunction with the description of its business practices.\u201d BTA No. 2008-A-241, 2011 WL 4437290, *3. Thus, the BTA found that the burden lay on PPI to rebut the commissioner\u2019s assessment and that PPI had not made an affirmative showing that its inventory was entitled to a lower valuation. Accordingly, given the following analysis, there is no need to remand to afford the BTA the opportunity to make any further findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">\n<em>1. R.C. 5711.18\u2019s presumption in favor of book value does not permit a \u201cfinding\u201d that merely substitutes one accounting method for another</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">{\u00b6 20} R.C. 5711.18 establishes that the taxpayer\u2019s depreciated book value is the starting point for valuing manufacturing inventory: indeed, book value <em>\u201cshall </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number><em>be taken as the true value of such property, </em>unless the assessor [i.e., the tax commissioner] finds that such depreciated book value is greater or less than the then true value of such property in money.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Having set forth a mandate, the statute then provides for an exception: if the assessor \u201cfinds\u201d that the value on the books does not reflect true value, a different value may be substituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">{\u00b6 21} R.C. 5711.18 raises the crucial question for this case: under what circumstances may a different value be substituted for book value? R.C. 5711.21(A) furnishes the answer to that question: the tax assessor\u2019s finding under R.C. 5711.18 must \u201cbe guided by the statements contained in the taxpayer\u2019s return and such other rules and evidence as will enable the assessor to arrive at such true value.\u201d Additionally significant is R.C. 5711.09: that section charges the tax commissioner with administering the personal property tax and prescribes that he \u201cmay adopt and promulgate rules\u201d in relation to his duties as administrator of the personal property tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">{\u00b6 22} In the present case, the commissioner cited neither an administrative rule nor any content of PPI\u2019s returns in support of substituting FIFO for LIFO, as contemplated by R.C. 5711.21. PPI contends that, as a result, \u201cthe burden [was] upon the Tax Commissioner to make a finding, supported by evidence pertinent to the taxpayer, that the book value of the inventory as reported by the taxpayer is not the true value of that inventory.\u201d In PPI\u2019s view the commissioner, by relying on a general accounting proposition rather than on a rule or on specific evidence, failed to comply with R.C. 5711.18 and 5711.21(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">{\u00b6 23} In response, the commissioner argues that he may make a \u201cfinding\u201d under R.C. 5711.18 based upon his \u201cexpert judgment\u201d that the FIFO method of valuation is a better indicator of the value of PPI\u2019s inventory than LIFO. As discussed in the fact section above, PPI demonstrated that the tax audit did not rely on PPI-specific data in substituting FIFO for LIFO, but on a general principle broadly applied to taxpayers that has not been adopted as an administrative rule. At oral argument, the commissioner\u2019s counsel characterized the taxpayer\u2019s use of LIFO on its personal property tax return as a \u201cred flag\u201d that triggered the substitution of FIFO absent a contrary showing by the taxpayer. That is, the commissioner\u2019s approach was to presume the propriety of substituting FIFO and, as counsel stated it, to place the burden on PPI to \u201cshow us that LIFO is appropriate here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">{\u00b6 24} We agree with PPI that the substitution of FIFO for LIFO exceeded the commissioner\u2019s authority under R.C. 5711.18 and 5711.21 in the circumstances presented in this case. The presumption dictated by R.C. 5711.18 is that the taxpayer\u2019s books, kept in accordance with accepted accounting principles, establish the value of the inventory. Consistent with R.C. 5711.21, a departure from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>that book value may be justified based on the content of the taxpayer\u2019s returns, the language of an administrative rule, or other evidence. Nothing in this scheme, however, permits the commissioner to raise a presumption that an accounting convention <em>not </em>used by the taxpayer better estimates value than the one the taxpayer did use, thereby placing a burden of rebuttal on the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">{\u00b6 25} The case law supports this analysis. In <em>PPG Industries, Inc. v. Kosydar, </em>65 Ohio St.2d 80, 83, 417 N.E.2d 1385 (1981), the tax commissioner confronted a similar question of valuing manufacturing inventory on audit. The taxpayer reported value using the same method it used in keeping its books, a method that excluded certain indirect factory overhead costs. But the commissioner determined that those costs must be included and recomputed the taxpayer\u2019s tax liability, assessing a higher amount. This approach reflected the \u201cabsorption\u201d method rather than the variable costing convention employed by the taxpayer. When the taxpayer appealed, the BTA affirmed, but on further appeal, the Tenth District Court of Appeals reversed. The court of appeals held that \u201cin the absence of an applicable rule or evidence to the contrary, the tax commissioner and the Board of Tax Appeals must accept the statements contained in the taxpayer\u2019s return\u201d on the grounds that \u201cthere would be no basis to find the statements in the return to be inaccurate.\u201d <em>PPG Industries, Inc. v. Kosydar, </em>10th Dist. Nos. 79AP-139 through 79AP-142,1979 WL 209569, *6 (Dec. 28, 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">{\u00b6 26} The tax commissioner appealed, and we defined the issue as \u201cwhether the variable costing method employed by PPG is an acceptable indicator of true value for Ohio personal property tax purposes.\u201d 65 Ohio St.2d at 81, 417 N.E.2d 1385. A rule adopted by the tax commissioner required use of the \u201cfull absorption\u201d method of accounting when valuing inventory, but <em>that language was not part of the rule during the tax years at issue. Id. </em>We held that the taxpayer, unconstrained by the administrative rule during the relevant period, was \u201cnot required to adopt the full absorption method of inventory valuation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, under R.C. 5711.18, \u201c[t]he statements in the taxpayer\u2019s returns, being unrebutted, must be accepted by the commissioner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82. Hence, we affirmed the court of appeals\u2019s disposition of the issue. <em>Id. </em>at 82-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">{\u00b6 27} By the same logic, PPI must prevail in the present case. PPI used an accepted accounting method, LIFO, for its manufacturing inventory, and that method becomes binding in the absence of a rule or of particularized findings based on specific evidence, be it of the taxpayer\u2019s operations or of market conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">{\u00b6 28} The tax commissioner and the BTA placed heavy reliance on <em>Champion Spark Plug Co. v. Lindley, </em>6 Ohio St.3d at 58, 451 N.E.2d 514. That case does involve manufacturing inventory, and we did uphold the substitution of FIFO for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>LIFO in <em>Champion. </em>However, the BTA in that case had affirmed the commissioner\u2019s use of FIFO based on actual evidence of inventory flow, and this court found the BTA\u2019s decision to be reasonable and lawful in that regard. The taxpayer argued that book value \u201cconstitutes prima facie evidence of true value which [the tax commissioner] must either accept or overcome through the production of evidence to the contrary,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 57, and under the circumstances of that case, we resolved the issue against the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"AfVX\">{\u00b6 29} But although <em>Champion </em>was decided after <em>PPG Industries, </em>and although the taxpayer specifically argued that substituting FIFO for LIFO \u201cis not such a finding as is required by Revised Code section 5711.18 to overcome the book value reported by the taxpayer,\u201d we did not address, much less embrace or refute that argument. Instead, we relied on the totality of the record as substantiating the tax commissioner\u2019s assessment. Indeed, <em>Champion </em>does not cite <em>PPG Industries, </em>let alone overrule it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It follows that where, as here, the commissioner relies on the asserted superiority of one accounting convention for determining value, over the convention used by the taxpayer, his position must fail under <em>PPG Industries.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">\n<em>2. The tax commissioner may require the substitution of a more accurate accounting convention by administrative rule</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AR6\">{\u00b6 30} In holding that the commissioner cannot substitute accounting methods, we acknowledge that the commissioner\u2019s preference for FIFO over LIFO in valuing inventory is by no means arbitrary. Indeed, it is a commonplace that FIFO is an \u201cacceptable measure of inventory replacement cost\u201d because \u201c[p]rices most recently paid are a better indication of replacement cost than are prices from months, even years, earlier,\u201d while LIFO is \u201cless acceptable\u201d because \u201cit does not reflect inventory value for property tax purposes.\u201d IAAO, <em>Property Assessment Valuation </em>368 (2d Ed.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">{\u00b6 31} However, the commissioner \u201ccannot confer the force of law on a requirement without promulgating it as a rule,\u201d <em>HealthSouth Corp. v. Testa, </em>132 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Ohio St.3d 55, 2012-Ohio-1871, 969 N.E.2d 232, \u00b6 33, citing <em>McLean Trucking Co. v. Lindley, </em>70 Ohio St.2d 106, 114-116, 435 N.E.2d 414 (1982), and <em>Condee v. Lindley, </em>12 Ohio St.3d 90, 92-93, 465 N.E.2d 450 (1984). Accordingly, we hold that the commissioner must promulgate an administrative rule to require the use of a particular accounting convention as a matter of course. A notable example is the commissioner\u2019s \u201c302 computation\u201d: even though that method \u201cprescrib[es] annual depreciation rates <em>in lieu of book depreciation </em>for Ohio personal property tax purposes\u201d (emphasis added), we have repeatedly upheld that method as \u201c \u2018a practical, reasonable and lawful method and device to achieve uniform valuation of plant equipment in Ohio.\u2019 \u201d <em>WCI Steel, Inc. v. Testa, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 256, 2011-Ohio-3280, 951 N.E.2d 421, \u00b6 23, quoting <em>PPG Industries, </em>65 Ohio St.2d at 83, 417 N.E.2d 1385. Unlike the substitution of FIFO for LIFO, however, the commissioner has exercised his rulemaking authority to confer proper legal status on the 302 computation. <em>Compare </em>Ohio Adm.Code 5703-3-10 and 5703-3-11, which expressly adopt the \u201c302 computation\u201d method for valuing depreciable tangible personal property used in business, <em>with </em>5703-3-27, which is silent as to the method to be used for valuing the average inventory of a manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">\n<em>3. The record does not negate PPPs use of LIFO</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">{\u00b6 32} The commissioner also asserts that the substitution of FIFO is justified because the evidence shows that FIFO better reflects PPI\u2019s actual inventory flow. In particular, the commissioner points to an internal PPI memorandum that states: \u201cEven though LIFO is used for balance sheet valuation of inventories, our company uses raw materials and ship [sic] finished goods on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But the commissioner is wrong. Actual inventory flow is neither dispositive of the propriety of using LIFO on the books of the business nor determinative of which accounting convention reflects value. <em>See </em>Larson &amp; Miller at 489; <em>Property Assessment Valuation </em>at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">{\u00b6 33} For the foregoing reasons, the BTA erred by upholding the tax commissioner\u2019s use of FIFO for 2004 and 2005. We therefore reverse that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>portion of the BTA\u2019s decision. Unaffected by our holding is the remainder of the BTA\u2019s decision, which PPI did not challenge on appeal.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ach\">Corsaro &amp; Associates Co., L.P.A., Christian M.

In the 2003 tax-year case, PPI did not present witnesses and exhibits at a BTA hearing, but chose instead to rely on the existing record, supplementing it by submitting the depositions of one former and one current tax agent. When PPI later appealed the commissioner\u2019s determination of the 2004 and 2005 tax-year assessments to the BTA, PPI again presented no witnesses or exhibits. To make the record complete, the tax commissioner \u2014 in addition to certifying the statutory transcript for the later tax years \u2014 also submitted a supplemental transcript containing, in PDF format, the record from the 2003 tax-year case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b773-10\">. The tax commissioner seeks to substitute stare decisis for collateral estoppel, but no analysis of this point is necessary inasmuch as the BTA did not address it, and neither the BTA decision nor the court of appeals judgment furnishes binding precedent at this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b776-8\">. <em>Champion </em>cites <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Kosydar, </em>44 Ohio St.2d 96, 338 N.E.2d 366 (1975), for the proposition that \u201cthe taxpayer\u2019s book value of its inventory is merely evidence of true value and will be taken as prima facie evidence of true value only when the Tax Commissioner has failed to find that such book value is greater or less than true value in money of the property.\u201d <em>Id., </em>paragraph two of the syllabus. In <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube, </em>the BTA, faced with a \u201cbattle of the experts,\u201d resolved the case in favor of the taxpayer. We affirmed. Likewise, in <em>R.H. Macy Co., Inc. v. Schneider, </em>176 Ohio St. 94, 197 N.E.2d 807 (1964), we affirmed the BTA\u2019s decision in a context where the BTA had evidence before it showing the inventory computed by both the LIFO and the retail-inventory methods. The BTA determined that true value was the amount determined by the retail-inventory method, and we held in essence that the BTA\u2019s decision was neither arbitrary, unreasonable, nor unlawful. <em>Id. </em>at 97-98. Neither case explicitly endorsed the general substitution of one accounting convention for another.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b777-9\">. Under its second proposition of law, PPI contends that the tax commissioner \u201ccannot rely on information obtained through a prior year\u2019s audit to assess additional tax for a subsequent year\u201d because each tax year \u201cstands on its own.\u201d PPI cites <em>Olmsted Falls Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 134, 2009-Ohio-2461, 909 N.E.2d 597, and <em>Fogg-Akron Assoc., L.P. v. Summit Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 112, 2009-Ohio-6412, 919 N.E.2d 730. Both cases address the question whether presumptive validity may be accorded to a prior year\u2019s valuation. Using evidence from a prior year is a completely different issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
