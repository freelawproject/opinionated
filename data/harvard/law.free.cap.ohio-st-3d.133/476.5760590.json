Thus the facts of this case are taken from the order of certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">{\u00b6 2} Younglove Construction, L.L.C., entered into a contract with PSD Development, L.L.C., for the construction of a feed-manufacturing plant in Sandusky, Ohio. When PSD withheld payment, Younglove brought this diversity suit against PSD and three other defendants, seeking damages for breach of contract and related causes of action. In its answer, PSD alleged that it had sustained damages as a result of defects in a steel grain bin. The bin had been constructed by respondent, Custom Agri Systems, Inc., as a subcontractor, and Younglove filed a third-party complaint against Custom for contribution and indemnity. Custom filed similar third-party complaints against the subcontractors it had used to construct the bin and turned to its insurer, petitioner Westfield Insurance Company, to defend and indemnify it in the litigation. Westfield intervened in order to pursue a judgment declaring that it had no such duty under the terms of its commercial general liability (\u201cCGL\u201d) policy with Custom.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">{\u00b6 3} Custom was being sued under two general theories: defective construction and consequential damages resulting from the defective construction. West-field argued that none of the claims against Custom sought compensation for \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d and therefore that none of the claims were covered under the CGL policy. In the alternative, Westfield argued that even if the claims were for property damage caused by an occurrence, they were removed from coverage by an exclusion in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">{\u00b6 4} Westfield and Custom filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The parties agreed that the case was governed by Ohio law, and the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio acknowledged that it was an open question under Ohio law whether defective-construction claims fall under the auspices of a CGL policy. Rather than decide the issue, the district court assumed that Custom\u2019s policy covered defective construction and went on to find that the exclusion removed such claims from coverage. After reconsideration of an earlier order, the district court granted summary judgment for Westfield. <em>Younglove Constr., L.L.C. v. PSD Dev., L.L.C., </em>767 F.Supp.2d 820 (N.D.Ohio 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">{\u00b6 5} Custom appealed the summary judgment in favor of Westfield. West-field moved to certify two questions of state law to this court. Custom did not oppose the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">{\u00b6 6} In a divided decision, the Sixth Circuit determined that the question of whether defective construction or workmanship constitutes an \u201coccurrence\u201d with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>in the meaning of a CGL policy in Ohio might be determinative of the action in federal court. Furthermore, the Sixth Circuit found no controlling precedent on the issue in our decisions. For those reasons, the Sixth Circuit certified the following two questions of state law to this court pursuant to S.CtPrac.R. 18.1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-4\">(1) Are claims of defective construction/workmanship brought by a property owner claims for \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d under a commercial general liability policy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">(2) If such claims are considered \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence,\u201d does the contractual liability exclusion in the commercial general liability policy preclude coverage for claims for defective construction/workmanship?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">{\u00b6 7} We agreed to answer both questions. <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Custom Agri Sys., Inc., </em>130 Ohio St.3d 1415, 2011-Ohio-5605, 956 N.E.2d 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">\n<em>First Certified State-Law Question</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">{\u00b6 8} The underlying claim is one of defective construction of or workmanship on the steel grain bin by Custom. The present action is one of contract interpretation, as the issue is whether the claims of defective construction or workmanship against Custom fall within the insurance policy issued by Westfield.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-10\">When confronted with an issue of contractual interpretation, the role of a court is to give effect to the intent of the parties to the agreement. <em>Hamilton Ins.

Although it is a widely accepted principle that such claims are not covered by CGL policies, our inquiry cannot and must not end there. The issue we must decide is whether the CGL policy in the present case provides coverage to Custom for its alleged defective construction of and workmanship on the steel grain bin. Specifically, we must decide whether Custom\u2019s alleged defective construction of and workmanship on the steel grain bin constitute property damage caused by an \u201coccurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">{\u00b6 12} In the CGL policy here, the word \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d The word \u201caccident,\u201d however, is not defined in the CGL policy. Therefore, \u201caccident\u201d must be given its \u201cnatural and commonly accepted meaning.\u201d <em>Gomolka v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>70 Ohio St.2d 166, 167-168, 436 N.E.2d 1347 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">{\u00b6 13} We have defined \u201caccidental\u201d as \u201cunexpected, as well as unintended.\u201d <em>Hybud Equip.

In defining the ordinary meaning of \u201caccident\u201d in the context of a CGL policy that, too, did not include a definition of the word, our sister court in Kentucky held, \u201cInherent in the plain meaning of \u2018accident\u2019 is the doctrine of fortuity. Indeed, \u2018[t]he fortuity principle is central to the notion of what constitutes insurance * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co., </em>306 S.W.3d 69, 74 (Ky.2010), quoting Corpus Juris Secundum, Insurance, Section 1235 (2009). Similarly, the Eleventh District has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-7\">\u201c \u2018Insurance coverage is bottomed on the concept of fortuity. Applying this rule in the construction context, truly accidental property damage generally is covered because such claims and risks fit within the statistical abstract. Conversely, faulty workmanship claims generally are not cov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>ered, except for their consequential damages, because they are not fortuitous. In short, contractors\u2019 \u201cbusiness risks\u201d are not covered by insurance, but derivative damages are. <em>The key issues are whether the contractor controlled the process leading to the damages and whether the damages were anticipated.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-5\">\u201c \u2018Coverage analysis largely turns On the damages sought. If the damages are for the insured\u2019s own work, there is generally no coverage. If the damages are consequential and derive from the work the insured performed, coverage generally will lie. The underwriting intent is to exclude coverage for the contractor\u2019s business risks, but provide coverage for unanticipated consequential damages.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>[Indiana Ins.

In keeping with the spirit of fortuity that is fundamental to insurance coverage, we hold that the CGL policy does not provide coverage to Custom for its alleged defective construction of and workmanship on the steel grain bin. Our holding is consistent with the majority of Ohio courts that have denied coverage for this type of claim. The majority view is that claims of defective construction or workmanship are not claims for \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d under a CGL policy. <em>E.g., Bogner Constr.

Holder, </em>370 Ark. 465, 261 S.W.3d 456 (2008), the Arkansas Supreme Court reached the same result. The issue was \u201cwhether defective construction or workmanship is an \u2018accident\u2019 and, therefore, an \u2018occurrence\u2019 within the meaning of commercial general liability insurance policies.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 457. In <em>Essex, </em>a couple had contracted with a builder to build a home. Before the home was completed, the couple sued the builder, seeking damages for breach of contract, breach of an express warranty, breach of implied warranties, and negligence. They alleged that they had suffered damages from the builder\u2019s delays, employment of incompetent subcontractors, and defective or incomplete construction. The builder then demanded that Essex Insurance Company defend him in the action under his CGL policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">{\u00b6 17} Essex asserted that there was no coverage under any of the CGL policies for the alleged damages. The federal district court certified this question of Arkansas law to the Arkansas Supreme Court to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">{\u00b6 18} The Arkansas court held that \u201cthe contractor\u2019s obligation to repair or replace its subcontractor\u2019s defective workmanship could not be deemed unexpect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>ed on the part of the contractor, and therefore, failed to constitute an \u2018event\u2019 for which coverage existed under the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459, citing <em>Nabholz Constr. Corp. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>354 F.Supp.2d 917, 921-922 (E.D.Ark. 2005). Therefore, the Arkansas Supreme Court held that \u201cdefective workmanship standing alone \u2014 resulting in damages only to the work product itself \u2014 is not an occurrence under a CGL policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And as the court pointed out, to protect itself from faulty performance by a subcontractor, a contractor can require the subcontractor to provide a performance bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">{\u00b6 19} Based on our review of the purpose of a CGL policy and of the majority view of our appellate courts that have addressed this issue and the view of our sister court in Arkansas, we hold that claims of defective construction or workmanship brought by a property owner are not claims for \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d under a commercial general liability policy such as the one in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">\n<em>Second Certified State-Law Question</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">{\u00b6 20} Because we answered the first question in the negative, the second certified state-law question is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">{\u00b6 21} We answer the first certified state-law question in the negative and hold that claims of defective construction or workmanship brought by a property owner are not claims for \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d under a commercial general liability policy. We do not reach the second certified state-law question, as it is unnecessary to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">So answered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b762-11\">Lundberg Stratton, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b762-12\">O\u2019Donnell, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b762-13\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b762-14\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AEqR\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">{\u00b6 22} I dissent, first, because I believe this court should not be answering this question at this time. The question the majority leaves unanswered is the only question truly at issue in this case. Second, I dissent from the majority\u2019s response to the first certified question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>The Wrong Question</p>\n<p id=\"ARF\">{\u00b6 23} The district court determined that it did not have to answer the question of whether claims of defective construction/workmanship are claims created by an \u201coccurrence\u201d under a commercial general liability (\u201cCGL\u201d) policy. Instead, it answered the question it deemed dispositive \u2014 whether the policy\u2019s contractual liability exclusion precluded coverage for claims for defective construction/workmanship in this case. Even at the trial level, Westfield Insurance Company sought certification to this court for a determination of the two issues it raises here, but the district court denied the motion. I agree with the dissenting judge of the court of appeals \u2014 Westfield\u2019s revival of the motion to certify at the appellate level was an end run to evade abuse-of-discretion review of the district court\u2019s denial of the motion for certification. As Judge McKeague wrote below, \u201cthe proper course would have been for Westfield to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to certify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">{\u00b6 24} Custom Agri Systems appealed the district court\u2019s determinative ruling on the policy exclusion, but Westfield again sought certification to this court \u2014 this time from the court of appeals \u2014 on the broader issue of whether defective workmanship constitutes an \u201coccurrence\u201d under a CGL policy. The district court had concluded that it was unnecessary to even meet that question, and as Judge McKeague noted, \u201cthere is absolutely no reason to certify the first question at this stage of the litigation.\u201d If the appellate court first overruled the district court on the contractual exclusion issue, it might then become appropriate for the panel, or the district court on remand, to certify the question to this court. Until then, Judge McKeague wrote, the circuit court \u201cshould not be in the business of certifying questions that need not be resolved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">{\u00b6 25} The first certified question is a big question, and an open question, which Westfield really wants answered. But its desire to resolve an issue that must arise with its policyholders fairly often does not create in this court an obligation to answer it in this case. This is not \u201cDear Abby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The Wrong Answer</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">{\u00b6 26} I also dissent from the majority\u2019s response to the first certified question, \u201cAre claims of defective construction/workmanship brought by a property owner claims for \u2018property damage\u2019 created by an \u2018occurrence\u2019 under a commercial general liability policy?\u201d The majority answers in the negative. I would answer that if the defective construction is accidental, it constitutes an \u201coccurrence\u201d under a CGL policy. \u201c[A] strong recent trend in the case law interprets the term \u2018occurrence\u2019 to encompass unanticipated damage to nondefective property resulting from poor workmanship.\u201d <em>Greystone Constr., Inc. v. Natl. Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>661 F.3d 1272, 1282 (10th Cir.2011). That is not to say that an exclusion in the policy might not relieve the insurer of the duty to provide coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>{\u00b6 27} The majority holding is too broad for the facts of this case. Determining that defective workmanship cannot result in a covered occurrence under a CGL policy forecloses too many other potential cases. The question posed by the federal court concerns the initial grant of coverage; it does not relate to any possible exclusions. In <em>Zanco, Inc. v. Michigan Mut. Ins. Co., </em>11 Ohio St.3d 114, 464 N.E.2d 513 (1984), this court faced a similar CGL policy and a similar set of facts. In <em>Zanco, </em>condominium owners alleged that the contractor, Zanco, breached its duty to construct the condominiums in a workmanlike manner, thereby causing defects in the structure. Zanco did not deny the defects, but rather claimed that the fault lay with its suppliers, who allegedly furnished Zanco with defective materials. Zanco sought coverage under its CGL insurance contract. The court looked to the entire contract to determine the issue. The court did not expressly rule on the issue of whether the damage to the condominiums was \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence,\u201d but did indicate support for the idea that at that threshold level, there was coverage but that the policy <em>exclusions </em>were ultimately determinative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">Zanco maintains, and the court of appeals agreed, that the counterclaim alleged \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d as those terms are defined in the policies. Athough a perfectly credible argument can be made that the allegations in the Pinecrest counterclaim were within these initial provisions for coverage, the insurance contracts must be examined in their entirety to determine if there are any applicable exceptions to their coverage. A careful review of the exclusions contained in the policies reveals that Michigan Mutual owed no duty to defend under these facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">(Footnote omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 115-116.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">{\u00b6 28} Again, the question we are answering does not consider exclusions \u2014 it deals with the initial grant of coverage. Under the policy at issue, the insurance covers \u201c \u2018property damage\u2019 * * * caused by an \u2018occurrence\u2019 that takes place in the \u2018coverage territory.\u2019 \u201d The policy defines an \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d The key question is whether defective workmanship can be considered accidental. Given this court\u2019s definition of \u201caccidental,\u201d I would hold that the initial grant of coverage would apply in certain instances of defective workmanship, those in which the damage was not intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">{\u00b6 29} This court\u2019s definition of \u201caccidental\u201d is broad, covering unexpected, unintentional happenings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>In <em>Hybud Equip. Corp. v. Sphere Drake Ins. Co. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 657, 666, 597 N.E.2d 1096, we stated that \u201c[i]n its common, ordinary use, the word \u2018accidental\u2019 means unexpected, <em>as well as </em>unintended.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We similarly recognized in <em>Gearing v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 34, 38, 665 N.E.2d 1115, that \u201cinherent in a policy\u2019s definition of \u2018occurrence\u2019 is the concept of an incident of an accidental, <em>as opposed to an intentional, nature.\u201d </em>(Emphasis altered.) Furthermore, in <em>Rothman v. Metro. Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1938), 134 Ohio St. 241, 247, 12 O.O. 50, 16 N.E.2d 417, this court acknowledged that \u201c \u2018accident,\u2019 as the term is ordinarily used, is a more comprehensive term than \u2018negligence,\u2019 and in its common signification means an unexpected happening without intention or design.\u201d Id. at 247, 16 N.E.2d 417, 12 O.O. 50, citing <em>Commonwealth Cas. Co. v. Headers </em>(1928), 118 Ohio St. 429, 161 N.E. 278. Thus, we held in <em>Rothman </em>that absent contrary language in a policy, \u201cif the injury was not intentionally caused, then it was accidentally suffered.\u201d Id. at 246, 16 N.E.2d 417,12 O.O. 50.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-5\"><em>Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. White, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 562, 2009-Ohio-3718, 913 N.E.2d 426, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">{\u00b6 30} Our first-level analysis should thus focus upon whether the defective workmanship was intentionally caused. In <em>Sheehan Constr. Co., Inc. v. Continental Cas. Co., </em>935 N.E.2d 160, 170 (Ind.2010), <em>modified on rehearing, </em>938 N.E.2d 685 (Ind.2010), the Supreme Court of Indiana established that intent is the key to determining whether a construction defect is accidental:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-7\">Implicit in the meaning of \u201caccident\u201d is the lack of intentionality. * * * The question presented is whether faulty workmanship is an accident within the meaning of a standard CGL policy. In our view the answer depends on the facts of the case. For example, faulty workmanship that is intentional from the viewpoint of the insured cannot be an \u201caccident\u201d or an \u201coccurrence.\u201d <em>See Lamar Homes [Inc. v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co.,] </em>242 S.W.3d [1] at 8-9 [(Tex.2007)]. On the other hand if the faulty workmanship is \u201cunexpected\u201d and \u201cwithout intention or design\u201d and thus not foreseeable from the viewpoint of the insured, then it is an accident within the meaning of a CGL policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">{\u00b6 31} A deliberate act \u2014 such as performing construction work \u2014 can have accidental consequences. \u201c[A] deliberate act, performed negligently, is an accident if the effect is not the intended or expected result; that is, the result would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>have been different had the deliberate act been performed correctly.\u201d <em>Lamar Homes, Inc. v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co., </em>242 S.W.3d 1, 8 (Tex.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">{\u00b6 32} The majority relies on an Arkansas case and some Ohio appellate cases that seem to say that defective workmanship that results in damage only to the work product itself cannot constitute an occurrence. But the character of the damage is immaterial in regard to the threshold question of whether faulty construction is an occurrence: \u201cThe CGL policy * * * does not define an \u2018occurrence\u2019 in terms of the ownership or character of the property damaged by the act or event. Rather, the policy asks whether the injury was intended or fortuitous, that is, whether the injury was an accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Cases that focus on the type of damage resulting from faulty construction do not truly address the issue of whether there has been an \u201coccurrence\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-5\">The reasoning found in these cases simultaneously fails to evaluate the policy as a whole and collapses what should be a separate and specific analysis of the policy exclusions into the coverage grant analysis of the term \u201coccurrence.\u201d By focusing on the kind of property damage alleged to determine whether there has been an \u201coccurrence,\u201d these decisions improperly apply the policy <em>exclusions </em>to determine whether there has been an \u201coccurrence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">(Emphasis sic; footnote omitted.) Clifford J. Shapiro, <em>Point/Counterpoint: Inadvertent Construction Defects Are an \u201cOccurrence\u201d under CGL Policies, </em>22 Construction Lawyer 13, 17 (Spring 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">{\u00b6 33} The better-reasoned Ohio appellate cases recognize that a CGL policy is not the equivalent of a performance bond but also recognize that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-8\">the rationale for [that] proposition is not that the allegations of negligent construction or design practices do not fall within the broad coverage for property damage caused by an occurrence, but that * * * the damages resulting from such practices are usually excluded from coverage by the standard exclusions found in such policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-9\"><em>Erie Ins. Exchange v. Colony Dev. Corp., </em>136 Ohio App.3d 406, 414, 736 N.E.2d 941 (1999). In <em>Erie Ins. Exchange v. Colony Dev. Corp., </em>136 Ohio App.3d 419, 422, 736 N.E.2d 950 (2000), fn. 1, the court pointed out the illogic of basing a determination of whether a defect is an occurrence on what property was damaged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>The logical basis for the distinction between damage to the work itself (not caused by an occurrence) and damage to collateral property (caused by an occurrence) is less than clear. Both types of property damage are caused by the same thing \u2014 negligent or defective work. One type of damage is no more accidental than the other. * * * [T]he basis for the distinction is not found in the definition of occurrence but by application of the standard \u201cwork performed\u201d and \u201cwork product\u201d exclusions found in a [cjommercial general liability insurance policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">{\u00b6 34} As pointed out by the court in <em>Lee Builders, Inc. v. Farm Bur. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>281 Kan. 844, 856, 137 P.3d 486 (2006), exclusions for work product and work performed exist because the initial broad grant of coverage for occurrences includes damage caused by accidental defective workmanship:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">\u201cA court need only ask why the CGL policy includes an exclusion for property damage to the insured\u2019s own work and that of its subcontractors to understand that it would be nonsensical for the policy to include such a provision if this kind of property damage could never be caused by an \u2018occurrence\u2019 in the first place. A court need only ask <em>why </em>the CGL policy specifically includes an express exception to the \u2018your work\u2019 exclusion for property damage arising out of the work of a subcontractor to understand that this kind of property damage must be included in the broad scope of the term \u2018occurrence\u2019 in the coverage grant, and that the coverage determination for this kind of property damage must be made based on the construction-specific policy exclusions.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-7\"><em>Id., </em>quoting Clifford J. Shapiro, <em>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: New State Supreme Court Decisions Address Whether an Inadvertent Construction Defect Is an \u201cOccurrence\u201d under CGL Policies, </em>25 Constr. Law. 9, 12 (Summer 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">{\u00b6 35} If coverage were inappropriate in this case, it would be by operation of the policy\u2019s exclusions, \u201cnot because a loss actionable only in contract can never be the result of an \u2018occurrence\u2019 within the meaning of the CGL\u2019s initial grant of coverage. This distinction is sometimes overlooked, and has resulted in some regrettably overbroad generalizations about CGL policies * * *.\u201d <em>Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Am.

Answering a question it should not even be answering, the majority misinterprets the contract and misapplies Ohio law, leaving us on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>wrong side of the divide of states that have considered this question.
