Bay treated the personnel supplied by Tradesmen International, Inc. and Construction Labor Contractors (\u201cCLC\u201d) as \u201cpermanent-assignment\u201d employees and therefore re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>garded the attendant employment services as exempt pursuant to R.C. 5739.oi(jj)(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>On audit, the commissioner overruled Bay\u2019s exempt treatment of the transactions on the primary ground that Bay had failed to supply \u201cfacts and circumstances\u201d evidence in relation to the assignment of individual employees. On appeal, the BTA found that the testimony and the summary exhibits offered by Bay were insufficient to prove entitlement to the exemption, with the result that the BTA affirmed the commissioner\u2019s denial of the exemption. <em>Bay Mechanical &amp; Elec. Corp. v. Levin, </em>BTA No. 2008-K-1687, 2011 WL 2446198, *3-4 (June 14, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">{\u00b6 3} Before this court, Bay renews its contention that the language of its contracts and the testimony offered satisfy the one-year and permanent-assignment criteria of R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3). We disagree, and we therefore affirm the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">I. Course of proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">{\u00b6 4} Bay Mechanical &amp; Electrical Corporation is a construction contractor that provides various services such as plumbing, piping, HVAC, electrical wiring, and maintenance work. Bay directly employed \u201ccore employees\u201d to carry out its projects, but additionally relied on labor supplied by third parties \u2014 in other words, Bay purchased \u201cemployment services,\u201d which are generally subject to sales tax unless specifically excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">{\u00b6 5} During the audit period, which stretches from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2005, Bay held a direct-payment permit. Although the sales-tax law usually requires vendors to charge the tax to their consumers and then remit the collected tax to the state, see R.C. 5739.03 and 5739.29, another section \u2014 R.C. 5739.031 \u2014 empowers the commissioner to issue direct-payment permits to consumers. Under such a permit, the consumer files monthly sales-tax returns that ascertain its own liability to pay the tax on its own purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">\n<em>1. The audit and assessment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">{\u00b6 6} The tax commissioner commenced his audit of Bay\u2019s purchases with a notification letter dated February 13, 2006. Over the course of several months, the tax agent worked out the method for the audit with Bay. On December 20, 2006, Bay representatives met with the tax agent at Bay\u2019s Lorain headquarters, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>and during that meeting, the taxability of the purchases from Tradesmen and CLC was a principal subject of discussion. A second meeting on February 20 resolved several issues but not the disagreement regarding the taxability of the employment services that Bay had purchased. Bay argued that the Tradesmen and CLC transactions were exempt as \u201cpermanent assignment\u201d sales under R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3). The parties agreed that Bay would produce additional information for the tax agent\u2019s review. That additional information would have included employment-service invoices from Tradesmen and CLC as well as \u201cjob cost summary sheets and supporting accrual information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">{\u00b6 7} By letter dated March 7, 2007, Bay\u2019s controller announced that Bay had decided not to produce the additional information. The letter recited that Bay had furnished to the tax agent the employment-service contracts between it and Tradesmen and CLC and that Bay had paid sales tax on employment services as to specified temporary employees supplied by other vendors. Bay took the position that it had \u201cfollowed the intent and the letter of the law with regard to leased construction labor\u201d and asked the tax agent to proceed to issue his preliminary report without the benefit of additional documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">{\u00b6 8} The tax agent\u2019s audit remarks reveal the department\u2019s own position. After reviewing the two CLC contracts and the three Tradesmen contracts, the tax agent concluded that two of the Tradesmen contracts were disqualified as a basis for exemption because they referred to nonpermanent assignments. In reviewing the other contracts, the agent first confirmed the existence of clauses that established that the contracts were \u201cfor at least one year\u201d as required by R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3). Next, the agent stated that although the remaining three contracts referred to indefinite or permanent assignment of the employees, they did not qualify as a basis for exemption because they failed to specify those employees or positions subject to such permanent or indefinite assignment. With respect to Tradesmen, the additional question arose whether employees had been assigned pursuant to the temporary-service contract or the permanent-assignment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">{\u00b6 9} As a result of the audit, the tax department issued a use-tax assessment against Bay on May 25, 2007, calling for payment of $105,078.77 of use tax, of which $74,574.65 related to employment services.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition to the tax, penalties and interest were assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"A6ih\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>\n<em>2. Petition for reassessment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">{\u00b6 10} On July 17, 2007, Bay filed its petition for reassessment, which challenged the employment-services portion of the assessment and stated that Bay was not requesting a hearing. An attorney with the tax department\u2019s Office of Chief Counsel wrote to Bay\u2019s counsel, noting that the audit agent had requested \u201cadditional information, including comprehensive invoice and time sheet information for employees supplied to the petitioner by Tradesmen International, Inc. and Construction Labor Contractors.\u201d The attorney stated that the information was \u201cnecessary in order to determine whether or not the employees were placed with the petitioner on a permanent basis per <em>H.R. Options, Inc. v. Zaino </em>(2004), 100 Ohio St.3d 373, 800 N.E.2d 740,\u201d and requested that Bay supply it. After receiving a second, similar letter, Bay\u2019s counsel responded that Bay \u201chas declined to submit any additional information, including comprehensive invoice and time sheet information for employees supplied to Bay Mechanical by Tradesmen International, Inc. and Construction Labor Contractors,\u201d while also asserting that \u201c[t]he information was provided to the auditor during the course of the audit.\u201d The record does not support the latter statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">{\u00b6 11} On July 22, 2008, the tax commissioner issued his final determination, which denied the exemption on the ground that Bay had failed to supply \u201cfacts and circumstances\u201d evidence in the form of \u201ccomprehensive invoice and time-sheet information\u201d and that Bay had failed to submit the tax department\u2019s employment-services questionnaire. The commissioner additionally faulted Bay for not supplying contracts with individual employees. The commissioner concluded that he could not grant the exemption because Bay had \u201cnot supplied information regarding the employees\u2019 contracts or the facts and circumstances regarding the employees\u2019 assignments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">\n<em>3. The BTA appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">{\u00b6 12} Bay appealed to the BTA and, at the BTA hearing, presented the testimony of Bay\u2019s controller along with four summary exhibits. The exhibits (1) identified the assigned employees by name, (2) associated each employee with either Tradesmen or CLC, (3) set forth the precise duration of each employee\u2019s assignment, and (4) stated the reason each employee had stopped working for Bay. The controller testified that she had prepared the documents by referring to the employment-service invoices received from Tradesmen and CLC \u2014 documents that the tax agent had requested during the audit but that were not produced.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>{\u00b6 13} The tax commissioner objected to the introduction of the exhibits on the grounds that the invoices themselves constituted the evidence, but the board received the exhibits and made them a part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">{\u00b6 14} On June 14, 2011, the BTA issued its decision. The BTA stated that Bay had the burden to prove that each employee covered under the contracts was assigned to Bay on a permanent basis \u2014 meaning that the personnel were assigned for a indefinite period and not assigned either as a substitute for an employee who was on leave or to meet seasonal or short-term workload conditions. <em>Bay Mechanical, </em>BTA No. 2008-K-1687, 2011 WL 2446198, *2, citing <em>H.R. Options, Inc. v. Zaino, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 373, 2004-Ohio-l, 800 N.E.2d 740, \u00b6 21-22. The BTA found that the controller\u2019s testimony and exhibits, presenting as they did information \u201cgleaned from records not before us,\u201d did not rise to the level of proof required by <em>H.R. Options. </em>Accordingly, the board affirmed the final determination of the commissioner, and the cause is now before us on an appeal of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">II. Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">{\u00b6 15} In a claim for tax exemption, the \u201conus is on the taxpayer to show that the language of the statute \u2018clearly expresses] the exemption\u2019 in relation to the facts of the claim.\u201d <em>Anderson/Maltbie Partnership v. Levin, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 178, 2010-Ohio-4904, 937 N.E.2d 547, \u00b6 16, quoting <em>Ares, Inc. v. Limbach, </em>51 Ohio St.3d 102, 104, 554 N.E.2d 1310 (1990). And when a decision issued by this court furnishes a definitive construction of the exemption statute, we typically reject an exemption claim that would expand the exemption beyond the scope described in that decision. <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">{\u00b6 16} Also significant are two settled propositions that govern, respectively, the BTA\u2019s review of the tax commissioner\u2019s determinations and our review of a BTA decision. First, before the BTA, \u201c[t]he Tax Commissioner\u2019s findings \u2018are presumptively valid, absent a demonstration that those findings are clearly unreasonable or unlawful.\u2019 \u201d <em>A. Schulman, Inc. v. Levin, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 105, 2007-Ohio-5585, 876 N.E.2d 928, \u00b6 7, quoting <em>Nusseibeh v. Zaino, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 292, 2003-Ohio-855, 784 N.E.2d 93, \u00b6 10. It was therefore Bay\u2019s burden to rebut the presumptive validity of denying the exemption by affirmatively proving its entitlement to it. Second, under R.C. 5717.04, the question for our determination is whether the BTA\u2019s decision is reasonable and lawful, and because \u201c[t]he function of weighing evidence and determining credibility belongs to the BTA, * * * our review of that aspect of its findings\u201d applies the highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>HealthSouth Corp. v. Testa, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 55, 2012-Ohio-1871, 969 N.E.2d 232, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">{\u00b6 17} With these preliminaries in mind, we turn to the exemption claim at issue. Effective January 1, 1993, Ohio imposes sales and use tax on the provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>of \u201cemployment services.\u201d AmuSub.H.B. No. 904, 144 Ohio Laws, Part IV, at 6598, 6688-6689, 6698, and 6797, codified at R.C. 5739.01(B)(3)(k) and 5739.01(JJ). We have held that a service, to be taxable pursuant to the definition of employment services at R.C. 5739.01(JJ), must meet three requirements: \u201c(1) it must provide or supply personnel on a temporary or long-term basis, (2) the personnel must perform work or labor under the supervision or control of another, and (3) the personnel must receive their wages, salary, or other compensation from the provider of the service.\u201d <em>Moore Personnel Serv., Inc. v. Zaino, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 337, 2003-Ohio-1089, 784 N.E.2d 1178, \u00b6 14. There is no dispute that these elements are present in the transactions at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">{\u00b6 18} Shortly after enactment of the sales tax on employment services, the General Assembly decided to create an additional exception for \u201cpermanent assignment\u201d employees. Am.Sub.H.B. No. 152, 145 Ohio Laws, Part III, at 4297, codified at R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3). Under that provision, \u201cemployment service\u201d did not include \u201c[supplying personnel to a purchaser pursuant to a contract of at least one year between the service provider and the purchaser that specifies that each employee covered under the contract is assigned to the purchaser on a permanent basis.\u201d In <em>H.R. Options, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 373, 2004-Ohio-l, 800 N.E.2d 740, \u00b6 21, we explained that \u201cpermanent\u201d in the context of (JJ)(3) means that an employee is \u201cassign[ed] to a position for an indefinite period,\u201d which in turn means that (1) the assignment has no specified ending date and (2) the employee is not being provided either as a substitute for a current employee who is on leave or to meet seasonal or short-term workload conditions. <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 21. We also held that R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3) was to be treated as an exception or exemption from taxation, with the result that it must be strictly construed against the taxpayer\u2019s claim for tax relief. <em>H.R. Options, </em>\u00b6 17, clarified by <em>H.R. Options, Inc. v. Wilkins, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 1214, 2004-Ohio-2085, 807 N.E.2d 363, \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">{\u00b6 19} <em>H.R. Options </em>is additionally significant because we construed the exemption as turning on the facts of each employee\u2019s assignment rather than on the presence of \u201cmagic words\u201d in the employment-service agreements themselves. <em>H.R. Options, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 373, 2004-Ohio-l, 800 N.E.2d 740, \u00b6 21. Instead of requiring that the contracts recite \u201cpermanent\u201d (or \u201cindefinite\u201d) assignment,'<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we viewed the language of the contracts as one element that, along with the facts and circumstances of the individual assignments, established whether the provider was truly \u201csupplying personnel\u201d in an exempt manner. Indeed, instead of requiring the commissioner to focus on contract language in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><em>H.R. Options, </em>we directed that official to look at two types of evidence when auditing a claim of exemption: (1) the employment-services contract itself, to see whether it is consistent with the requirements set forth at (JJ)(3), and (2) the facts and circumstances of the assignment, in order to ascertain whether in actual practice the assignment of the particular employees was \u201cindefinite\u201d in character, or whether the assignments were seasonal, substitutional, or designed to meet short-term workload conditions. <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">{\u00b6 20} These legal standards furnish the basis for our analysis of Bay\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">\n<em>1. Bay\u2019s argument that its contract language entitles it to exemption without regard to the facts and circumstances is wrong</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">{\u00b6 21} Bay argues that \u201cthe plain language of the [employment service contracts] alone is sufficient\u201d to establish the exemption with respect to the purchase of employment services associated with employees assigned under those contracts. In Bay\u2019s view, the mere presence of \u201cpermanent\u201d and \u201cindefinite\u201d assignment terminology in its contracts is dispositive: no inquiry into facts and circumstances of the assignment of individual employees is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">{\u00b6 22} The foregoing discussion establishes that Bay is mistaken. In <em>H.R. Options, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 373, 2004-Ohio-1, 800 N.E.2d 740, the claim for exemption was potentially viable even though the contracts did not contain the magic words. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b621. That was so because <em>H.R. Options </em>viewed contract language as merely one important element of establishing entitlement to the exemption. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">{\u00b6 23} Just as the absence of magic words is not dispositive of a permanent-assignment claim, neither does the presence of those words establish entitlement to the exemption as a matter of law. In this regard, <em>H.R. Options </em>adopts a consistent theme sounded by the BTA itself when reviewing exemption claims: when \u201cdetermining whether an exception or exemption to taxation applies, it is not just the form of a contract that is important,\u201d but instead, the \u201ccrucial inquiry becomes a determination of what the seller is providing and of what the purchaser is paying for in their agreement.\u201d <em>Excel Temporaries, Inc. v. Tracy, </em>BTA No. 97-T-257, 1998 WL 775284, *2 (Oct. 30, 1998) (applying the permanent-assignment exception before <em>H.R. </em>Options); <em>see also Stein, Inc. v. Tracy, </em>BTA No. 92-T-1388, 1997 WL 704479, *16 (Nov. 7, 1997) (\u201cnot just the form of the contract\u201d is important in determining whether [the sale-for-resale] exception applies, but also \u201cwhat actually is being done by the parties involved\u201d), aff d in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 84 Ohio St.3d 501, 705 N.E.2d 676 (1999). Despite R.C. 5739.01 (JJ)(3)\u2019s explicit reference to contract language, the statute justifies the focus on \u201cwhat actually is being done\u201d by requiring that the provider actually \u201csupplyf ] personnel\u201d on a permanent-assignment basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>{\u00b6 24} Accordingly, <em>H.R. Options </em>teaches that supplying personnel on an exempt basis under R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3) means that the employees are actually provided to work for an indefinite period \u2014 -i.e., that they are not serving as seasonal workers, as substitutes for regular employees on leave, or as labor needed to meet a short-term workload. It follows that a contract can contain all the right language, but if a particular employee <em>is </em>seasonal, substitutional, or on a short-term-workload assignment, the provider is not \u201csupplying\u201d that employee \u201cpursuant to\u201d the agreement for purposes of qualifying for exemption under R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">\n<em>2. The existence and production of contracts with individual employees is not a necessary condition for exemption under R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">{\u00b6 25} In his final determination, the commissioner faults Bay for not producing contracts with individual employees. Although the commissioner appears to have abandoned this contention, we think it prudent to address and dispose of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">{\u00b6 26} In <em>H.R. Options, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 373, 2004-Ohio-1, 800 N.E.2d 740, the commissioner audited and assessed against a <em>vendor </em>of employment services and, as it happened, that vendor had written agreements with the personnel that it supplied to the consumers of its employment services. Those contracts with individual employees became important pieces of \u201cfacts and circumstance\u201d evidence in determining the case. By contrast, the present case presents an audit and assessment of a <em>consumer </em>of employment services. As a result, the taxpayer would not in the ordinary course have possession of such contracts, even if they existed. Nor is there any reason why such contracts are a necessary element for claiming exemption, especially given the statute\u2019s explicit focus on the employment-services contracts and its omission of any mention of employee contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">{\u00b6 27} We hold that the existence of contracts with individual employees was not a necessary condition for exemption under R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">\n<em>3. Claiming an exemption in the context of a direct-payment audit calls for producing appropriate documentation on request</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">{\u00b6 28} It'is significant that the present claim for exemption from the sales tax arises in the context of an audit of purchases made by a taxpayer that holds a direct-payment permit under R.C. 5739.031. As noted, that section authorizes the issuance of permits that allow the taxpayer to avoid paying sales tax to vendors and instead report and remit tax on its purchases directly to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">{\u00b6 29} Under R.C. 5739.031(D), the holder of a direct-payment permit has the duty to \u201ckeep and preserve suitable records of purchases together with invoices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>of purchases, bills of lading, asset ledgers, depreciation schedules, transfer journals, and such other primary and secondary records and documents in such form as the commissioner requires.\u201d As for the tax auditor, R.C. 5703.19(A) authorizes the commissioner and his agents to \u201cinspect books, accounts, records, and memoranda of any person or public utility subject to [the] laws\u201d that the tax commissioner is required to administer. Additionally, <em>II.R. Options, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 373, 2004-Ohio-l, 800 N.E.2d 740, unequivocally establishes that \u201cboth the contract and the facts and circumstances of the employee\u2019s assignment * * * must be reviewed to determine whether the employee is being assigned on a permanent basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">{\u00b6 30} In this case, the commissioner fulfilled his duty by specifically requesting facts-and-circumstances evidence \u2014 notably, the employment-service invoices. But Bay made a deliberate decision to refuse to honor that request. Under these circumstances, the commissioner acted reasonably and lawfully when he denied the exemption because of Bay\u2019s failure to produce the requested pertinent documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">{\u00b6 31} In so holding, we acknowledge that cases may arise where a taxpayer\u2019s good-faith efforts to produce documentation could lead to failure. In a given case, for example, a fire may have destroyed the relevant records or the records may be in the possession of someone other than the taxpayer and unattainable by the taxpayer. Such circumstances might in a proper case justify suspending the requirement that facts-and-circumstances evidence be produced and reviewed. Nor do we hold that a taxpayer must comply with arbitrary requests by the commissioner \u2014 indeed, the commissioner\u2019s power to require production is constrained by the principle that the information request be reasonably calculated to lead to the production of matter relevant to whether personnel have been permanently assigned within the intendment of R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3) as construed by <em>II.R. Options.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">{\u00b6 32} This case, however, presents a straightforward refusal by Bay to produce clearly relevant documents on request, some of which the taxpayer itself later used to prepare summary exhibits at the BTA. The commissioner therefore acted appropriately in denying the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">\n<em>I. The BTA acted reasonably and, lawfully in affirming the commissioner\u2019s denial of the exemption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">{\u00b6 33} As discussed, at the BTA, Bay took a step beyond its reliance on the employment-service contracts when it presented not only the testimony of its controller, but also four summary exhibits concerning the individual assignments that were referable to the contracts at issue. The summary exhibits purport to show the names and periods of employment of particular employees pursuant to the employment-service contracts. The testimony establishes that their founda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>tion lies partly in invoices that the tax agent had previously requested without success. The BTA held that the evidence was not sufficient because of its summary nature, with the primary documentation not before the board. <em>Bay Mechanical, </em>BTA No. 2008-K-1687, 2011 WL 2446198, *3-4. In other words, the BTA decided not to accord evidentiary weight to the exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">{\u00b6 34} Because (as already discussed) the BTA\u2019s determinations of the credibility of witnesses and its weighing of the evidence are subject to a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion review on appeal, we will reverse only if we find an abuse of discretion. <em>HealthSouth Corp., </em>132 Ohio St.3d 55, 2012-Ohio-1871, 969 N.E.2d 232, \u00b6 10. In two respects, the <em>HealthSouth </em>decision is instructive in applying the abuse-of-discretion standard in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">{\u00b6 35} First, although the taxpayer\u2019s evidence in <em>HealthSouth </em>showed substantial evidential weaknesses, we nonetheless affirmed the BTA\u2019s decision to order the commissioner to issue a reduced assessment based on the totality of the record. The same broad deference that we exercised toward the BTA\u2019s judgment in <em>HealthSouth </em>is merited in this case as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">{\u00b6 36} Second, <em>HealthSouth </em>was a case in which the record contained not only the taxpayer\u2019s summary exhibits presented at the BTA, but other documentation to support the taxpayer\u2019s claim that had been submitted contemporaneously with the original tax returns on which the commissioner had predicated his assessment. <em>HealthSouth, </em>\u00b6 23, 25-26. By contrast, the underlying facts-and-circumstances evidence in the present case was neither shown to the tax agent during the audit, nor presented in support of Bay\u2019s petition for reassessment, nor offered as an exhibit at the BTA hearing. Accordingly, the record in this case was devoid of documentation that would corroborate the summary exhibits on which Bay chose to rely.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">{\u00b6 37} Bay suggests that by producing the underlying documentation to the tax commissioner\u2019s counsel on CDs during discovery at the BTA, it cured its earlier failure to produce it during the audit or in connection with the petition for reassessment. According to Bay, it \u201cshould not be penalized for producing the requested information for the first time during proceedings before [the BTA].\u201d But imposing a penalty is completely beside the point. The issue is: did the primary documentation ever become part of the record so that the BTA could review it in deciding Bay\u2019s appeal? It did not. Neither Bay nor the commissioner presented the documentation as a hearing exhibit. And because Bay had the burden of rebutting the commissioner\u2019s determination, it was not the commissioner\u2019s responsibility to offer the documents as evidence, even if he did obtain them through discovery. Moreover, a taxpayer at the BTA is not entitled to relief merely because the commissioner adduces no evidence contra his claim. <em>Higbee Co. v. Evatt, </em>140 Ohio St. 325, 332, 43 N.E.2d 273 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>{\u00b6 38} To show that the BTA abused its discretion by according no weight to the hearing exhibits, Bay must prove that the BTA\u2019s \u201cattitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.\u201d <em>J.M. Smucker, L.L.C. v. Levin, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 337, 2007-Ohio-2073, 865 N.E.2d 866, \u00b6 16. Given that <em>H.R. Options </em>calls for the consideration of facts-and-cireumstances evidence, that the documentation was completely withheld on audit, and that it was not offered as an exhibit at the BTA hearing, we conclude that the BTA did not act unreasonably, arbitrarily, or unconscionably when it disregarded the summary exhibits in spite of the controller\u2019s foundational testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">{\u00b6 39} Finally, Bay suggests that by virtue of admitting the summary exhibits under Evid.R. 1006, the BTA was constrained to accord them some evidential weight. We disagree. The Rules of Evidence are not binding at the BTA, even though they may be consulted for guidance. <em>Plain Local Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 230, 2011-Ohio-3362, 957 N.E.2d 268, \u00b6 20. When a determination of the tax commissioner is appealed, the BTA convenes an evidentiary hearing, <em>see </em>R.C. 5717.02(D) (\u201cupon the application of any interested party the board shall order the hearing of additional evidence\u201d), and at the hearing evidence is received. But just as the BTA\u2019s discretion to receive evidence is unconstrained by the Rules of Evidence, so also is its discretion to accord no weight to the evidence so received.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">{\u00b6 40} For the foregoing reasons, the BTA acted reasonably and lawfully when it upheld the tax commissioner\u2019s sales-tax assessment against Bay. We therefore affirm the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b711-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b711-10\">Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b711-11\">O\u2019Donnell, J., not participating.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-12\">. After the audit period at issue, the General Assembly amended the definition of \u201cemployment service\u201d at R.C. 5739.01(JJ) and added an exception at paragraph (5). Sub.H.B. No. 293, 151 Ohio Laws, Part V, 8842, 8864. The amendment is not material to the analysis of the statute in this opinion, and it did not change the language of paragraph (3) at all. In this opinion, however, R.C. 5739.01(JJ) and 5739.01(JJ)(3) refer to the version in effect during the audit period. 145 Ohio Laws, Part III, 4009, 4297.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b703-8\">. The commissioner assessed the tax owed as use tax, not as sales tax. The distinction has no practical significance in this context, because the undisputed realization of the benefit of the employment services within Ohio means that the purchases entail a taxable \u201cuse\u201d as long as the separate sales-tax obligation remains unpaid. <em>See </em>R.C. 5741.02(C)(1) (transactions subject to the sales tax are exempted from the use tax, <em>but only if the sales tax has been </em>paid). Moreover, if the purchases are excepted from sales tax, there is no use tax, either. R.C. 5741.02(C)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b704-8\">. In its reply brief, Bay argues that its production of the invoices in discovery at the BTA should substitute for its failure to produce them during the audit. We address this contention in the legal analysis below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b706-7\">. As Bay points out, the <em>H.R. Options </em>contracts contained no such language themselves. The contract language in that case was significant to the extent that it provided a contract term of at least one year and that it did not otherwise conflict with the conclusion that the personnel were assigned on a permanent basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b708-12\">.

It boils down to whether Bay Mechanical &amp; Electrical Corporation has submitted evidence of its claim for an R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3) exclusion from sales tax. Bay Mechanical believes that submitting the contracts and a summary of the work assignments at issue to the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d), having its controller testify regarding the contracts and work assignments before the BTA, and submitting the underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>documentation to the tax commissioner\u2019s counsel are sufficient to establish its claim. I agree.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A0mr\">Brouse McDowell, L.P.A., Joseph T. Dattilo, Thomas J. Ubbing, and Caroline L. Marks, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AA7\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, and Sophia Hussain, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">{\u00b6 42} It would have been better if Bay Mechanical had submitted the information earlier \u2014 to the tax commissioner before the necessity of an appeal to the BTA. It would have been better if Bay Mechanical had submitted the underlying documentation to the BTA as well as the tax commissioner. But the bottom line is that the information is now readily available, was available at the time of the appeal to the BTA, and is sufficient to establish Bay Mechanical\u2019s entitlement to the tax exclusion. I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b712-5\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
