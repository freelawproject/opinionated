Plaintiffs paid the taxes for the fifth year, and then brought suit against defendant, the tenant\u2019s surety, to recover the amount last paid. Plaintiffs averred in their statement that in Massachusetts taxes were assessed on May 1st, and that 'under the lease, which was executed in Massachusetts, the tenant was bound to pay the taxes levied and assessed during his term. The defendant in his affidavit of defence averred that \u201c the lessee did not covenant to pay to the plaintiffs the taxes levied and assessed on the demised premises, the words which import such covenant having been scored out in the contract and intended to be eliminated. The taxes now claimed for were not payable for or in respect'of the said premises or any part thereof during the said term, but were for taxes payable from the property for the year ending May 1, 1892, covering but one month of the lease.\u201d The affidavit did not deny that the copy of the lease filed was a true copy, and it did not specify what words were \u201c scored out and intended to be eliminated.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the affidavit of defence was insufficient to prevent judgment.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b204-7\"><em>Suretyship </em>\u2014 Extension <em>of time </em>\u2014 Payment <em>of taxes </em>\u2014 Previous <em>demand.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b204-8\">Where a tenant has covenanted to pay taxes, the mere'giving of time to him for the payment of his taxes does not release the tenant\u2019s surety from his obligation; and, in such ease, where the landlord has paid the taxes, no previous demand on the tenant is necessary before bringing suit against the surety.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b204-9\">Argued Jan. 2, 1894.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AKk_\">Appeal, No. 200, Jan.

Smalley a certain piece of partnership land in the said city of Boston on North street, more particularly described in the lease (a true copy of which is hereunto annexed), from the first day of June, 1886, for the term of five years. The rent agreed upon by the said lease was $1,764 a year, payable in monthly installments, and the said lessee, Albert G. Smalley, covenanted to pay, in addition to the rent aforesaid, all \u2018 the taxes and water taxes payable on said premises or any part thereof during the said term.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-6\">\u201c The said Albert G. Smalley, on the expiration of the term of the lease, June 1, 1891, had paid all the rent aforesaid, and all the taxes, except the tax which was levied and assessed on the said leased premises on the first day of May of said year 1891, by the city of Boston, amounting to $308.70, whereupon the plaintiffs, on October 31,1891, were obliged by law to pay, and did pay the said tax of $308.70 to the said city of Boston. The said lease was made and executed in Boston, Massachusetts, for property situated in Boston, and its covenants were to be performed there, and it was therefore subject to the laws of Massachusetts, under which a tenant who contracts by his lease to pay the taxes on the leased property during his term is liable for all taxes levied and assessed during such term. The said Smalley did not pay and was not bound to pay the taxes assessed May 1, 1886.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-7\">\u201c The defendant in this suit, Thomas W. Synnott, bound himself for the punctual payment of the rent and taxes reserved in the said lease by writing annexed to said lease, of which the following is a true copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-8\">\u201c \u2018 In consideration of the execution of the preceding lease, and of one dollar to me paid, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, I do hereby guarantee to the said Oliver Ditson &amp; Company the true and punctual payment of the rent and taxes reserved at the times mentioned, and in default thereof I promise to pay the same on demand,\u2019 (with signature, etc.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-9\">\u201c The defendant, Thomas W. Synnott, thereby became liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>for the payment of the said \u00cd308.70, which the said lessee had neglected and refused to pay and still refuses to pay. The said Thomas W. Synnott, defendant, has often been requested to pay said sum in accordance with his said undertaking, but has always refused and still refuses to pay said sum or any part thereof, and the same is now unpaid, wherefore the plaintiff brings this suit and craves judgment for the amount as aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-5\">The copy of the lease filed showed a covenant for the payment of the \u201c taxes and water taxes which may be payable for or in respect of the said premises or any part thereof during the said term.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-6\">The original lease, produced on the argument in the court below, read, \u201c all taxes and water taxes [and assessments whatsoever, whether in the nature of taxes now in being or not] which may be payable,\u201d etc, the part in brackets being erased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-7\">The affidavit of defence averred:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-8\">\u201c 1. The said Albert G. Smalley, lessee, did not covenant to pay to the plaintiffs the taxes \u2018 levied and assessed \u2019 on the- demised premises \u2014 the words which import such covenant having been scored out in the contract and intended to be eliminated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-9\">\u201c The taxes now claimed for were not \u2018 payable for or in respect of the said premises or any part thereof during said term,\u2019 but were for taxes payable from the property for the year ending May 1, 1892, covering but one month of the term of the lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-10\">\u201c 2. I am informed and believe that after the making of the said lease the said plaintiffs and the said Smalley entered into an agreement unknown to me by which the lessee was given time for the paj^ment of the taxes, and that by reason of such agreement the taxes which should have been collected at the proper time are now sought to be recovered against me under my contract of suretyship.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-11\">\u201c 3. I believe that no demand has been made upon the said Smalley, the lessee, for the payment of the said taxes.

Smalley a property in Boston, Massachusetts, for the term of five years, commencing June 1,1886. The lease contained a covenant for the payment of the rent and \u201c also the taxes and water taxes which may be payable for or in respect of the said premises or any part thereof during the said term.\u201d The plaintiffs paid the taxes assessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>May 1,1886. The lessee paid for the four years following, but, not for the fifth. This action is to recover of the defendant,' who was surety on the lease, the taxes assessed May 1,1891, and paid by the plaintiffs after the expiration of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">It is not claimed that the lessee was bound to pay more than five years\u2019 taxes. The contention on the part of the plaintiffs is that under the laws of Massachusetts the lessee was not bound to pay the taxes for the first year of his lease, they having been assessed before the commencement of his term, but was bound for the last year\u2019s taxes, assessed before its end.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In support of this contention it is averred in the statement that \u201cthe said lease was made and executed in Boston, and its covenants were to be performed there, and it was therefore subject to the laws of Massachusetts, under which a tenant who covenanted by his lease to pay the taxes levied and assessed during his term is liable for all taxes levied and assessed during such term. The said Smalley did not pay, and was not bound to pay, the taxes assessed May 1,1886.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">In answer to this averment it is stated in the affidavit of defence that \u201c the said Albert Gr. Smalley, lessee, did not covenant to pay to the plaintiffs the taxes levied and assessed on the demised premises, the words which import such covenant having been scored out in the contract and intended to be eliminated. The taxes now claimed for were not payable for or in respect of the said premises or any part thereof during the said term, but were for taxes payable from the property for the year ending May 1, 1892, covering but one month of the lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">It is not denied that the copy of the lease filed is a true copy, and the court was not informed as to what words were \u201c scored out and intended to be eliminated,\u201d but only as to the defendant\u2019s understanding of the effect of the erasure of certain words which are not given. The assertion that the taxes were not payable for or during the term, with the qualification that they were for the year ending May 1, 1892, is not in denial of the plaintiff\u2019s statement, but is in entire harmony with it, and leaves untouched the essential averment, that under the facts stated? and the written contract, and the law, the defendant is liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s case rests upon the averment of the contract .and of its meaning and effect under the laws of Massachusetts, by which it is to be interpreted. The affidavit denies neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>the contract as' set out nor the law as stated, and is therefore insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\">It is unnecessary to more than refer to the remaining grounds of defence. The mere giving of time to the tenant for the payment of taxes did not release the defendant from his obligation, and as this is a contract of suretyship no previous demand of the principal was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">The judgment of the court is reversed, and it is now ordered that the record be remitted to the court of common pleas, with directions to enter judgment against the defendant for such sums as to right and justice may belong, unless other legal or equitable cause be shown to the court why such judgment should not be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
