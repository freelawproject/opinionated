J. :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-5\">\u201c The purpose of this bill is to restrain the borough of Chambersburg from engaging in the manufacture of electricity for the supply and use of its citizens. The effort is made on two distinct grounds : First, that the act of May 20, 1891, entitled \u2018 An act to authorize any borough now incorporated, or that may hereafter be incorporated, to manufacture electricity for commercial purposes for the use of the inhabitants of said borough, and for this purpose to erect, purchase or condemn electric light plants,\u2019 etc., under which the defendants claim to exercise this right, is unconstitutional, and therefore void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-6\">\u201c Second, that the debt proposed to be incurred by the borough, or which it will necessarily incur, for the purpose aforesaid, will increase the indebtedness of the borough to an amount in excess of the constitutional limit of seven per cent of the assessed valuation of the taxable property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-7\">\u201c In both contentions the conclusions of the master are adverse to the plaintiffs, and they except thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-8\">\u201c The exceptions which relate to the constitutionality of the act of May 20, 1891, are overruled. It is sufficient to say in this connection, that our attention has not been called to any exception or prohibition in the constitution with which the act conflicts; and that we know of none.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-9\">\u201c Nor can the exceptions to the master\u2019s conclusions with respect to the indebtedness of the borough be sustained. It is immaterial whether occupations be regarded as taxable property within the meaning of the constitution, or not, so far as the result here is concerned. Eliminate entirely from the calculation the tax assessed upon occupations, and seven per centum of the assessed valuation of what remains makes a total which exceeds, by several thousand dollars, the debt of the borough at the time referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-10\">\u201c But there is no reason why this tax should be eliminated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Indeed there is express authority-for including it in the calculation. This very point was raised and decided in the case of Brown\u2019s Ap., Ill Pa. 80, and it now admits of no controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-4\">\u201cWe have considered the exceptions to the costs taxed, but are unable to see any good reason why the bill as taxed should not be allowed.

L. 90. It is grounded mainly on allegations which, in substance, are (1) that said act is unconstitutional, and (2) that the debt, which would necessarily be incurred by the borough in carrying into effect its proposed undertaking, will increase its indebtedness to an amount in excess of the constitutional limit of seven per centum of the assessed valuation of taxable property within the corporate limits. As to both of these allegations, the learned master\u2019s findings of fact and legal conclusions are in defendant\u2019s favor. The first five specifications charge error in overruling the several exceptions to the master\u2019s conclusions of law recited therein respectively. For reasons sufficiently stated in the report and in the opinion of the learned president of the common pleas, approving the same, we think there was no error in refusing to sustain either of said exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\">The burden was on the plaintiffs to prove that the indebtedness of the borough would be necessarily increased to an amount exceeding the constitutional limit, etc. In that they were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">While the legislative intention may not be as clearly and happily expressed as it might have been, we fail to discover anything in the provisions of the act that is in conflict with the constitution. The power of the legislature to authorize municipal corporations to supply gas and water for municipal purposes, and for the use and benefit of such of their inhabitants as wish to use and are willing to pay therefor at reasonable rates, has never been seriously questioned. In view of the fact that electricity is so rapidly coming into general use for illuminating streets, public and private buildings, dwellings, etc., why should there be any doubt as to the power to authorize such corporations to manufacture and supply it in like manner as artificial gas has been manufactured and supplied ? It is a mistake to assume that municipal corporations should not keep abreast with the progress and improvements of the age.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The subjects of complaint in the remaining specifications are the learned judge\u2019s refusal to reduce the master\u2019s fee, and the decree dismissing the bill. As to the former he says: \u201cWe are unable to see any good reason why the bill as taxed should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>not be allowed. The master\u2019s work was protracted, and he has given it careful study and attention.\u201d In the absence of any evidence that would justify us in saying that the fee is clearly excessive, we must assume that the compensation sanctioned by the court was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The decree dismissing the bill is the logical sequence of the facts and legal conclusions properly drawn therefrom. The questions involved are so well considered and so satisfactorily disposed of by the learned master and court below, that further comment is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
