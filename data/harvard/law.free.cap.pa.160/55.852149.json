Fernberger, Appellant, <em>v. </em>Butterworth.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b79-10\"><em>Corporations </em>\u2014 Acceptance <em>of constitution by accepting benefit of future legislation </em>\u2014 Cumulative <em>voting </em>\u2014 Quo <em>warranto </em>\u2014 Act <em>of May </em>20, 1891.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b79-11\">AVhere the charter of a corporation granted prior to the constitution of 1874 provided that salaried officers should not be elected directors, the fact that after the passage of the act of May 20, 1891, P. L. 101, which permitted such election, salaried officers were elected directors, does not make the corporation subject to the provision of the constitution of 1874, relating to cumulative voting.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b79-12\">Submitted Jan. 26, 1894.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ABe\">Appeal, No. 18, Jan. T., 1894, by Commonwealth ex rel. Henry Fernberger, from order of C. P. No. 4, Phila.

Thirteen directors were to be elected, and a ticket containing thirteen names, not including the relator\u2019s, received a smaller number of votes, James Butterworth being the lowest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-4\">The Fire Association of Philadelphia was incorporated by-various acts of assembly, all prior in date to the adoption of the constitution of 1874. By its original charter no salaried officer was eligible to the position of director, but whether this had been changed by the supplements was disputed. On May 2Q, 1891, an act was passed authorizing salaried officers of private or business corporations to serve as directors. On Jan. 8,1892, the Fire Association elected as directors two who had been salaried officers the previous year, and who, the answer averred, \u201c were afterwards elected to salaried offices,\u201d by the directors, on the same day. Relator claimed that the action of the association involved an acceptance of the constitution of 1874, so as to give him the privilege of cumulating his votes under art. 16, \u00a7 4.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-5\">Rule for writ discharged.
