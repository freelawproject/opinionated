In substance, the affidavit of defence denies the existence of any such indebtedness, and avers that at the time said assessments were made there was no such indebtedness by the company, nor is there now, and that the very claims for which said assessments were made have been paid. Assuming, as we must for the purposes of this case, that these averments are true, they con\u25a0stitute a substantial traverse of the plaintiff\u2019s claim as presented \u25a0in his statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
