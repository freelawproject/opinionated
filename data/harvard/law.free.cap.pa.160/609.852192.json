Chief Justice Stebbett,</author>\n<p id=\"A1Vc\">The learned court erred in its assumption that the bequest to Walter Man was made contingent upon his- surviving his mother Louisa S. Anson. True the \u201c principal \u201d of the estate was directed to be \u201c divided \u201d \u201c from and after \u201d her death;' but by the express terms of the will it was to be \u201cdivided\u201d among \u201c such \u201d of her children \u201c as should be living at a period not exceeding nine months after\u201d testator\u2019s \u2014 not her \u2014 death. The gift over to testator\u2019s \u201c heirs \u201d obviously had reference to the last antecedent, and could only become operative upon default of \u201c such children \u201d as should be \u201c living \u201d at the \u201c period \u201d fixed by the testator. The death of Mrs. Anson simply marked the limit of her interest and the beginning, in possession, of those entitled in remainder. The rule is conceded that where there is bequest in the form of a direction to pay, or pay and divide \u2019\u201cfrom and after\u201d the happening of any event, \u201cthen the gift being to persons answering a particular description, if a party cannot bring himself within it he is not entitled to take the benefit of the gift. There is no gift in these cases except in the direction to pay, or in the direction to pay and divide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>But if. upon the whole will, it appears that the future gift is only postponed to let in some other interest, or, as the court .has -commonly expressed it, for the greater convenience of the estate, the same reasoning has never been applied to the case. The interest is vested notwithstanding, although the enjoyment is postponed: \u201d Packham v. Gregory, 4 Hare, 898. Upon the whole.of this will, it is apparent that the interest of the children was simply postponed to let in their mother\u2019s. Even without the nine months\u2019 clause, such of her children as survived testator would have thereupon taken vested interests in remainder. That clause, which was evidently intended to embrace- any posthumous child who might be born, extended the time for ascertainment of the class ; and, as Walter Man survived the time so fixed, he took a vested interest which, upon his subsequent death, passed by operation of law to his personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">This view is not in conflict with the decision of this court in Cascaden\u2019s Estate, 153 Pa. 170. There the legatee died before the happening of the contingency upon which his interest was to vest, while here he survived.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Nor is there any ground for presumption in favor of the testator\u2019s heirs at law. The children of Louisa S. Anson were preferred objects of his bounty, as the will shows, and every intendment is in their favor. As already seen, testator\u2019s heirs at law could only have taken \u201c in default of such children \u201d of Louisa S. Anson as should be \u201c living at a period not exceeding-nine months after\u201d testator\u2019s death, and Waltpr Man, who was one of these children, having survived the testator, necessarily thereupon took a vested interest. \u00ab</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Decree reversed with costs to be paid by the appellees; and it is now adjudged and decreed that the balance for distribution, to wit: Twenty-seven thousand nine _ hundred and fiftysev.en dollars and seventy-one cents ($27,957.71), subject to apportionment of income accruing at.the death of the tenant for life, be awarded to Edward A. S. Man, George E. Man, Juliet D. Man, administratrix of Walter Man, deceased, and Jane Man, in equal shares.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
