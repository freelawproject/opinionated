Has the act of 1891 prescribed a different and inconsistent mode ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-5\">\u201c All the powers conferred by this act, relative to the laying out, opening and widening of streets and alleys, are to be found in its 1st, 8th and 9th sections.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-6\">\u201c The 1st provides \u2018 That all municipal corporations of this commonwealth shall have power, whenever it is deemed necessary in the laying out, opening, widening, extending or grading of streets, lanes or alleys, .... to take, use, occupy or injure private lands, property or material.\u2019 No power is here conferred to lay out, open, etc., streets and alleys, but when that power already exists and is being exercised, \u2018 in the laying out, opening,\u2019 etc., an additional power is conferred upon the municipality, if \u2018 it shall be deemed necessary,\u2019 \u2018 to take, use, occupy or injure private lands, property or material.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-7\">\u201c Nor is the power claimed conferred by the 8th section. The first paragraph of that section provides that \u2018 every municipal corporation shall have power to lay out, establish or re-establish,\u2019 not streets and alleys, but \u2018 grades of streets and alleys,\u2019 and the second empowers said corporations, upon a petition of a majority of property owners in interest and number, abutting on the line of the proposed improvement, .... to grade, pave, curb, macadamize and otherwise improve any public street or public alley,\u2019 etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-8\">\u201c The 9th section does however authorize said municipalities \u2018 to open, widen, straighten or extend streets or alleys, or parts thereof, within its limits, and to vacate the same,\u2019 \u2014 but onty \u2018 upon the petition of a majority in interest and number of owners of property abutting on the line of the proposed improvement.\u2019 But even this section does not authorize municipalities to lay out or ordain streets and alleys, but only \u2018to open, widen, straighten or extend \u2019 them when laid out; and though it should be held that in the power to open is included the power also to lay out, still this would be only an additional, and not the sole and exclusive method.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>\u201c As was said by the Supreme Court in commenting upon this section, in Hanover Borough\u2019s Appeal, supra, where the laying out, opening, etc., of streets was regulated by the act of April 3, 1851, the general borough act: \u2018 There is nothing repugnant in the existence of two methods of initiating the improvement. ... A precise analogy is to be found in the city of Philadelphia, where streets may be opened, on their own motion, by councils, or by the court of quarter sessions upon petition, and doubtless similar double methods coexist in other municipalities of the state. Repeals by implication are never favored, and the implication would have to be very strong indeed to justify a court in adjudging an implied repeal of the power to lay out, open and widen streets, which has existed in some form from the colonial days, and is an essential part of our modern conception of a municipality of any grade.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-4\">\u201c The act of 1891 apparently assumes that the power to sur vey, lay out and ordain streets and alleys in the municipalities of the commonwealth already exists somewhere ; and that power it does not pretend to alter or interfere with, as its provisions become available only after that power has been exercised by the proper tribunal, aud the streets and alleys have been surveyed and laid out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-5\">\u201c Being of the opinion therefore that the act of 1891 merely provides an additional method for the opening of streets and alleys in municipalities, and does not by implication repeal the provisions of the act of June 13, 1836, relating to the same, the exceptions are dismissed, and the report of the jury is confirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were dismissing exceptions, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b116-7\"><em>William T.

L. 75, entitled: \u201cAn act in relation to the laying out, opening, widening, straightening, extending or vacating streets and alleys, and the construction of bridges in the several municipalities of this commonwealth,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">After a careful consideration of the subject, and for reasons which are entirely satisfactory, the learned judge of the court below came to the conclusion \u201c that the act of 1891 merely provides an additional method for the opening of streets and alleys in municipalities, and does not by implication repeal the provisions of the act of June 13, 1836, P. L. 551, relating to the same \u201d subject. The logical result of this conclusion was the decree dismissing exceptions to the report of the viewers and confirming their report.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">All that is necessary to be said on the controlling question in the case will be found in the clear and able opinion of the learned judge of the quarter sessions; and on that we affirm the decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
