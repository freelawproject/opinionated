Pottsville Railroad Company and the Pennsylvania Schuylkill Valley Railroad Company, that, at the time of the filing of the bill, the plaintiffs had proposed and had arranged, at and beyond the Lebanon Valley bridge in the city of Reading, to connect their said railroad with the railroad then about to be constructed by the Reading &amp; Pottsville Railroad Company from the point of connection aforesaid to the borough of Pottsville, in the county of Schuylkill, Pennsylvania, as averred in the sixth paragraph of the plaintiffs\u2019 bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-3\">\u201cThe master finds that the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company, the defendants, are operating other railroads tying and being between the points named, and to which railroads the railroad and branch so as aforesaid since constructed by the said plaintiffs are parallel and competing lines, as averred in the eighth paragraph of the plaintiffs\u2019 bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-4\">\u201c The ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth paragraphs of the plaintiffs\u2019 bill relate more particularly to the controversy between the parties arising out of the defendants\u2019 attempting to relay and extend their siding on the River road, and their attempt to extend the same over and across the location of the plaintiffs\u2019 main line, in order to connect their railroad system with the Schuylkill Navigation Company\u2019s canal, which is controlled and operated by the defendants under a contract and lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-5\">\u201c To determine the defendants\u2019 power and authority in the premises, regard must be had as to the right of their occupancy of the River road, to the use of the siding, and to the object and purpose of the construction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-6\">\u201c The master finds that this siding on the River road was originally constructed by the Berks County Railroad Company in 1872; that it extended from Court street in a northerly direction and parallel with the main track of the Berks County Railroad for a distance of nineteen hundred and forty feet six inches to a point opposite the property now or late of Henry Ruth; that this siding had not been in use for some time prior to the filing of the plaintiffs\u2019 bill, but that after the location of the plaintiffs\u2019 mainline the defendants began to relay the siding, and were about extending it across the plaintiffs\u2019 location at Buttonwood street over and upon the defendants\u2019 land to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>defendants\u2019 wharf at the canal, a distance of eight hundred and thirty-eight feet, when the defendants were restrained, by injunction at the instance of the plaintiffs, after which no further efforts were made by the defendants to complete their construction. The defendants had succeeded in laying the track in a temporary way across the plaintiffs\u2019 route and on their own property for a distance of about eight hundred and three feet, and [were about raising the track to grade, placing it in proper shape, and conforming it to their main line and making it convenient and serviceable with their siding, when, in obedience to the writ, their construction ceased.] [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-4\">\u201c [The plaintiffs, in entire disregard to the injunctional order, unlawfully tore up and removed the defendants\u2019 track back to the line of the Ruth property, a distance of about three hundred and thirty feet, placing the materials upon defendants\u2019 land.] [7] The plaintiffs then completed the construction of their main track and have been operating it ever since, whilst the [defendants have been entirely deprived of access by rail to their wharf, and have lost a convenient transferring point for freight from the canal to the railroad, or from the railroad to the canal.] [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-5\">\u201c At this point on the River road, which is sixty feet wide, there are now located the following tracks, namely, the main line of the Schuylkill &amp; Lehigh Railroad, the defendants\u2019 lessor, the defendants\u2019 siding, which starts at Court street, in part removed, and the main track of the plaintiffs, from which, at a short distance below Buttonwood street, a siding extends parallel with the main line.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-6\">\u201c The plaintiffs contend that the defendants\u2019 construction, particularly the crossing over the plaintiffs\u2019 route, was in part located upon the River road and upon the plaintiffs\u2019 lot, thus appropriating the same whereon the plaintiffs\u2019 route was previously located, and that the defendants\u2019 track across the plaintiffs\u2019 route was at such a declivity with reference to the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed railroad track as to render it difficult and impracticable in crossing at grade, that it was an obstruction to the plaintiffs, and was made by the defendants for the purpose of hindering and debarring the plaintiffs from an occupancy authorized by various statutory enactments and by the various ordinances of the city of Reading. In short, the plaintiffs contend that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>removal of the defendants\u2019 track was absolutely necessaiy in order to enable them to construct their main track.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-3\">\u201c The defendants, in answer, aver that their construction of this siding was on their own property and across the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed railroad, that they were relaying and extending their track on the River road, which was but a continuance of their Court street siding, across the plaintiffs\u2019 route and over their own property, for the purpose of preserving their trade and facilitating their business between their railroad and their canal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-4\">\u201cAt this point in dispute the defendants own land on both sides of the River road, and they possess all the rights and privileges of the Berks County Railroad, the power and franchises of its own charter, and the rights, privileges and franchises of the Schuylkill Navigation Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-5\">\u201c It appears that some time prior to the construction of the plaintiffs\u2019 railroad, or rather before its contemplated location on the River road was made known, an effort was made by certain of the city officers to acquire a portion of the road upon which the siding had been located for public use, the siding being then not actually used for railroad purposes. The defendants declined to accede to the request, and refused to permit the removal of the siding by the city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">\u201c The plaintiffs have submitted certain propositions, which the master proceeds to consider:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-7\">\u201c \u2018 1st. That the plaintiffs\u2019 railroad between Penn street and the Lebanon Valley bridge was located in March, 1883.\u2019 This, in so far as it relates to location, is in accord with the allegation in the third paragraph of the plaintiffs\u2019 bill, and, although not admitted by the defendants in their answer, is not denied. The master finds, however, that in point of fact [the plaintiffs, in March, 1883, had simply located their route for a railroad over the ground in controversy by preliminary and tentative surveys; in short, they ran lines and drove stakes, and that therefore there was no actual location or construction of a track over this route in March, 1883.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-8\">\u201c \u2018 2d. That the defendants at the time of the plaintiffs\u2019 location had abandoned their route along there.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-9\">\u201c The testimony of the defendants establishes conclusively that a use was made by the defendants of the track at intervals during the entire period, from the time of the leasing of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Berks County road to the defendants until the date of this controversy. Mr. Dale, in speaking of this track being used, says this track was always <em>used; </em>that in 1882 he took up a rail with the calculation of putting it back again; that he never did so, because the road was leased shortly afterwards. He further testifies that \u2018it is a usual thing to move rails around from one part of the road to the other.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-4\">\u201c It also appears in evidence that Mr. Roberts, president of the plaintiffs\u2019 company, on March 27,1884, offered to purchase the siding from the defendants; that no sale was consummated, and that within a few days after the offer was made the defendants commenced the construction of the branch in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-5\">\u201c The master finds that the defendants had not entirely abandoned this track as claimed by the plaintiffs at the time of the plaintiffs\u2019 location.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-6\">\u201c \u2018 3d. That the siding formerly extending from Court to Buttonwood street was the property of Bushong &amp; Craig.\u2019 Mr. Craig received some toll for the use of this siding during a portion of the time, but such testimony, when considered with reference to the testimony of his partner, Mi'. Bushong, who disavows all ownership, is therefore entirely insufficient to establish any ownership in Mr. Craig. Mr. Bushong, being examined, testified as follows: \u2018 Q. Do you remember the second track on River street, running from Court out up the river? Who put the track there ? A. The Berks County Railroad Company. Q. Something has been said about Craig and you claiming the track as owners ? A. It never belonged to us ; the Berks County Railroad put down that track.\u2019 The master finds that the siding is not the property of Bushong &amp; Craig.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-7\">\u201c \u2018 4th. That the siding, of which they, the plaintiffs, complained in their bill, which was laid in April, 1884, was made to obstruct the construction of the said plaintiffs\u2019 road, and was not practicable for the professed purpose for which this siding was laid.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-8\">\u201c The master finds under the testimony in this case [that the siding in question was a practicable siding for the purposes of defendants\u2019 business, and that its construction as contemplated was fully authorized by the corporate power and authority of the defendants.] [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-9\">\u25a0 \u201c The fact that its construction was stimulated by the contem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>plated construction of the plaintiffs\u2019 railroad is unimportant, and the fact that to some extent it may have obstructed the plaintiffs\u2019 railroad is likewise immaterial, because it is manifest from the testimony that this obstruction was due entirely to the hastiness of the construction of the siding and to the defendants\u2019 inability to properly complete it by reason of the plaintiffs\u2019 writ of injunction. It is also apparent that the rapid descent of the defendants\u2019 track at the point in controversy, specially complained of by the plaintiffs, can under the testimony of both parties be easily obviated by properly constructing, grading and aligning said track so that the plaintiffs can readily cross the same, and both the defendants\u2019 siding and the plaintiffs\u2019 railroad can exist.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-3\">\u201c [The master under these findings, based largely upon the testimony not submitted to the court at the time of its decision continuing the preliminary injunction [16 W. N. 165], does therefore not regard the affirmance of that decree by the Supreme Court as decisive of'the question.] [9] \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-4\">\u201c The master is of opinion that on the law and the facts [the plaintiffs have no such standing as to entitle them to a reinedy by injunction,] [8] for such a remedy is never granted unless there is a clear right which is violated, resulting in irreparable injury, and when there is no adequate remedy at law. Such facts have not been established by the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-5\">\u201c The master therefore, in view of the corporate power and authority of the defendants and the facts as ascertained, regards the construction by the defendants as having been but the lawful exercise of an undoubted prior right on the River road, and therefore decides that [the defendants were lawfully authorized to extend their siding and to cross the plaintiffs\u2019 location at grade in the construction of their tracks to connect the defendants\u2019 railroad system with the Schuylkill Navigation Company\u2019s canal, which is controlled and operated by the defendants under a contract and lease.] [10]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-6\">\u201c [The master further decides that the siding was a practical one for the purposes of the defendants, and that it was no insuperable obstruction to the plaintiffs\u2019 railroad.] \u201d [11]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-7\">The remaining portion of the master\u2019s report related to the controversy over the occupation of Front and Canal streets decided in plaintiff\u2019s favor by the appeal reported in 157 Pa. 42.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>The master recommended that both the bill and cross bill should be dismissed, and the costs should be divided equally between the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-4\">Exceptions to the master\u2019s report, among others as in brackets, were overruled by the court, in an opinion, which, so far as it relates to the controversy involved in this appeal, was as follows, by Endlich, J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-5\">\u201c This cause has been kept by the parties in the hands of the master for a trifle over seven years, with but an occasional and fitful effort to break its profound slumber. In the meanwhile, the failure to justify by theoretical and conjectural testimony the anticipations of wrong and disaster on which this litigation was originally grounded has given room to a practical demonstration of their baselessness. The experience gathered in the course of these years has disposed of every substantial difficulty in the case. All that remains is a question of abstract technical \u00f1ght and of costs. The master, in his report, recommends the dismissal of both bill and cross bill, and an equal division of the costs of the whole proceeding between the parties. His report is now before us, together with eighteen exceptions filed on the one side and twenty-three on the other. In considering these exceptions, few of which merit any discussion, it is unnecessary to rehearse the history of the contending parties with reference to the locality covered by this litigation \u2014 of their origins, consolidations, absorptions, locations, constructions, and past strifes. The material facts concerning these details are fully stated in the report, and have, moreover, been so often threshed out in this court as to render their restatement a wearisome and unprofitable toil.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-6\">\u201c Plaintiffs\u2019 exceptions, Nos. 5, 6 and 11, relate to the power of the defendant to construct and its bona fides in constructing the branch, its action in relation to which became the occasion of this suit. In the light of the testimony in the case it can scarcely be open to dispute that the defendant had the power to build the branch at the time when it undertook to do so. In so far as the legitimacy of the exercise of that power, as dependent upon the bona fides of the attempt, is important here\u2014 the element in this case, indeed, mainly dwelt upon by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel at the argument, \u2014 the finding of the master in favor of the defendants being based not simply upon deductions and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>ferences from other facts shown or admitted, but also in a large degree upon direct testimony of witnesses examined before him,is entitled to great weight (Phillips\u2019s Ap., 68 Pa. 130, 138), and will not be disturbed unless clear error is apparent. The allegations of plaintiffs\u2019 bill in the particular now uiider discussion are explicitly denied by the answer. Bearing in mind, the rules of equity practice as to the amount of evidence necessary to overcome such denial (Ibid, page 139), a review of the testimony fails to show that the master\u2019s conclusions are wrong.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-3\">\u201c No. 17 is meritorious' in so far as it objects to the recommendation to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 bill. The finding of the master that the plaintiff is not entitled to the injunction it prays for is based, in part, upon the fact that the construction of the defendants\u2019 branch will not be an insuperable obstacle to the building and operation of plaintiff\u2019s railroad, because, as shown by the evidence, the former may be so accomplished as to enable the plaintiff conveniently to cross it. If this is to be a ground for refusing the injunction, and if it is further true,' as the master finds, that the plaintiff has the right to build its railroad in the manner claimed, and that the possibility of the crossing referred to is a condition of the coexistence of the defendants\u2019 branch and the plaintiffs\u2019 road, then, under the general prayer of the bill, the decree ought to be so framed as to conserve whatever equities the plaintiff may have in the premises. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-4\">\u201c There remains only the recommendation to divide costs, objected to by the plaintiffs\u2019 eighteenth and the defendants\u2019 twenty-second exceptions. If both bills were to be wholly dismissed, the logical disposition of the costs would seem to be to let the plaintiff pay those apportionable to the bill and the defendant those apportionable to the cross bill: Baum v. Wicklein, 2 Woodw. 242. But the plaintiffs\u2019 bill is not to be wholly dismissed. In view of this result, it seems to me that an equal division of the costs is justified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-5\">\u201c The plaintiff\u2019s seventeenth exception will be sustained to the extent indicated in the foregoing opinion ; the remaining exceptions of plaintiffs and the exceptions of defendants will be dismissed ; the report of the master will be approved except in the particular mentioned ; and counsel will prepare and submit the proper decree sec. reg.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\u201c Now, Dec. 5, 1892, this cause came on to be heard at this term and was argued by counsel, and thereupon, upon consideration thereof, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed as follows, viz.: that the preliminar}* injunction heretofore granted against the defendants be dissolved and the plaintiffs\u2019 bill be dismissed, saving, however, to the plaintiffs the right to construct and maintain their railroad as at present located or constructed, and that the defendants\u2019 cross bill be dismissed, each party to pay half the costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-4\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were dismissal of exceptions and decree, quoting them respectively.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b268-5\"><em>Cyrus G-.
