J., plaintiff introduced evidence which tended to show that, on Feb. 4, 1888, plaintiff received a check for $824.86 from a building association, and \u2022that she loaned the money to her husband, Edward J. Leedom, who indorsed the cheek, and apparently received the money. Mrs. Leedom testified that in February, 1889, her husband paid back to her $800 which she kept in the house, and on March 1, 1889, it was placed in the hands of defendant, who has failed and refused to return it to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-7\">Defendant offered to show by declarations of plaintiff\u2019s husband that the building association money drawn Feb. 4, 1888, was deposited in the First National Bank in the name of Edward Leedom, and soon thereafter the same money was loaned to his brother, John Leedom, a note taken therefor, which is the note plaintiff held and had in her possession until 1889, when the same was paid back into the hands of Edward Leedom and again deposited in the same bank in his own name, and remained \u2022\u2022there until his death, Nov. 19, 1889. This offer was made for \u2022the purpose of tracing this identical fund from the time it was \u25a0paid by the building association up to the time of Edward Lee-Mom\u2019s death. The several offers were objected to on the \u25a0.ground that the declarations were made in the absence of the 'wife. [1-8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-8\">The plaintiff proposed to show, by the defendant, on eross- \u25a0 examination, that he, defendant, did not employ counsel to defend this case. Admitted under objection.

Objection sustained. Exception. [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-5\">Plaintiff proposed to prove by Lawrence Ressler that he knew Edward J. Leedorn ; that in the month of February, 1889, Edward J. Leedorn came to his saloon in the city of Reading, having in his possession a large amount of money in gold and in notes; that he was giving some of it away and that the witness told him that he should take that money home and give it to his wife. This for the purpose of showing that on or about the middle of February, 1889, at the time at which the plaintiff alleges that her husband gave her this money, her husband had money to give away; also, for the purpose of answering that part of the defendant\u2019s case which seeks to show by the condition of Edward Leedom\u2019s 'bank account and by the extent of his estate, that he did not have $800 to give her at that time, and for the general purposes of the case. Objected to as not being rebuttal, and as generally incompetent and inadmissible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-6\">The Court: The facts are admitted but not the conversation. Exception. [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-7\">The witness testified substantially as in the offer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-8\">By Mr. Derr: A reference to the testimony shows that the defendant\u2019s counsel did inquire of Mrs. Leedorn as to what was said by her husband when he gave her this $800. I desire to call your honor\u2019s attention to that, and renew my offer to ask her what else was said, and what if anything was said about Mr. Ressler.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-9\">By Mr. Jacobs : Objected to; she cannot give declarations against the defendant made by other parties, in his absence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-10\">By the Court: We think they are entitled to have the-conversation, in so far as it may be relevant to this issue, inasmuch as it has been gone into somewhat on cross-examination. Admitted. Exception for defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>By Mr. Derr : Q. State all that was said by your husband at the time when he handed back the $800 to you, in February, 1889.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-4\">Mr. Jacobs : Counsel for defendant asks what is proposed to be proven. Is it what other people said, or is it what defendant should have said ? If it is what defendant said, there is no objection to it. If it is what other people said it is objected to, for the reason that, on cross-examination, the witness was not ^ asked what was said, nor to give the whole conversation, and . was only asked whether the husband did not say, \u201c This is your money from the building association,\u201d in order to identify the money, she having said that her husband had given her back the money, and any inquiry as to the whole conversation would be irrelevant. The act of a party or a portion of his words may be proven against him, we admit, but it is in rebuttal only that the whole conversation may be drawn out for the purpose of explanation. Here, there is no necessity for explanation, and it is immaterial and irrelevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-5\">Mr. Keiser : The question put by counsel for defendant, in order to identify this particular money, were not words proven against the party, within the rule of Steckel v. Desh, 2 Penny. 803, 313, and such as could be rebutted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-6\">Objection <em>overrul\u00e9d; </em>exception for defendant.

State all that was said by your husband at the time when he handed back the $800 to you, in February, 1889. A. When he handed back the money to me he says, \u201c Here is your $800 coming to you from the building association.\u201d He said, \u201c I have been away at Mr. Kessler\u2019s saloon, and I gave some money away while I was there, and Mr. Kessler said, \u2018 Ed., you go home and give this money to your wife,\u2019 and here it is.

There is no complaint as to the manner in which said questions were submitted. The assignments of error relate solely to certain rulings of the learned trial judge on questions of evidence. The first, second, third and sixth specifications allege error in rejecting defendant\u2019s offers of testimony therein recited respectively; and the remaining three complain of the admission of testimony offered on behalf of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">We have considered the questions thus presented, and are not convinced that there is any substantial error in either of said rulings. There appears to be nothing in the record that requires a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
