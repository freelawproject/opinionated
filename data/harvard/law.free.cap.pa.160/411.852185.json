(2) If entitled to recover, whether the statute of limitations is a valid partial defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-3\">The court subsequently entered judgment for $74,584.34, in the following opinion by McPherson, J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-4\">\u201cBy section 8 of the act of May 8, 1850, P. L. 751, it was provided, inter alia, that all damages caused by the laying out of any street or alley in the city of Lancaster should be paid, not by the county but by the city. This of course included damages for injuring or removing buildings as well as for the taking of land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-5\">\u201c The act of 1854, P. L. 352, which repealed section 8\u2019 of the act of 1850, relieved the city to some extent. It left it liable, as under the act of 1850, for all damages caused by injuring or removing buildings, but allowed it to apply to the payment of damages for land taken a certain proportion of the county tax collected from the taxpayers of the city. This is the substance of the act although the result just stated is reached by a somewhat roundabout process. The method adopted by the act is this : The county is made primarily liable to the landowner for the damages caused by taking his land, the city continuing to be liable, both first and last, for the damages caus\u00e9d by injuring and removing buildings. In any given year the amount thus advanced by the county (and it is really nothing more than an advance on behalf of the city) is charged against the city, and the city is then credited with the proportion of county tax which its taxpayers have contributed towards opening roads and erecting and repairing bridges' in the county. If the difference is in favor of the city it is entitled to be paid in money (which it may recover by suit if necessary), or to have a credit carried over to the next year, but if the difference is in favor of the county, i. e., if the city has spent in advance a part of its proportion of the county tax for the next year, then the damages for land taken (as between the county and the city) are no longer to be paid by the county but by the city, until there is again a balance in favor of the city, whereupon these damages are once more to be paid by the county, but (as between the county and the city) only \u2018 to the extent of such balance.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>\u201c It seems quite clear that this simply amounts to allowing the city-to draw back a varying sum each year from the county tax, and to use it in payment for land taken in opening streets. But the landowner is not bound to inquire into the state of the accounts between the county and city and to look to one or the other as the balance may be found to incline. As between the county and the landowner the county is made primarily liable to any extent which viewers and juries may determine ; but, as between the county and the city, the county is only bound to pay for this particular purpose a varying proportion (but one easily calculated) year by year, of the city\u2019s contribution to the county tax. If this proportion is not enough to repay the county its advances to the landowners, one of two things may be done: Either the balance against the city may be carried over for a year or for several years in the hope that succeeding credits may restore the equilibrium; or if the balance is so large that this would involve a delay the county considers unreasonable, an action may be brought to recover what is due, and a new starting point for the future accounting may be reached. Indeed, there is a third course which the county may adopt if it sees proper: It may sue for any balance in its favor, whether large or small, but ordinarily we presume so strict a settlement would not he insisted upon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-4\">\u201c In brief, the act makes the county the paymaster for land taken, and requires it to advance to the landowner whatever may be needed for this purpose, whether the city is its debtor or its creditor; but, as between the city and the county, the county is only bound to pay \u2014 or perhaps to speak more accurately, to pay back \u2014 the city\u2019s due proportion of the county tax. This proportion the county controls, for it has the money in its own hands ; whatever sum it pays beyond this is really lent to the city \u2014 lent by compulsion of the statute, and in our opinion may be recovered by suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-5\">\u201c This view of the act of 1854 is only a restatement in other language of the construction already announced by the Supreme Court in Lancaster County v. Frey, 128 Pa. 598, as a few extracts from the opinion will show. On pages 597 and 598 Mr. Justice Clark says: \u2018 It is conceded that by force of the second section of the act \u00f3f 1854 all sums awarded for damages for the opening of streets in the city of Lancaster are to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>paid out of the county treasury, with the exception of such damages as may accrue from the removal of or injury to any house, etc., which are to be separately assessed and paid out of the city treasury. The second section as thus construed is a complete adjustment of the rule of responsibility attaching to the city and the county for the opening of streets within the city. ... In the third section it is assumed that under the second the county will expend county funds in payment of damages as therein provided, and the policy of the third section is that the city shall not thus withdraw from the county fund more than she contributes to it; that is to say, the city is responsible to the county that the amount thus expended in its behalf shall not exceed the amount contributed by the city to the county funds for opening roads,\u2019 etc. He then shows that the one hundred and eighteenth word in the third section should be read city \u2019 instead of \u2018 county \u2019 \u2014a conclusion which we adopt in the present case, as the question is again raised and we are asked to pass upon it \u2014 and proceeds to say on page 599 : \u2018 But this obligation of the city was to the county, upon which by the second section the primary obligation to pay was imposed.\u2019 After explaining why the county must be primarily liable to the landowner, the learned justice declares that the city must repay the county if the latter has been forced to advance too much; \u2018 hence it was provided that the county commissioners should- open an account with the city of Lancaster, showing the amount contributed by the city to the county treasurer towards opening roads, etc., on the one side, and the amount withdrawn from the county treasury for opening streets, etc., in the city on the other side; and, whilst the balance on that account was against the city, the damages incurred in the opening of streets in the city should be payable out of the treasury of the city \u2014 payable to the county, of course, who is primarily liable to the property holder.\u2019 The opinion is summarized i'n the concluding sentence: \u2018 We are of opinion that the question of the liability of the city in each case can only be raised in a proceeding between the county and the city; that the property holder must resort to the county treasury, and the county must in a proper case resort to the city; and further, that the city upon payment of any such claim is reimbursable out of the county treasury, when the balance is in favor \u2022of the city, to the extent .of such balance.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>\u201c It will be observed that this construction accords with the rule declared by Mr. Justice Shabswood in Holl v. Deshler, 71 Pa. 301: \u2018Every part of a statute should be brought into action in order to collect from the whole one uniform and consistent sense if that may be done, or, in other words, the construction must be made upon the entire statute and not merely upon disjointed parts of it: Broom\u2019s Leg. Max. 513. \u201c It is the most natural and genuine exposition of a statute,\u201d says Lord Coke, \u201c to construe one part of the statute by another pai*t of the same statute, for that best expresseth the meaning of the makers.\u201d \u2019 The same rule is to be found in Potter\u2019s Dwarris on Statutes, p. 144, in this language: \u2018In the construction of a statute every part of it must be viewed in connection with the whole, so as to make all its parts harmonize if practicable and give a sensible and intelligent effect to each. It is not to be presumed that the legislature intended any part of a statute to be without meaning.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-5\">\u201c And to this construction it is not sufficient to object that the act does not expressly give the county a right to sue, and, therefore, that no suit of any kind can be maintained. For the act clearly requires the county to advance money on behalf of the city, and, unless it manifestly appeared that the county was restrained from recovering its advances, it seems to us that this necessarily carries with it a right to sue if repayment is refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-6\">\u201c As to the form of action, we. think.it may be either assumpsit or a bill in equity. Ordinarily assumpsit would be an adequate remedy, and in the case before us at least we see no need for a resort to equity. All the facts are either agreed upon or not disputed, there are no complex, mutual rights to be adjusted, and the only contention is over the proper legal principles to be applied. It is easy to do complete justice in this proceeding, and it would, therefore, be most inequitable at the very end of the controversy to turn the parties over to another tribunal and, merely for the sake of form, compel them to prove again the facts already proved or admitted, and to advance again the same legal propositions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-7\">\u201cFor the same reason, namely, the ability of the court to do complete justice, either in this proceeding or by bill in equity, the remedy by mandamus is not appropriate. This writ lies \u2018 where there is a clear legal right in the relator, a correspond<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>ing duty in the defendant, and a want of any other adequate, appropriate and specific remedy : \u2019 Easton v. Water Co., 97 Pa. 560. It is used \u2018only as a process in the last resort; never where there is a specific remedy: \u2019 Ins. Co. v. Com., 92 Pa. 77.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-3\">\u201c It was argued, however, that, even if a right of action is given by the statute, the keeping of the account mentioned in section 3 is a condition precedent, and as no such account is shown to have been kept, no recover}' can be had in the present suit. Doubtless the act does contemplate the keeping of a formal account, and such an account ought to be kept, but we think the provision is directory merely, and that the failure to keep it will not prevent a recovery. It is not always easy to determine whether a provision is mandatory or only directory, but there are two good rules which are often of much assistance in deciding this question. The first is referred to in Bladen v. Phila., 60 Pa. page 466: \u2018 Where the words are affirmative and relate to the manner in which power or jurisdiction vested in a public office or body is to be exercised, and not to the limits of the power or jurisdiction itself, they may and often have been construed to be directory.\u2019 See also Pittsburgh v. Coursin, 74 Pa. 401; Dewhurst v. Allegheny, 95 Pa. 442; Hersberger v. Pittsburgh, 115 Pa. 86; Cusick\u2019s Election, 136 Pa. 470; Potter\u2019s Dwar. St., p. 222, note 29. The other side of the rule is approved in Norwegian St., 81 Pa. 353-4, in the following language : \u2018 There is a class of cases which hold that whether a statute is to be regarded as directory or not, is made to depend upon the employment or failure to employ negative words which import that an act should be done in a particular manner or time and not otherwise.\u2019 Perhaps Lord Mansfield\u2019s rule in Rex v. Loxdale, 1 Burr. 445, is a better one (and this is the second rule we have in view), that \u2018 whether a statute is mandatory or not depends on whether the thing directed to be done is the essence of the thing required.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-4\">\u201c Tried by either of these rules, we think it must be said that the direction to keep an account is not a condition precedent either to the county\u2019s right to sue or its right to recover; and we may add that in fact no harm has been done by the failure to keep the account, for we have now before us in orderly detail every item which such an account, if kept year by year, would have shown, and these items have always been readily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>accessible to either party in the records of the county and'of the county offices.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-4\">\u25a0 \u201cWe are of opinion, therefore, that the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this action, but are also of the opinion that the statute of limitations is a valid defence to part of its claim. Taxes are yearly contributions; almost all public accounts are settled annually, and we think the act contemplates yearly settlements and the striking of a balance once a twelve-month. If this had been formally done there could be no doubt that a right of action would have accrued year by year when the balance was struck, and that the statute would now bar recovery, except for six years preceding date of suit. In effect, however, the county has been treated in this action as if the account had actually been kept as required by the act, and we think it may'fairly be held to all the consequences which in that event would have followed. Moreover, as the balance each year was hardly more \u2014 and might indeed be nothing more \u2014than a matter of arithmetical calculation, it does not seem unreasonable to consider the balance as formally struck, although the computations were not actually made. And still further \u2014 and perhaps alone of decisive weight \u2014 since the duty of keeping the account was laid upon the county, it can hardly set up its own neglect as a successful answer to the plea of the statute, and thus derive a benefit from its failure to obey the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-5\">\u201c The amounts named in-the verdict were agreed upon by the parties, and, in accordance with the views above expressed, we direct judgment to be entered for the plaintiff on the points reserved in the sum of seventy-four thousand five hundred and eighty-four dollars and thirty-four cents ($74,584.34).\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was entry of judgment as above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-7\"><em>W.

L. 352, entitled \u201c An act relative to the opening of streets in the city of Lancaster.\u201d That act was properly before us for construction in County of Lancaster v. Frey, 128 Pa. 593 ; and after full consideration it was there held that the word \u201c county,\u201d which is the one hundred and eighteenth word in the 3d section thereof, is a clerical mistake, for the word \u201c city,\u201d apparent on the face of the act. In delivering the opinion of the court our late brother Clark; said: \u201c It is perfectly manifest that the word \u2018 county,\u2019 the one hundred and eighteenth word in the third section, is a mere clerical error in the transcribing of the act. That the damages should be paid out of the treasury of the county and be reimbursable out of the county treasury, etc., is a manifest misuse of words. No such thing could have been in the mind of the legislature, for the proposition involves an absurdity. The obvious meaning and purpose of the act is plain from the context. It needs no argument to show that the word \u2018 county \u2019 was mistakenly written for \u2018 city,\u2019 and it is a mistake apparent on the face of the act, which may be rectified by the context.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The very able and ingenious argument of learned counsel for defendant, on the question of construction, etc., induced us to reconsider the subject, but we are not convinced that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>construction given to the act in the case referred to is either erroneous or unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\">In his clear and exhaustive opinion on the questions of law reserved, the learned judge of the common pleas has not only recognized and acted upon the authority of the case above cited, but he has also so well considered and correctly disposed of all the material questions involved that we deem it unnecessary to add anything to what he has so well said.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">We find nothing in the record that requires either reversal or modification of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
