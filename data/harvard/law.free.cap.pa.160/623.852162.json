The following opinion was filed by Krebs, P. J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-8\">\u201c The bill in this case involves the question of the plaintiff company\u2019s right to cross five branches of the defendant company\u2019s line between Philipsburg, its northern and eastern terminus, and its connection with the Beech Creek Railroad and its southern and western terminus at Janesville. For a proper understanding of what is involved in this controversy on the one side and the other, we deem it of the utmost importance that there should be set out as briefly but as clearly as may be the following details: (1) A statement of the topographical position of the territory traversed by these lines of railroad as constructed and projected. (2) The position of the field in its geological aspect as a freight-producing field and its importance in this respect. (3) The finding of the admitted or undisputed facts in the case as they bear upon the merits of the controversy in hand in relation to all of the five branches sought to be crossed. (4) The findings-of the facts as they relate to each separate branch. (5) The statement of the law. (6) The appropriate decree for each crossing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-9\">\u201c The topographical position of the territory traversed by these lines of railroad already constructed and now projected is deemed material because it bears directly upon the location of the lines as laid down and constructed and in process of construction. It will hardly be disputed that where a line of railroad has been constructed and in operation, whether for a long time or a short time, with its branches and laterals running out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>from it, that a newline entering the field must so locate its lines as to do the least amount of injury, consistent Avith any reasonable expenditure of capital, to the older and first located and constructed line, in its operation, both as to the main stem and its lateral feeders or branches. The topography of the country is therefore material, and is an existing fact, open to the notice of the court, Avhether fully in proof or not. Much may be gleaned from the evidence of the witnesses in the case, in addition to Avhat is notorious to all who have studied the geological formation of the first bituminous coal basin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-3\">\u201c The general trend of the crest of the Allegheny mountains is northeast and southAvest, and on the Avestern slope the Moshannon creek and its tributaries floAV in a northeasterly direction for quite a long distance. The valley of the stream is narrow, Avith the hills rising in most portions of its course close from its banks. Starting at Philipsburg and going in a southerly direction up the stream, the tributary coming in on the northern and Avestern side is the Crowell run, up Avhich is constructed the Mapleton branch of the Tyrone &amp; Clearfield Railroad. Farther to the south, and Avest of the Osceola mills is the next, or Big .run; still farther south and Avest is Coal run. Near this point Beaver run entei\u2019S the Moshannon creek, and to the south and west Goss run enters Beaver run. The country between these streams is elevated, the hills rising anyAvhere from fifty feet to two hundred above ordinary Avater level. The valley of some of these streams, particularly Big run and Coal run, is quite narrow and precipitous. Goss run has a Avider valley, and the rise both of the stream and the hillsides is not so abrupt as the others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-4\">\u201cThe defendant company\u2019s line of railroad from Philips-burg in a southAvestwardly direction toAvards Osceola mills and beyond, constructed prior to 1869, traverses the valley of Moshannon creek along the eastern side thereof, folloAving the hillside so as to obtain and preserve its gradients until it reaches Osceola mills, where it. crosses the Moshannopi creek to the Avestern side and continues along its Avestern side until it reaches the mouth of Beaver run, where it leaves the Moshannon and follows Beaver run to its head at or near Ramey. This Avill fully appear by defendant\u2019s exhibit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-5\">\u201c The first spur or branch, south of Philipsburg, of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>ant\u2019s line, and known in this case as the Mapleton branch No. 1, was constructed as much as twelve years ago. On the defendant\u2019s exhibit--it will be seen that since that time, and prior to the location of the plaintiff\u2019s line of road, there have been two sub-branches of the first Mapleton branch constructed, which unite near the point where the plaintiff\u2019s line seeks to cross this branch of defendant\u2019s line.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-5\">\u201c The second branch, and known in this case as the Big Run branch, was constructed about four years ago up the valley of Big run.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-6\">The third branch, and known as the Goal Run branch, was constructed up the valley of Coal run about twelve years ago, and has since been extended from time to time across the summit at the end of the valley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-7\">\u201c The fourth branch, and known as the Goss Run branch, was constructed up Goss run more than twelve years ago.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-8\">\u201c The fifth branch, and known as the Amesville branch, leaves the main stem beyond Houtzdale and crosses over the summit and descends into the valley of Upper Morgan run, and has been built, part of it, as much as six years ago, and the balance of more recent date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-9\">\u201c Each and all of these laterals extend in a westerly direction up these several streams entering Moshannon creek or its tributary Beaver run on their northern and western side.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-10\">\u201c That on the-day of-, A. D. 18-, the Moshannon &amp; Clearfield Railroad Company was organized, and that all of the main branch, beginning in the Osceola yard and extending south and west, then constructed as far as Ramey or beyond, is operated under that name, and that all the branches crossed, except the Mapleton, join the Moshannon branch of the Tyrone &amp; Clearfield Railway and appear to be part and parcel of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-12\">\u201c The second inquiry, which pertains to the field traversed by the plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s line of railroad in its geological aspect, is important in that it bears upon the question not only of the lines of roads themselves, but has much to do with the effect of future and further development of those seams or veins of coal of the first bituminous coal basin that in this particular portion thereof lie below water level. The facts pertaining to this case are these :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-13\">\u201c The first bituminous coal basin lies west of the crest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Allegheny mountains, and the general trend is northeast and southwest. At Philipsburg and Houtzdale there is no difficulty in defining the position of the basin. Its central line or axis is almost exactly coincident with the course of Beaver run from or beyond Ramey on the west, passing through Houtzdale and east from there some short distance. It then runs about north 60 degrees east, and continues nearly in this course until it reaches a point near Philipsburg. The general course of the Moshannon creek from Philipsburg, in a southerly and westerly direction to the south of Beaver run, is not far at most points from the central axis of the basin as above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b651-3\">\u201c [The small courses, entering the main stream of Moshannon creek at or near the Mapleton branch, Big Run branch and Coal Run branch, cut through the upper measures of this, field, but, as appears by the testimony of Mr. Womelsdorff (called by defendants), the vein or measure known as \u2018 B \u2019 in geological nomenclature in this field, is under the water level of Moshannon creek at Mapleton branch, Coal Run branch, Goss Run branch and the-Amesville branch at its junction with the Moshannon &amp; Clearfield Railroad of the defendant company\u2019s line. The extension, however, of the Amesville branch has reached a field of very large acreage of this vein that can be mined through drifts above water level. At the Big Run branch the \u2018 B \u2019 vein can in all probability be opened above the water level of the Moshannon creek.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b651-4\">\u201c That on account of the location of the axis of the basin, the amount of development of this \u2018 B \u2019 vein, the largest known measure, and proportionately of greater value in the future, must necessarily be as near the line of axis as possible to be practical, and the future shipments over the outer extensions of Mapleton, Big Run, Coal Run and Goss Ruii branches will not in any probability be any larger than they have been in the past before the exhaustion of the Moshannon vein to its present state.] [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b651-5\">\u201c Upon the third point, as to the facts that are undisputed and that relate alike to all the five branches, there are but a few, and they may be stated thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b651-6\">\u201c <em>a. </em>These branches were originally built as a part of the Tyrone &amp; Clearfield Railway Company, and it is supposed under an assumed authority that its charter contained branching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>powers, which is very doubtful; but if there was no power, still it could not be questioned in this proceeding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-4\">\u201c [5. They were all and each in their inception arid construction for the development of the coal of private individuals owning lands along them or at the end thereof, and to afford means of transporting tire coal to a distant market, and might more appropriately have been constructed under the \u2018 Lateral Railroad Act \u2019 as coal branches.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-5\">\u201c <em>o. </em>That, with the exception of the Goss Run branch, no passenger trains are now or ever have been run upon any of them, and upon the Goss Run branch a distance of not over one mile from its junction with the main stem now operated under the name of the Moshannon &amp; Clearfield Railroad Company, as stated hereinbefore.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-6\">\u201c <em>[d. </em>That except upon the Goss Run branch, as seen in paragraph \u2018 e,\u2019 nothing but freight trains, mainly of coal alone, ever enter upon these branches, and that not more than two on any day, and generally but one a day, go in with empties and return with the loaded cars from these branches.] [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-7\">\u201c [g. That the coal seam or vein known as \u2018 D,\u2019 or the Moshannon vein, was the measure then sought for more particularly, and because of its elevation in the hill, to reach and properly develop it is in some degree at least the cause of the heavy grades upon these branches and the controlling cause of the length thereof, as they exist at the present time.] [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-8\">\u201c [/. That owing to the topography of the country, the manner the water streams enter the Moshannon creek, and the approach of the hillsides to the same, the Altoona &amp; Philipsburg Connecting Railroad could not have located their line of road on any other ground, so as to secure a line of road that could be operated with reasonable practicability. It was not absolutely impracticable to locate and build a different line upon ground elevated over some one or more of the defendant\u2019s laterals, so as to have enabled overhead crossings to be constructed ; but from long acquaintanceship and knowledge of the country, derived from careful study of the coal strata, we find as a fact that owing to the curvatures and gradients, and the very greatly increased cost of construction, no sensible engineer would have adopted any other route or location than that adopted by the plaintiff company at the points of crossing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>controversy, except that an undergrade crossing is reasonably practicable at Amesville branch as is hereinafter set out.] [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-3\">\u201c <em>\\_g. </em>That overhead crossings at each of the four branches, Mapleton, Big Bun, Coal Run and Coss Run would increase the grades very much at each of these points and greatly affect the operation of the Altoona &amp; Philipsburg Connecting Railroad, both in its capacity to haul freight over these humps, as also in the matter of operating expense by requiring greatly increased power at each of these humps; while the amount of injury done to the defendant company and the inconvenience in the future operation of the branches in question can easily be compensated in damages.] [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-4\">\u201c This brings us to the fourth paragraph of the case as outlined, namely, the findings of fact as they relate to each separate branch sought to be crossed. The bill of complaint unites them all in one proceeding, but they must be dealt witli as distinoth' as if separate and distinct bills had been filed in the case of each crossing. We will therefore proceed with them, beginning at Mapleton branch, and will set forth the facts, omitting only those general facts that we have already stated pertain alike to all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-5\">\u201c MAPLETON BRANCH.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-6\">\u201c 1st. The point of crossing is situate from the junction with the Tyrone &amp; Clearfield Railroad about one mile.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-7\">\u201c 2d. That the Mapleton branch is in reality three branches known as Nos. 1, 2 and 3, and the point of junction of Nos. 1 and 2 is at or near the point of crossing in controversy, No. 3 running out from No. 2 and forming part thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-8\">\u201c 3d. The cars brought down from the coal operations at the head of No. 3 are run down upon No. 2 and there united with the train before being brought out over the point of crossing, so that in point of fact No. 3 does not enter into consideration in the case except as it is a part of No. 2.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-9\">\u201c [4th. That the location of the Altoona &amp; Philipsburg Connecting Railroad at this point is the only reasonable one consistent with good railroad construction and operation, owing to the topography of the country. That to change the location as proposed by the defendants would affect the curvature of the line so as to materially affect the operation thereof, aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>from increasing the length in some slight degree, and very materially increasing the cost of construction apart from and in addition to the cost of an overhead crossing.] [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-4\">\u201c [5th. That the line of the Altoona &amp; Philipsburg Connecting Railroad, on account of the prior location and construction of Mapleton branch No. 3, and the nearness of the Moshannon creek at this point to the hillside, in order to construct an overhead crossing at this point, would be compelled to construct a retaining wall along Moshannon creek, on the southerly side of the point of crossing, and also construct a like wall of some height between the line of the Altoona &amp; Philipsburg Connecting Railroad and the right of way to the Mapleton No. 3 branch, thus adding very considerably to the cost of constructing an overhead crossing.] [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-5\">\u201c [6th. That after full and careful consideration of the testimony of the engineering experts called by the plaintiff and defendant companies, making due allowance for any apparent magnifying of the expense of crossing on one, and of minimizing of the expense on the other, and considering the character of the line crossed, and it being in an open country, a coal branch with but one freight train entering daily thereon, we find as a fact that to compel an overhead crossing would be imposing an unreasonable burden on the plaintiff company, and that an overhead crossing is not reasonably practicable.] [9]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-6\">\u201c BIG BUN BBANCH.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-7\">\u201c [1st. This branch was constructed within the last four years and is about two and one half miles long. It was built for the purpose of shipping what was supposed to be a considerable acreage of the Moshannon or \u2018 D \u2019 vein, but this vein was, and is, entirely cut out by a fault, and, so far as there is any testimony in the case, has not been found.] [10]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-8\">\u201c [2d. That very small freight shipments have ever come from this branch at any time since its construction, and not more than three, four or perhaps a few more cars per diem can be produced on this branch until inore development is made on the C or \u2018 C \u2019 vein, or the measure underlying it known as the \u2018 B.\u2019 ] [11]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-9\">\u201c [3d.

Southwest Pennsylvania Railroad, 77 Pa. 175, it was said: \u2018 Two thoughts are already expressed in the statute. The one that no unnecessary injury shall be perpetrated on the road sought to be crossed; the other, that crossings at grade shall be prevented whenever they can reasonably be avoided. The very language used implies that one railroad cannot be crossed by another without some injury to the company whose road is crossed. But if the injury is not such as will deprive the company of the exercise of its corporate rights, or seriously impair its operations, and is susceptible of compensation in damages, there is no reason why a railroad company should claim immunity any more than other corporations or individuals. The development of the country and promotion of its prosperity, for which all corporate powers are conferred, are weightier considerations than private interests or the convenience of corporations.\u2019 This language, and much more, particularly applicable to the case in hand, was quoted and approved by our present Chief Justice Sterketx, in Northern Central Railway Company\u2019s Appeal, 108 Pa. 621-628.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-4\">\u201c This doctrine thus enunciated not only defines the policy that is embodied in the act of 1871, and which looks to the protection of the rights of the road sought to be crossed, and the avoidance of danger to the life of the employees and the traveling public, but it goes further and fixes the limitations thereof by declaring that the public policy of the state to foster and encourage the improvement and development of the country and the material resources thereof must not be dwarfed and wholly overlooked.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-5\">\u201c Railroad corporations being created to serve the public must Submit to slight inconveniences where the public interests are concerned, and this is particularly true in all cases where compensation can be made in damages for the injury and inconvenience inflicted in permitting crossings at grade.

In such cases it is not regarded as being reasonably practicable to avoid a grade crossing.

As to the Amesville branch, he decreed \u201cthat the plaintiff company shall have the right to construct and operate its railroad underneath the defendant\u2019s roadway and tracks,\u201d as is fully set forth in the 3d paragraph of his decree. This under-grade crossing does not appear to be the subject of complaint in any of the specifications, and may therefore be dismissed without further notice except in sustaining that part of the decree. A considerable portion of the learned judge\u2019s opinion is devoted to a consideration of the topographical features of the territory, traversed by the projected and constructed roads in question, together with the position and importance of said territory in its geological aspects as a freight-producing field, etc. As to some of these matters, he appears to enjoy the advantage of a personal knowledge of the locality which we do not possess. His consideration of the subjects referred to is followed by a statement or findings of fact, bearing on the merits of the controversy, in relation to each of said proposed grade crossings, and from all these are drawn the general conclusions on which the decree is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-3\">It does not appear that an opportunity of excepting to the opinion was afforded, and hence many of the matters above referred to are for the first time subjects of complaint in several of the specifications of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">It is not our purpose, nor do we deem it necessary to consider said specifications in detail. In our opinion, the contention hinges on the soundness of the general conclusions on which the decree appears to be based. A careful consideration of all the testimony has led us to the conclusion that the learned judge underestimated the present and prospective importance, to the defendants as well.as the public, of the four branch roads over which grade crossings are sanctioned by the decree, as well as the danger, inconvenience and ultimate loss that are likely to result from such crossings, if the decree is permitted to stand. On the other hand, we think he has attached undue importance to the increased costs of constructing, increased expense and difficulty of operating plaintiff company\u2019s road, and other injurious consequences likely to result to it as well as the public from prohibiting said grade crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>It may be conceded, that the increased cost of construction, with over or undergrade crossings, will be very considerable ; but, on the other hand, the compensation for that increased outlay can scarcely be overestimated. Four dangerous, expensively constructed and maintained grade crossings, within a distance of about eight miles, with the expense, inconvenience, delay, loss of life and property necessarily incident thereto, are avoided, not for a few years but for all time, and in lieu thereof a clear and unobstructed roadway and tracks are permanently secured.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">While the learned judge refers to estimates of increased cost of over-grade as compared with grade crossings, he has not given us any distinct and definite finding on that subject. As is usual in such cases, the witnesses of the respective parties differ widely in their estimates. Those of the defendants range from about $86,000 to $46,000, for all four crossings, or an average of from $9,000 to less than $10,000 each, depending somewhat on the mode of construction, materials, etc. They profess to give the data upon which their calculations are based. The plaintiffs\u2019 estimates, on the other hand, are about one hundred per cent higher. Making proper allowance for these discrepancies and giving due weight to the respective witnesses on the subject, we think an estimate of $12,000 to $15,000 for each crossing would not be much out of the way. To what extent the witnesses took into consideration the cost of constructing grade crossings and signals, keeping a watchman at each, etc., as required by the decree, does not clearly appear; but the necessary outlay would certainly be very considerable. The annual expense of maintaining the crossings, including watchmen\u2019s salaries, etc., if capitalized, would be no insignificant sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The alleged increased expense and difficulty of operating plaintiff\u2019s road with over-grade crossings as compared with crossings at grade is not so serious as some of their witnesses appear to think. The maximum grade of their road, as shown by the evidence, is about one and a half feet to one hundred feet, or about seventy-ninefeet to the mile. The weight of the testimony is that the grade of overhead crossings need not exceed sixty or eighty feet to the mile.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">As was said in Northern Central Railway Co.\u2019s Appeal, 108 Pa. 629, the practicability of overhead crossings depends almost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>entirely on the circumstances of each particular case. It is always a question of fact, or rather a conclusion drawn from a variety of independent facts and circumstances. The location and surroundings of the proposed crossing, the character of the railroads and the uses made and intended to be made of them, the increased cost of construction and expenses of operation, the public safety and convenience, the interests and convenience of the road intended to be crossed, are some of the many factors that enter into the solution of the question of the reasonableness of an overhead crossing in almost every case; and the same may be generally said of undergrade crossings.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-3\">The act of 1871 requires courts of equity \u201c to ascertain and define by their decree the mode of crossing which will inflict the least practicable injury upon the rights of the company owning the road .... intended to be crossed; \u201d and \u201c by their process prevent a grade crossing \u201d whenever in their judgment \u201cit is reasonably practicable to avoid such crossings.\u201d The necessity, which, nearly a quarter of a century ago, moved the legislature to enjoin these duties on the courts, is now greater than ever; and in several cases, among which are Perry County R. R. Co. v. N. &amp; S. V. R. Co., 150 Pa. 193, and Penna. R. R. Co. v. Electric Railway Co., 152 Pa. 126, we have had occasion to emphasize the importance of the ever increasing and now almost imperative necessity of prohibiting grade crossings. That constantly growing necessity has more than kept pace with the rapid multiplication of railroads and urgent demands for high rate of speed, few stoppages, etc. But it is unnecessary to enlarge on the many considerations that are opposed to grade crossings, and the comparatively few that can be even plausibly urged in their favor. After fully considering and carefully weighing all the facts and circumstances which make for as well as against the reasonable practicability of avoiding the proposed grade crossings, we have reached the conclusion that the learned court below erred in not adjudging and decreeing that it is reasonably practicable to avoid each and all of said grade crossings.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">It is therefore adjudged and decreed as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">1st. That so much of the decree of the court below as authorizes the undergrade crossing of the Amesville Branch specified in the third paragraph of said decree, and also so much of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>said decree as in any manner relates to the construction, maintenance and operation of said undergrade crossing, be affirmed with costs, including the costs of this appeal, to be paid by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">2d. That so much of the decree of the court below as authorizes grade crossings at either of the four points named therein, and also so much and such parts of said decree as in any manner relate to the construction, maintenance and operation of said crossing, and any of the appliances intended to be connected therewith, be and the same are hereby reversed and set aside; and, in lieu thereof, it is now adjudged and decreed that it is reasonably practicable to avoid each and all of. said four grade crossings.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Bd. That so much of the decree of the court below, as is not hereinbefore mentioned, referred to and disposed of, be and the same is hereby reversed; and it is further ordered that the record be remitted to the court below for such further action as may be necessary to carry into effect the provisions of this decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
