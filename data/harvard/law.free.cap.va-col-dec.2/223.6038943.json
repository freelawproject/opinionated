Whether the Defts. paying Judgments upon simple Contract obtained after full notice of this Action be a Devastavit 2. Whether an Ex\u2019r may retain a Debt by simple Contract ag\u2019t a Bond Creditor 1. I agree that if an Exec\u2019r pays a Debt by simple Contract <em>(i.e. </em>without Specialty) voluntarily without Coersion of Suit before a Debt by Bond or other Specialty whereof he has Notice it is a Devastavit But I apprehend it is not so to satisfie a Judgment obtained on such simple Contract even tho\u2019 an Action is brought &amp; the Ex\u2019r has full Notice of a Debt by Specialty before such Judgment is had as was the Case here</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">It is. true the Law has instituted a certain Method or Order to be observed by Ex\u2019rs in the Paiment of Debts which is as follows 1. He is to pay Debts of or upon Record 2. Debts by Specialty 3. Those without Specialty Curs. Wentw. 131. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B240\">*B240</page-number>But this is to be understood \u2014 where an Ex\u2019r pays Debts without Coersion of Suit For where an Action is brought &amp; Judgm\u2019t had ag\u2019t an Ex\u2018r Let the Debt be of what Nature it will I conceive the Ex\u2019r is bound to satisfie that Judgment before any other Debt of the Testators Except Debts of Record If it be objected that where an Ex\u2019r has Notice of Debts by Specialty he may prevent any Judgment on a Debt by Simple Contract by pleading those Debts in Bar And 'if he will not it is his own Folly I answer that it is true an Ex\u2019r may plead such Debts by Specialty in Bar to an Action on simple Contract if he pleases But I apprehend he is not bound to do so <em>r'</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\">In the Paiment of a Testators Debts the Law has left many Things to the Conscience &amp; Discretion of the Ex\u2019r who may lawfully prefer one Cred\u2019r to another as Charity or other equitable Motive May induce In Debts of equal Dignity before Action brought It is commonly known that an Ex\u2019r may prefer which Cred\u2019r he pleases So where an Action is brought and pending that another is commenced the Ex\u2019r may lawfully give Way to &amp; confess this last Action &amp; the Judgm\u2019t shall be a good Bar to the first if there be no Covin as appears by Doct. &amp; Stud. 157. Curs. Wentw. 144. Mo. 678. Scarles Case &amp; Cro. Eliz. (462.) Green <em>a </em>Wilcox And no Difference appears by these Books where the first Action is for a Debt by Specialty &amp; the last for a Debt without Specialty But Keil. 74. is more express that when a Judgment is given ag\u2019t Ex\u2019rs such Recovery is a good Plea to all other Actions And so I understand the Book Case 9. E. 4. 12. there cited Ex\u2019rs were sued and pending that Action a Stranger recovered in another Action and\u201d adjudged a good Plea Edgcomb <em>a </em>Dee Vaugh. 95. is an Authority in Point that a Judgment [224] obtained upon a simple Contract pending a former Action brought on an Obligation is a good Bar to such Action Consequently to satisfie such a Judgment can be no Devastavit which is the Question now before us</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">From all these Cases I hope it is clear that the Order to be observed by Ex\u2019rs in the Paiment of Debts can refer only to such Paiments as are made without Coersion of Suit But where Actions are brought he that first gets Judgm\u2019t must be first satisfied Curs. Wentw. 144. And in this as has been sayed the Ex\u2019r may lawfully shew Fav\u2019r by confessing one Action &amp; delaying the other And it is very equitable &amp; convenient that such a Power should reside in the Ex\u2019r Since there is certainly no natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B241\">*B241</page-number>Difference between a Debt by Specialty &amp; a Debt without but there may &amp; often is more Justice &amp; commonly more Charity to satisfie a Debt of the latter Sort ather than the former The principal Reason why the Law gives the Preference to the former is that the Writing makes the Debt more clear &amp; certain but when there is a Judgment for a Debt without Wring <em>[sic] </em>That is then become as certain And therefore no Reason after Judgment that one should be preferred to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">It was an Opinion of old that an Action would not lie ag\u2019t an Ex\u2019r upon simple Contract And upon this probably was founded the Difference the Law has made between Debts of that sort &amp; Debts by Specialty because it might seem unreasonable that an Ex\u2019r shou\u2019d have the Liberty of paying Debts to which he was not bound before Debts he was bound to pay This old Rule of Law having no Foundation in Reason or Justice has been long since exploded or rather a Way has been invented to elude it by turning Actions of Debt upon simple Contract into Actions upon the Case upon a Promise implied by Law as was settled about 150 Years ago in Slades Case 4. Co. 92. So that Ex\u2019rs being now liable to Actions for Debts of this sort No Kind of Reason remains why Debts by Specialty should have the Preference after there is a Judgment for the other Courts of Equity in Cases properly under their Direction make no Difference at all between one Sort of Debt &amp; the other If Lands are devised to Trustees to be sold for Paiment of Debts Creditors by simple Contract shall be let in equally with Cred\u2019rs by Specialty &amp; they shall be all paid in equal Proportion 2 Ch. Ca. 54. 1. \u2014Vern. 63. 2. Vern. 405. (But note if the Devise be to Ex\u2019rs to pay Debts the Land is legal Assets and Debts must be paid according to their priority at Law) And the Reason is because there is no natural Difference between one Sort of Debt &amp; the other as has been already observed And therefore Equity will make none I [225] hope therefore as the Difference is meerly artificial introduced upon Reasons that now no longer subsist especially after a Judgment this Point will be carried no further than there are clear Authoritys for And I am much mistaken if any Case can be shewn where it is expressly &amp; in Point adjudged to be a Devastavit in an Ex\u2019r to pay a Judgment obtained on a Debt by Simple Contract before a Bond Debt of which he had Notice whereas I take 9. E. 4. 12. Keilw. 74. &amp; Vaugh. 95. to be affirmative Resolutions for me And consequently are more cogent &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B242\">*B242</page-number>will weigh more than 20 Cases which prove nothing but by Way of Inference .</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\">2. Whether an Ex\u2019r may retain a Debt by Simple Contract ag\u2019t a Bond Cred\u2019r It is a gen. Rule that an Ex\u2019r may retain to satisfie a Debt due to himself But this says Wentworth in his Office of Executor 141. is to be understood where the Exec\u2019rs Debt is of equal Dignity with the Cred\u2019rs And puts a Case that the Testator is indebted to othe s by Judgment Statute or Recognisance and to the Exec\u2019r by Bond There he cannot retain I shall not deny Wentworth\u2019s Opinion to be Law in the Case put But I apprehend a great Difference between that Case &amp; ours where the Cred\u2019rs Debt is by Bond &amp; the Ex\u2019rs by simple Contract Judgm\u2019ts Statutes Recognisances are all Debts of Record Of which the Ex\u2019r is at his peril to take Notice without Information of the Cred\u2019r 21. E. 4. 21. b. 2. Vern. 89. ( <em>Vide </em>2. And. 159. 1 Mod. 175. &amp; 3 Mod. 115. and <em>quaere) </em>And therefore if Judgm\u2019t be had ag\u2019t him upon a Bond &amp; he satisfies it before he knows of these Debts by Record it is a Devastavit and he must pay the Money again out of his own Pocket So that an Ex\u2019r cannot under any Circumstance pay a Bond Debt before a Debt by Judgment &amp;c. But the Law is not so with Respect to Debts by Specialty &amp; those without for an Ex\u2019r may lawfully pay these latter even without Judgm\u2019t before he has Notice of Debts by Specialty 3 Lev. 113. FitzGib. 77. 78. And even after Notice which must always be by Action he may give Way to a Judgment for a Debt by Simple Contract tho\u2019 the Action on the Specialty be first commenced as I hope has been demonstrated</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Allowing then Wentworths Opinion to be Law which however I don\u2019t find is supported by any Authority before or since he wrote I conceive it is nothing to the present Question Nor have I met with one judicial Resolution in the Point The Matter then I presume must be determined upon the Reason of the Thing &amp; the Rule of Equity &amp; Natural Justice And if so I hope clearly to demonstrate that the Exec\u2019r in this Case ought to retain</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">It is absurd to suppose that the Law gives a Man Power to do a greater Benefit to another than to himself Yet such will be the Consequence if the Ex\u2019r may not retain in this Case For immediately upon the Testators Death he may pay a Cred\u2019r by [226] simple Contract without Action &amp; before a Cred\u2019r by Specialty can possibly bring an Action And such Paiment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B243\">*B243</page-number>undoubtedly good ag\u2019t any Debt by Specialty So where an Action is brought on a Specialty And afterwards another is brought on a simple Contract the Ex\u2019r may confess this last &amp; it shall be a good Bar to the first as has been shewn Now shall an Ex\u2019r have it in his Power to do thus much for another And yet have no Remedy himself in the like Case Surely no but as he can neither sue himself nor pay himself the Law must give him an adequate Remedy that is by suffering him to retain Otherwise his Extorship will put him in a worse State than another Cred\u2019r whereas the Rule of the Law is <em>In equali jure melior est conditio possidentis </em>Where the Right is equal Possession puts a Man in the better Cond\u2019n Now it must be allowed that the Right between an Ex\u2019r &amp; Cred\u2019r where both Debts are by simple Contract is equal Yet the Ex\u2019r may satisfie the Cred\u2019r but not himself This is surely a strange Way of reasoning It actually inverts the Rule of Law (just now mentioned) for the Ex\u2019rs Possion puts him in a worse State instead of a better He shall be without a Possibility of obtaining his Debt while another Cred\u2019r can easily get his especially with the Ex\u2019rs Favour which he may lawfully shew I must submit whether this be not ag\u2019t Sense &amp; Reason It has already been observed that there is no natural Difference between Debts by Specialty &amp; Debts by Simple Contract And that Courts of Equity make none Since then the Law is silent as to the Matter now before us I hope the Rule of Equity will be no bad one to follow Especially when the contrary Determination will be attended with so much Hardship upon the Ex\u2019r whom the Law intends to favour as much as possible And will clash with a Rule of Law first introduced in Favour of Ex\u2019rs</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><em>E contra </em>were cited 1.
