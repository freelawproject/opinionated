She dies leaving issue this Son &amp; a Daughter by her first husband &amp; a Son by a second husband Orrill the Donee dies without issue The Lessor of the Pit. is his Sister &amp; Heir &amp; the Deft, is the Donor\u2019s Son by her second husband &amp; is her Heir The Q. is whether the Reversion which was expectant upon the determination of the Estate tail created by the Deed from S. Orrill to her Son Orrill upon the death of Orrill the Son descends to the heir of Orrill the Son who is the Pit. or to the Heir of the Donor S. Orrill who is the Deft. Barradall fr. Deft. It must be agreed on all hands that after the Deed from S. Orrill to her Son whereby she gives him only an Estate tail there was remaining in her a Reversion expectant [105] upon the determination of that Estate tail</p>\n<p id=\"An7\">The Rev\u2019n upon her death descended to her Son Orrill the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B112\">*B112</page-number>Ten\u2019t in tail And that after her death he was Ten\u2019t in tail with the Rev\u2019n in fee expectant all which I agree</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\">Upon the death of Orrill the Son without issue whereby the Estate tail determined this Rev\u2019n expectant they say descended to the Sister &amp; heir of Orrill the Son. But I say it descended to the heir at Law of the Donor who is the Deft. This is the point between us It is a rule of Law that I hope will not be denied that whoever claims an Inheritance as Heir must make himself Heir to him who was last seised of the fee 3. Co. 41. 42. Co. Lit. 11. 6. 15. a.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Now Orrill the Son was never seized of the fee simple He was Ten\u2019t in tail &amp; the fee simple was- only expectant The person who was last seised of the fee was S. Orrill the Donor and who ever claims the Inheritance must make himself heir to her which the Pit. is not but the Deft.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">In 3. Co. 42. a. Ratcliff\u2019s Case It is expressly sayed he who claims a Rev\u2019n or expectant as heir ought to make himself heir to him who made the Gift S. Orrill made the Gift the Deft, is her heir not the Pit.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In the rules which govern Descents we are not to look for solid reasons to support them It is enough if the Law is clear &amp; settled The rules of Descent vary almost in every Country &amp; perhaps we shall find few of them founded upon the principles of right reason or natural Justice The rules of the Civil &amp; Common Law are widely different &amp; the Lawyers of both sorts contend for the excellency of each The Inheritance descends to the Eldest Son by the Common Law whereas by the Civil Law I mean the Roman all the Children succeed to the Inheritance The Common Law utterly excludes the half Blood By the Roman Law they succeed in the Second Place In both these Instances the Civil Law seems to be preferrable More agreeable to nature &amp; justice</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">1 Domat. 684 Ha. Hist. Common Law, 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">By the rules of Descent that obtain in the law of England the Pit. can\u2019t claim the Inheritance as heir to her Brother because her Brother never was seised or poss\u2019ed of the fee simple</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">The rule of Law is <em>possessio fratris de feodosimplicifacitsororem esse hceredem </em>The rule is mentioned by Lit. sect. 8. where speaking that the half blood can\u2019t Inherit he puts the Case of a man having a Son &amp; a Daughter by one Venter &amp; a Son by another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B113\">*B113</page-number>If says he after the death of the father the elder Son enters &amp; dies without issue the Inheritance shall descend to his Sister but if the elder Son dies before he enters Then it shall descend to the Bro\u2019r of the half Blood as heir to his fa\u2019r because says he it is <em>possessio fratris See.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Coke in commenting upon this Sect. <em>Se </em>this rule of <em>Possessio fratris </em>[106] 1 Inst. 14. 15. puts sev\u2019l Cases where the Sister can\u2019t inherit &amp; they all turn upon this point where there is not an actual pos\u2019sion in the Bro\u2019r for it is that must make the Sister heir <em>Possessio </em>says he is <em>quasi pedis positio </em>And therefore it is held in Ratcliff\u2019s Case before mentioned that if there be not an actual .possession Or if the Inheritance be such of which an actual pos\u2019sion can\u2019t be gained <em>per pedis positionem </em>the half blood shall come in</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Now the Inheritance here is a Rev\u2019n expectant which it is impossible in nature could ever be reduced to an actual possession <em>per pedis positionem </em>And therefore by the rules of Law the Sist\u00e9r can\u2019t inherit but it must descend to the heir of the Donor</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Nay in some Cases tho\u2019 the Son actually enters the Sister shall not inherit if this possession is afterw\u2019ds defeated by legal title as where the Wid\u2019o of the fa\u2019r recovers Dower ag\u2019st him If the elder Son dies in the life of Ten\u2019t in Dower his Sister shall not inherit but the Bro\u2019r of the half blood as heir to the fa\u2019r because the elder Son never had a rightful pos\u2019sion 1. Inst. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">If the fa\u2019r makes a Lease for Life or Gift in tail &amp; dies And the eldest Son dies in the life of Ten\u2019t for life or in tail the Bro. of the half blood shall inherit because the Ten\u2019t had the Freehold <em>Se </em>the elder Bro\u2019r only a Pee simple expectant <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">So here the elder Bro. was in possession it is true but of what why of an Estate tail but he had only a fee simple expectant</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\"><em>Vid. </em>2. Dam. 558-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">Another Case put by Coke cannot be distinguished from this A Gift is made to a man &amp; his wife <em>Se </em>the heirs of their two bodies Rem\u2019r to the heirs of the husband They have issue a Son The Wife dies Husband marries again &amp; has issue another Son &amp; dies The eldest Son enters &amp; dies without issue The second Son tho\u2019 of the half blood shall inherit for the eldest Son was not actually seised of the fee simple which was expectant but only of the Estate tail for the rule says he is <em>possessio </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B114\">*B114</page-number><em>fratris </em>&amp;c. but here the elder Brother was not pos\u2019sed of the fee simple but of the Estate tail</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\">This Case is exactly ours the Son here upon the death of his fa\u2019r was Ten\u2019t in tail with the Rev\u2019n in fee expectant he died without issue and it was adj\u2019d that the younger Brother of the half Blood as heir to the fa\u2019r should inherit &amp; not the heir of the elder Bro\u2019r</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">For the Pit. it was argued by Needier &amp; Lewis to this purpose. Upon the death of S. Orrill the Donor the Rev\u2019n expectant descended to her Son Orrill the Donee who was her heir at the time This Descent must exclude the Deft, who cannot claim as heir to Orrill the Son being only of the half blood but upon his death the Rev\u2019n must descend to his heir who is the Pit. Upon the Descent of the Rev\u2019n to Orrill the Son he was seised of it &amp; might have aliened or devised it There was not indeed an actual pos\u2019sion which cannot be by any possibility of an Estate in Expectancy But if he could dispose of it surely it ought to descend to his heir \" Suppose he had actually devised or aliened [107] it Could the Deft, then have claimed ag\u2019st such disposition It is not pretended The descent to his heir is the disposition of the Law &amp; must work as strongly as the act of the party</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The rule <em>possessio fratris </em>&amp;c. relied on by the Deft, can extend only to Cases where an actual possession can be had It would be unreasonable to carry it to Cases where pos\u2019sion cannot be had which would be inconvenient &amp; create confusion The cases for the Deft, came not up to this The last cited out of Cokes Inst, was governed by the Rem\u2019r in the Deed And a Rem\u2019r is different from a Rev\u2019n</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The Donor never intended the Deft, should take anything in the Land He was not born when the Deed was made Upon the Descent of this Rev\u2019n to Orrill the Son it vested in him absolutely to all intents &amp; purposes Otherwise it would be in abeiance which the Law will not suffer And this was much relied on The Deft, is neither heir to the Donee nor was so to the Donor when the Reversion happened In what right then can he claim</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">To which it was replied</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">A great deal of pains has been taken to prove a point which nobody denies that a Rev\u2019n expectant upon the determination of an Estate tail may be aliened or devised If Orrill the Son <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B115\">*B115</page-number>had disposed of the Rev\u2019n in this Case after the descent upon him the present question would not have been made which seems indeed to be strangely misunderstood on the other side for it does not depend upon the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the thing nor upon the power Orrill had to dispose which is admitted but upon certain fixed &amp; settled rules of Law which govern descents If the reason of the thing was to govern abstracted from those rules I should be glad to hear a good &amp; solid one assigned why the half blood should not inherit Yet it is upon that rule or principle that the Pit. can have any pretence of title And it is upon another rule viz. <em>possessio fratris </em>&amp;c. that the Defts. Title depends</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">Every one who has a fee simple either in pos\u2019sion or reversion has a power to dispose but if he does not do it The Inheritance must go according to the rules of Law which govern descents</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\"><em>Vid. </em>Cro. Car. 411. 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">To say the rule <em>possessio fratris </em>&amp;c. extends only to Cases where pos\u2019sion can be had is a flat contradiction of the plainest &amp; most positive Authority &amp; some of the best in the Law In Ratcliff\u2019s Case it is expressly sayed that if the Inheritance be such of which an actual possession cannot be gained the half blood shall come in And as to any inconvenience or confusion that may be the consequence it wants pointing out for I cannot conceive any</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">It is sayed the Case cited out of the Inst, is not parrallel because the Rem\u2019r there was created by Deed It is true the Rem\u2019r to the [108] husband is created by the Deed but then upon his death the Rem\u2019r descended to his Son who took it by descent &amp; not by Purchase And so after his father\u2019s death he was Ten\u2019t in tail with the Rem\u2019r in fee expectant Where then is the difference betw. that Case &amp; this. Here the Rem\u2019r descended to him from his Mother In the Case cited the Son was Ten\u2019t in tail with a Rem\u2019r in fee expectant which Rem\u2019r descended to him from his father I know no difference betw. a Rev\u2019n &amp; a Rem\u2019r in fee but in the manner of the creation A Rev\u2019n is where the Owner does not part with his whole Estate Then it is sayed to revert or come back to him after the determination of the particular Estate A Rem\u2019r is where the Owner parts with his whole interest giving a particular Estate to one &amp; the fee to another which is called a Rem\u2019r And such Rem\u2019r <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B116\">*B116</page-number>in fee will descend in the same manner as a Rev\u2019n in fee. There is no kind of diff. betw. them as to the business of descent</p>\n<p id=\"A0k\">The disposition of the Law is doubtless as strong as the disposition of the party but we say the Law disposes in our favour which is the point to be determined</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\">The Donor\u2019s Intention in the Deed is quite out of the Case We are contending about the Descent of the Rev\u2019n &amp; claim nothing under the Deed or that is disposed of by the Deed</p>\n<p id=\"AyH\">It\u2019s no good consequence that because the Rev\u2019n descended to Orrill upon the death of his Mother which we admit that therefore it must descend from him to his Heir The Cases cited prove the contrary &amp; clearly shew that a Rev\u2019n expectant does not descend in the same course an Estate in pos\u2019sion does There are other instances of this in the law If there be father &amp; Son &amp; the Son purchase land &amp; make a lease for life &amp; dies the reversion descends to his Uncle who dies the father cannot be heir to the Uncle of this reversion because he was never actually seised 1. Inst. 11. 6. And as to the Argum\u2019t that the fee would be in Abeiance if it did not vest absolutely in Orrill the Son Every Estate in expectancy may be sayed to be in Abeiance (Vid. Plunket &amp; Holme 1 Lev.) for the word is derived from the French bayer to expect 1. Inst. 342. b. And there is no inconvenience that a Rev\u2019n expectant upon an Estate of Freehold should be in Abeiance for the true reason why the Law will not suffer the fee \u2022 to be in Abeiance (which I admit it will not except in some instances <em>ex </em>necessitate) is because there would want a Ten\u2019t to the Freehold Ag\u2019st whom a <em>praecipe </em>might be brought But this cannot happen where the fee is expectant on the determination of an Estate tail because there is a Ten\u2019t of the Freehold viz. The Ten\u2019t in tail The rule in truth is only that the Freehold shall not be in Abeiance for there are many instances [109] where the fee may As in the Case of a Lease for life Rem\u2019r to the right heirs of I. S. The fee simple is in Abeiance during the life of I. S. 1. Inst. 342. b. So if Ten\u2019t in tail grants all his Estate The Grantee has only an Estate for life of Tent in tail And the fee or Inheritance of the tail is in Abeiance during the life of Ten\u2019t in tail Lit. S. 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Upon the whole tho\u2019 we are neither heir to the Donee nor was so to the Dornor when the Reversion descended from her Yet in as much as the Rev\u2019n was only expectant by the rules of Law in Cases of Descent we are intitled to this Rev\u2019n because we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B117\">*B117</page-number>now heir to the Donor &amp; there never was nor could be such pos\u2019sion as the Law requires to make the Sister that is the Pit. take as heir to her Brother</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b121-5\">Randolph, Custis &amp; Robinson Fr Pit.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Judgm\u2019t fr Deft, by the Opinion of Lee, Tayloe, Grymes &amp; Carter</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
