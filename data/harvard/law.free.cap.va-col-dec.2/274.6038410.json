Knows nothing of Testors being indebted to Pit. before Marriage &amp; never heard of the Bond till a Year after the Marr. Denys he knows upon what Acco\u2019t it was given Or that there was any such Agreem\u2019t before Marr as in Bill Knows the Stock &amp; Cattle raised on Testors Plant\u2019n for sev\u2019l Years both before &amp; after Marr. were used by Pit. and that the Tob\u2019o made on a Plant\u2019n of Defts. descended to him from his Grandmo\u2019r for 4 Years before Marr. were ship\u2019d under Pits.

Can\u2019t tell what his Debts are. Pit. after his Death enter\u2019d into her Dower of his Lands &amp; has all her separate Estate</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">And upon th s Answer Demurs because the Mony pretended to be lent &amp; the Bond were before Marr. &amp; it does not appear there was any Agreem\u2019t the Mony sho\u2019d be paid Notwithstanding the Marr. By which Deft, is advised the Bond <em>8c </em>all Debts due before Marr. are extinguished at Law And as this Case is ought not to be set up in Equity</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The Proofs in the Cause are but few <em>8c </em>they are principally about the Mony lent The Pit. has exhibited some Accounts curr\u2019t &amp; Bi Is of Lading a Love-letter from the Testor &amp; the Draught of a Bond formerly offered by him And it is proved for the Deft, that Pit. holds her Dower in Testors Lands &amp; has her separate Estate And that she had two Crops of Testors 7 Years before Marr.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The great Question in this Case is whether the Pit. ought to be paid out of the Testors Estate the Mony she lent him before Marr.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The Equity set up is a pretended Agrem\u2019t before Marr that the Testor sho\u2019d pay the Pit. what he owed her Notwithstanding the Marr. This is suggested in-the Bill but not proved as I conceive</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">I shall therefore in speaking to this Cause endeavour to .shew 1. That there is not any certain or positive Proof of the Agreem\u2019t pretended And 2. If there was That the Agreem\u2019t is derogatory to the Rights of Marr &amp; such as a Court of Equity will not support. I shall not rely much upon the Demurrer because we are gone into Proofs and the whole Equity of the Cause is before the Court</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">It cannot I think be s'ayed that there is any direct or positive Proof of the Agreem\u2019t suggested in the Bill The Bond which is alledged to have been given for Performance of the Agreem\u2019t has not a Sillable in it of an intended Marr or that the Condition should be performed notwithstanding Marr. Neither is there one Witness who proves any such Thing And the Deft, denies that he knows any Thing of such an Agreem\u2019t</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">It appears indeed from the Papers exhibited that the Testor courted the Pit. many Years before Marr &amp; offered her very good Terms but they were not accepted This was four Years at least before the Marr. And no Proof of any Overtures within those 4 Years or that he continued in the same Mind And yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B297\">*B297</page-number>these are the Circumstances relied upon to make out the Agree-m\u2019t suggested in the Bill</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">[276] One of these Papers is a Love letter dated in 1722. 9 Years before the Marr. There is another Love letter without Date &amp; the Draught of a Bond sent in it The Date of the Bond is cut out with Design I suppose to impose it for a Thing of later Date than it really is but the Figure 7 may be seen pretty plainly at the End And so we may conclude it was dated in 1727. 4 Years before the Marr.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">I must submit whether a Man\u2019s courting a Woman four Years before he marr\u2019d her &amp; then offering her advantagious Terms is any Evidence of a subsequent Marr Agreem\u2019t suggested to be made 4 Years afterwards when there is no kind of Proof that the Courtship continued or that the Man remained in the same Mind And if it be no Evidence as I humbly conceive it is not Then are the Pits, without the least Shadow of Proof of the Agreem\u2019t suggested</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The most that can be sayed is that these Circumstances make some sort of Presumption that the Bond mentioned in the Bill was for Performance of a Marr Agreem\u2019t for it is no necessary Consequence that because a Man once makes an advantagious Offer to his Mrs. that he should be always so disposed at any Distance of Time On the contrary we know Mens Tempers &amp; Inclinations are very subject to change &amp; especially in Matters of this Sort when a Mistress is obstinate</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The Presumption then in this Case must be very light which according to Sir E. Coke proves nothing at all And if the Differ ^ ence between the Conditions of the two Bonds be considered it must further weaken the Presumption In that of 1727. Notice is taken of an intended Marriage whereas nothing of that is mentioned in the Bond of 1731. By the first the Testor was to make over all his own Estate as well as the Pits, (a most extravagant Proposal) The Cond. of the latter is only that she shall have her own Estate &amp; he pay her what he owed her As there is so great a Difference between the two Conditions &amp; one mentions an intended Marr. &amp; the other not As there is no Proof of the Courtships continuing from 1727. to 1731. I cannot conceive that the Bond in 1727. is any kind of Proof that the Bond of 1731. was given on the same Occasion or for the same Purpose but the contrary I think is rather to be presumed</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Then the Testors Decl. mentioned in the Defts. answer when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B298\">*B298</page-number>he made his Will is a further Argument ag\u2019t this Presumption After directing a Bequest of Pits, separate Estate &amp; her Dower in his Lands he sayed it was more than she deserved &amp; he [277] would not have done so much but for his Words Sak\u00a7 which plainly imports that whatever Marr. Agreem\u2019t he had made was only verbal Or rather that he had only made a Promise to the Pit. (which perhaps might be after Marr) to do what he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\">This Bequest &amp; Decl. of the Testor I presume will have some Weight In the Case of Myhil &amp; Myhil Oct. 1735. where the Question was Whether the Pit. was a Bastard the Decl. of the Husband in his Will that he was so was much relied on And the Case of one Tranter a Bailif try\u2019d for the Murder of Mr. Luttere was urged where Mr. Lutterel\u2019s Words in his last Moments were allowed as Evidence ag\u2019t the Prisoner Here we have the Will &amp; the last Words of the Testor ag\u2019t the Presumption they would set up.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">But it will be argued perhaps <em>Quorsum hoc </em>To what Purpose was this Bond given This I think will admit of an easie answer by shewing that the Cond. may have a suffic\u2019t Effect &amp; Operation without supposing it to be made for Performance of a Marr Agreem\u2019t</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The first Part of the Cond. is that the Pit. shall keep possess &amp; dispose of all the Estate she was then possessed of without the Molestation of the Obligor Suppose the Pit. had anything in her Possion which the Testor had or claimed a Right to (And this is no improbable Conjecture Since it appears they lived tog\u2019r &amp; she had the entire Use &amp; Disposal of his Estate) This Part of the Cond. would have its Effect in securing to the Pit. a good Title to the Thing so in her- Possion And the latter Part of the- Cond. that he sho\u2019d pay what he owed her might be intended as a better Security for the Paiment of what he owed</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Thus we see this Bond might be given for another Purpose than for Performance of a Marr. Agreem\u2019t The Condition does not necessarily import that it was given for that End but may have a suffic\u2019t Operation to other Purposes</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Since then there is not the least mention of an intended Marr. in the Cond. Since the Cond. may without any forced or strained Construction have a suffic\u2019t Operation without supposing a Marr. Agreem\u2019t And since there is no direct or positive Proof of such Agreem\u2019t I hope the Agreem\u2019t suggested in the Bill shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B299\">*B299</page-number>not be supported barely upon a slight Presumption without other Proof Especially when the Presumption is as strong or stronger from the Circumstances that have been taken Notice of that there was no such Agreem\u2019t</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">It is well known that Marr is a Gift in Law of all the Wifes [278] personal Estate That it extinguishes all Debts &amp; Contracts between the Husband &amp; Wife And this Right a Court of Equity is always very tender to preserve And I apprehend will never take from the Husband what the Law gives him or set up a Debt w\u2019ch the Marr has extinguished without clear Proof of an Agreem\u2019t to that Purpose w\u2019ch I take to.be wanting in this Case</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">But if the Court shall be of Opinion that the Agreem\u2019t is sufficiently proved And that the Bond is not extinguished by the Marr Then I must endeavour to shew 2. That this Agreem\u2019t is not such a one as a Court of Equity ought to support as being derogatory to the Marr Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">It will be sayed that Marr Agreem\u2019ts are always favoured which 1 agree to be true in this Sense that an Agreem\u2019t fit and proper to be decreed will receive a favourable Interpretation for the Support of it accordnig to the Intention of the Ptys. But I deny it to be an universal Rule that all Marr. Agreem\u2019ts are to be favoured Because there are some of such a Nature that a Court of Equity will not support them at all And this I take to be of that Kind</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The usual Method in Marr Contracts is to make Use of a third Person as a Trustee However I will not pretend to say but that an Agreem\u2019t between the intended Husband &amp; Wife without the Intervention of a third will sometimes be supported in Equity And that whether the Agreem\u2019t be by Promise Articles or Bond But then</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">If the Agreem\u2019t be between the Husband &amp; Wife alone I take a Difference where the same is to have Exon during the Coverture <em>&amp; </em>where the Exon of it is future to the Marr. Of the first Kind are such where the Husband agrees fhat the Wife shall have any Thing to her own Use or at her Disposal during the Coverture The latter Sort are where the Husband agrees to leave his Wife so much at his Death That she may dispose by Will or the like In the first Case as the Agreem\u2019t is without Question extinguished at Law So I take it a Court of Equity will never set it up Because it is derogatory to the Rights of Marr &amp; in a Manner inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B300\">*B300</page-number>with the Nature of it For by the Marr. the Law puts the Wife &amp; every Thing she has under the Power &amp; Controul of her Husband And consequently an Agreem\u2019t to suffer her to dispose of Mony during the Coverture must derogate from &amp; be inconsistent with the Husbands Power &amp; the Wifes Subjection But in the 2. Case I take it the Agreem\u2019t is neither extinguished [279] at Law or in Equity It is only suspended during the Coverture And after the Death of either Party may be set up either at Law or in Equity as the Case may require</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\">This will appear very evident from the foil. Cases Clark <em>a </em>Thompson Extor of Isaac Cro. Ja. 571. Assumpsit in Cons. Pit. would marry Testor he would leave her worth 500;\u00a3. It was objected the Promise was extinguished by the Marr. but not allowed Because it was not a Duty in the Life of the Husband And Judgm\u2019t for the Pit.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Gray <em>a </em>Acton 1 Sal. 325. a Bond was given before Marr. from the Husband to the Wife with Cond. if she survived &amp; he left her <em>1000\u00a3 to </em>be void Holt C. J. was of Opinion the Bond was extinguished by the Marr. being a present Debt and the Cond. was collateral but allowed a Cov\u2019t or Promise to such Effect had been good because they raise no present Duty But two other Justices held the Debt was only suspended because it was not paiable during the Coverture &amp; was only a Debt on Contingency</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Thus at Law we see if the Agreem\u2019t is not to have Exon during the Coverture it is not extinguished by the Marr. And we shall see presently that Equity follows the Law</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Darcy <em>a </em>Chute 1. Ch. Ca. 21. The Pit. being a Widow &amp; seised of a Jointure Mr. Chute the Defts. Father before Marr. with her agreed by Deed betw. them that it should be lawful for her during the Coverture to receive &amp; dispose of the Rents of her Jointure The Court declared that the Agreem\u2019t before Marr. with the Pit. herself was immediately extinguished by the Marr. &amp; refused Relief Pridgeon <em>a </em>Pridgeons Exors 1 Ch. Ca. 117. An Agrem\u2019t was made by Pit. &amp; others on her Behalf before Marr with Testor that notwithstanding the Marr. the Rents &amp; Profits of all her own Estate &amp; what personal Estate &amp; goods she had should be at her own Dispose It was held by the Keeper (Bridgman) assisted with two Judges (Hales &amp; Archer) that the Agreem\u2019t was extinguished by the Marr And Hales takes the Difference I rely on betw. an Agreem\u2019t for any Thing to be done future to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B301\">*B301</page-number>the Marr. &amp; where the Agreem\u2019t is to have Exon during the Coverture In the first Case he says the Agreem\u2019t is not extinguished by the Marr. but is in the latter I will beg Leave to read the Case as I presume it will be satisfactory to the Court to have that great &amp; good Mans Opin. in his own Words</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Thus it appears the same Distinction is kept up in Equity as at Law If the Agreem\u2019t is extinguished at Law Equity will not set it up If it be not extinguished at Law as where the Exon is future to the Marr. There is no Doubt but Equity will decree it Which is [280] all that is proved by the Cases cited on the other Side And this Difference well considered reconciles all the Cases we meet with in the Books upon this Subject tho\u2019 at first View they may seem to clash &amp; contradict one another</p>\n<p id=\"AFQD\">The Agreem\u2019t in this Case as set forth in the Bill is to have Exon during the Coverture It is that the Pit. shall keep &amp; dispose of her own Estate And the Testor pay her what he was indebted to her And so I apprehend it is not such an Agrem\u2019t as a Court of Equity will support</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">It would indeed be the greatest Absurdity that such an Agremt. as this sho\u2019d subsist after Marr for every Debt of the Wife vests in the Husband by the Marr. And so the same Pson would be both bound to pay &amp; intitled to receive if the Debt subsisted For this Reason it is &amp; for avoiding this Absurdity that the Law extinguishes the Debt And the same Reason will hold good why it should not be set up in Equity And I believe I may venture to say there is no Instance where a Court of Equity has set up an Agr\u00e9ment of this kind but they have often refused so to do as appears from the Cases cited</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Obj.

B. The Reporter seems to incline to the Difference I take And thus I hope it is evident that the Agrem\u2019t set up if it was fully proved (w\u2019ch I can by no Means admit) is not such a one as a Court of Equity ought to support It may seem needless then to make, any further Observations however to shew there is no great Hardship on the Pit. I must beg Leave to make a Remark or two</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">It appears upon the Defts. Answer &amp; is in Part proved that the Pit. for sev\u2019l years ship\u2019d the Testors Tob\u2019o under her Mark &amp; reced the Produce &amp; killed &amp; made Use of the Testors Hoggs &amp; Cattle In the Acco\u2019t exhibited by her she has given Credit for no more than 35 . . 11. for the Produce of Tob\u2019o And that in a gen\u2019l Article without saying how many Hhds she received or when &amp; there is no Credit at all for Cattle or Hogs This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B303\">*B303</page-number>must appear a very inconsiderable Allowance for the Labour of 11 or 12 Hands for sev\u2019l Years 3 according to her own acco\u2019t Then she charges 24^. for Tools &amp; Cloaths for the Negros So the n\u2019t Produce is but 11^ . . 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">It appears further upon the Answ\u2019r that the Testor told the Deft, six Weeks before his Death he had at the Pits. Importunity fr. her Son 50;\u00a3. To get a little Ease but she would not be satisfied without having all from his Children (as indeed is plain from this Suit) No Allowance is offered to be made for this 50;\u00a3.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The Claim the Pit. sets up amounts to more than the whole Estate of the Testor So if she succeeds Not only the Testors Children will be sent a begging but sev\u2019l of his just Cred\u2019rs be defrauded of their Debts And besides all this the Pit. holds her Dower in the Testors Lands It is a Maxim those who will have Equity must do Equity and surely there is as much Reason &amp; Justice that the Pit. sho\u2019d acco\u2019t for the Profits of the Testors Estate while she reced them &amp; for the 50;\u00a3. pd. her Son as that the Testors Estate should be liable for this pretended Debt to her It is a piece of Justice to the Cred\u2019rs &amp; Children of the Testor Now I believe if a reasonable Allowance is made for the Profits reced by Pit. out of Testors Est\u2019a If the 50^. pd. her Son &amp; the Advantage she has made from the Dower in the Testors Lands be deducted out of her [282] Claim I mean so much of it as is proved there will be little or nothing due to the Pit.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">In the Case of McCarty <em>a </em>Fitzhugh ab\u2019t six Years ago which was a Bill to compel the Paiment of a Bond Debt due to the Pits. Father from the Deft, who was one of his Exors The Deft, in his Answer disclosed divers equitable Demands he had ag\u2019t the Testor And without other Proof the Court allowed those Demands to bal\u2019a the Bond Debt And the Suit was dismissed. I hope there is the same Equity in this Case to regard the Defts. Demands</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">But there is a further Circumstance in this Case which I apprehend will bar the Pits, pretended Equity if the Agrem\u2019t was ever so fully proved It appears that the Pit. has accepted w\u2019t the Testor gives her by his Will viz. her separate Estate &amp; Dower in his Lands. This Acceptance I take to be a Waiver of the Benefit of this pretended Agreem\u2019t I must submit whether this Case be not within the Equity of the Act 1. Geo. 2. 11. w\u2019ch enacts that a Widow shall declare within 9 months Whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B304\">*B304</page-number>she will accept the Provision made for her by her Husbands Will If she fails she is forever barr\u2019d to claim anything more than is given her by the Will Here the Wife is so far from making any Decl. that she will not accept that she actually enters upon what is given her It is plain from what the Testor declared when he made his Will that this Devise was intended in Satisfaction of what he promised w\u2019ch must be understood of the Marr Agrem\u2019t The Wife accept it This Acceptance I rely upon bars her from claiming anything more both by the Act of Ass. &amp; in natural Equity &amp; Justice There can be no Reason she sho\u2019d have the Benefit of the Devise &amp; this pretended Agrem\u2019t too To the defrauding of the Cred\u2019rs &amp; Ruin of the Testors Children</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\">Upon the whole I conclude 1. that there is no direct or positive Proof of any Marr Agrem\u2019t at all And the Presumption on their Side is very light in itself &amp; is also opposed &amp; ballanced by as strong or stronger Presumption on our Side 2. The Cond. of the Bond does not necessarily import that it must be given for Performance of a Marr Agreem\u2019t Because it may have a suffic\u2019t Effect &amp; Operation to other Purposes 3.
