Ex\u2019x Clopton <em>vs. </em>Henry &amp; Ux\u2019r Adm\u2019x Syme</parties>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ag4\">\n<em>Appeal</em>\n</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b142-9\">The Pit. declares upon an Ind. Ass. for <em>\u00a32.2. </em>9. &amp; 837lbs. Tob\u2019o due by Intestate Syme to the Testator Clopton</p>\n<p id=\"Ayo\">The Deft, pleads that Clopton made his last Will &amp; Test in Writing &amp; appointed Syme one of his Ex\u2019ors which said Win was proved as the Law directs to be the last Will of Clopton ill the Court of New Kent by pretext &amp; reason whereof the said Syme was discharged of his said Debt And prays Judgment if Action</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">They also plead <em>nil debet </em>&amp; <em>non </em>Ass. <em>infra 5 annos. </em>Upon these two last pleas there were issues &amp; a Dem\u2019r to the first</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">Upon arguing the Dem\u2019r the County Court was of Opinion that the plea was not sufficient to bar the Pits. Action And upon the issues the Jury found for the Pits. ;\u00a39. 2. <em>SH </em>dam\u2019s The Defts. have Appealed</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">The only question here is whether the Defts. plea be a good bar And I hope to shew it is not either for the matter or the manner of it The matter of the Plea is shortly this. That Pits, tes\u2019tor made a Will &amp; appointed Defts. Intest, one of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B139\">*B139</page-number>Ex\u2019ors And that the Will was proved to be the Will of the Tes\u2019tor in due form of Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\">It is insisted that this making the Intest, an Ex\u2019or is a discharge of the Debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">It is a common doctrine that where the Debtee makes his Debtor Ex\u2019or the Debt is extinguished But this rule is liable to several exceptions As 1. where the Ex\u2019or dies before he proves the Will 2. Where the Exor refuses before the Ordinary For the rule of Law is founded on these reasons 1. that a man cannot sue himself 2. that the same hand being both to receive &amp; pay it amounts to an Extinguishm\u2019t Which reasons do not hold where the Ex\u2019or dies before he prooves the Will or where he refuses</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The making the Debtor Ex\u2019or amounts to paiment &amp; a release but if the Debtor will not accept the Ex\u2019orship it can have no operation for You cant force a man to accept a Rel. ag\u2019st his Will per Holt Sal. 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Here it does not appear that Syme proved the Will or ever Administered the fact must be taken as it stands upon the pleadings It is only sayed that Syme was appointed an Ex\u2019or &amp; that the will was proved in due form but it is not sayed that Syme proved it. A Will may be proved <em>per testes &amp; </em>yet the Ex\u2019or refuse If Syme did not prove the Will he was not the person intitled to receive &amp; so falls not within the reason of the rule of a Debtee making his Debtor Ex\u2019or amounting to a Rel.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">[129] Obj. But here Syme was only an Ex\u2019or with others And tho\u2019 it be not pleaded that the other Ex\u2019or proved the Will it appears sufficiently by the Record the Pit. suing as Ex\u2019trix. And where the Debtor &amp; others are made Ex\u2019ors &amp; the other Ex\u2019or proves the Will but the Debtor does not the Debt is extinguished So it is if the Debtor refuse &amp; die before the other Ex\u2019ors for he might come in notwithstanding this refusal</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">All which must be admitted And if it appeared to the Court that the Will proved by the Pit. &amp; the Will mentioned in the Plea wherein Svme was appointed Ex\u2019or were the same the Argum\u2019t would be conclusive but I conceive it does not</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">This Case as I have sayed must be taken as it stands upon the pleadings The Plea is no more than that Clopton made a Will &amp; Syme one of his Ex\u2019ors &amp; that that Will was proved</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">Now it will scarse be denied but that a Man may have two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B140\">*B140</page-number>Wills &amp; several Ex\u2019ors Cur. Went. 12. Which appears by the Case of Kitchen &amp; Bassett 2. Sal. 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">It is not pleaded that the Will wherein Syme was appointed Ex\u2019or was the same Wiil proved by the Pit. Or that it was proved by any other of the Ex\u2019ors And if the Will was not proved by any other of the Ex\u2019ors It is no Rel. or extinguishm\u2019t</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">When men will make use of such extraord\u2019ry methods to avoid the paim\u2019t of a just debt it can\u2019t be thought hard to hold them to the greatest strictness in pleading Here the Deft should have craved Oyer of the Probate &amp; then have pleaded that Syme &amp; the Pit. were both made Ex\u2019ors And then the matter would have appeared clearly &amp; judicially to the Court</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">It is possible there might be two Wills The fact cannot now be enquired into but Your Honours will judge upon the pleadings</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">It shews an extraordinary temper of litigiousness in the Deft, to contest this matter for even tho\u2019 the debt should not be recoverable at Law Yet in Equity it will indisputably be subject to Cred\u2019rs or even Legatees in some cases Here there are Creditors unsatisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">What is meant by the debts being extinguished is no more than that an Action will not lie to recover for it is Assets in the hands of the Ex\u2019or &amp; as such liable to the Tes\u2019tors debts And that is the reason Holt says it amounts to paiment &amp; a rel.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">The Case of Wankford &amp; Wankford 1. Sal. 299. where all the learning on this head is collected was no more than this The Obligee made the Obligon Exor who Adm\u2019rd part of the Tes\u2019tors Goods but never proved the Will &amp; died The Action was brought ag\u2019st the Heir of the Obligor who pleaded this matter And it was adjudged that [130] the debt was extinguished tho\u2019 the Will was not proved because the Ex\u2019or had Adm\u2019rd &amp; so had put it out of his power to refuse</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">But here Syme never Administ\u2019red.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">Judgm\u2019t affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
