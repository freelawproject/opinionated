Assumpsit for Money &amp; Tob\u2019o had &amp; reced to his Use Upon Non assumpsit pleaded the Jury find a Special Verdict Upon which the Case appears to be That the Pit. was Sherif of New Kent <em>Anno </em>1733 &amp; had the [ 149] collection of the Quit rents Levies &amp; Fees one Birch was his Undersherif &amp; paid him 5000. lbs. Tob\u2019o for the profits of his Office There was due from the Deft. 6. . 12 . . 4 for quit rents &amp; 7737 lbs. Tob\u2019o for County Levies &amp; Officers Fees of his own &amp; other peoples that he had received Birch being indebted to the Deft, more than that Money &amp; Tob\u2019o before the Year 1733 gives the Deft, receits for those Quitrents Levies &amp;c. And gives himself Credit in the Defts. Book for the same but no Mony [sic] or Tob\u2019o was paid Except by that Discount And the Deft. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B158\">*B158</page-number>or Birch have not paid the Pit. any Part of that Money &amp; Tob\u2019o If the Law befor the Pit. the Jury find 71-1-10 Dam\u2019a</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\">The Questions upon this Case I take to be two. 1. Whether the Deft, is chargeable at all to the Pit. for the Quitrents &amp;c. discounted with Birch the Undersherif &amp; for which he has his Receits. 2. If he be, Whether the Pit. can maintain an Indeb. assumpsit for the Quitrents &amp;c. due from the Deft, himself</p>\n<p id=\"A7N\">There is a Difference taken as to the Mony rec\u2019d for Quitrents &amp; the Tob\u2019o rec\u2019d for Levies &amp; Fees. The Quitrents are sayed to be the Kings Treasure &amp; coming to the Defts. Hands he is answerable And so perhaps he would to the King if we were in a dispute with the Crown for it must be owned the Law is particularly careful to secure the Kings Debts. His Treasure is looked upon as the Treasure of the Comonwealth which is <em>pads vinculum et bellorum nervi </em>And therefore he has sundry Prerogatives for obtaining them He can have Exon of Body Lands &amp; Goods at once A subject can have no Exon ag\u2019t the King\u2019s Debtor without first securing the King\u2019s Debt (p 33. H. 8. c. 39. if process for the King be comenced before Judgment) The King shall have Remedy ag\u2019t the Debtor of his Debtor <em>cum multis aliis </em>If a Man intermeddle with the Kings Treasure pretending Title he shall be answerable for it to the King 11. Rep. 89. E. of Devonshire \u2014 Godb. 291. 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">All this is true but nothing to the purpose the Question here is not between the King &amp; a Subject Nor ought the Money in this Case as I conceive be regarded as the Kings Debts It seems therefore foreign &amp; absurd to talk of his Prerogative The Case as to this Point is no more than this An Officer of the Crown employs a person under him who receives the Kings Money &amp; pays it to a third Person The Officer sues this 3. Person for Mony received to his Use How is the King concerned in all this Will his Treasure be impaired if the Pit. should not recover How then can this be regarded as his Debt Is the Pit. intitled to an Exon ag\u2019t Body Lands &amp; Goods Will he be preferred to another Subject in the Point of Exon. Can the Pit. have Remedy ag\u2019t the Debtor of the Deft. If I am answered in the Negative as sure I must be it will be evident to a Demonstration this is not the Kings Debt nor can be regarded as such if it was the Pit. would have all these Privileges Therefore without entering into the Dispute whether the Deft, would be answerable to the King or not [150] which I conceive is nothing at all to this Case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B159\">*B159</page-number>I shall close this Point with an Observation of Sir M. Hale that To make the Kings Prerogative a State to recover other Mens Debts is unreasonable inconvenient &amp; mischievous. Hard. 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">This plausible Pretence of the Kings Debt being removed the Case is in short this An Undersher who had farmed the Profits of the Sher Office directs a Person to whom he is indebted to receive divers Quitrents Levies &amp; Fees And disco\u2019ts them together with what this Person owed himself on the same Account but of his own private Debt &amp; gives Rect\u2019s The Undersher proves insolvent the Sher is forced to pay the King &amp; public Officers And whether the Sher can recover ag\u2019t the Person who reced these Quitrents by the Undersherifs Order is the Question</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">It is sayed if a Master send his Serv\u2019t to receive Mony &amp; the Serv\u2019t pays it again to the Person he received it of in discharge of his own Debt this shall be taken as Mony reced to the Masters Use And I agree that it will be so But then I think that is nothing like the Case at Bar</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The Undersherif here cannot be taken as a Serv\u2019t He had farmed the Office for a great Premium &amp; so was not subject to the Direction or Controul of the Sher who had delegated his whole Power to him &amp; therefore had no Right to intermeddle in the Receits &amp; Paiments but the Undersherif was surely to manage that &amp; everything else relating to his Office as he thought most for his own Advantage &amp; Benefit It is inconsistent in the Nature of the Thing that the Sher should intermeddle for by that Means he might deprive the Undersherif of all the Profits which he paid so largely for</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">If the Sherif then had no Power to direct the Rec\u2019ts &amp; Paiments or in any Manner to controul the Undersherif How can the Undersherif be regarded as his Servant Or. how can Mony reced by the Order of the Undersher be Mony reced to the Sherifs Use</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">The Case therefore is not like that of the Master &amp; Serv\u2019t for there is an apparent Fraud &amp; the Person receiving the Mony knows very well it is the Masters &amp; therefore it is reasonable he should be answerable to the Master But in the Case at Bar I conceive the Mony &amp; Tob\u2019o was in no sort the Sherifs nor subject to his Disposal (tho\u2019 it be true that he is answerable to the King &amp; Public Cred\u2019rs). He had fully authorised the Undersher to receive &amp; pay The Deft, transacted this Matter with the Person so authorised &amp; who alone had a Right to transact it</p>\n<p id=\"b164-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B160\">*B160</page-number>If I employ a Factor and he pays his Debts with my Effects what Remedy have I ag\u2019t his Cred\u2019rs</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\">[151] Suppose the Undersher had actually reced this Mony &amp; Tob\u2019o &amp; paid the same to the Deft. Could the Sher then have demanded it as Mony reced to his Use I believe not I cannot then conceive any Difference in the Reason of the Thing between actually receiving &amp; paying &amp; discounting as in this Case</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">This Case is of very general Concern Almost every Man pays his Quitrents <em>See. </em>to the Undersherif And often no doubt by Way of Disco\u2019t where a Man has an Acco\u2019t open with the Undersherif And this I believe is the first Time such a Paiment has been disputed But hereafter it will be unsafe to transact any Business with an Undersherif if the Deft, is chargeable in this Case And I must submit whether such a Determination will not be introductive of a general Inconvenience</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">But here it is pretended there is a mighty Fraud because the Mony was never actually paid to the Sher I cannot conceive in what this Fraud consists A public Collector being indebted to a Man appoints him to receive some public Debts &amp; then allows him to apply them in Discharge of his own private Debt New Men I believe would scruple to do this or think it any Point of Dishonesty or Fraud And as to the Mony not being actually paid That is answered before</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The 2. Question is Admitting the Deft, is answerable Whether the Pit. can maintain an Indeb. assumpsit for Mony <em>Sec. </em>reced to his Use for the Defts. own Quitrents <em>Sec. </em>paid the Undersherif by Way of Disco\u2019t as appears in this Case And I conceive he cannot</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">This Disco\u2019t must be admitted to be a Paiment or not a Paiment If it be a paiment the Undersher was sufficiently authorised to receive them His Discharge we have <em>8e </em>there can be no Foundation for this Action as to them If this Discount be not a Paiment as has been strongly urged It must be owned they are still due But then the Remedy to recover them is not by Action but Distress Nay there is an express Law that no Action shall be brought unless the Party be returned insolvent What Pretence then has the Sher to maintain this Action or indeed any Action at all Certainly if these Quitrents <em>Sec. </em>are not paid they must be recovered in the Name of the King &amp; the Officers to whom they are due</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">I conceive the Pit. has no Right to recover any Part of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B161\">*B161</page-number>Mony &amp; Tob\u2019o of the Deft. Much less can he maintain this Action for the Defts. own Quitrents And the Law be ag\u2019t the Pit. upon either Point Judgm\u2019t must be given ag\u2019t him the Dam\u2019s being entire</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b165-4\">Sir J.
