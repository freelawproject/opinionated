Senior</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">The Pit. below declared on a Bond in the Penaly of ^40. The condition of which was to stand to the Award of Fleming &amp; Baber arbitrators provided they shall agree &amp; if they disagree then to the award of an Umpire to be chosen by them</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">The Deft, craved Oyer &amp; pleaded no Award The Pit. replied that the Arbitrators took upon them the burthen of the Award but disagreeing in several matters they chose one Scott an Umpire And that they &amp; Scott having taken upon them the burthen of the Award they made an Award which is set forth</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">It is a Masterpiece of Nonsense</p>\n<p id=\"b133-14\">The Deft. Demurred Judgm\u2019t for the Pit. &amp; a Writ of Enquiry The Jury gave \u00bf5.12.8. Dam\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b133-15\">Judgm\u2019t entered for the Dam\u2019s &amp; not for the penalty of the Bond</p>\n<p id=\"b133-16\">On Demurrer Judgm\u2019t ought to have been given for Deft.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-17\">Obj. 1. The Award being made by the Arbitrators &amp; Umpire is not according to the Submission or the power given them</p>\n<p id=\"b134-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"B130\">*B130</page-number>The power given to the Arbitrators is to determine if they can agree If not they are to chu.se an Umpire</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\">The Award recites that the Arbitrators could not agree Yet they join in making the Award</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Upon their disagreement their power was determined &amp; the Umpire was solely to determine</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The Arbitrators &amp; Umpire are different Judges &amp; cannot have a concurrent jurisdiction 1 Sid. 455. Coppin &amp; Hurnard 1 Dam. 540. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">There never was an instance of such an award</p>\n<p id=\"AMR\">Arbitrators can\u2019t determine part &amp; Umpire other part unless expressly so provided 1. Ro.'A. ?62. 7. 8. Danv. 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">[121] Umpire in the common signification denotes a person that is to make an end if others cannot</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">It is true if a submission be to four &amp; to the Umpirage of J. S. they may all join but it is otherwise if their power is divided 1. Bui. 184. which is in point</p>\n<p id=\"AAk\">Obj. 2. The Award is uncertain</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">An Award is in the nature of a Judgment &amp; ought to be certain Danv. 543. 1. &amp; Notes ... &amp; ought to be wholly decisive.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">Can there be say\u2019d to be certainty in Nonsence Here is nothing actually awarded It is say\u2019d they agree the Gaming to be intirely false Gaming and not anything to be recovered that was supposed to be won by gaming &amp; that the said Senior pay all Costs &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">Nothing certainly awarded. Not that Suits shall be dismiss\u2019d Nor is it say\u2019d what Costs Senior shall pay It does not put an end to the Controversie No <em>Rel. . </em>to be executed. <em>Ex parte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">An Award to pay Costs of such a Suit generally not good 1. Sal. 75. Otherwise if such as Master shall tax [sic]</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">But here it is not sayed the Costs of what Suits</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">Obj. 3. Judgm\u2019t wrong should have been for the penalty &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-15\">Judgm\u2019t reversed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
