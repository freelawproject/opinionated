Order affirmed, with $50 costs and disbursements. There has been no showing of such unusual and unanticipated conditions as would justify relaxation of the rules of this court prohibiting disclosure proceedings after a statement of readiness has been filed (see 22 NYCRR 675.7; <em>Cassidy v Kolonsky, </em>37 AD2d 880; cf. <em>Calvo v Peros, </em>49 AD2d 744).
