Mahoney, Main, Herlihy and Reynolds, JJ., concur; Greenblott, J. P., dissents and votes to reverse in the following memorandum: Greenblott, J. P. (dissenting). I am still of the view that the finding that the signs provided adequate warning of the hazard is unreasonable, that the <em>Swartz </em>and <em>Williams </em>cases are inapposite and that judgment for the claimant is warranted under <em>Hulett v State of New York </em>(4 AD2d 806) for the reasons set forth in my prior dissent. <em>(Barnard v State of New York, </em>52 AD2d 700, 701)</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
