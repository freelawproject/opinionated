Grijal-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number><em>va-Lopez, </em>108 Fed.Appx. 157 (5th Cir. 2004) (unpublished). Following our judgment, Grijalva-Lopez filed a petition for certiorari. The Supreme Court granted Grijalva-Lopez\u2019s petition for certiorari, vacated our judgment, and remanded the case to this court for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We now reconsider the matter in light of <em>Booker </em>and decide to reinstate our previous judgment affirming Grijalva-Lo-pez\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Grijalva-Lopez raised a Booker-related challenge to his sentence for the first time in a supplemental brief before his direct appeal was submitted to this court. Because Appellant made no Booker-related objection in the district court, however, Appellant\u2019s claim must fail under the plain-error test discussed in <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-22 (5th Cir. 2005). Our review of the record reveals no basis for concluding that the district court would have imposed a less severe sentence if the district court had proceeded under advisory, rather than mandatory guidelines. In fact, the record indicates that the court would <em>not </em>have imposed a lighter sentence. First, the court upwardly departed from a guideline range of 21-27 months to a sentence of 87 months. The court also ordered defendant to serve this sentence consecutively to a sentence he was serving at the time the court imposed this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Grijalva-Lopez also argues that application of Justice Breyer\u2019s remedial opinion in <em>Booker </em>would strip him of his constitutional protections against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. He explains that <em>Apprendi </em>gave him the right to a jury trial on all facts essential to his sentence and Justice Breyer\u2019s remedial opinion in <em>Booker </em>stripped that right away. In <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>411 F.3d 572, 575-76 (5th Cir.2005) we rejected that argument and held that <em>Booker </em>required us to apply both Justice Stevens\u2019 merits opinion and Justice Breyer\u2019s remedial opinion in <em>Booker </em>to all cases such as this one on direct review.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Finally, Grijalva-Lopez argues that his sentence was unreasonable. Assuming ar-guendo that this argument can be made, when this objection was not raised earlier, it has no merit with respect to this guideline sentence. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cIf the sentencing judge exercises her discretion to impose a sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range, in our reasonableness review we will infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines.\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">For the reasons stated above, our prior disposition remains in effect, and we REINSTATE OUR EARLIER JUDGMENT affirming Grijalva-Lopez\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
