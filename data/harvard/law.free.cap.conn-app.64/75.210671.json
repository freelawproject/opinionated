We agree with the town on the second issue, which we find to be dispositive and, accordingly, we reverse the decision of the board without addressing the remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The commissioner found the following facts. The plaintiff, a former police officer for the town, suffered a compensable back injury on August 7,1990. The town and the plaintiff entered into two voluntary agreements regarding that injury in which the parties agreed that the plaintiff had a 20 percent permanent partial impairment of his back entitling him to 104 weeks of specific indemnity benefits. At the time of his injury, as a benefit of employment, the plaintiff, his spouse and dependents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>were receiving health, dental and life insurance coverage without cost to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">On July 14,1995, the plaintiff was awarded a disability pension as a result of his back injury and the fact that he was unable to perform the duties of a police officer. When the plaintiff began receiving his disability pension, the town discontinued his dental insurance coverage and began deducting health insurance premiums from his paychecks. The plaintiff then instituted a claim against the town seeking reimbursement of all premiums deducted and reinstatement of the same health, dental and life insurance coverage for himself and his defendants that was in place on the date of his injury, August 7, 1990. The plaintiff also sought interest and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The commissioner ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to \u00a7 31-284b benefits, even though he no longer was receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits of any kind. The commissioner found that the plaintiffs case remained open and active, a fact that made him <em>eligible </em>to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The commissioner thus concluded that the plaintiff was expressly entitled to \u00a7 31-284b benefits. The commissioner directed the town to reinstate the plaintiff and his group medical benefits that were in effect on the date of the plaintiffs injury without cost to him. Additionally, the commissioner ordered the town to reimburse the plaintiff for all of the health insurance premiums that were improperly deducted from his paychecks. Because attorney\u2019s fees were not awarded, the plaintiff joined the town in petitioning the board for review of the commissioner\u2019s decision. The board affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The second issue raised by the defendant is identical to that addressed by this court recently in <em>Kelly </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number><em>Bridgeport, </em>61 Conn. App. 9, 762 A.2d 480 (2000), cert. denied, 255 Conn. 933, 767 A.2d 104 (2001). In <em>Kelly, </em>this court held that \u201c[c]onstruing the statutes as they existed at the time of the plaintiffs injury, we conclude that the term \u2018compensation payments\u2019 as used in \u00a7 31-284b (a) does not include payments for medical care after the indemnity compensation period has ceased. The statute mandates that an employer is required to continue insurance benefits only while an employee is receiving \u2018compensation payments\u2019 for disability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d Id., 16-17. For the reasons set out in that opinion, we reverse the decision of the board and remand this case to it with direction to reverse the decision of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board is reversed and the case is remanded to the board with direction to reverse the decision of the commissioner.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-13\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-284b (a) provides: \u201cIn order to maintain, as nearly as possible, the income of employees who suffer employment-related injuries, any employer, as defined in section 31-275, who provides accident and health insurance or life insurance coverage for any employee or makes payments or contributions at the regular hourly or weekly rate for full-time employees to an employee welfare fund, as defined in section 31-53, shall provide to such employee equivalent insurance coverage or welfare fund payments or contributions while the employee is eligible to receive or is receiving workers\u2019 compensation payments pursuant to this chapter, or while the employee is receiving wages under a provision for sick leave payments for time lost due to an employment-related injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b98-8\"> A form 36 notifies the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner and the person claiming benefits that the employer and its insurer intend to discontinue compensation payments. <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Twin Tool Mfg.
