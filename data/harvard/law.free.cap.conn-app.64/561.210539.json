We affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The following facts are necessary for our resolution of this appeal. The court, <em>Pickett, J., </em>incorporated the parties\u2019 separation agreement into its 1991 judgment dissolving the parties\u2019 marriage. According to the separation agreement, the plaintiff is required to pay the tuition and room and board expenses of any college the parties\u2019 children choose to attend. The parties have three sons.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">In November, 1999, the defendant filed a postjudgment motion seeking, in part, an order that the plaintiff pay the costs associated with the postmajority education of the parties\u2019 eldest son, James, who was twenty-one years old at the time, and their youngest son, Benjamin, who was almost eighteen years old.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff refuses to pay any additional postmajority educational expenses for James and the cost of room and board and his share of other college related expenses for Benjamin. The plaintiff is unwilling to pay Benjamin\u2019s room and board expenses because Benjamin planned to live with the defendant while he attended a state university that did not provide residential facilities for students. The plaintiff refuses to pay the cost of tuition, room and board and related educational expenses for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>James due to his son\u2019s failure to complete prior educational endeavors for which the plaintiff had paid. More specifically, the plaintiff refuses to pay additional post-majority educational expenses for James because James dropped out of military school when he was thirteen years old and withdrew from Northwestern Connecticut Community-Technical College during his first semester of enrollment. At the time of the hearing, James, who had obtained a graduate equivalency diploma, was homeless and unemployed.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The court denied the postjudgment motion, in part, as it pertained to the plaintiffs paying for (1) costs related to James\u2019 postmajority education, (2) the cost of room and board for Benjamin that is not incurred by his living in college sponsored housing and (3) the attorney\u2019s fees of the defendant. The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion ordering the plaintiff to share equally with the defendant the cost of Benjamin\u2019s books, laboratory and other fees imposed by the college as a consequence of Benjamin\u2019s being enrolled or taking particular courses, and other fees ordinarily imposed on all students at the institution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">By her postjudgment motion, the defendant asked the court to interpret the separation agreement as it was incorporated into the parties\u2019 judgment of dissolution. \u201cA judgment rendered in accordance with such a stipulation of the parties is to be regarded and construed as a contract. . . . Accordingly, [o]ur resolution of [a party\u2019s claims] is guided by the general principles governing the construction of contracts. A contract must be construed to effectuate the intent of the parties, which is determined from the language used interpreted in the light of the situation of the parties and the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>stances connected with the transaction.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Issler </em>v. <em>Issler, </em>250 Conn. 226, 235, 737 A.2d 383 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">\u201cWhen . . . the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct .... Practice Book \u00a7 4061 [now \u00a7 60-5]. . . . Under the circumstances of this case, because the trial court relied solely upon the written [agreement] in ascertaining the intent of the parties, the legal inferences properly to be drawn from the [document is a question] of law .... In short, our resolution of the present appeal does not call upon us to go outside the four comers of the agreement, the language of which is clear and unambiguous. Accordingly, our standard of review is plenary.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Issler </em>v. <em>Issler, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly determined that the plaintiff is not responsible for the cost of Benjamin\u2019s room and board while he attends a college that does not provide student housing. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Benjamin planned to enroll at Louisiana State University at Alexandria, an institution of higher education that does not provide residential facilities for its students. Benjamin therefore intended to reside with the defendant. The relevant provision of the separation agreement provides that the plaintiff \u201cagrees to pay . . . the room and board of any private schools or undergraduate colleges the parties\u2019 children choose to attend . . . .\u201d The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion seeking an order that the plaintiff pay the cost of Benjamin\u2019s living in the defendant\u2019s home by distinguishing the language of the separation agreement here from the language of the separation agreement in <em>Legg </em>v. <em>Legg, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>44 Conn. App. 303, 688 A.2d 1354 (1997).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, the court concluded that the language of the parties\u2019 separation agreement \u201cunambiguously expresses the clear intent that. the room and board expenses would cover expenses imposed by a private school or undergraduate college, as [opposed] to expenses [of] living at home.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">\u201cAn agreement between divorced parties regarding the postsecondary education of their children that is incorporated into a dissolution decree should be regarded as a contract. <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Barnard, </em>214 Conn. 99, 109, 570 A.2d 690 (1990). In interpreting contract items, we have repeatedly stated that the intent of the parties is to be ascertained by a fair and reasonable construction of the written words and that the language used must be accorded its common, natural, and ordinary meaning and usage where it can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract. . . . Where the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract is to be given effect according to its terms. A court will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity and words do not become ambiguous simply because lawyers or laymen contend for different meanings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Legg </em>v. <em>Legg, </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">We conclude from our construction of their separation agreement that the parties here intended, except under certain circumstances,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the plaintiff would pay the cost of tuition and room and board associated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>with his sons\u2019 college educations. Article ten of the parties\u2019 separation agreement is titled \u201cchild support and education of the children.\u201d The fourth, fifth and sixth paragraphs of article ten concern the responsibilities of the parties for their sons\u2019 educations. Paragraph four provides that the plaintiff \u201cagrees to pay the tuition of any private schools or undergraduate colleges the parties\u2019 children choose to attend. [The plaintiff] shall be consulted prior to the decision of such school or college. (Such schools to include any undergraduate private schools.)\u201d The next paragraph provides in relevant part that the plaintiff \u201calso agrees to pay fully the room and board of any private schools or undergraduate colleges the parties\u2019 children choose to attend so long as [the defendant\u2019s] income is below the \u2018Index\u2019 set forth below.\u201d The final paragraph provides that \u201c[t]he parties shall share equally all other related expenses pertaining to the children\u2019s private school or undergraduate educations over and above tuition and room and board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">This court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Legg </em>concerning the expenses of room and board applies to the facts here as well. The circumstances in both cases indicate that when they were divorcing, the parents recognized the importance of a college education for the children and agreed to provide some manner of financial assistance in that regard. In <em>Legg </em>we stated: \u201cThe stipulation of the parties made clear their intention to pay for the room and board of their children when they attended college. These items have a dollar value, whether incurred on or off campus, and each party agreed to pay one half of that value. Nowhere in the agreement is there a specification that requires the child to live on campus for the parents to be responsible for room and board expenses. The defendant could have incorporated such a specification into the stipulation had he wanted, but he did not. If the son had lived on campus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>the evidence indicated that the father\u2019s share of room and board would greatly exceed $750.\u201d Id., 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Here, the parties agreed that the plaintiff would pay the cost of room and board associated with their children\u2019s college education. They could have specified that their sons had to live in college sponsored housing for the plaintiff to be responsible for room and board, but they did not do so. Pursuant to the separation agreement, the plaintiff agreed to give his children the freedom to attend the college of their choice. In the face of such an agreement, the plaintiff cannot now say that he will not pay the cost of room and board for Benjamin because the young man has elected to attend a state university that does not provide student housing. The court therefore improperly denied the defendant\u2019s motion, and we reverse that portion of the court\u2019s judgment. On remand, the court must hear evidence to determine the costs of Benjamin\u2019s room and board in the defendant\u2019s home or wherever he may reside while he is enrolled at college.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the court improperly applied the best interest of the child standard to the issue of postmajority education. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of this claim. During the hearing on the defendant\u2019s postjudgment motion, the court heard testimony from both the plaintiff and James. In its memorandum of decision, the court stated: \u201cThe plaintiff testified, and the court finds this testimony persuasive, that if James does not have to contribute to the cost of his education, he will probably again not follow through and complete his education. James himself testified that he wants to attend college again, but could not finance college on his own unless he attended only part-time or during evenings so that he can get a job to pay for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>his education expenses. Despite this, however, James testified that he wanted to pay for his tuition himself and did not want his father to be ordered by the court to pay tuition. James also stated that he thought he would complete his education if he had to pay for it himself and thought he might respect himself more if he had to pay for it himself. From this evidence, the court finds persuasive the plaintiffs testimony that it is James\u2019 best interest if the plaintiff does not pay for tuition for James.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">\u201cIn this context, where the court has found it not to be in James\u2019 best interest for the plaintiff to pay for James\u2019 tuition, the court must now rule on the defendant\u2019s request that the plaintiff be ordered to do so.\u201d Thereafter, the court construed the parties\u2019 separation agreement, applying the law of contracts. The court concluded that \u201cthe plaintiff fulfilled the reasonable and foreseeable obligations imposed on him by the separation agreement and intended by the parties in this regard when he paid for tuition and college expenses for James when he last attended [Northwestern Connecticut Community-Technical College].\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Immediately following that conclusion, the court stated: \u201cIn considering this matter, moreover, the Superior Court sits as a court of equity. . . . <em>Based on the court\u2019s finding of James\u2019 best interest, </em>the court holds it would be inequitable to require the father to pay for tuition that would not benefit his son.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the best interest of the child standard does not apply to postmajority educational issues and that the court improperly failed to base its ruling on the separation agreement. We agree with the plaintiff that the best interest of the child standard has no application to postmajority educational issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>The plaintiff argues, without citation or analysis, that the court\u2019s \u201cfinding\u201d as to James\u2019 best interest was a \u201cfinding of fact and not the holding of the trial court.\u201d Although the memorandum of decision is not a model of clarity, it is clear to this court that the trial court based its conclusions concerning the plaintiffs contractual obligations, in part, on its own belief of what is best for James.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">At the time of the hearing, James was twenty-one years old. General Statutes \u00a7 1-ld provides that \u201cany person eighteen years of age or older shall be an adult for all purposes whatsoever and have the same legal capacity, rights, powers, privileges, duties, liabilities and responsibilities as persons heretofore had at twenty-one years of age, and \u2018age of majority\u2019 shall be deemed to be eighteen years.\u201d We have not been able to find any case law or other authority in which a court has determined the legal rights of an adult or one who has reached the age of majority by the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d standard. Our statutes, in fact, are to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The jurisdiction of the court to enter an order concerning the education of a child beyond the age of eighteen is permitted exclusively by statute. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66 provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]f the [separation] agreement is in writing and provides for the . . . education ... of a child beyond the age of eighteen, it may also be incorporated or otherwise made a part of any such order and shall be enforceable to the same extent as any other provision of such order or decree . . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Whether the plaintiff or the court believes James may be better served by an alternate strategy for funding his education, the separation agreement, enforceable pursuant to \u00a7 46b-66 and not modifiable except by written agreement of the parties, is determinative of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>plaintiffs obligation to pay for James\u2019 education. The agreement is a contract and must be interpreted by our laws pertaining to the construction of a contract. To that end, the court also made findings of fact with respect to the separation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In addition to the best interest standard, the court found, with regard to the separation agreement, that the plaintiff had not been consulted about James\u2019 education after he left Northwestern Connecticut Community-Technical College. The court also determined that the plaintiff had fulfilled his obligation to James by paying his son\u2019s tuition for one semester at the community college. On the basis of our review of the record, however, there was no evidence before the court to make such a finding. Although the court concluded that the plaintiff had fulfilled the reasonable and foreseeable obligations imposed on him by the separation agreement, the record is void of any evidence as to the intention of the parties as to what they considered reasonable obligations at the time they entered into the separation agreement. See <em>Sablosky </em>v. <em>Sablosky, </em>61 Conn. App. 66, 71, 762 A.2d 922 (2000) (\u201c \u2018well settled standard of review in domestic relations cases is that this court will not disturb trial court orders unless the trial court has abused its legal discretion or its findings have no reasonable basis in the facts\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Because the court improperly applied the best interest standard to the issue of James\u2019 postmajority education and found the reasonable obligations of the plaintiff in the absence of evidence to support its finding, we reverse that portion of the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings to ascertain, in part, the parties\u2019 intent at the time they entered into the separation agreement regarding the extent to which they reasonably expected to provide for their children\u2019s postmajority education, e.g., the equivalent of eight full-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>time semesters of study at the colleges of their sons\u2019 choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that the court improperly denied her request for attorney\u2019s fees. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">In her postjudgment motion, the defendant requested that the plaintiff be ordered to pay Benjamin\u2019s and James\u2019 college expenses, among other things, and to pay for the expenses of the motion, including attorney\u2019s fees and her travel expenses. Although the defendant titled her motion one for contempt, she did not request that the plaintiff be found in contempt. The court did not find the plaintiff to be in contempt, but it did order the plaintiff to do certain things pursuant to the parties\u2019 separation agreement, which was incorporated in the judgment of dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Ordinarily, courts in this country do not award attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party unless there is a prior agreement between the parties or the payment of such fees is provided for by statute. <em>Raph </em>v. <em>Vogeler, </em>45 Conn. App. 56, 65, 695 A.2d 1066, cert. denied, 241 Conn. 920, 696 A.2d 342 (1997). General Statutes \u00a7 46b-87<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides that the court may award attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party in a contempt proceeding.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>dant did not ask that the plaintiff be found in contempt and he was not found to be in contempt and because certain of the items for which the defendant sought reimbursement are not included in the statute, the court properly denied the defendant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses related to the prosecution of her postjudgment motion. The portion of the court\u2019s judgment related to attorney\u2019s fees therefore is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">The judgment is reversed only on the issues of room and board for the parties\u2019 youngest son and tuition and other expenses for the parties\u2019 oldest son and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-12\"> The defendant\u2019s motion was titled motion for contempt or order post-judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b584-13\"> The court heard evidence on the issue of prior consultation and found that the plaintiff had not been consulted in accordance with the separation agreement. Both parties addressed the correctness of the court\u2019s finding; neither party argues on appeal that the court improperly considered the question of prior consultation in construing the separation agreement. Prior consultation is a condition precedent to the plaintiffs paying for his sons\u2019 education.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-14\">Although the court found that the plaintiff had not been consulted about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>the colleges that Benjamin and James would attend, the plaintiff did not claim at the hearing, or in his brief to this court, that the lack of consultation was the reason he had refused to pay for certain college related expenses of the parties\u2019 sons. Indeed, the plaintiff agreed to pay Benjamin\u2019s tuition. The plaintiff refused to pay any college related expenses for James because James had not completed prior educational endeavors he had undertaken. We therefore decline to review this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b585-10\"> The defendant titled her motion a motion for contempt or order. The defendant, however, did not ask the court to find the plaintiff in contempt but to order the plaintiff to do certain things pursuant to the judgment of dissolution. The court treated the motion as a motion to compel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b586-8\"> The plaintiff did not appeal from the court\u2019s judgment ordering him to share the cost of certain of Benjamin\u2019s college related expenses or from other orders not related to the defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b588-8\"> In <em>Legg, </em>the parties\u2019 son enrolled in Quinnipiac College in the fall of 1994 and lived at home with his mother to reduce expenses. The father refused to pay the cost of his son\u2019s living expenses because the young man was living at home rather than on campus. <em>Legg </em>v. <em>Legg, </em>supra, 44 Conn.
