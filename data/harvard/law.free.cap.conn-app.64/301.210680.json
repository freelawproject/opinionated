We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. In 1986, Schweitzer agreed to represent the plaintiff in a retaliatory discharge action against her former employer, the Connecticut state library. In 1994 or early 1995, the parties entered into an oral retainer agreement, in which Schweitzer agreed to accept a legal fee of 20 percent for representing the plaintiff. Thereafter, Schweitzer diligently represented the plaintiff in the workers\u2019 compensation proceeding and obtained a finding dated August 2, 1995, establish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>ing the employer\u2019s liability pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">On or about August 15, 1996, Schweitzer requested that the plaintiff sign a document agreeing to increase his fee to one-third of the gross award.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Despite her concerns, the plaintiff signed and returned the document to him without consideration or an adequate explanation because she trusted his advice and was pleased with his work.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In a note attached to the signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>agreement, she praised him for an excellent job and stated that he \u201cdeserve[d] every penny\u201d of his fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Schweitzer continued to prosecute the plaintiffs claim, and commissioner George A. Waldron issued a finding and award dated February 16,1996. The finding and award ordered reinstatement of the plaintiff to employment similar to the position she held before her termination, remittance of $145,675.60 in back pay ($203,575.84 in lost wages minus an offset of $57,900.24 for wages earned after termination), credit for her accumulated sick time and vacation time, credit for her retirement contributions and a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee of $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Both parties appealed to this court from the commissioner\u2019s decision, but withdrew their appeals with prejudice and exchanged releases pursuant to a settlement agreement dated July 2, 1996. The agreement was substantially similar to the prior award and provided for the payment of back wages owed to the plaintiff ($146,675.50, minus taxes and retirement contributions that would have been deducted had she continued working) and her reinstatement as an employee with credit for more than ten years of accrued vacation and sick leave. Unlike the prior award, however, the agreement also provided that the plaintiff would be paid \u201c$90,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and in further consideration of her release of any and all claims against the State of Connecticut and [Connecticut state library].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Under the terms of the settlement, the state paid the plaintiff $236,675.50. After withholding $39,515.58 in federal income taxes,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> $6014.20 for FICA and $6600.40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>in state income taxes, the employer paid the plaintiff a net cash payment of $184,545.32.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Schweitzer then submitted to the plaintiff a document titled \u201cState of Account and Reconciliation of Cash Received.\u201d On the basis of Schweitzer\u2019s accounting, the total value of the plaintiffs award was $390,762.12, consisting of $203,575.84 in back wages (including the credit deducted by the state for wages earned after termination), $50,000 in attorney\u2019s fees, $40,000 in interest,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> $65,471.20 in retirement benefits, and $31,715.10 in vacation and sick day awards. Schweitzer deducted from the state\u2019s original $236,675.50 cash payment to the plaintiff his attorney\u2019s fee ($130,254.04 pursuant to the one-third contingency fee agreement), an amount for support services and research ($7997.50), state and federal income taxes ($46,115.98) and FICA ($6014.20), leaving the plaintiff with a net cash recovery of only $40,784.72.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Displeased with that accounting, the plaintiff hired separate counsel to contest Schweitzer\u2019s fee. At a hearing before commissioner Stephen B. Delaney, she argued that Schweitzer\u2019s fee should be limited to $50,000, the amount determined in the 1996 award, plus payment for additional time and costs not to exceed a total of $75,000. Schweitzer introduced no evidence to support a higher fee other than the retainer agreement and the plaintiffs expressed satisfaction with his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>In a ruling dated November 17, 1998, the commissioner rejected Schweitzer\u2019s claims that the commission lacked jurisdiction to determine attorney\u2019s fees in a \u00a7 31-290a action and that the contingency fee was reasonable pursuant to <em>In re Estate of Salerno, </em>42 Conn. Sup. 526, 630 A.2d 1386 (1993). The commissioner awarded Schweitzer a fee of $75,000, inclusive of the previous award of $50,000. The commissioner found that although the amount of attorney\u2019s fees awarded in a \u00a7 31-290a action is not the maximum an attorney may accept, Schweitzer did not provide any evidence that his expertise and ability, the time he spent on the case, the results he achieved in that time, the standard billing rate for such a case or the novelty of the legal questions he addressed warranted a higher fee pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-327.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Schweitzer filed a motion to open and modify the decision, but the motion was denied. He then appealed from the denial of his motion and from the November 17, 1999 decision. The board affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Schweitzer first claims that the board\u2019s affirmation of commissioner Delaney\u2019s decision to \u201creduce\u201d his attorney\u2019s fees to $75,000 was premised on inferences unreasonably drawn from the facts and an incorrect application of the law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">\u201cAs a threshold matter, we set forth the standard of review applicable to workers\u2019 compensation appeals. The principles that govern our standard of review in workers\u2019 compensation appeals are well established. The conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. . . . <em>Besade </em>v. <em>Interstate Security Ser</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number><em>vices, </em>212 Conn. 441, 449, 562 A.2d 1086 (1989). . . . It is well established that [although not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes by the commissioner and review board. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary. . . . [0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. ... As with any issue of statutory inteipretation, our initial guide is the language of the operative statutory provisions.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>61 Conn. App. 9, 13-14, 762 A.2d 480 (2000), cert. denied, 255 Conn. 933, 767 A.2d 104 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Schweitzer claims that the commissioner has no authority to \u201creduce\u201d his fees because the fees are contained in a separate award. He argues that the plain language of General Statutes \u00a7 31-280 (b) (11) (C) requires the commissioner to issue guidelines for \u201cthe maximum fees <em>payable by a claimant\u201d; </em>(emphasis added); for the legal services rendered by an attorney, which means that the commission has authority to approve attorney\u2019s fees only to the extent that the <em>claimant </em>bears the burden of paying the fees. Schweitzer contends that this provision protects a claimant from losing the benefit of her recovery, but that here, the provision does not apply because the plaintiffs employer paid her a separate amount specifically designated for attorney\u2019s fees. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Section 31-290a (b) (2) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides that any employee who is discharged or discriminated against because he or she has filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits or otherwise exercised the rights afforded to them pursuant to the act may file a complaint with the commissioner, and \u201c[a]ny employee who prevails in such a complaint shall be awarded reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. ...\u201d Section 31-327 (a) provides that the commissioner may make an award of such fees \u201cdirectly in favor of the person entitled to the fees . . . [and] . . . [t]he award may be combined with an award for compensation in favor of or against the injured employee ... or may be the subject of an award covering only the fees and expenses.\u201d Section 31-327 (b) further provides that <em>\u2018[a]ll </em>fees of attorneys ... or other persons for services <em>under this chapter </em>shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u201cWe inteipret the regulations of an administrative body pursuant to the principles of statutory construction. . . . When interpreting a regulation, we must use common sense. . . . Courts must assume that a reasonable and rational result was intended and construe the regulation accordingly. . . . When confronted with two possible interpretations, courts will adopt the interpretation that makes the regulations effective and workable, and not the one that leads to unreasonable results.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Day </em>v. Middletown, 59 Conn. App. 816, 821-22, 757 A.2d 1267, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 945, 762 A.2d 900 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">We conclude that the commissioner has statutory authority to approve attorney\u2019s fees contained in a separate award and that the board\u2019s affirmation of the commissioner\u2019s decision cannot be successfully challenged on that ground. Subsection (a) of \u00a7 31-327 flatly states that an award of fees to a claimant may be made sepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>rately or combined with an award for compensation. Subsection (b) directly follows and modifies subsection (a) , and further provides that <em>all </em>attorney\u2019s fees shall be subject to the commissioner\u2019s approval. Subsection (b) makes no distinction between fees that are awarded separately and fees that are combined with other compensation. In the absence of a statutory exception, we are not persuaded that a separate award of fees is exempt from the commissioner\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The board itself reached asimilar conclusion in <em>Ayala </em>v. <em>Konover Residential Corp., </em>14 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 87, 89 (1995), in which it stated that the \u201cplain language\u201d of \u00a7 31-227 (b) makes <em>all </em>attorney\u2019s fees subject to the approval of the commissioner. \u201c[General Statutes \u00a7 1-1] requires that, in interpreting our statutes, we construe nontechnical words and phrases \u2018according to the commonly approved usage of the language.\u2019 \u2018Subject\u2019 is defined by the American Heritage Dictionary (2d Ed. 1982) as meaning \u2018[u]nder the power or authority of another: subject to the law. . . . Contingent or dependent: subject to approval.\u2019 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary further defines \u2018subject to\u2019 as meaning \u2018[liable, subordinate, subservient, inferior, obedient to; governed or affected by; provided that; provided; answerable for.\u2019 It would be inconsistent with both the clear meaning of those definitions and the humanitarian purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act in general to read \u00a7 31-327 (b) as limiting the authority of commissioners to oversee attorney\u2019s fees .... A commissioner should be free to examine <em>all </em>attorney\u2019s fee agreements to be sure that they are consistent with the attorney\u2019s fee guidelines promulgated by the chairman of the workers\u2019 compensation commission in accordance with \u00a7 31-280 (b) (11) (C).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Ayala </em>v. <em>Konover Residential Corp., </em>supra, 89; see also <em>Day </em>v. <em>Middletown, </em>No. 3264 CRB-8-96-2 (May 20, 1997); <em>LaPia </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>No. 3109 CRB-4-95-6 (August 29, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>1996), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 47 Conn. App. 391, 706 A.2d 11 (1997). Accordingly, we agree with the board that Schweitzer\u2019s fee was subject to the commissioner\u2019s approval pursuant to \u00a7 31-327 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Schweitzer also argues that the commissioner does not have statutory authority to approve attorney\u2019s fees paid by a claimant\u2019s employer under the terms of a negotiated settlement agreement between the parties. We decline to review Schweitzer\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\u201cIt is well settled that this court will not review statutory claims that are raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>255 Conn. 830, 843, 769 A.2d 698 (2001). We find no basis in the record to consider Schweitzer\u2019s newly raised statutory claim. Schweitzer did not refer to the settlement agreement in his brief to the board; he did not refer to it even in his statement of facts. He argued instead that the plaintiff waived her right to have attorney\u2019s fees approved by the commissioner when she agreed to the contingent fee arrangement. Consequently, as Schweitzer himself now points out in his brief to this court, any discussion of the $90,000 attorney\u2019s fee awarded in the settlement agreement was \u201cconspicuously absent from [the] legal analyses\u201d contained in the rulings of both the commissioner and the board. The board \u201cnecessarily could have made no ruling\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id.; and Schweitzer\u2019s claim as to the settlement agreement is, therefore, not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">In the alternative, Schweitzer claims that the provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act pertaining to the commissioner\u2019s oversight and approval of attorney\u2019s fees are impermissibly vague, and violate his state and federal constitutional due process rights as applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the facts of this case. He claims that, according to the board, \u00a7\u00a7 31-280 (b) (11) and 31-327 confer broad authority on the commissioner to regulate all attorney\u2019s fees, regardless of their source, and even permit the commissioner to modify the fees contained in a settlement agreement between the parties. He argues that, to the extent that this is a proper reading of the statutes, they cannot be enforced. This claim also is raised for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u201cOnly in the most exceptional circumstances will this court consider a claim that was not raised [before the trial court]. . . . Such exceptional circumstances may occur where a new and unforeseen constitutional right has arisen between the time of trial and appeal or where the record supports a claim that a litigant has been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial. ... An exception may also be made where consideration of the question is in the interest of public welfare or of justice between the parties.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Egbarin, </em>61 Conn.
