We are not persuaded and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The following facts and procedural history are necessary to our disposition of the respondent\u2019s appeal. D was bom on October 22, 1988. He has four siblings, Q, bom on December 14, 1983, R, bom on April 12, 1991, J, bom on November 17, 1992, and A, bom on January 1, 1995. On January 8, 1993, and again on February 25, 1993, the Yale-New Haven Hospital Lead Clinic (Yale) filed reports of medical neglect on D\u2019s behalf. He had been hospitalized for extreme lead poisoning. High levels of lead were found in D\u2019s body, he was suffering from high fevers and repeatedly losing consciousness. The respondent refused to comply with medical followup, including immunizations for D. On May 27, 1994, Yale filed a third report of medical neglect on D\u2019s behalf. He had been hospitalized once again for extreme lead poisoning, and the respondent did not visit D.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The department investigated and found that the respondent was not following through with D\u2019s medical treatment. The respondent also admitted to using cocaine. A department caseworker referred the respondent to the Addiction Prevention Treatment Foundation for substance abuse evaluation and treatment. She did not follow through with the evaluation. The department also found that the family\u2019s apartment contained lead and informed the respondent that she would have to move. The department of social services, however, was already in the process of trying to find alternative housing for the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">On January 6,1995, a New Haven public school supervisor filed a report of educational neglect on D\u2019s behalf. He had been enrolled in a special education preschool, but only attended once. On February 17,1995, Yale filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>another medical neglect report on D\u2019s behalf after he was hospitalized for the tenth time for chelation therapy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On that same day, the commissioner filed a neglect petition and a request for an order of temporary custody with respect to D, citing as the reason the respondent\u2019s continuing drug abuse. The court granted an order of temporary custody, and D was placed in a foster home.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">On February 27, 1995, the respondent entered a plea of nolo contendere to medical neglect of D and signed a list of court-ordered expectations requiring that she (1) keep appointments with the department, (2) notify the department of her whereabouts, (3) visit D consistently, (4) participate in drug and alcohol counseling, (5) sign releases as requested, (6) secure and maintain adequate housing and income, (7) refrain from substance abuse, (8) secure and maintain a lead free apartment and test her other children for lead poisoning, and (9) release information. On March 17, 1995, D was adjudicated neglected and committed to the care of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">On January 12, 1996, during a treatment plan conference with the department, the respondent, once again, signed her service agreement containing the previously mentioned nine requirements. During the five years that D has been in foster care, the respondent failed to comply with most of those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">After D was removed from his mother\u2019s care, the department referred the respondent for substance abuse treatment programs at the Addiction Prevention Treatment Foundation and the Hospital of St. Raphael. The respondent canceled all of her appointments for evaluations. The department then referred her to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Four C\u2019s agency for home family preservation services.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Again, the respondent failed to keep her appointments, and Four C\u2019s, thereafter, closed her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">After D was first placed in foster care, the department scheduled weekly visits between him and his mother. The respondent missed more than half of those scheduled visits. The department then moved the scheduled visits to the respondent\u2019s home. That resulted in an improvement of the respondent\u2019s attendance, but D repeatedly fell ill during the visits. The respondent informed the department that the lead in the apartment may have accounted for D\u2019s illness. The department, thereafter, moved the visits to alternate sites in the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">In September, 1997, the department received a referral regarding the respondent\u2019s other four children. The department investigated and found the respondent, her other four children, Q, R, J and A, and Q\u2019s infant daughter, living in an apartment without food, heat or electricity. The respondent continued her substance abuse. The department removed the respondent\u2019s four remaining children, along with Q\u2019s infant child, from the home. At the time of the trial in this case, none of the respondent\u2019s children had been returned to her, and petitions for the termination of her parental rights with regard to R and J were pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">After the remaining children were removed, the department set up supervised visits for the respondent and D at the department offices. She attended fewer than half of those visits. The department moved the scheduled visits from its offices to various locations in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>the community. Still, the respondent attended only sporadically.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Following her children\u2019s removal, the respondent once again admitted ongoing substance abuse to her caseworker. Thereafter, the department made the following referrals: (1) to the Addiction Prevention Treatment Foundation<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> once again, (2) to the Guenster Rehabilitation Center,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (3) to the Hospital of St. Raphael<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> again, (4) to Amethyst House for inpatient treatment,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (5) to Advanced Behavioral Health Voluntary Substance Abuse Services for Primary Caregivers, (6) to the Women and Children\u2019s Center for inpatient drug treatment on two occasions, (7) to the New Haven Family Alliance, (8) to Crossroads for inpatient substance abuse treatment, (9) to the AIDS Interfaith Program for individual therapy and substance abuse services, and (10) to Connecticut Valley Hospital for outpatient substance abuse. As late as November, 1999, the respondent sought a substance abuse referral from her caseworker, but did not follow through.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">While in the custody of the department, D was diagnosed as autistic, and experienced continued intellectual and cognitive difficulties due to the lead poisoning that he had suffered as a young child. When D was first committed to the department\u2019s care in February, 1995, he was six and one-half years old and spoke very few words. He had not been attending school, suffered from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>high fevers and repeatedly lost consciousness due to severe lead poisoning. After one month of placement, the department moved D to the home of his maternal uncle. In October, 1995, however, D\u2019s uncle returned to school and could no longer care for D. At that time, D was placed in the foster home of H.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">While with H, D began speaking, reading and bonding with his foster father. H expressed a desire to adopt D, and the department approved that as part of D\u2019s long-term treatment plan. The respondent also approved of H\u2019s intention to adopt D. In February, 1998, the respondent agreed with the department not to seek reunification with D and consented to the termination of her parental rights so that H might adopt him. On February 17,1998, the Superior Court found that no further reunification efforts were required for the respondent and D. In September, 1998, H moved to Florida and informed the department that he would be ready to take D after three months. H never returned to take D. D was immensely hurt and disappointed, and the department eventually terminated all communication between D and H. The department coordinated counseling for D to help him deal with H\u2019s abandonment and D\u2019s placement in a new foster home. D has adjusted well in his current foster home. He calls his foster mother \u201cmom\u201d and has connected with the other children in the home, community and church. He also is doing well in school. That placement is not preadoptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">D and the respondent were evaluated by a court-appointed psychologist. The psychologist concluded that (1) D requires placement in a home in which the family understands his handicaps and in which he feels acceptance and support, (2) the respondent has significant cognitive limitations and exhibits antisocial traits, both of which would impair her ability to care adequately for D, and hinder her willingness to work with the educational system and D\u2019s other service providers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>(3) D is not emotionally bonded to the respondent and neither seeks physical affection from her nor shares memories with her of their life together,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (4) it is not in D\u2019s best interest to be returned to the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">On February 1,1999, the commissioner filed a petition for the termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights as to D. The court had found on February 17, 1998, that further efforts toward reunification of D and the respondent were not appropriate. On May 2, 2000, the court terminated the respondent\u2019s parental rights after having determined that she had failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation. At the present time, D is thirteen years old and must consent before there can be any adoption. D\u2019s attorney agrees with the respondent that termination of her rights will not benefit D, and that it would be detrimental to sever his relationships with the respondent and with his siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">The respondent first claims that the court improperly concluded that the department made reasonable reunification efforts prior to the commissioner\u2019s filing of the petition for termination of her parental rights. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that in seeking to terminate parental rights, the commissioner must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the department made reasonable efforts to reunify the parent and child as required by [General Statutes (Rev. to 1999)] \u00a7 17a-112<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (c) (1). . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>We also note that [t]he statutory criteria must be strictly complied with before termination can be accomplished. ... On appeal, our function is to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>the trial court\u2019s conclusion was legally correct and factually supported; every reasonable presumption is made in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling and we will disturb the findings of the trial court in either the adjudication or disposition phases only if they are clearly erroneous.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Amanda A., </em>58 Conn. App. 451, 454-55, 755 A.2d 243 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>\u201cBefore a termination of parental rights can be granted, the trial court must be convinced that the department has made reasonable efforts to reunite the [child with the] family. The term reasonable efforts was recently addressed by this court: Turning to the statutory scheme encompassing the termination of the parental rights of a child committed to the department, the statute imposes on the department the duty, inter alia, to make reasonable efforts to reunite the child or children with the parents. The word reasonable is the linchpin on which the department\u2019s efforts in a particular set of circumstances are to be adjudged, using the clear and convincing standard of proof. Neither the word reasonable nor the word efforts is, however, defined by our legislature or by the federal act from which the requirement was drawn. . . . [Reasonable efforts means doing everything reasonable, not everything possible.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The court granted the termination petition on the ground that the respondent had failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation. The court\u2019s factual findings are supported by the record and easily meet the requirements set forth by \u00a7 17a-112. The court specifically found that (1) appropriate and timely services were provided by the department to the respondent and her family, (2) the department made reasonable efforts to reunify the family, (3) reasonable court expectations were set for the respondent, and she was not able to fulfill them even minimally, (4) D is not emotionally attached to the respondent, (5) D was born on October 22,1988, (6) the respondent made no changes in her life to accommodate the care and nurturing of D, the respondent visited D sporadically, and only after the filing of the termination petition did she send him gifts and cards and recognize his birthday, and (7) the department took many steps for many years, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>encouraging the respondent to both nurture a meaningful relationship with D and to rehabilitate herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The respondent specifically claims that because she agreed to H\u2019s adoption of D, no efforts were made toward reunification after the February 17,1998 finding by the Superior Court that further reunification efforts were not required. That does not negate the continuous efforts made by the department prior to February 17, 1998. D was committed to the custody of the commissioner on March 17, 1995. By the time that the court found that no more efforts were necessary, D had been in foster care for three years. The department made constant and continuous efforts during those three years to reunite D and the respondent. As previously discussed, the court found that the respondent did not avail herself of those many opportunities. Further, as late as November, 1999, the respondent requested a referral for drug treatment from the department, which the department provided. She once again failed to follow through. \u201cReasonable efforts\u201d does not mean \u201cevery possible\u201d effort, but every reasonable effort. The evidence clearly shows that the department made every reasonable effort to reunite the respondent with D.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">We conclude that the court properly found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the department made reasonable reunification efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">The respondent next claims that the court improperly found that termination of her parental rights is in the best interest of D. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">\u201cThe desire and right of a parent to maintain a familial relationship with a child cannot be separated from the desire and best interest of a child either to maintain or to abandon that relationship, or the interest of the state in safeguarding the welfare of children. These legitimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>interests of parent, child and state require a balancing of the factors involved in those interests. ... In every case involving parental rights, a struggle exists between parents and the state to determine what is in the child\u2019s best interest, the child being the focus of the struggle.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>In re Shaquanna M., </em>61 Conn. App. 592, 598-99, 767 A.2d 155 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u201cIn the dispositional phase of a termination of parental rights hearing, the trial court must determine whether it is established by clear and convincing evidence that the continuation of the respondent\u2019s parental rights is not in the best interest of the child. In arriving at this decision, the court is mandated to consider and make written findings regarding seven factors delineated in [General Statutes (Rev. to 1999)] \u00a7 17a-112 (d). On appeal, we will disturb the findings of the trial court in both the adjudication and disposition only if they are clearly erroneous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Tyscheicka H., </em>61 Conn. App. 19, 26, 762 A.2d 916 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">As previously stated, the court made detailed, written findings regarding all seven factors required by \u00a7 17a-112 (d). In its memorandum of decision, filed May 2, 2000, the court further stated that \u201cthere is no biological parent ready now or in the foreseeable future who will be able to care for [D]. Despite the fact that continued counseling between [the respondent] and [D] could possibly improve their relationship, the court concludes it is both too little and too late as [the respondent] simply does not possess the capacity to care for this special needs child. The court concludes, from the clear and convincing testimony, that it is in [D\u2019s] best interest to have permanency and stability in his life. The court further finds that adoption by a family that understands and can accommodate his special needs is the avenue most likely to accomplish this result for [D]. The court also finds the testimony concerning [D\u2019s] adoptability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>persuasive. The court is aware that there are a number of private adoption agencies for placement [of] children like [D]. The court concludes that termination of [the respondent\u2019s] rights to him will make his ultimate adoption more probable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">We see no reason to disturb the findings of the court, and conclude that those findings are well supported by the record and illustrate (1) the department\u2019s continued efforts to reunite the respondent and D, (2) the respondent\u2019s failure to comply with any of those efforts, (3) that D\u2019s best interest lies in his chances for adoption and (4) that termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights will make D\u2019s adoption more likely. D has now been in foster care for more than six years. There is no evidence before us that during those six years, the respondent made any progress toward rehabilitating herself. D\u2019s best interest lies in the hope that he will be adopted by a family that understands and can accommodate his special needs, not that he will be returned to the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">The respondent\u2019s final claim is that the court improperly utilized a \u201csympathy standard\u201d in determining the best interests of D. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">The respondent\u2019s claim stems from a passage in the court\u2019s memorandum of decision, which states: \u201cThe court would have some slight sympathy with this argument<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> had [the department] cut off [the respondent\u2019s] access to D after February, 1998, and not provided either visitation or services. The claim would have even more merit had [the respondent] made demonstrable progress in the early years of [D\u2019s] placement. But neither of these things happened. [The respondent] had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>not made any progress toward reunification when [D] had been in [foster] care for over two years. Further, [the department] has permitted visitation up to the present time. [The department] has also continued to provide services after the termination petition was filed, despite the court order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">The respondent fails to provide either legal authority or analysis to support her theory. \u201cWe are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief. . . . Analysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Shane P., </em>58 Conn. App. 234, 243-44, 753 A.2d 409 (2000). \u201cWe will not review claims absent law and analysis.\u201d <em>Altfeter v. Naugatuck, </em>53 Conn. App. 791, 796 n.5, 732 A.2d 207 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">As previously stated, the court made detailed and voluminous findings regarding the respondent\u2019s failure to achieve a sufficient degree of rehabilitation and D\u2019s best interest. Simply because the court couched a small portion of its discussion in terms of sympathy, or lack thereof, does not undermine in any way the ample evidentiary support for its determination regarding the best interest of D. The court applied the correct standard according to \u00a7 17a-112 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-13\"> The court also terminated the parental rights of the respondent father. He has not appealed from the court\u2019s judgment. We therefore refer in this opinion to the respondent mother as the respondent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b480-9\"> Chelation therapy is utilized in children who have been exposed to lead.
