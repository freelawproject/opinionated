We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the commission\u2019s appeal. On August 26, 1998, the plaintiff, the owner of certain land on Ledges Road in Ridgefield, submitted a resubdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>application to the commission,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking approval for four building lots. Public hearings for the plaintiffs applications were conducted by the commission on September 22, 1998,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and November 17, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">At the September 22, 1998 hearing, the commission expressed concerns regarding the steep slope of the property<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the preservation of the existing features of the land.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff acknowledged that the slope of certain land involved in the resubdivision application was an issue \u201cin particular\u201d that previously had been considered. At that hearing, a letter to the commission, regarding the plaintiffs application, from the Ridgefield conservation commission was read. In part, the letter stated: \u201c[T]he applicant is attempting to put houses on land with grades running 35% to 70%. \u201d The letter advocated denial of the applications \u201cunless more details] . . . are provided and satisfactorily address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>the many problems created by the extraordinarily steep grades.\u201d In the same letter, the conservation commission wrote about what it called the \u201cvery steep\u201d condition on the property and stated that \u201cextraordinary measures will be required to stabilize these slopes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Dainius L. Virbickas, an engineer from Tyree Engineering, P.C., the firm that prepared the plans filed by the plaintiff, also spoke at the September 22, 1998 meeting. When asked by a commission member about the plans to stabilize the steep slopes on the property, Virbickas replied, \u201cRight now, we have just shown one to one slopes to be stabilized with riprap, but as one of the letters had mentioned, we probably will encounter ledge and probably will have that to face as our slope.\u201d A commission member also questioned Virbickas about whether borings had been conducted to determine the extent of the ledge that might be encountered. Virbickas answered, \u201cNot yet, not yet. The only machines that we have had out there were backhoes for septic system testing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the commission directed the plaintiff to two sections of the subdivision regulations of the town of Ridgefield, appendix A, ait. IV, \u00a7\u00a7 4-18 and 4-31, which were read in full into the record. The commission decided to continue the hearing until a later date to enable the plaintiff to more fully address concerns raised with regard to the slope of the land, pursuant to \u00a7 4-18, and the preservation of existing features of the land, pursuant to \u00a7 4-31. The commission further instructed the plaintiff to provide more detailed information about the slope of the land and preserving the existing features, including the need for additional drawings, \u201cat a minimum, twenty-scale drawings of each site, very detailed [including] landscaping necessary to stabilize the slopes.\u201d The hearing was then adjourned until November 17, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>At the November 17, 1998 hearing, the plaintiff presented Mark Komhaus of Tyree Engineering, P.C., who had the \u201crenderings\u201d that the commission had requested earlier. The plaintiff also introduced additional counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff, in discussing the maps and the property involved, as they were displayed before the commission, stated, \u201cWe are going to [explain] to you the grades on these lots. The driveway grades are actually fairly gentle, even though, of course, the slope of the property is <em>fairly steep as it goes up from the </em>road, as you know.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Kornhaus also addressed the issue of the slope of the lots on behalf of the plaintiff and stated that as to ledge, they were \u201canticipating\u201d that \u201cwe are going to hit rock on this site. In fact, it is very evident that there is ledge; there are actual outcrops there [which could be handled by] shelving it off at one to one and creating a retaining wall.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When asked by the commission how he could determine the nature of the ledge present on the lots so as to know to \u201cdo a one on one, and [whether] it is all just ledge, solid right through,\u201d Komhaus replied, \u201cWhen you are dealing with ledge, you never really know what you are going to get into until you actually uncover it. And what I am talking about is a fractured type of ledge [as distinguished from] something that is very solid, your granite type of bedrock.\u201d The commission then read to Komhaus the last sentence of \u00a7 4-18 of the regulations and asked him whether \u201cledge rock and fractured rock\u201d meant the same thing, to which Kornhaus answered, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">There appears to be no question that there were visible ledge outcroppings on the application site. The com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>mission expressed concern, however, that the resubdivision application as presented apparently called for grading areas of a slope that exceeded the maximum provided in \u00a7 4-18. The commission also stressed to the plaintiff that it had reservations because there were locations on the new plans<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that indicated grades of a slope of two on one where a one on one slope was proposed. The commission observed that \u201cthere is quite a difference between one on one and two on one, and two on one is what we require <em>unless ledge rock prevents </em>[that]. And I am having a problem now with what you expect to find there.\u201d Komhaus stated, however, that he was \u201cvery confident that we are going to hit rock there. It is going to be a rock slope.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">After that exchange, a commission member asked Komhaus, \u201cJust for the record, did you not say that you might find either solid, almost like granite type ledge or highly fractured ledge,\u201d and Komhaus replied, \u201cRight, that is a <em>possibility.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) After some further questioning and discussion,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the chairman closed the public hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">On December 22, 1998, the commission denied both applications and gave written reasons for its denial. One of the reasons given for denying the plaintiffs resubdivision application was that \u201c[t]he applicant has not demonstrated that \u2018cuts, fills and grades necessary to utilize the lots will not result in unsafe driveways or adversely affect adjacent properties, and that graded areas shall have a slope not exceeding one foot vertical in 2 feet horizontal, unless ledge rock prevents,\u2019 as required by Section 4-18 of the Subdivision Regulations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>No empirical evidence was offered to support the applicant\u2019s assertion that grading to a 1:2 slope would be prevented by ledge rock. The nature of the ledge rock and soils of the slope is unknown since the applicant stated that no borings were taken at the depth proposed for excavation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The plaintiff appealed to the trial court from the commission\u2019s denial of his resubdivision application. The court sustained the plaintiffs appeal. In sustaining the plaintiffs appeal on the resubdivision application, the court reasoned that the commission\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat no evidence was offered to support the assertion that ledge rock was present on the property or that ledge rock affected the grading ... is not supported by the record.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The commission claims that the court improperly concluded that its decision to deny the plaintiffs subdivision application was unsupported by the record. Further, the commission contends that the court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the commission in reversing the denial of the plaintiffs application. We agree with the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that a planning commission, in passing on a resubdivision application, acts in an administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>live capacity and is limited to determining whether the plan complies with the applicable regulations. ... It is equally axiomatic that the trial court, in reviewing the action of a planning commission regarding a resubdivision application, may not substitute its judgment on the facts for that of the planning commission. . . . The conclusions of the commission must stand if even one of the stated reasons is reasonably supported by the record.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>R. B. Kent &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>21 Conn. App. 370, 373, 573 A.2d 760 (1990). It is within the province of the commission to interpret and apply its zoning regulations. <em>Gorman Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>35 Conn. App. 191, 195, 644 A.2d 964 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u201cThe evidence, however, to support any such reason must be substantial .... This so-called substantial evidence rule is similar to the sufficiency of the evidence standard applied in judicial review of jury verdicts, and evidence is sufficient to sustain an agency finding if it affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred. . . . [I]t must be enough to justify, if the trial were to a jury, a refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion sought to be drawn from it is one of fact for the jury. . . . The substantial evidence rule is a compromise between opposing theories of broad or de novo review and restricted review or complete abstention. It is broad enough and capable of sufficient flexibility in its application to enable the reviewing court to correct whatever ascertainable abuses may arise in administrative adjudication. On the other hand, it is review of such breadth as is entirely consistent with effective administration. . . . [It] imposes an important limitation on the power of the courts to overturn a decision of an administrative agency . . . and to provide a more restrictive standard of review than standards embodying review of weight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>of the evidence or clearly erroneous action.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Quality Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, 55 </em>Conn. App. 533, 540, 738 A.2d 1157 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u201cThe trial court must determine whether the commission has correctly interpreted its regulations and applied them with reasonable discretion to the facts. . . . The trial court can sustain the [plaintiffs] appeal only upon a determination that the decision of the commission was unreasonable, arbitrary or illegal . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gorman Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 35 Conn. 195. \u201cIn reviewing the action of the trial court, we have to decide whether it could in logic and in law reach the conclusion that the [commission] should be overruled.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Daw </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>63 Conn. App. 176, 180, 772 A.2d 755, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 931, 776 A.2d 1145 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">With those principles in mind, we now address the issue of whether the court improperly concluded that the commission\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence in the record.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In connection with that issue, we also will resolve the commission\u2019s claim that the court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">In overturning the commission\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs resubdivision application, the court stated that \u201c[t]he commission concluded that no evidence was offered to support the assertion that ledge rock was present on the property or that ledge rock affected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>grading.\u201d After thoroughly reviewing the record, we conclude that the court misinterpreted the commission\u2019s rationale in denying the plaintiffs application. We will discuss that further, but we state here that the court\u2019s statement is wide of the mark. The commission concluded that the plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate that ledge rock prevented compliance with the slope requirements of \u00a7 4-18 and not that the plaintiff failed to present evidence that ledge rock existed in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">There is substantial evidence in the record that reasonably supports the commission\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff did not demonstrate that the exception, \u201cunless ledge rock prevents,\u201d in \u00a7 4-18 applied here. To begin with, the plaintiffs application, including the new plans, delineated areas of grading that would have slopes in excess of the maximum of one foot vertical and two foot horizontal ratio permitted by \u00a7 4-18. It was the plaintiffs burden to demonstrate either that such areas met the requirements of \u00a7 4-18 or that he was within the \u201cunless ledge rock prevents\u201d exception from compliance with \u00a7 4-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">It also is clear from \u00a7 4-18 that the <em>mere </em>presence of ledge rock is not dispositive, despite the court\u2019s suggestion, in demonstrating compliance with the regulation in obtaining the relief afforded the plaintiff by satisfying the exception of where ledge rock \u201cprevents\u201d compliance with the slope requirement of \u00a7 4-18. The court\u2019s concern with the <em>mere presence </em>of ledge rock is ill founded. In focusing solely on the presence of ledge rock, the court effectively ignored the \u201cunless ledge rock prevents\u201d language in the regulation in a factual context that clearly invokes it \u2014 and where, as the commission perceived, it was the only route for the plaintiff, under the circumstances of this case, to qualify for relief under \u00a7 4-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">In his brief, the plaintiff claims that \u201c[t]he testimony of the engineer and the maps are clear evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>ledge, allowing greater grading in those areas than one to two [foot] slopes if that could not be otherwise achieved during construction. On the other hand, there was no credible evidence supporting the absence of ledge.\u201d We do not agree with the plaintiff that his engineer, Komhaus,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> stated during the hearing that the presence of ledge rock \u201cprevented\u201d compliance with the one foot to two foot slope requirement of \u00a7 4-18. Moreover, the plaintiff fails to point to any statement or credible evidence from which it could be reasonably inferred that the presence of ledge rock on the lots prevented compliance with the \u00a7 4-18 requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In reference to the ledge rock, Komhaus, the plaintiffs expert engineer, stated that \u201cthere is apparent ledge and it is very evident here.\u201d He stated that \u201cin the back of that house [there] is definite ledge. It is about to five to six feet down ... it is coming out of the ground in outcrops.\u201d As to another site, he stated, \u201cIn fact, it is very evident that there is ledge; there are actually outcrops there.\u201d Komhaus also stated, \u201cI am very confident that we are going to hit rock there. It is going to be a rock slope.\u201d Again, this merely shows that there is ledge rock outcropping in various areas on the site of the lots in the application. When asked by the commission, however, \u201c[j]ust for the record, did you not say that you <em>might </em>find either solid, almost like granite type ledge, or highly fractured ledge?\u201d Komhaus answered, \u201cRight, that is a <em>possibility.'\u201d </em>In the context of safety and stabilization vis-a-vis grading, one commission member stated that he assumed that it would be stable because of the rock. Kornhaus replied, \u201cRight, because it is rock. Maybe these are some areas that <em>might </em>not be.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The engineer\u2019s testimony was essentially conjectural and surmise. Contrary to the plaintiffs claim that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>is no countervailing evidence to that of the engineer, the commission, as the judge of credibility, \u201cis not required to believe any witness, not even an expert.\u201d <em>Monor Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>180 Conn. 692, 697, 433 A.2d 999 (1980); <em>see Laufer </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>24 Conn. App. 708, 716, 592 A.2d 392 (1991). It was properly within the discretion of the commission to reject the engineer\u2019s evidence. In any event, Komhaus never provided, nor can it be fairly implied that he stated, that the presence of ledge rock <em>prevented </em>compliance with \u00a7 4-18. Simply put, the expert Komhaus\u2019 testimony did not give the commission any definitive information on the central issue of whether the presence of ledge rock <em>prevented </em>compliance with \u00a7 4-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Furthermore, the commission, during the November 17, 1998 hearing, reminded the plaintiff that at the earlier<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> public hearing, it had cautioned him about the need for more specific answers and notified him about its problems understanding the nature of the ledge on the property. More than once, the commission stressed the need for meaningful presentation in light of the language, \u201cunless ledge rock prevents,\u201d in \u00a7 4-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In the challenged reason for denying the plaintiffs subdivision application, the commission stated the following: \u201cNo empirical evidence was offered to support the applicant\u2019s assertion that a grading to a 1:2 slope would be prevented by ledge rock. The nature of the ledge rock and soils of the slope is unknown since the applicant stated that no borings were taken at the depth proposed for excavation.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The word \u201cempirical\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>defined as \u201c[o]f, relating to, or based on experience, experiment, or observation.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999). It means \u201ccapable of being confirmed, verified, or disproved by observation . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The plaintiff had made some borings on those lots earlier, concerning septic systems, but no \u201cborings were done at the depth proposed for excavation.\u201d At the first public hearing in September, 1998, Virbickas, the original engineer for the plaintiff, when asked if any borings had been taken concerning ledge rock responded, \u201cNot yet, not yet.\u201d Although some seven weeks expired between the first and second public hearings, there was no evidence that any further borings had been taken at all between the two public hearings. There was no empirical data or evidence offered by the plaintiff.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">In examining the conclusion of the court, we review the facts on which the commission based its decision, keeping in mind that the reasons given for the commission\u2019s denial involved pertinent considerations required by the regulation \u00a7 4-18. We conclude that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the commission\u2019s findings and conclusion that the plaintiff had not sustained his burden of demonstrating that the exception to the slope requirement of \u00a7 4-18 applied to his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">In addition, we conclude that the court improperly perceived its function in its review of the commission\u2019s decision on appeal when it substituted its judgment for that of the commission. The court\u2019s function was \u201cto determine on the basis of the record whether substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>tial evidence has been presented to the [commission] to support its findings.\u201d <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>35 Conn. App. 204, 209, 644 A.2d 401 (1994); see <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>203 Conn. 525, 540, 525 A.2d 940 (1987). Furthermore, a reviewing court cannot substitute its judgment as to the weight of the evidence before the commission and on factual issues material to the reasons for the commission\u2019s decision because it is within the province of the commission to determine the credibility of witnesses. <em>Whisper Wind Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>32 Conn. App. 515, 523, 630 A.2d 108 (1993), aff'd, 229 Conn. 176, 640 A.2d 100 (1994). Not only is a reviewing court prohibited from substituting its judgment for that of the commission, but the decision of the commission must be sustained if an examination of the record discloses evidence that supports any one of the commission\u2019s reasons. <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>244 Conn. 619, 629, 711 A.2d 675 (1998); <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 539-40. \u201cThe question is not whether the trial court would have reached the same conclusion but whether the record before the [commission] supports the decision reached. <em>Calandro </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>176 Conn. 439, 440, 408 A.2d 229 (1979).\u201d <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>189 Conn. 261, 265, 455 A.2d 339 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In this case, the court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the commission. It weighed the evidence and concluded that the evidence was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 4-18, despite the substantial evidence in the record supporting the commission\u2019s conclusion that the evidence was not sufficient to permit an exception to the slope requirements of that regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The plaintiff counters that the court\u2019s decision should be upheld because the commission improperly interpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ted applied \u00a7 4-18 of its own subdivision regulations.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The plaintiff contends that, as to \u00a7 4-18, \u201c[a] standard requiring proof sufficient to satisfy the commission is not a valid basis for refusing to approve an application.\u201d In similar fashion, he posits that \u201c[a]n applicant does not have to present sufficient information as the agency members may require because that is a subjective standard without any reasonable parameters.\u201d Further, the plaintiff argues that the \u201ccutting, filling and grading . . . applies to <em>actual </em>development of an approved lot and not to initial approval of lots in a subdivision. The grades are not determined until the lot is used and improved. [It is only at] that point [that] the necessary slope is obtained in graded areas.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">We consider the plaintiffs suggestion, directed to \u00a7 4-18, that \u201c[a] standard requiring proof sufficient to satisfy the commission is not a valid basis for refusing to approve an application\u201d and that \u201c[a]n applicant does not have to present sufficient information as the agency members may require because that is a subjective standard without any reasonable parameters.\u201d The plaintiff, in discussing the two sentences that comprise \u00a7 4-18, claims that they must not be read so as to give the commission discretion to veto a lot at the subdivision approval stage because the applicant \u201cwho is not [actually] developing the lot at that stage, has not <em>conclusively proved </em>that grading during construction can obtain a 1 to 2 slope or that ledge rock will be encountered in <em>all graded areas </em>in sufficient amounts to allow a lesser grade.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>The subdivision regulations on which the commission, acting administratively, should rule must contain known and fixed standards applying to all cases of a like nature and must conform to the principle that a regulation, like a statute, cannot be too general in its terms. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>29 Conn.

App. 571. \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>words [employed] are to be interpreted according to their usual and natural meaning and the regulations should not be extended, by implication, beyond their expressed terms.\u201d <em>Coppola </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 23 Conn. App. 641. \u201cThe language of the ordinance is construed so that no clause or provision is considered superfluous, void or insignificant.\u201d <em>Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">We disagree with the plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 4-18. The first sentence of \u00a7 4-18 provides that \u201c[t]he lot arrangement shall be such as to minimize foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the applicable zoning regulations and sanitary regulations, and in providing safe driveway access to buildings on such lots.\u201d The intent of the regulation is to reduce in degree or extent difficulties of the nature set out thereafter in the first sentence. The associated \u201cdifficulties\u201d that are \u201cforeseeable\u201d are quite clear, especially given the acceptable meaning of \u201cforeseeable\u201d as \u201cbeing such as may reasonably be anticipated . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It does not speak only to foreseeable difficulties in providing safe driveway access, but also to property or other conditions, and on the securing of building permits in compliance with zoning and sanitary regulations. The \u201cforeseeable\u201d difficulty as to the ledge rock is taken into consideration by the drafters of \u00a7 4-18 by providing relief from the two to one slope requirement where ledge rock \u201cprevents\u201d compliance with that ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The second sentence of \u00a7 4-18 provides that \u201c[t]he applicant <em>must demonstrate </em>to the Commission that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>cuts, fills and grades necessary to utilize the lots will not result in unsafe driveways or adversely affect adjacent properties, and that graded areas shall have a slope not exceeding one foot vertical in 2 feet horizontal, <em>unless ledge rock prevents.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) First, we point out that the applicant \u201cmust demonstrate\u201d to the commission that certain activities on the lots will not result in unsafe driveways or adversely affect adjacent properties and also \u201cdemonstrate\u201d that graded areas will have a slope not exceeding one foot vertical in two feet horizontal except where it is demonstrated that ledge rock prevents attaining the required slope. \u201cDemonstrate\u201d means \u201cto make evident or reveal as true by reasoning processes, concrete facts and evidence, experimentation, operation, or repeated examples . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. \u201cDemonstrate\u201d is synonymous with \u201cprove, show.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">We are persuaded that in the context within \u00a7 4-18, to demonstrate indicates futurity and not certainty. After all, in building development, developers accept, as part of the business, that land use agencies require tests of various natures so as to be reasonably assured that certain problems will not be encountered. \u201cThe law favors rational and sensible statutory construction. . . . The unreasonableness of the result obtained by the acceptance of one possible alternative interpretation of an [ordinance] is a reason for rejecting that interpretation in favor of another which would provide a result that is reasonable.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Maciejewski </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>194 Conn. 139, 151-52, 480 A.2d 519 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">That reasoning also applies to the plaintiffs apparent claim that the commission views \u00a7 4-18 as structured so that it <em>requires </em>an applicant, at the subdivision approval stage,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> to be faced with a \u201cveto\u201d of his application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>unless he has \u201cconclusively proved\u201d that \u201cgrading construction can obtain a one to two slope or that ledge rock will be encountered in <em>all </em>graded areas in sufficient amounts to allow a lesser grade.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 4-18 does not state that. First, the plaintiffs \u201cconclusively proved\u201d standard is ill chosen; this is civil litigation, and such a standard is not applicable. Nor is such language warranted by the \u201cmust demonstrate\u201d requirement; that simply informs him that he must adduce evidence on his application at the public hearing of such a nature that demonstrates or proves and places in the record substantial evidence in support of his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u201cSubstantial evidence,\u201d as defined by the cases that we previously have discussed, is hardly within the probative stratum of \u201cconclusive proof. \u201d See <em>Beizer v. Dept. of Labor, </em>56 Conn. App. 347, 357, 742 A.2d 821, cert. denied, 252 Conn. 937, 747 A.2d 1 (2000). For example, \u201c [substantial evidence exists if the administrative record affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred.\u201d Id. The commission\u2019s factual determination must be sustained if it is reasonably supported by substantial evidence in the record taken as a whole. <em>Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 744; <em>Beizer </em>v. <em>Dept. of Labor, </em>supra, 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">In sum, we do not agree with the plaintiff that \u00a7 4-18 lacks a standard that affords a valid basis for the commission to use in passing on the propriety of a resubdivision application and that it leaves the fate of such applications to the subjective views of commission members. The regulation provides that an applicant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>must demonstrate, i.e., prove, certain matters. Those include that cuts, fills and grades necessary to use the lots will not result in unsafe development or adversely affect adjacent properties,\u201d and that \u201cgraded areas shall have a slope not exceeding one foot vertical in two feet horizontal, <em>unless ledge rock prevents.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) There is no issue raised about the plaintiffs and the commission\u2019s understanding about what \u201cunsafe driveway\u201d means,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> nor is anyone attacking the language about use of those lots \u201cadversely affecting adjacent properties.\u201d Those words are plain and clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">In like manner, the last portion of the second sentence in \u00a7 4-18, the provision that states \u201cthat graded areas shall have . . . <em>unless ledge rock prevents\u201d-, </em>(emphasis added); which is focal in this appeal, is also unambiguous in its meaning. The \u201cunless\u201d clause provides an applicant with the opportunity for relief from the slope requirement. That, of course, is subject to the plaintiff, demonstrating that the ledge rock prevents compliance by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d which, as pointed out, is not at all the \u201cconclusively proven\u201d standard of proof of which the applicant complains. The standard in \u00a7 4-18 is thus reasonably sufficient fairly to apprise the applicant, the commission and the public of the circumstances under which an exception will be permitted. We therefore not only disagree with the plaintiffs claim regarding the standard applicable to \u00a7 4-18, but also his argument that the commission misread that regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment dismissing the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>tiffs appeal from the denial of his resubdivision application.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-11\"> The resubdivision application was combined with an inland wetlands application concerning an intermittent watercourse draining to Ledges Road in Ridgefield, which was heard at the same time as the resubdivision application. Both the resubdivision and inland wetlands applications simultaneously were denied on December 22, 1998. The denial of the inland wetlands application, however, is not part of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b344-6\"> Appendix A, art. I, \u00a7 1-2, of the Ridgefield subdivision regulations provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]o subdivision of land shall be made until a plan for such subdivision has been approved by the Commission. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\"> Prior to the public hearing, members of the commission held a site walk on the subject property on September 13, 1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b344-8\"> Pursuant to appendix A, art.

The commission may make reasonable modifications in standards for layout of streets and lots to accomplish such purposes, including protective screening. . . . Slopes and ledges not suitable for such treatment shall not be disturbed and shall remain in their natural state.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b346-7\"> That new counsel, Robert A.

Furthermore, evidence was offered concerning the one to one slope and the presence of ledge rock .... The commission concluded that no evidence was offered to support the assertion that ledge rock was present on the property or that ledge rock affected the grading. This conclusion is not supported by the record. All accessway grades and driveway grades comply with all subdivision regulations, consistent with \u00a7 14-12 of the Ridge-field subdivision regulations. In the absence of specific information indicating a violation of the subdivision regulations, coupled with definite finding of ledge rock requiring the grade adjustment, a standard requiring proof sufficient to \u2018satisfy\u2019 the commission, cannot provide the basis for a denial of the plaintiffs submission. <em>Helbig </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>185 Conn. 294, 314, 440 A.2d 940 (1981).
