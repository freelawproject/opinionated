The defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) denied his motion to dismiss the assault charge, (2) denied his motion to dismiss the unlawful restraint charge, (3) deprived him of a fair trial because of prosecutorial misconduct and (4) made an improper evidentiary ruling. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant and the victim lived together in a second floor apartment with the victim\u2019s three children and her sixteen year old cousin. The victim\u2019s parents lived on the first floor with her uncle and her twenty-one year old sister. On the morning of February 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>1999, the defendant and the victim engaged in an argument that escalated when the victim attempted to go downstairs to her mother\u2019s apartment. As she started to leave, the defendant pulled her back up the stairs by her hair and then pinned her shoulders to the bed so that she could not get up. She called for her mother, who arrived shouting, \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d When the victim\u2019s mother went back downstairs, she told her husband that \u201c[h]e\u2019s going to kill her. He\u2019s going to hit her in the head with the juice bottle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">During the altercation, the defendant struck the victim in the face and threatened that if she called the police she would pay for it, that he would kill the police, burn down the house and that there would be bloodshed. Throughout the altercation, the victim cried and feared physical harm if she called the police. The defendant hit the victim with a juice bottle, and other occupants of the building heard and saw the victim crying. This incident was a continuation of four months of physical abuse. Because the family feared further violence if the police were called, under a guise of leaving for work, the victim\u2019s uncle left the house and called the police from a corner telephone booth. When the police arrived at the house, they observed that the victim\u2019s hair was in disarray, that she was nervous and that she had a red mark on her face.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">The defendant first claims that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of assault in the third degree and, therefore, the trial court improperly failed to dismiss that count.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>We determine whether the evidence is sufficient to support a jury verdict by employing a familiar two part test. \u201cWe first review the evidence presented at trial, construing it in the light most favorable to sustaining the facts expressly found by the trial court or impliedly found by the jury. We then decide whether, upon the facts thus established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, the trial court or the jury could reasonably have concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . [I]n viewing evidence which could yield contrary inferences, the jury is not barred from drawing those inferences consistent with guilt and is not required to draw only those inferences consistent with innocence. The rule is that the jury\u2019s function is to draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical. \u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>231 Conn. 115, 132-33, 646 A.2d 169 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u201cIt is well settled that in reviewing a defendant\u2019s challenge to a verdict based on insufficient evidence, we defer to the jury. We do not sit as a seventh juror empowered to cast an overriding vote over the jury of six that actually heard the case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brunori, </em>22 Conn. App. 431, 434-35, 578 A.2d 139, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 814, 580 A.2d 61 (1990). In determining whether the evidence would support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the law \u201cdoes not require a court to ask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence . . . established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Instead, the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rationale trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>307, 318-19, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Scielzo, </em>190 Conn. 191, 197, 460 A.2d 951 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">A person is guilty of assault in the third degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-61 when he causes \u201cphysical injury\u201d to the victim. Physical injury is defined as \u201cimpairment of physical condition or pain . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (3); <em>State </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>37 Conn. App. 733, 743, 658 A.2d 585, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 912, 660 A.2d 355 (1995). In this case, the evidence showed that the defendant struck the victim in the face, grabbed her by the shirt, pinned her shoulders to the bed, wrapped her up like a rubber band and pulled her hair. The jury reasonably could have inferred that these acts caused pain to the victim, and the defendant\u2019s intent to cause that pain could have been inferred from his conduct and the surrounding circumstances. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>35 Conn. App. 51, 63-66, 644 A.2d 923 (1994). Applying the two part sufficiency test, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the defendant\u2019s conviction of assault in the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The defendant next argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of unlawful restraint in the first degree and, therefore, the trial court improperly denied his motion to dismiss that count. Section 53a-95 (a) provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of unlawful restraint in the first degree when he restrains another person under circumstances which expose such other person to a substantial risk of physical injury.\u201d \u201c \u2018Restrain\u2019 means to restrict a person\u2019s movements intentionally and unlawfully in such a manner as to interfere substantially with his liberty ... by confining him ... in the place where the restriction commences . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-91 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">The defendant concedes that he restrained the victim but argues that the evidence does not support a finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>that it exposed her to a substantial risk of physical injury. He contends that, at most, he could be guilty only of unlawful restraint in the second degree, which does not require exposure to a substantial risk of physical injury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">To convict a defendant of unlawful restraint in the first degree, no actual physical harm must be demonstrated; the state need only prove that the defendant exposed the victim to a substantial risk of physical injury. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fields, </em>31 Conn. App. 312, 331, 624 A.2d 1165, cert. denied, 226 Conn. 916, 628 A.2d 989 (1993). The question before us is whether, under the facts of this case, <em>any </em>rational jury could have found that the defendant exposed the victim to a substantial risk of injury. We conclude that a rational jury could have so found.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The jury reasonably could have found that the defendant not only exposed the victim to physical injury, but, by its guilty verdict of assault in the third degree, also that he <em>actually </em>had inflicted physical injury on her.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This jury finding of actual physical injury encompasses the statutory requirement of mere exposure to physical injury necessary to obtain a conviction of unlawful restraint in the first degree. Both prongs of the two part test, referred to in part I of this opinion, are satisfied. Accordingly, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction of unlawful restraint in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">The defendant next claims that he was deprived of a fair trial by a pattern of prosecutorial misconduct. The following additional facts are necessary for the disposition of this claim. At trial, the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>been charged with, among other crimes, criminal possession of a pistol or revolver in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217c.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> An element of this crime is that the defendant previously had been convicted of a felony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The state and the defendant stipulated that the jury could be informed that the defendant had been convicted of a class B felony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Pursuant to the stipulation, the court instructed the jury that the defendant had been convicted of a class B felony but did not inform the jury of the nature of the felony. During closing argument, the prosecutor referred to the defendant as \u201ca guy who has killed somebody.\u201d This apparently was a reference to the defendant\u2019s prior manslaughter conviction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant now argues that the statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>was improper because the court made it clear that the jury was not supposed to know the nature of the class B felony. The defendant, however, failed to object when the remark was made and now seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">In <em>Golding, </em>our Supreme Court held that \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail. The appellate tribunal is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant\u2019s claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id. \u201cThe first two questions relate to whether a defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable, and the last two relate to the substance of the actual review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>60 Conn. App. 575, 578-79, 760 A.2d 948, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 922, 763 A.2d 1043 (2000); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>51 Conn. App. 645, 654, 725 A.2d 333, cert. denied, 248 Conn. 905, 731 A.2d 310 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">In the present case, we focus on the third prong, i.e., that the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial. \u201c[T]o deprive a defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial, however, the prosecutor\u2019s conduct must have so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. . . . We do not focus alone, however, on the conduct of the prosecutor. The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct. . . . [M] ore-over . . . <em>[Golding] </em>review of such a claim is unavailable where the claimed misconduct was not blatantly egregious and merely consisted of isolated and brief episodes that did not reveal a pattern of conduct repeated throughout the trial . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Correa, </em>241 Conn. 322, 356-57, 696 A.2d 944 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Beall, </em>61 Conn. App. 430, 442, 769 A.2d 708, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 954, 772 A.2d 152 (2001); see <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S. Ct. 940, 71 L. Ed. 2d 78 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>State </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>55 Conn. App. 502, 739 A.2d 732 (1999), aff'd, 255 Conn. 828, 769 A.2d 697 (2001), is misplaced. In <em>Butler, </em>the defendant moved for a mistrial immediately after the improper remarks were made, and the trial court lambasted the state\u2019s attorney in exceptionally harsh language.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After a lunch recess, the defendant filed a written motion for dismissal, mistrial, surrebuttal time or a corrective instruction. Id., 506. \u201cDespite stating that the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>tor\u2019s comment was prejudicial, improper and unprofessional, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motions for dismissal and a mistrial, but granted the request for a curative instruction.\u201d Id. Those strong comments from the court and the defendant\u2019s objection distinguish <em>Butler from </em>the present case in which neither the defendant nor the court objected to or commented on the state\u2019s argument, nor did the defendant request a curative instruction. We may infer that in the atmosphere of the trial the defendant did not regard the remarks as seriously prejudicial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>50 Conn. App. 175, 180, 718 A.2d 60 (1998), aff'd, 251 Conn. 54, 738 A.2d 652 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The defendant argues that the court had a duty to give a cautionary instruction sua sponte. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Wragg, </em>61 Conn. App. 394, 399, 764 A.2d 216 (2001), we discussed sua sponte jury instructions. We concluded that \u201cwhen opposing counsel does not object to evidence, it is inappropriate for the trial court to assume the role of advocate and decide that the evidence should be stricken. . . . The court cannot determine if counsel has elected not to object to the evidence for strategy reasons. . . . Experienced litigators utilize the trial technique of not objecting to inadmissible evidence to avoid highlighting it in the minds of the jury. Such court involvement might interfere with defense counsel\u2019s tactical decision to avoid highlighting the testimony. When subsequent events reveal that it was an imprudent choice, however, the defendant is not entitled to turn the clock back and have [the appellate court] reverse the judgment because the trial court did not, sua sponte, strike the testimony and give the jury a cautionary instruction. No limiting instruction was given at the time [of the offending] remark and none was required because none was requested.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. We discern no distinction, for this purpose, between offensive testimony and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>an inappropriate comment in closing argument and conclude that the court had no duty to give a sua sponte correcting instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The burden is on the defendant to show that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s remarks were prejudicial in light of the entire proceeding. <em>State </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>supra, 55 Conn. App. 508. In this case, the jury did not learn something new. It already had heard twice from a defense witness on cross-examination that the defendant had been involved in a murder case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Closing argument is properly based on evidence presented during trial. Id., 521 <em>(Foti, J., </em>dissenting). Because the witness had placed the defendant\u2019s previous involvement in a homicide prosecution into evidence, we cannot conclude that the defendant has carried his burden of showing that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s remark was prejudicial. Even if we concluded that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s remark was improper, it did not infect the entire trial with unfairness so as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">We conclude that there was no pattern of prosecutorial misconduct and that the prosecutor\u2019s sole, isolated comment did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial. The defendant has not satisfied the third prong of <em>Golding </em>and, therefore, he cannot prevail on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court made an improper evidentiary ruling when it allowed the state to inquire as to whether he previously had hit the victim. On appeal, the state contends that the question and answer were admissible as tending to show whether the victim was in fact exposed to a substantial risk of physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>A trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is entitled to great deference. <em>State </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>255 Conn. 61, 69, 762 A.2d 1278 (2000). \u201c[T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility . . . of evidence. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion. . . . Moveover, evidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of a substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>States v. Fisher, </em>57 Conn. App. 371, 375, 748 A.2d 377, cert. denied, 253 Conn. 914, 754 A.2d 163 (2000).
