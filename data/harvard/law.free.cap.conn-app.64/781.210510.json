On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly (1) concluded that the plaintiffs were diligent in their attempt to secure a mortgage, (2) construed the terms of paragraph twenty-three of the parties\u2019 contract, (3) concluded that the parties\u2019 initial letter of agreement did not control the escrow agreement, (4) concluded that the defendant had recouped moneys that it had spent on changes in the construction plan that were requested by the plaintiffs, (5) failed to allow the defendant the opportunity to prove the cost of building a larger structure, (6) found that the defendant had converted the plaintiffs\u2019 money and (7) awarded interest on the entire amount of the down payment and stated in its memorandum of decision that the defendant would have to pay offer of judgment interest to the date of satisfaction of the judgment. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The court reasonably could have found the following facts. In June, 1996, the plaintiffs met with the president of the defendant corporation, Calvin Munson, to discuss the purchase of certain real property located in Fairfield and the construction of a home thereon. On July 23, 1996, the parties entered into a sales agreement. The sales agreement provided for a down payment of $74,900, which included $7490 that was paid when the plaintiffs submitted an offer to purchase on July 2,1996, and $5000 paid pursuant to the terms of a letter of agreement dated July 2, 1996. The plaintiffs paid the remaining balance due on the down payment to the defendant after deducting the $12,490 that they already had paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Paragraph nineteen of the sales agreement contained a mortgage contingency clause on which the effectiveness of the contract depended. The mortgage contingency clause provided: \u201cIt is expressly understood and agreed by the parties hereto that this contract is condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>tioned on the Purchaser being able to obtain a mortgage loan in the amount of FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($400,000.00) from a recognized lending institution which loan shall be for a period not to exceed thirty (30) years and shall bear interest at the prevailing rate of said institution. Purchaser shall make prompt and immediate application with diligence, including the providing of all documentation necessary to support said application promptly. If Purchaser is unable to obtain a commitment for such loan on or before August 16, 1996, and if Purchaser so notifies Seller in writing care of James A. Miller, Jr., Attorney at Law, 140 Sherman Street, P.O. Box 826 Fairfield, Connecticut, 06430, on or before August 16, 1996, at 5:00 p.m., then this contract shall be null and void and the Purchaser shall be entitled to the return of all sums paid by the Purchaser on account of this contract, except $250.00 to cover the cost of preparing this contract. Should the Purchaser fail to provide such notice or fulfill the foregoing requirements, this contract shall continue in full force and effect, and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall be as if this paragraph did not appear in this contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">On July 30, 1996, Robert Aubin sent a fully executed copy of the sales agreement to People\u2019s Bank, a recognized lending institution. On August 6, 1996, Robert Aubin completed additional documents as requested by People\u2019s Bank, including additional credit and employment release authorization forms, a borrower\u2019s certification and authorization, another copy of the mortgage application and a rate lock-in agreement. He also advised the bank of the August 16, 1996 deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">On August 8,1996, Robert Aubin\u2019s employer, Reader\u2019s Digest, prepared an employment verification form, and its senior vice president for strategic planning and human resources sent the bank a letter confirming that Robert Aubin would be given an interest free corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>loan ranging from $150,000 to $250,000 to assist in his relocation. That loan would be secured by a second mortgage on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">On August 13, 1996, Reader\u2019s Digest terminated Robert Aubin\u2019s employment. He thereafter advised his attorney, Kathryn Hunter, and the account officer at People\u2019s Bank, Mary Neidermeier, that Reader\u2019s Digest had terminated his employment. On August 14, 1996, Hunter notified the defendant and its attorney, James A. Miller, Jr., by facsimile and registered mail that the plaintiffs were unable to secure a mortgage and, therefore, that they sought the return of all sums paid under the sales agreement pursuant to paragraph nineteen of the sales agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Despite the plaintiffs\u2019 repeated demands, the defendant refused to return the plaintiffs\u2019 deposit. On August 10, 1998, the plaintiffs commenced the present action by service of process upon Munson Builders, Inc., and its attorney, James A. Miller, Jr., who was the escrow agent under the sales agreement. The first count of the complaint alleged breach of contract against the defendant. The second count alleged breach of the escrow agreement by Miller. The third count of the complaint alleged violations of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., against Miller. The fourth count of the complaint alleged theft against the defendant and Miller, and the fifth count of the complaint alleged conversion against the defendant and Miller. After a trial to the corut, the court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant as to counts one and five. The court further rendered judgment in favor of Miller on all counts, and in favor of the defendant as to the fourth count. The court awarded damages to the plaintiffs in the amount of $74,650, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $26,749.58 and offer of judgment interest in the amount of $20,006.03, for a total amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>$121,405.61. The defendant appeals from that judgment. Additional facts will be provided as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly determined that the plaintiffs were diligent in their application for the required loan. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Before we address the defendant\u2019s claim, we first articulate the applicable standard of review. \u201cIf the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged, our review includes determining whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Keefe </em>v. <em>Norwalk Cove Marina, Inc., </em>57 Conn. App. 601, 606, 749 A.2d 1219, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 903, 755 A.2d 881 (2000). \u201cWith regard to the trial court\u2019s factual findings, the clearly erroneous standard of review is appropriate.\u201d <em>Empire Paving, Inc. </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>57 Conn. App. 261, 265, 747 A.2d 1063 (2000). \u201cThe trial court\u2019s legal conclusions are subject to plenary review. [W]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision .... [T]he interpretation of the contract is a matter of law and our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Yellow Page Consultants, Inc. </em>v. <em>Omni Home Health Services, Inc., </em>59 Conn. App. 194, 199, 756 A.2d 309 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">\u201cIt is well established that [i]n a case tried before a court, the trial judge is the sole arbiter of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given specific testimony. . . . The credibility and the weight of expert testimony is judged by the same standard, and the trial court is privileged to adopt whatever testimony he reasonably believes to be credible. ... On appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>we do not retry the facts or pass on the credibility of witnesses.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Olson, </em>252 Conn. 98, 105, 742 A.2d 799 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">After careful review of the record, we conclude that there is ample evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s finding that the plaintiffs made reasonable efforts to secure a mortgage. The defendant is asking this court to reconsider the evidence and to reach a different finding. We cannot do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">\u201cReasonableness . . . is an objective standard, involving an analysis of what a person with ordinary prudence would do given the circumstances, without accounting for any particular knowledge or skill. . . . In contracts as in tort cases, [t]he test is external, not subjective; that is, the question is how would a person of ordinary prudence in such a situation have behaved, not how did the defendant in fact behave. . . . Whether the plaintiffs actions constituted reasonable efforts to satisfy the contractual condition is a factual determination for the trial court.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Phillipe </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>3 Conn. App. 471, 475, 489 A.2d 1056 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">The defendant makes several different arguments to support its position that the plaintiffs did not make reasonable attempts to secure a mortgage. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">First, the defendant claims that because Denyse Aubin did not herself apply for a mortgage after the bank denied Robert Aubin\u2019s application, the plaintiffs did not make reasonable efforts. The defendant\u2019s argument is without merit. Here, the court found that the plaintiffs disclosed all assets and debts to the bank, including the fact that Denyse Aubin had no income. We agree with the court that the law does not require the performance of a useless act; <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>58 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>Conn. App. 330, 336, 753 A.2d 430, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 920, 759 A.2d 1023 (2000); and common sense dictates that someone with no income would not be approved for a $400,000 mortgage loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The defendant also argues that the evidence shows that Reader\u2019s Digest did not fire Robert Aubin, but that he left his job voluntarily, and, therefore, the plaintiffs did not make reasonable efforts to secure a mortgage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court specifically found that the official reason given by Reader\u2019s Digest for Robert\u2019s departure was nothing more than a pleasant coiporate gloss given to make the termination appear less harsh. Again, we conclude that the evidence in the record supports the court\u2019s finding that Reader\u2019s Digest fired Robert Aubin, and, therefore, the court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">The defendant further argues that the court was bound to consider exhibit Q, which consisted of the organizational announcement by Reader\u2019s Digest of Robert Aubin\u2019s departure, for its truth, and not for the limited purpose of showing the organizational announcement. We note that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>62 Conn. App. 743, 757, 774 A.2d 1015, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 919, 774 A.2d 142 (2001). The court properly determined that the announcement was hearsay, and the court considered the evidence for the limited purpose of showing the company\u2019s announcement and not for the truth of the statements contained therein. Moreover, the court concluded that \u201ceven if the organizational announcement was admitted as a full exhibit . . . it is nothing more than corporate posturing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>merely providing a polite reason for Aubin leaving Reader\u2019s Digest.\u201d Notwithstanding the announcement, the court specifically found Robert Aubin\u2019s testimony that Reader\u2019s Digest fired him believable and credible. We do not reconsider the credibility of the witnesses on appeal, which is properly left within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>62 Conn. App. 338, 343, 771 A.2d 196 (\u201c \u2018[i]t is the trier\u2019s exclusive province to weigh the conflicting evidence, determine the credibility of witnesses and determine whether to accept some, all or none of a witness\u2019 testimony\u2019 \u201d), cert. denied, 256 Conn. 917, 773 A.2d 943 (2001). Accordingly, we conclude that the record supports the court\u2019s conclusion that Reader\u2019s Digest fired Robert Aubin and that the plaintiffs made reasonable efforts to secure a mortgage. The court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the admissibility of exhibit Q, nor was its finding that Reader\u2019s Digest fired Robert Aubin clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly failed to consider that paragraph twenty-three of the purchaser\u2019s rider to the sales agreement authorized the release of funds to the defendant. The defendant claims that once those funds were released to the defendant, the funds were not required to be returned pursuant to the mortgage contingency clause in paragraph nineteen. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. Pursuant to a letter of agreement dated July 2, 1996, the plaintiffs released $5000 to the defendant so that construction of the home could commence. Upon completion of the foundation, Miller released $24,966.99 to the defendant. The court did not allow the defendant to raise those setoffs, in part, because the defendant did not attempt to do so until the eve of trial. The court did, however, consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>the defendant\u2019s argument that it was entitled to keep that money pursuant to the terms of the sales agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">We begin our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim by first stating the applicable standard of review. \u201cIf a contract contains definitive language, the determination of what the parties intended by their contractual commitments is a question of law subject to plenary review by this court. . . . <em>Gateway Co. </em>v. <em>DiNoia, </em>232 Conn. 223, 229-30, 654 A.2d 342 (1995).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Plikus </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>42 Conn. App. 299, 301, 679 A.2d 401 (1996). Because the defendant\u2019s claims relate to clear and unambiguous language in the parties\u2019 contract, our review is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">The defendant first claims that paragraph twenty-three of the rider to the sales agreement entitles it to retain the escrow funds that the plaintiffs paid over: We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Paragraph twenty-three of the purchasers\u2019 rider to the contract of sale, which was incorporated into the contract of sale agreement,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides: \u201cThe amount of $74,900 paid by Purchaser on account of the Purchase Price (the \u2018Escrow Funds\u2019) shall be held in escrow by James A. Miller, Jr., Esq., Seller\u2019s attorney (the \u2018Escrow Agent\u2019), and shall be released to Seller as follows: (i) one-third ($24,966) upon the completion of the foundation and basement and (ii) the balance ($49,934) upon completion of the framing, including the roof. Escrow Agent shall notify Purchaser at such time as the Escrow Funds, or any portion thereof, are released to Seller. In the event of any dispute with respect to the disposition of said funds, the Escrow Agent may retain the Escrow Funds in escrow until the dispute is settled, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>may deposit the Escrow Funds into a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Connecticut, and thereupon be released and discharged of any and all obligation and liability hereunder. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any error or omission or action which it may take, and the Purchaser and the Seller do each hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify and save the Escrow Agent harmless of and from any and all liability in connection with this paragraph, unless the same is the result of the Escrow Agent\u2019s negligence or willful breach of the terms of this paragraph. In the event the Escrow Funds are deposited in an interest-bearing account, any interest earned thereon shall belong to the Seller if the sale is completed pursuant to the terms hereof, but shall belong to and be released to Purchaser upon the down payment being returned to the Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this Contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">As previously stated, paragraph nineteen of the sales agreement provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf Purchaser is unable to obtain a commitment for such loan . . . this contract shall be null and void and the Purchaser shall be entitled to the return of <em>all sums paid by the Purchaser on account of this contract, </em>except $250.00 to cover the cost of preparing this contract.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because paragraph twenty-three of the sales agreement was incorporated into the contract, it follows that the sums paid pursuant to that paragraph were \u201csums paid by the Purchaser on account of this contract,\u201d and, therefore, the plaintiffs were entitled to have the money returned once the \u201cnull and void\u201d mechanism contained in paragraph nineteen was triggered by the plaintiffs\u2019 inability to secure a mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Similarly, paragraph nineteen of the sales agreement also governs the $5000 that the plaintiffs paid to the defendant pursuant to the letter agreement. Indeed, the letter agreement preceded the sales agreement and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>merely served as evidence that the plaintiffs paid the defendant $5000 to initiate breaking ground and the construction of the foundation. This is further evidenced by the footnote to paragraph two, subsection (b), of the sales agreement, which provides: \u201cReceipt of $5000.00 provided in accordance with letter agreement attached hereto is acknowledged, balance due upon signing is $62,410.00.\u201d Therefore, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s argument that it is entitled to offset the amount owed to the plaintiffs by the money that it already received is without merit. The sales agreement controls all of the money that the plaintiffs paid to the defendant on account of the purchase of the property and the construction of the home thereon. The court properly concluded that the plaintiffs were entitled to the return of their deposit of $74,900, less the $250 for the preparation of the contract, i.e., $74,650.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">We further conclude that the defendant\u2019s argument that the plaintiffs should be held responsible for the additional expenses is unpersuasive. As the defendant concedes in its brief, it took a significant risk by proceeding with construction before the mortgage condition was satisfied. We do not agree with the defendant that it is unfair to force it to return the funds to the plaintiffs. That is precisely what the defendant bargained for in its contract. Because the defendant was a party to the contract, we presume that it was aware of the mortgage condition, and it cannot now complain that the court held it to the terms to which it previously had agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly concluded that the letter of agreement did not control the payment of funds to the defendant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">As a threshold matter, we note that our standard of review is plenary because the determination of this issue involves construing clear and unambiguous language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>the contract. See <em>Plikus </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>supra, 42 Conn. App. 301-302. The defendant argues that the letter of agreement was intended to protect it when a purchaser demands an immediate start to construction. Specifically, the defendant argues that it was the intent of the parties that the plaintiffs compensate the defendant immediately for the work that it had initiated prior to the contract. The defendant further argues that this intent persisted through the negotiation of the language of the escrow clause contained in paragraph twenty-three. The defendant contends that once funds were released under the escrow agreement, such funds were no longer governed by the sales agreement, but rather were governed by the letter of agreement. The plaintiffs respond that there is nothing in either paragraph twenty-three of the sales agreement or the letter of agreement that overrides the mortgage contingency clause contained in paragraph nineteen of the sales agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">\u201cOur interpretation of these contract provisions is guided by well established principles of contract law. A contract must be construed to effectuate the intent of the parties, which is determined from the language used interpreted in the light of the situation of the parties and the circumstances connected with the transaction. . . . [T]he intent of the parties is to be ascertained by a fair and reasonable construction of the written words and . . . the language used must be accorded its common, natural, and ordinary meaning and usage where it can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract. . . . Where the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract is to be given effect according to its terms. A court will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity .... Similarly, any ambiguity in a contract must emanate from the language used in the contract rather than from one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>party\u2019s subjective perception of the terms.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tallmadge </em>Bros., <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., </em>252 Conn. 479, 498, 746 A.2d 1277 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">We agree with the plaintiffs that there is no language in either paragraph twenty-three of the sales agreement or the letter of agreement that could be read to override the mortgage contingency clause. We will not torture the language of the contract or search for another meaning when the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous. Id. As we previously concluded in part II of this opinion, the mortgage contingency clause contained in paragraph nineteen of the sales agreement governs the disposition of all moneys paid by the plaintiffs to the defendant on account of the sales agreement. Therefore, we conclude that the court properly determined that the defendant was not entitled to keep any sums paid over to it by the plaintiffs other than the $250 provided for in paragraph nineteen for the cost of preparing the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly determined that it had recouped the money that it had spent for the plaintiffs\u2019 changes when the property was sold. The defendant claims that it was entitled to compensation for the expenditures made on construction in compliance with the plaintiffs\u2019 plan. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">As we previously have concluded in parts II and III of this opinion, paragraph nineteen of the sales agreement controls the return of all sums paid by the plaintiffs on account of the contract. Accordingly, we conclude that the court properly determined that the defendant was not entitled keep the money that the plaintiffs paid to it beyond the $250 for preparing the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly failed to allow it the opportunity to prove the cost of constructing a larger building than it originally had planned. Specifically, the defendant argues that because the plaintiffs required a new plan for a structure that was 143 square feet larger than the one that the defendant originally had planned to construct on the property, and because the defendant already had poured the foundation for the larger structure prior to the mortgage contingency\u2019s coming into effect, the defendant should have been allowed to prove how much the revised plan added to its costs. Thus, the defendant claims that the court\u2019s failure to allow it to make such a showing prejudiced its defense at trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">As we already have concluded in parts II, III and IV of this opinion, the mortgage contingency contained in paragraph nineteen of the sales agreement controls the resolution of the defendant\u2019s claims arising out of the purchase of the property and the construction of the home thereon. The court properly limited the defendant\u2019s proof at trial because the issue of how much the defendant expended as a result of the plaintiffs\u2019 plans was not relevant to the issue of whether the mortgage contingency contained in paragraph nineteen properly had been triggered. Under the circumstances of the present case, the court did not abuse its discretion by not allowing the defendant to present evidence of setoffs. See <em>Gore </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Savings Bank, </em>40 Conn. App. 219, 226, 670 A.2d 332 (1996) (\u201c \u2018trial court has broad discretion to determine the relevancy of evidence, and we will not disturb a trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly found that it had converted the plaintiffs\u2019 money. Specif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>ically, the defendant argues that it did not convert the plaintiffs\u2019 money because a genuine dispute existed as to whether the defendant was entitled to the deposit. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The defendant is essentially claiming that the record does not contain sufficient evidence to support a finding of conversion. The applicable standard of review is whether the court\u2019s conclusion that the evidence supported the finding of conversion was clearly erroneous. \u201cWe have long held that a finding of fact is reversed only when it is clearly erroneous. ... A factual finding is clearly erroneous when it is not supported by any evidence in the record or when there is evidence to support it, but the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. . . . Simply put, we give great deference to the findings of the trial court because of its function to weigh and interpret the evidence before it and to pass upon the credibility of witnesses.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>American Heritage Agency, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gelinas, </em>62 Conn. App. 711, 717, 774 A.2d 220, cert. denied, 257 Conn. 903, 777 A.2d 192 (2001). We cannot say that the court\u2019s finding of conversion was clearly erroneous based on the evidence before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">\u201cConversion is an unauthorized assumption and exercise of the right of ownership over goods belonging to another, to the exclusion of the owner\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Discover Leasing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>33 Conn. App. 303, 309, 635 A.2d 843 (1993). To establish a prima facie case of conversion, the plaintiffs had to establish that (1) the deposit given to the defendant belonged to the plaintiffs, (2) the defendant deprived the plaintiffs of their funds for an indefinite period of time, (3) the defendant\u2019s conduct was unauthorized and (4) the defendant\u2019s conduct harmed the plaintiffs. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Here, the court found that the language of the sales agreement was so clear that even a lay person could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>understand it. The court found that the contract became null and void on August 16,1996, and that the defendant should have realized that. The court found that after the contract had become null and void, it was incumbent on the defendant to return the plaintiffs\u2019 deposit, less $250 for the preparation of the agreement. The court found that despite repeated demands for the return of the money, the defendant refused to return it. The court found that the defendant\u2019s conduct was wrongful and without justification. Finally, the court found that the plaintiffs were harmed when they were deprived of their property. After our review of the record, we conclude that all of those findings are supported by the evidence in the record and thus are not clearly erroneous. Therefore, under the facts and circumstances of this case, the court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant converted the plaintiffs\u2019 money was correct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court improperly awarded interest to the plaintiffs. The defendant presents its claim in two parts. The defendant first claims that the court improperly awarded interest on part or all of the plaintiffs\u2019 deposit. Second, the defendant claims that the court improperly awarded offer of judgment interest to the plaintiffs until the date of satisfaction of the judgment. We disagree with the first claim and agree with the second. We will address the defendant\u2019s claims in turn.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">The defendant first argues that because a genuine dispute existed as to whether it was entitled to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>funds and because it was entitled to keep at least a portion of the down payment, the court should not have calculated the interest based on the entire $74,650 that was due the plaintiffs. The defendant\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides that interest may be recovered and allowed in civil actions as damages for the detention of money after it becomes payable. \u201cIt is clear that Connecticut case law establishes that prejudgment interest is to be awarded if, in the discretion of the trier of fact, equitable considerations deem that it is warranted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hoye </em>v. <em>DeWolfe Co., </em>61 Conn. App. 558, 564, 764 A.2d 1269 (2001). As we previously have determined in this opinion, the court properly concluded as a matter of law that the plaintiffs were entitled to the return of their deposit in the amount of $74,650. The court also determined that the defendant\u2019s conduct was wrongful and meant to punish the plaintiffs. Furthermore, the court determined that the defendant was not entitled to the setoffs that it had claimed. Those findings by the court were supported by the facts in the record. Therefore, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion when it awarded prejudgment interest on the $74,650.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">The defendant also claims that the court improperly stated in its memorandum of decision that the plaintiffs were entitled to offer of judgment interest through the date of satisfaction of the judgment. The plaintiffs concede in their brief that the court\u2019s statement to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>effect is incorrect. They note, however, that the court\u2019s award of offer of judgment interest through the date of judgment was proper. We agree that the court improperly stated in its memorandum of decision that offer of judgment interest was payable through the date of satisfaction of the judgment, but we also conclude that the court properly awarded offer of judgment interest through to the date of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary for our resolution of this claim. On September 23, 1999, the plaintiffs filed an offer of judgment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>of $69,500. The defendant did not respond to the offer, and the plaintiffs subsequently recovered an amount greater than the amount proffered in the offer of judgment. The court found that the plaintiffs were entitled to $20,066.03 in offer of judgment interest. In its memorandum of decision, the court stated that \u201cthe plaintiffs Robert Aubin and Denyse Aubin are entitled to offer of judgment interest through the date of satisfaction of judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">\u201cThe question of whether the trial court properly awarded interest pursuant to \u00a7 52-192a is one of law subject to de novo review.\u201d <em>Willow Springs Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Seventh BRT Development Corp., </em>245 Conn. 1, 55, 717 A.2d 77 (1998). It is well established that \u201c[sjection 52-192a provides for interest until the date of judgment.\u201d <em>Paulus </em>v. <em>LaSala, </em>56 Conn. App. 139, 151, 742 A.2d 379 (1999), cert. denied, 252 Conn. 928, 746 A.2d 789 (2000); see also <em>Willow Springs Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Seventh BRT Development Corp., </em>supra, 55. \u201cSection 52-192a (b) requires a trial court to award interest to the prevailing plaintiff from the date of the filing of a complaint to the date of judgment whenever: (1) a plaintiff files a valid offer of judgment within eighteen months of the filing of the complaint in a civil complaint for money damages; (2) the defendant rejects the offer of judgment; and (3) the plaintiff ultimately recovers an amount greater than or equal to the offer of judgment. . . . The purpose of \u00a7 52-192a is to encourage pretrial settlements by penalizing a party that fails to accept a reasonable offer of settlement in any civil action based upon contract or seeking the recovery of money damages.\u201d (Citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lakeview Associates </em>v. <em>Woodlake Master Condominium, Assn., Inc., </em>239 Conn. 769, 783-84 n.22, 687 A.2d 1270 (1997). \u201cThe mies of \u00a7 52-192a determine prejudgment interest, the interest from the date when the offer of judgment was filed until the date of judgment. Thereafter, [the plaintiffs are] entitled to interest at the rate of [10] percent<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on whatever amounts remain unpaid on the judgment rendered in [their] favor. . . . This postjudgment interest is authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>Industrial Park Corp., </em>211 Conn. 648, 653, 560 A.2d 968 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">Here, the court misstated in its memorandum of decision that the plaintiffs were entitled to offer of judgment interest through the date of satisfaction of the judgment. Interest payable after the judgment would be at the rate of 10 percent pursuant to \u00a7 37-3a. See id.

The plaintiff shall give notice of the offer of settlement to the defendant\u2019s attorney, or if the defendant is not rejtresented by an attorney, to the defendant himself. Within thirty days after being notified of the filing of the \u2018offer of judgment,\u2019 and prior to the rendering of a verdict, by the jury or an award by the court, the defendant or his attorney may file with the clerk of the court a written \u2018acceptance of offer of judgment\u2019 agreeing to a stipulation for judgment as contained in plaintiff\u2019s \u2018offer of judgment\u2019. Upon such filing, the clerk shall enter judgment immediately on the stipulation. If the \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 is not accepted within thirty days and prior to the rendering of a verdict by the jury or an award by the court, the \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 shall be considered rejected and not subject to acceptance unless refiled. Any such \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 and any \u2018acceptance of offer of judgment\u2019 shall be included by the clerk in the record of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">\u201c(b) After trial the court shall examine the record to determine whether the plaintiff made an \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 which the defendant failed to accept. If the court ascertains from the record that the plaintiff has recovered an amount equal to or greater than the sum certain stated in his \u2018offer of judgment\u2019, the court shall add to the amount so recovered twelve per cent annual interest on said amount, computed from the date such offer was filed in actions commenced before October 1, 1981. In those actions commenced on or after October 1, 1981, the interest, shall be computed from the date the complaint in the civil action was filed with the court if tire 'offer of judgment\u2019 was filed not later than eighteen months from the filing of such complaint.
