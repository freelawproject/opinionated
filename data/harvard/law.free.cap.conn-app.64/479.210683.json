Thompson, appeals from the judgment of the trial court rendered in favor of the plaintiff Kari Damato. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly (1) admitted into evidence certain expert testimony from a physician, (2) denied her motion to set aside the verdict and (3) denied her motion for a remittitur. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">The standard of review for each claim raised by the defendant is the abuse of discretion standard. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Copas, </em>252 Conn. 318, 326, 746 A.2d 761 (2000) (court\u2019s evidentiary ruling upheld absent clear abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>of discretion); <em>Gilliard </em>v. <em>Van-Court Property Management Services, Ltd., </em>63 Conn. App. 637, 644, 777 A.2d 745 (2001) (court\u2019s denial of motion for remittitur undisturbed unless clear abuse of discretion); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Fracasso, </em>59 Conn. App. 291, 295, 756 A.2d 325 (2000) (court\u2019s denial of motion to set aside verdict upheld absent manifest abuse of discretion). Further, when ruling on a motion for remittitur, a trial court must determine whether the jury\u2019s award \u201cfalls somewhere within the necessarily uncertain limits of just damages or whether the size of the verdict so shocks the sense of justice as to compel the conclusion that the jury was influenced by partiality, prejudice, mistake or corruption.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gilliard </em>v. <em>Van-Court Property Management Services, Ltd., </em>supra, 643. In a case involving similar injuries from a motor vehicle accident, our Supreme Court concluded that a jury\u2019s award of $150,000 fell \u201c \u2018somewhere within the necessarily uncertain limits of just damages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>217 Conn. 671, 688-89, 587 A.2d 1014 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">We have fully reviewed the record and briefs and considered the oral arguments of the parties. Having applied the appropriate standard of review, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion and that its decision conforms to the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
