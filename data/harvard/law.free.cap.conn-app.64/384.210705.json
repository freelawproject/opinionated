The defendant additionally contends that (1) he received ineffective assistance of legal counsel in violation of his federal and state constitutional rights, (2) his conviction of the crimes of robbery in the first degree and criminal possession of a pistol or revolver violated his constitutional right against double jeopardy, and (3) the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury improperly diminished the presumption of innocence standard and shifted the state\u2019s burden of proof. Further, the defendant asserts in his supplemental brief that his conviction of the crime of conspiracy to commit robbery should be vacated because the codefendant in this joint trial was acquitted of the charge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree with the defendant\u2019s claim on the conspiracy charge, but affirm the judgments of the trial court on all other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On October 21, 1998, at approximately 4:45 a.m., the defendant and another man alleged to be Israel Garcia purchased food from a grocery store that was owned by William Acevedo and Augberto Gonzalez. Shortly thereafter, Acevedo was confronted by two men dressed in black and wearing black masks. The taller of the two men, later found to be the defendant, held a pistol and stole $160 from Acevedo. When Acevedo resisted, the defendant fired the pistol in the direction of the ground and again in the direction of Acevedo as he fled to the back of the store. The other robber held a customer down on the floor at knifepoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">William Reilly, a police officer from the Bridgeport police department, arrived at the grocery store to investi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>gate the robbery. He discovered the shell casing of aten millimeter bullet on the floor of the store. After interviewing Acevedo, Reilly disseminated apolice broadcast with the description of the perpetrators and the automobile in which they drove. A few hours later, Officer Daniel Garcia of the Bridgeport police department spotted a motor vehicle that matched the description in the police broadcast. After a short chase, the driver of the motor vehicle pulled over, and the three occupants of the automobile ran away. The driver of the motor vehicle leaped over a fence and escaped, but left his jacket behind. The police officer described the driver as a tall Hispanic male. Inside the jacket pocket, Officer Garcia found a live ten millimeter bullet.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The two other occupants of the car were apprehended shortly thereafter. One of the passengers, a short male wearing dark clothing, was later identified as the codefendant Israel Garcia. The other passenger was identified as Denise Holland. Later that day, Holland provided a statement to the police in which she claimed that the defendant and the codefendant Garcia had robbed the grocery store.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Two days later, on October 23, 1998, while on patrol at a housing project, Brian Fitzgerald, a police officer from the Bridgeport police department, saw a maroon Acura that matched the description of an automobile on the police list of stolen vehicles.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As the motor vehicle pulled into a parking space, Fitzgerald\u2019s partner drove the patrol vehicle behind the maroon Acura to prevent it from moving. The four occupants of the maroon Acura got out of the automobile and began to ran away. Fitzgerald observed that the front passenger appeared to have an object in his waistband resembling the shape of a gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>and ordered the man to stand still and to show his hands. The front passenger was later identified as the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The defendant ran away from Fitzgerald, pulled a black handgun out of his waistband and threw the weapon onto the ground. Witnessing the defendant dispose of the weapon, Fitzgerald picked up the handgun and, after a short chase, apprehended the defendant. The handgun was loaded with four rounds. Fitzgerald identified the man as the defendant and arrested him. The defendant was charged in two informations. In the first case, he was charged for the events that transpired when he was apprehended on October 23,1998, and, in the second case, for the events that transpired on October 21, 1998, when the grocery store was robbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The defendant and the codefendant Garcia were tried jointly before ajury regarding the charges ofrobberyand conspiracy to commit robbery.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On November 19,1999, the defendant was found guilty of all charges and convicted of two counts of robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2), conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-48, criminal possession of a pistol or revolver in violation of \u00a7 53a-217c, carrying a pistol or revolver without a permit in violation of \u00a7 29-35 (a) andpossession of a weapon in amotor vehicle in violation of \u00a7 29-38. The codefendant Garcia, however, was acquitted of all charges, including the charge of conspiracy to commit robbery. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be discussed where relevant to the claims raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">During the pendency of this appeal, we ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefs to address whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>this court should review under the plain error doctrine<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the issue of whether, in a joint trial, the conviction of one codefendant of the charge of conspiracy to commit robbery can stand when the other codefendant is acquitted of the charge. In his supplemental brief, the defendant contends that his conviction for conspiracy to commit robbery constitutes plain error and a legal impossibility when his codefendant in the joint trial was acquitted of the charge. We agree and conclude that the trial court committed plain error and, therefore, reverse the judgment of conviction of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">It is well established that this court will exercise plain error review under only the rarest of circumstances. \u201cSuch review is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>207 Conn. 276, 288-89, 542 A.2d 299 (1988). This court may \u201cin the interests of justice notice plain error not brought to the attention of the trial court. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>55 Conn. App. 28, 31, 739 A.2d 271 (1999). \u201cAs explained in detail in <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Granby Holdings, Inc., </em>[230 Conn. 95, 98, 644 A.2d 325 (1994)], our sua sponte invocation of plain error review is warranted when the following requirements are satisfied: (1) we discuss the rule and articulate why it is appropriate; and (2) we give the parties an opportunity to brief the issue.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>39 Conn. App. 175, 179, 664 A.2d 1153 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u201cTo prevail under the plain error doctrine, the defendant must demonstrate that the claimed error is both so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>clear and so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice. . . . This doctrine is not implicated and review of the claimed error is not undertaken unless the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. . . . Furthermore, even if the error is so apparent and review is afforded, the defendant cannot prevail on the basis of an error that lacks constitutional dimension unless he demonstrates that it likely affected the result of the trial. . . . <em>State </em>v. Caprilozzi, 45 Conn. App. 455, 462, 696 A.2d 380, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 937, 702 A.2d 644 (1997).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>60 Conn. App. 534, 546, 760 A.2d 520, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 921, 763 A.2d 1042 (2000). Here, the defendant was convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery, although his codefendant in this joint trial was acquitted of the same charge. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s conviction constitutes a legal impossibility and that to permit his conviction to stand would not only be manifestly unjust but also would undermine the public\u2019s confidence in these judicial proceedings. Accordingly, we will review this claim under the plain error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">When one alleged conspirator is convicted of conspiracy and his alleged coconspirator is acquitted, the situation is similar to that where a jury has rendered an inconsistent verdict. Just as we will overturn a legally inconsistent verdict when \u201cthe existence of the essential elements for one offense negates the existence of the essential elements for another offense of which the defendant also stands convicted\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 313, 630 A.2d 593 (1993); so, too, will we overturn a conspiracy conviction that is legally impossible because the acquittal of a codefendant negates the possibility of an agreement, which is an essential element of the conspiracy charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>\u201cTo establish the crime of conspiracy under \u00a7 53a-48 ... it must be shown that an agreement was made between two or more persons to engage in conduct constituting a crime and that the agreement was followed by an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy by any one of the conspirators. The state must also show intent on the part of the accused that conduct constituting a crime be performed. . . . Further, the prosecution must show both that the conspirators intended to agree and that they intended to commit the elements of the underlying offense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>62 Conn. App. 217, 223, 774 A.2d 157 (2001), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>250 Conn. 611, 657-58, 737 A.2d 404 (1999), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>529 U.S. 1060, 120 S. Ct. 1568, 146 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2000). Our Supreme Court \u201cheld in <em>States v. Grullon, </em>212 Conn. 195, 199, 562 A.2d 481 (1989), that our conspiracy statute is bilateral in nature: \u2018Our examination of the definition of the crime of conspiracy in \u00a7 53a-48 convinces us that the legislature has determined that conspiracy requires a showing that two or more coconspirators intended to engage in or cause conduct that constitutes a crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>213 Conn. 243, 250, 567 A.2d 1173 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\"><em>In Robinson, </em>our Supreme Court addressed the question: \u201cWhen only two persons are alleged to have conspired to commit a crime and they are tried separately, does the acquittal on the charge of conspiracy of the first person tried bar the state from prosecuting the remaining conspirator for that same conspiracy?\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>251. In answering this question in the affirmative, our Supreme Court first concluded that a defendant cannot be convicted of conspiracy in the same proceeding in which all of the alleged coconspirators are acquitted. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Our Supreme Court in <em>Robinson </em>stated that \u201c[i]t has traditionally been held that a single conspirator may not be convicted in the same proceeding or prosecution in which all of the alleged coconspirators are acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">. . . \u2018The apparent basis for the traditional rule is the notion that the acquittal of all but one potential conspirator negates the possibility of an agreement between the sole remaining defendant and one of those acquitted of the conspiracy and thereby denies, by definition, the existence of any conspiracy at all.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) Id. \u201cThe gravamen of the crime of conspiracy is the <em>unlawful combination </em>and an act done in pursuance thereof, not the accomplishment of the objective of the conspiracy. . . . Because the essence of conspiracy is the mental confederation of two or more persons, the crime is in every sense indivisible.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 252-53. Further, this court and our Supreme Court have on several occasions stated that the conviction of one defendant and the acquittal of the other in a joint trial of two alleged coconspirators constitutes a legal impossibility and cannot stand. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCaro, </em>252 Conn. 229, 244 n.13, 425 A.2d 1022 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>178 Conn. 649, 654, 425 A.2d 104 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Milner, </em>46 Conn. App. 118, 122 n.2, 699 A.2d 1022 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">The state contends that the import of the <em>Robinson </em>case does not apply to this situation and that the defendant\u2019s conviction of conspiracy to commit robbery should stand because the acquittal of the alleged coconspirator Garcia does not negate the fact that another coconspirator existed and entered into a conspiracy to commit robbery with the defendant. In essence, the state argues that it was not required to prove the identity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>of the coconspirator to sustain a finding of guilty of conspiracy, and, therefore, the acquittal of Garcia does not eradicate the fact that the defendant entered into a conspiracy with someone else. To support its proposition, the state distinguishes this situation from that in <em>Robinson </em>by claiming that in <em>Robinson, </em>unlike in the present case, it was assumed that all potential conspirators had been charged. We are not persuaded.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The state prosecuted this case against both the defendant and the codefendant Garcia, jointly, as codefendants and coconspirators of the robbery of the grocery store on October 21, 1998. Here, the state charged only one person as a coconspirator, Garcia, and did not allege nor introduce evidence to establish that another person had engaged in a conspiracy to commit robbery with the defendant on October 21, 1998. During the trial, the state presented witnesses to prove that the defendant and Garcia had entered into a conspiracy to commit the robbery of the grocery store and then robbed the grocery store. Holland testified that in the early morning of October 21, 1998, she drove around in an automobile with the defendant and the codefendant Garcia, and that the defendant and Garcia purchased food from the grocery store. Further, Holland described that, when the defendant and Garcia returned to the automobile, they donned sweatshirts and ski masks and then reentered the grocery store. When the defendant and Garcia came back, they got into the automobile and quickly drove away. Acevedo, an owner of the grocery store that was robbed, testified that two men wearing ski masks, one short and one tall, had robbed the grocery store. Officer Garcia testified that he had pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>sued a vehicle that was wanted in connection with the robbery of the grocery store on October 21,1998. When the automobile pulled over, the driver of the car, a tall man, escaped, and the two passengers, the codefendant Garcia and Holland, were apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">During closing arguments, the prosecutor detailed the evidence allegedly proving that the defendant and the codefendant Garcia had conspired to and had robbed the grocery store on October 21, 1998. In describing the evidence regarding the conspiracy count, the prosecutor stated, \u201cNow, intent for conspiracy. They [the defendant and the codefendant] have to intended to have committed the robbery. And they both put on the hoodies [hooded sweatshirts] and the mask, and they go in there, and one has a gun and one has a knife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Here, for the defendant to have been legally convicted of conspiracy, the jury must have found that another person, namely, the codefendant Garcia, also was guilty of participating in the conspiracy. Garcia\u2019s \u201cculpability was thus an essential element of the defendant\u2019s offense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Robinson, supra, 213 Conn. 253. Because Garcia was acquitted, he may not be considered as a coconspirator. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra, 62 Conn. App. 221. The state failed to present any evidence to prove that anyone other than Garcia had conspired with the defendant to commit the robbery. Therefore, the record lacks any evidence of separate acts or circumstances to support an agreement to conspire between the defendant and anyone else. See id., 224. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s conviction of conspiracy to commit robbery must be set aside, as it constitutes a legal impossibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly denied his motion for a mistrial because evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>his prior convictions had been admitted improperly.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The following facts are necessary for the disposition of this claim. Before the jury trial began, the state and the defendant entered into a stipulation that provided that the defendant lacked a pistol permit and registration on both October 21, 1998, and October 23, 1998, the date that he was arrested. Furthermore, the parties stipulated that the defendant had prior convictions for carrying a pistol without a permit on February 18,1997, and for possession of narcotics on March 22, 1995. Certified copies of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions were then introduced into evidence. When the trial court questioned the defendant\u2019s attorney as to whether he had any objection to the stipulations, the defendant\u2019s attorney responded, \u201cNo, Your Honor. In fact, since we\u2019ve discussed them, my understanding is that the certified copies will come in today, as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">During the trial, the state offered into evidence the certified copies of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions and the defendant\u2019s stipulation that he did not have a permit to carry a pistol. In response, the defendant\u2019s attorney objected and requested a mistrial on the grounds that the introduction of certified copies of the defendant\u2019s criminal record would unfairly prejudice the jury against him and because the defendant had not testified in the case. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, and the stipulations were presented before the jury. The trial court then informed the juiy that it was to consider the stipulations \u201conly with regard to that second information [the charge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>criminal possession of a pistol or revolver in violation of \u00a7 53a-217c]</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\u201cIn our review of the denial of a motion for a mistrial, we have recognized the broad discretion that is vested in the trial court to decide whether an occurrence at trial has so prejudiced a party that he or she can no longer receive a fair trial. The decision of the trial court is therefore reversible on appeal only if there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>250 Conn. 526, 533, 737 A.2d 392 (1999), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Newsome, </em>238 Conn. 588, 628-29, 682 A.2d 972 (1996). The trial court possesses great discretion in determining whether to grant a motion for a mistrial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Taft, </em>57 Conn. App. 19, 22, 746 A.2d 813, cert. granted on other grounds, 253 Conn. 909, 753 A.2d 942 (2000). On appeal, \u201cwe hesitate to disturb a decision not to declare a mistrial. . . . [W]e afford every reasonable presumption ... in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>51 Conn.

Without presenting proof of a prior conviction here,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> a violation of \u00a7 53a-217c could not be established. See id., 180. \u201c[AJlleging possession of a firearm [in this case a pistol or revolver] without reciting the prior criminal conviction would not set forth a cognizable criminal offense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>45 Conn.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>52 Conn. App. 790, 793-96, 729 A.2d 226 (1999); <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 51 Conn. App. 180-84; <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>supra, 45 Conn. App. 403-405; <em>State </em>v. <em>Banta, </em>15 Conn. App. 161, 166-72, 544 A.2d 1226, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 815, 550 A.2d 1086 (1988). In Joyce,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we concluded that the defendant was not prejudiced or deprived of a fair trial because the jury was informed of his prior conviction through a stipulation and because the trial court advised the jury that it was to consider the prior conviction solely for purposes of establishing an element of the crime charged. <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>supra, 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">When analyzing whether a defendant was prejudiced by the introduction of evidence of prior convictions for purposes of establishing the elements of a violation of \u00a7 53a-217, this court utilizes five factors as set forth in <em>Banta: </em>\u201c(1) the manner in which the evidence entered the case and the extent of the jury\u2019s knowledge of the facts underlying the prior felony conviction, (2) the adequacy of any cautionary instructions given by the court, (3) the use of the prior felony evidence by the prosecution in argument to the jury, (4) the likelihood that the prior felony conviction evidence will inflame the passions of the jurors in light of the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>offenses charged and (5) the strength of the evidence against the defendant. See <em>[State </em>v. <em>Banta, </em>supra, 15 Conn. App. 170-71].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 51 Conn. App. 181-82.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The record and transcripts in this case lead us to conclude that the introduction of evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions did not prejudice the defendant, nor did it deprive him of a fair trial. Here, the jury learned of the defendant\u2019s prior felony convictions by way of a stipulation and was presented with a copy of the defendant\u2019s convictions for possession of narcotics and possession of a pistol. The jury did not receive any other information regarding the defendant\u2019s prior convictions. The trial court informed the jury that it was to consider the defendant\u2019s prior convictions only with regard to the charge of a violation of \u00a7 53a-217c. Further, during closing arguments the prosecutor referred only once to the prior convictions. The prosecutor stated that the stipulations of the prior convictions did not \u201csay anything to [the defendant\u2019s] character; that\u2019s not the point of it. The point of that is that those are underlying elements in the crime of criminal possession of a firearm.\u201d Additionally, given the cursory mention of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions, it is unlikely that the jurors\u2019 passions were inflamed to such a degree as to unduly prejudice the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Finally, the evidence that the state presented against the defendant was neither sparse nor unconvincing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Acevedo testified that the defendant purchased goods from him prior to the robbery and that the robber resembled the defendant. Holland identified the defendant as one of the men who had robbed the grocery store. Further, the pistol that the defendant disposed of on October 23, 1998, was the same pistol as the one used in the robbery on October 21,1998, and a bullet from the pistol was also found in the defendant\u2019s jacket pocket.

Various witnesses provided testimony linking the defendant to the robbery at the grocery store on October 21,1998. The victim, Acevedo, testified that the defendant, who wore black clothing, purchased food from him early in the morning of October 21,1998, and that the robber who had entered a few minutes later was of a similar height and also was dressed in all black, with the addition of a black mask. Holland testified that she drove around in a grey station wagon with tinted windows with the defendant and the codefendant Garcia throughout the early hours of October 21, 1998, before, during and after the robbery. She described how after purchasing food from the victim\u2019s store, the defendant returned to the motor vehicle, dressed himself in a dark hooded sweatshirt and ski mask, and reentered the victim\u2019s grocery store. A few minutes later the defendant came back out and drove away from the scene. She noticed a pistol resting on the seat beside the defendant. Further, Marshall Robinson, a firearm and tool mark expert examiner, testified that the spent bullet shell discovered on the floor of the victim\u2019s grocery store and the live bullet found in the defendant\u2019s jacket pocket were both at one time chambered in the pistol that the defendant possessed on October 23, 1998. Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to upholding the jury\u2019s verdict, we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>elude that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict of guilty of robbery in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">In challenging the verdict of guilty of the robbery charges, the defendant argues that the jury improperly relied on the testimony of Holland because it was untrustworthy. The defendant further contends that the jury improperly relied on the testimony of other state witnesses due to their lack of personal knowledge of the robbery incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\u201cIt is the [jury\u2019s] exclusive province to weigh the conflicting evidence and to determine the credibility of witnesses.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>44 Conn.

Accordingly, the jury was entitled to credit the testimony of the state\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that sufficient evidence exists supporting the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty on the charge of robbery in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">The defendant next contends that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel when his counsel (1) entered a plea of guilty to \u201cthe gun charges\u201d without his consent, (2) failed to object at trial and to move for an acquittal on the charge of criminal possession of a firearm, (3) failed to raise the issue before the trial court that the conviction of robbery in the first degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>and criminal possession of a pistol violated Ms constitutional rigM agamst double jeopardy<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and (4) failed to object to prosecutorial misconduct and errors that occurred during the trial.

The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . .

Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly emphasized the jury\u2019s duty to convict. <em>In State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>227 Conn. 32, 62, 630 A.2d 990 (1993), our Supreme Court addressed a challenge to almost identical language contained in a jury instruction. In concluding that the instruction did not deprive the defendant of his due process rights, our Supreme Court stated: \u201c[I]t would be preferable for a trial court either to omit those references entirely or frame the instructions so that the laudatory references are included with respect to both jury functions \u2014 acquittal as well as conviction. . . . That does not mean, however, that the defendants are correct in their characterization of the message the language in issue may have conveyed to the jury . . . .\u201d Id., 63-64. Further, this court in several cases has upheld jury instructions containing substantially similar language, finding that such language \u201cdid not lessen the state\u2019s burden to prove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and did not undermine the presumption of innocence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>37 Conn.

The portion of the instructions challenged by the defendant is a small part of a larger section of the jury charge that concerns the jury\u2019s duty to view the evidence carefully and objectively, and to render a verdict based on its consideration of the evidence and the law. Immediately prior to the challenged instruction, the court instructed the jury that it was to \u201crender a verdict of not guilty, if the facts and the law require such a verdict.\u201d Shortly afterward, the court stated that \u201c[t]he state is as much concerned as having an innocent person acquitted as having a guilty person punished. ... It is the sworn duty of the courts and the jurors to safeguard the rights of persons charged with a crime by respecting the presumption of innocence which the law imputes to every person charged with a crime.\u201d Viewing the charge as a whole, we conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled.

Accordingly, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b427-8\"> The defendant challenges the following language contained in the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury: \u201cThese men [the defendants] rely upon you to consider carefully their claims and to evaluate carefully all of the evidence and to render a verdict of not guilty, if the facts and the law require such a verdict. The state of Connecticut and <em>its people . . . </em>look to you as sworn officers of the court to deal with the case fairly, firmly and honestly as strong-minded men and women with the interest placed in your hands as an arm of the court to weigh and uphold the law of the land by rendering a verdicl of guilty, if the facts and the law require such a verdict.\u201d The defendant objected to the phrase \u201cfairly, firmly,\u201d and presently contends that those words improperly placed emphasis on the jury\u2019s duty to convict in violation of his due process rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b427-9\"> The defendant challenges the following language: \u201cThe presumption of innocence does not have the effect of evidence itself. It\u2019s only effect is to place upon the state the burden of proving the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b429-9\"> Practice Book \u00a7 42-16 provides: \u201cAn appellate court shall not be bound to consider error as to the giving of, or the failure to give, an instruction unless the matter is covered by a written request to charge or exception has been taken by the party appealing immediately after the charge is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>delivered. Counsel taking the exception shall state distinctly the matter objected to and the ground of exception. The exception shall be taken out of the hearing of the jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b430-10\"> Notwithstanding the fact that this issue is unpreserved, this court on numerous occasions has approved similar language regarding the presumption of innocence and has found that such language did not mislead the jury or diminish the presumption of innocence standard. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>53 Conn. App. 690, 700-701, 734 A.2d 136 (1999); <em>State </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>36 Conn. App. 805, 814-15, 654 A.2d 371, cert. denied, 232 Conn. 921, 656 A.2d 669 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b430-11\"> The defendant contends that the following statements by the prosecutor during summation were improper: \u201cWith that said, this case is a very simple case. There was a robbery over at 741 East Main Street at Zaidas Market.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">. . . There is no evidence that a robbery did not take place\u201d; and \u201c[l]et\u2019s go back to the 21st day of October when the robbery occurred. As I said earlier, there\u2019s no dispute that arobbery took place. There\u2019s been no evidence to show a robbery did not take place.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
