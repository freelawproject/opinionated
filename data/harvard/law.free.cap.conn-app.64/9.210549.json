The defendants claim that the court improperly granted the motion because the motion failed to specify the grounds of insufficiency as required by Practice Book \u00a7 10-41.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree with the defendants and, therefore, reverse the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. The plaintiff holds a note, which is now in default, dated October 7, 1994, for $250,000 from the defendant Emerald Realty, Inc., secured by a mortgage on certain property in Hamden. Emerald Realty, Inc., subsequently conveyed the property by quitclaim deed to Rear Still Hill Road, LLC. Emerald Realty, Inc., holds a mortgage on the property bearing the same date as the quitclaim deed. Frank Verderame has an assignment of a prior mortgage on the property. The assignment was dated and recorded in August, 1997, and the mortgage was dated and recorded in July, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The plaintiff initiated this foreclosure action on September 2, 1998, and on or about December 21, 1998, the defendants filed an answer and special defenses. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion to strike the special defenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendants objected to the plaintiffs motion to strike, arguing, inter alia, that the motion failed to specify the grounds of insufficiency of the defendants\u2019 special defenses. On July 28, 1999, the defendants filed an answer with revised special defenses. On July 30, 1999, the court granted the plaintiffs motion to strike the defendants\u2019 revised special defenses. On January 24, 2000, the court rendered judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>ment of strict foreclosure in favor of the plaintiff. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">We begin by noting that the record is adequate for our review. As the plaintiff has pointed out, the record on appeal; see Practice Book \u00a7 68-2; does not contain a memorandum of decision or a transcribed copy of an oral decision signed by the trial court as required by Practice Book \u00a7 64-1 (a). A signed transcript from the hearing on the motion to strike, however, was distributed to this court before this appeal was argued. See Practice Book \u00a7 64-1 (b). Because the transcript includes detailed rulings made by the trial judge and is more than an \u201cautographed colloquy between the trial court and trial counsel\u201d; <em>Auric Answering Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Glenayre Electronics, Inc., </em>54 Conn. App. 86, 88, 733 A.2d 307, cert. denied, 250 Conn. 926, 738 A.2d 653 (1999); we will not exalt form over substance and refuse to review this appeal. See <em>Mikolinski </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>55 Conn. App. 691, 699, 740 A.2d 885 (1999), cert. denied, 252 Conn. 922, 747 A.2d 518 (2000). We now turn to the merits of the defendants\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">On appeal, the defendants\u2019 claim that the court improperly granted the plaintiffs motion to strike the defendants\u2019 special defenses. The defendants claim that the plaintiffs motion was fatally defective because it failed to state the alleged grounds of insufficiency as required by Practice Book \u00a7 10-41. In response, the plaintiff claims that his motion to strike was not fatally defective because the attached memorandum of law in support of his motion set forth the specified reasons of insufficiency. We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">\u201cOur standard of review is undisputed. Because a motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading and, consequently, requires no factual findings by the trial court, our review of the court\u2019s ruling on [a motion to strike] is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>omitted.) <em>Melanson </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>61 Conn. App. 683, 687, 767 A.2d 764, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 904, 772 A.2d 595 (2001); see <em>Eskin </em>v. <em>Castiglia, </em>253 Conn. 516, 522, 753 A.2d 927 (2000). A party wanting to contest the legal sufficiency of a special defense may do so by filing a motion to strike. \u201cThe purpose of a special defense is to plead facts that are consistent with the allegations of the complaint but demonstrate, nonetheless, that the plaintiff has no cause of action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Danbury </em>v. <em>Dana Investment Corp., </em>249 Conn. 1, 17, 730 A.2d 1128 (1999); Practice Book \u00a7 10-50. In ruling on a motion to strike, the court must accept as true the facts alleged in the special defenses and construe them in the manner most favorable to sustaining their legal sufficiency. <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>221 Conn. 530, 536, 606 A.2d 684 (1992); <em>Melanson </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>supra, 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Practice Book \u00a7 10-41 requires that a motion to strike raising a claim of insufficiency \u201cshall distinctly specify the reason or reasons for each such claimed insufficiency.\u201d Motions to strike that do not specify the grounds of insufficiency are \u201cfatally defective\u201d and, absent a waiver by the party opposing the motion, should not be granted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Lubas </em>v. <em>McCusker, </em>153 Conn. 250, 253, 216 A.2d 289 (1965); see <em>Bouchard </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Bank, </em>219 Conn. 465, 468 n.4, 594 A.2d 1 (1991). Our Supreme Court has stated \u201cthat a motion to strike that does not specify the grounds of insufficiency is fatally defective . . . and that Practice Book \u00a7 [10-42], which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>requires a motion to strike to be accompanied by an appropriate memorandum of law citing the legal authorities upon which the motion relies, does not dispense with the requirement of [Practice Book \u00a7 10-41] that the reasons for the claimed pleading deficiency be specified in the motion itself.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Hartford Courant Co., </em>200 Conn. 676, 683 n.5, 513 A.2d 66 (1986); <em>King </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>195 Conn. 90, 94 n.4, 486 A.2d 1111 (1985); see <em>Bouchard </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Bank, </em>supra, 468 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">In the present case, the plaintiffs motion clearly fails to specify the grounds of insufficiency. It merely states: \u201cA Memorandum of Law in support of this motion, which discusses the legal insufficiency of each Special Defense, is attached.\u201d Accordingly, the plaintiffs motion is fatally defective. The defendants brought this issue to the attention of the court, and the plaintiffs motion should not have been granted. The plaintiffs assertion that his motion is not fatally defective because the specific grounds of insufficiency are set forth in a supporting memorandum of law is meritless. See <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Hartford Courant Co., </em>supra, 200 Conn. 683 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Therefore, because the plaintiffs motion failed to specify the grounds of insufficiency as required by Practice Book \u00a7 10-41, we must conclude that the court improperly granted the plaintiffs motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the plaintiffs motion to strike and for farther proceedings in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-12\"> Practice Book \u00a7 10-41 provides: \u201cEach motion to strike raising any of the claims of legal insufficiency enumerated in the preceding sections [of the rules of practice] shall separately set forth each such claim of insufficiency and shall distinctly specify the reason or reasons for each such claimed insufficiency.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b32-13\"> We note that the defendants also have claimed on appeal that the court (1) failed to credit excess payments on another debt toward the mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>debt when granting the plaintiffs motion to strike as to the first special defense, (2) considered evidence outside of the pleadings when granting the plaintiffs motion to strike as to the first special defense and (3) improperly granted the motion to strike certain equitable defenses. In light of our conclusion that the court improperly granted the plaintiffs motion to strike because the motion failed to specify the grounds of insufficiency, we need not reach those claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b33-8\"> The plaintiffs motion to strike states: \u201cThe plaintiff in the above entitled matter moves to strike the following from the defendant[s\u2019] Special Defenses, the First through the Thirteenth Special Defenses. The Plaintiff makes this request because the mentioned Special Defenses are insufficient as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">\u201cA Memorandum of Law in support of this motion, which discusses the legal insufficiency of each Special Defense, is attached.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b35-6\"> We note that in <em>Bouchard </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Bank, </em>219 Conn. 465, 468 n.4, 594 A.2d 1 (1991), and in <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Hartford Courant Co., </em>200 Conn. 676, 683 n.5, 513 A.2d 66 (1986), our Supreme Court considered the fatally defective motions to strike in the form that they were presented to the trial courts because the parties opposed to the motions failed to object to their form at trial and because Practice Book \u00a7 10-41 is not jurisdictional in nature. In the present case, however, the defendants properly raised this issue in their objection to the plaintiffs motion to strike.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
