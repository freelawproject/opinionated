The defendant, Glenn Stewart, originally appealed to this court from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of manslaughter in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56 (a) (1)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and evasion of responsibility in the operation of a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-224 (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>In his original appeal to this court, the defendant asserted that the trial court improperly (1) denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal because the evidence was insufficient to convict him of either charge, (2) failed to instruct the jury, as required by statute,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that it co\u00fald draw no unfavorable inferences from his failure to testify, (3) precluded evidence that the child victim died because she and her safety seat were not properly secured, and (4) failed to instruct the jury adequately on the essential element of. causation. We resolved issues one, three and four against the defendant, and resolved issue two in the defendant\u2019s favor, thereby reversing the judgment of conviction and remanding the case for a new trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>60 Conn. App. 301, 759 A.2d 142, remanded, 255 Conn. 913, 763 A.2d 1039 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">After the defendant filed his brief in the original appeal to this court, the state filed a motion for permission to file a late motion for articulation or rectification. The state sought an articulation from the trial court as to whether, during a charging conference held in chambers, the defendant\u2019s trial attorney had requested that the court omit from its charge the \u201cno unfavorable inferences\u201d instruction at issue in the appeal. On February 9, 2000, we denied the state\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">On October 10, 2000, we officially released our decision on the defendant\u2019s appeal. We held, with respect to the issue concerning the omission of the \u201cno unfavor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>able inferences\u201d instruction, that there was no record of any conference at which the defendant\u2019s attorney requested that the court omit the instruction from its charge and that the court\u2019s failure to so charge constituted plain error. Id., 309. We relied on our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Suplicki, </em>33 Conn. App. 126, 634 A.2d 1179 (1993) , cert. denied, 229 Conn. 920, 642 A.2d 1216 (1994) .</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">On December 5, 2000, our Supreme Court granted the state\u2019s petition for certification limited to the following issues: \u201c1. Did the Appellate Court properly conclude that, under the facts of this case, the trial court\u2019s failure to give a \u2018no unfavorable inferences\u2019 instruction was plain error requiring reversal of the conviction? 2. Is the failure to include such an instruction subject to harmless error analysis?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>255 Conn. 913, 763 A.2d 1039 (2000). Our Supreme Court also \u201cordered that the trial court articulate the facts concerning discussions, if any, among the state\u2019s attorney, defense counsel and the court during a charging conference, relative to the court\u2019s giving a \u2018no unfavorable inferences\u2019 instruction to the jury in this matter.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">On December 14,2000, the trial court filed its articulation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On January 25, 2001, after receiving the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>court\u2019s articulation, our Supreme Court remanded the matter to this court \u201cfor reconsideration of whether the failure to give the instruction, under the circumstances of this case, was plain error requiring the reversal of the conviction.\u201d Id. We answer that question in the negative and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The defendant argues that the court committed plain, reversible error by omitting the \u201cno unfavorable inferences\u201d instruction from its jury charge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He asserts that the instruction implicated his fundamental right not to testify, which only he could exercise. As such, he argues, it necessarily follows that \u201cthe accused must personally waive his statutory right to the protections of General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b).\u201d The defendant urges us to accept his interpretation of the statute, arguing that it \u201crequires the court to ask the accused personally whether he or she desires to waive the otherwise mandatory [instruction].\u201d The defendant argues that because the court never conducted that inquiry, it committed plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The relevant facts underlying the defendant\u2019s conviction, as the jury reasonably could have found them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>were set out in this court\u2019s first opinion in this matter. <em>State </em>v. Stewart, supra, 60 Conn. App. 301. A summary of those facts will suffice here. On April 8,1996, Ioanna Schmidt and her four month old daughter, Arianna, were traveling on the southbound lane of Interstate 95 in Stamford. The weather conditions that evening were a wintry mix of snow and rain. Schmidt was driving a Toyota Corolla, and her daughter was buckled into her seat in the back of the vehicle. Lori Bonante was also traveling in the southbound lane at the same time as Schmidt.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Near exit two, Bonante, traveling in the right lane, noticed a large tractor trailer approach her from behind. The truck, operated by the defendant, maintained a distance of only a few inches from the rear of Bonante\u2019s vehicle for a distance of about one mile. After Schmidt, traveling in the center lane, passed the defendant\u2019s truck, the defendant moved from behind Bonante\u2019s vehicle into the center lane. Bonante decelerated her vehicle, affording Schmidt an opportunity to get out of the defendant\u2019s lane. As Schmidt moved from the center lane to the right lane, the defendant accelerated his tractor trailer, striking the left rear portion of her vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The impact caused Schmidt\u2019s vehicle to careen across the right lane, enter a grassy area and collide with a tree. Arianna was ejected from the vehicle as it collided with the tree. Arianna died from her injuries approximately six weeks after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Alter the accident, the defendant pulled his tractor trailer to the left lane, stopped and walked back to the scene of the accident. Shortly thereafter, he returned to his truck and drove away without speaking to anyone at the scene. Some ten months later, the state police determined that the defendant was operating the truck at the time of the accident. On February 23, 1997, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>state police arrested the defendant who, after initially indicating that he possessed a poor recollection concerning the events surrounding the accident, admitted that he must have been the truck\u2019s operator. Id., 303-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">At trial, the defendant did not raise the issue that the court improperly omitted the \u201cno unfavorable inferences\u201d instruction from its charge to the jury. On appeal, however, he concedes that his trial counsel specifically requested that the court take the action he now challenges. He nevertheless argues that the court committed plain error, which warrants the reversal of the judgment of conviction. Our Supreme Court has observed in several opinions that \u201c \u2018plain error is not even implicated unless the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. <em>State </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>223 Conn. 535, 551, 613 A.2d 770 (1992).\u2019 . . . <em>State v. Cassidy, </em>236 Conn. 112, 144, 672 A.2d 899, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 910, 117 S. Ct. 273, 136 L. Ed. 2d 196 (1996), overruled on other grounds, <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>254 Conn. 290, 755 A.2d 868 (2000). Although, on rare occasions, we have granted plain error review for claims of improper jury instructions . . . we have done so only when the instruction in question either failed to include language from a mandatory charging statute, or when the instruction was so patently improper that to allow it to stand uncorrected would work a manifest injustice.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>256 Conn. 23, 58 n.18, 770 A.2d 908 (2001); see also Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The United States Supreme Court, in <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>450 U.S. 288, 101 S. Ct. 1112, 67 L. Ed. 2d 241 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>(1981), discussed the fundamental importance of a \u201cno adverse inference\u201d instruction and its relation to the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination embodied in the fifth amendment to the United States constitution. The Supreme Court noted that \u201c[t]he principles enunciated in our cases construing this privilege, against both statutory and constitutional backdrops, lead unmistakably to the conclusion that the Fifth Amendment requires that a criminal trial judge must give a \u2018no adverse-inference\u2019 jury instruction when requested by a defendant to do so.\u201d Id., 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The Supreme Court underscored the significance of such an instruction in light of the tendency of jurors to view a criminal defendant\u2019s fifth amendment privilege \u201cas a shelter for wrongdoers . . . [and jurors who] too readily assume that those who invoke it are . . . guilty of crime . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 302. The court stated that \u201c[a] trial judge has a powerful tool at his disposal to protect the constitutional privilege \u2014 the jury instruction \u2014 and he has an affirmative constitutional obligation to use that tool when a defendant seeks its employment. No judge can prevent jurors from speculating about why a defendant stands mute in the face of a criminal accusation, but a judge can, and must, if requested to do so, use the unique power of the jury instruction to reduce that speculation to a minimum.\u201d Id., 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">\u201cThe provisions of \u00a7 54-84 (b) are more stringent than the federal or state constitutions require. . . . While the constitutional right to a no adverse inference charge depends upon the defendant\u2019s request of such a charge, the statutory right is conferred upon the defendant unconditionally, in the absence of his request that the charge not be given. . . . Our legislature has prescribed the language provided in \u00a7 54-84 (b) to be the jury instruction that must be given to reduce speculation to a minimum.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>tion marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thurman, </em>10 Conn. App. 302, 309, 523 A.2d 891, cert. denied, 204 Conn. 805, 528 A.2d 1152 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Our Supreme Court has noted that the legislature, in enacting \u00a7 54-84, established anew statutory procedure to protect the rights of those accused persons who choose not to testify. \u201cWhere the legislature has chosen specific means to effectuate a fundamental right, failure to follow the mandatory provisions of the statute is plain error . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>182 Conn. 330, 331-32, 438 A.2d 93 (1980). Moreover, our Supreme Court has \u201cregularly characterized as error any but the most minor departure from the language that \u00a7 54-84 (b) requires.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>197 Conn. 574, 583, 500 A.2d 539 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Although our state\u2019s appellate courts have, on several occasions, reviewed unpreserved claims of instructional error concerning \u00a7 54-84 (b), we have not had occasion to consider the issue presented by the circumstances of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b) provides in relevant part that \u201c[u]nless <em>the accused </em>requests otherwise,\u201d the court shall provide the jury with a \u201cno unfavorable inferences\u201d instruction in its charge. (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b). The issue before us is whether the statute requires, as the defendant argues, that the court inquire expressly of the defendant whether he or she wants the court to omit that instruction from its charge or whether, as the state argues, the defendant\u2019s attorney could waive that protection on the defendant\u2019s behalf. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">We begin our analysis by examining the language of \u00a7 54-84 (b). As in any exercise of statutory interpretation, \u201c[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Marrocco </em>v. <em>Giar</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number><em>dino, </em>255 Conn. 617, 624, 767 A.2d 720 (2001). \u201cIn seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Animal Rights Front </em>v. <em>Rocque, </em>63 Conn. App. 207, 211, 772 A.2d 769, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 936, 776 A.2d 1149 (2001). Furthermore, \u201cstatutory language should be given its plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Peabody N.E., Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Transportation, </em>250 Conn. 105, 122, 735 A.2d 782 (1999). We refrain from reading into statutes provisions that are not clearly stated and interpret statutory intent by \u201creferring to what the legislative text contains, not by what it might have contained.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Winchester v. Northwest Associates, </em>255 Conn. 379, 388, 767 A.2d 687 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Our review of the legislative history of \u00a7 54-84 (b) reveals that the legislature merely sought to make the instruction mandatory, absent a request to the contrary. We do not find in the legislative history support for the defendant\u2019s position that a court need inquire of the accused directly after it receives a request from his or her attorney to omit the instruction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990) defines \u201caccused\u201d as \u201c[t]he generic name for the defendant in a criminal case. . . .\u201d In ascertaining the customary use of the word, we will not ignore the important fact that once counsel undertakes representation of an accused, he or she acts on the accused\u2019s behalf within the scope of his or her representation. Absent some indication to the contrary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>a court is entitled to rely on counsel\u2019s representations on behalf of his or her client.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">We find persuasive our Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>245 Conn. 301, 715 A.2d 1 (1998). The issue before the court in that case was whether the trial court improperly deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to aprobable cause hearing because it permitted his attorney, without the defendant\u2019s consent or knowledge, to request a postponement of the hearing beyond the statutorily prescribed period of sixty days. Id., 313. General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cUnless waived by <em>the accused person </em>or extended by the court for good cause shown, such preliminary hearing shall be conducted within sixty days of the filing of the complaint or information in Superior Court. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>supra, 313. Our Supreme Court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the defendant himself must have made the waiver and that his attorney could not have made it on his behalf. Id., 313-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The Supreme Court reasoned that a personal, express waiver of the defendant\u2019s statutory protection was not required; such waiver may be implied by the actions of the attorney acting on his behalf. The legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201caccused\u201d in \u00a7 54-46a (b) did not require that the trial court inquire of the accused directly concerning his waiver of the statutory right. Further, the Supreme Court noted that waiver of the statutory right \u201ccertainly can be found from a specific request by counsel for a postponement.\u201d Id., 315. While the court recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>nized that \u201c[i]n some circumstances, a waiver of rights must be knowing, voluntary and intelligent, and it must be expressly made. ... In other circumstances, waiver can be implied . . . [and] [t]he waiver can be made by counsel . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 315-16.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant did not have a constitutional right to be canvassed personally as to his waiver of the jury instruction at issue in the present case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Although we rely on our Supreme Court\u2019s prior interpretation of \u201caccused,\u201d we also find considerable sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>port for our interpretation of the word from well settled principles in our law. We can discern no support, and the defendant fails to bring any to our attention, for the defendant\u2019s assertion that the court was required to conduct this type of inquiry, or ask him directly, concerning the jury instruction at issue in this case after his counsel had requested that the court omit the instruction. To the contrary, our law recognizes a distinction between matters that are within the province of a criminal defendant and those that are within the province of his or her counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u201cIt is . . . recognized that the accused has the ultimate authority to make certain fundamental decisions regarding the case, as to whether to plead guilty, waive a jury, testify in his or her own behalf, or take an appeal . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>199 Conn. 88, 95, 506 A.2d 86 (1986); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Morico, </em>14 Conn. App. 140, 144-45, 539 A.2d 1033, cert. denied, 208 Conn. 812, 546 A.2d 281 (1988). However, \u201c[o]nce counsel is appointed, the day-to-day conduct of the defense rests with the attorney. He, not the client, has the immediate \u2014 and ultimate \u2014 responsibility of deciding if and when to object, which witnesses, if any to call, and what defenses to develop. Not only do these decisions rest with the attorney, but such decisions must, as a practical matter, be made without consulting the client.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 95, citing <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 93, 97 S. Ct. 2497, 53 L. Ed. 2d 594 (1977); see also rule 1.2 (a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>In <em>Davis, </em>a defendant, who was represented at trial by counsel, argued that our state constitution conferred on him the ultimate decision-making right to call witnesses on his behalf. In rejecting his claim, our Supreme Court reasoned that such a decision is commonly regarded as tactical or strategic in nature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 96. The court\u2019s analysis of that issue is illuminating because it underscores the principle that \u201cdecisions concerning matters of trial strategy and tactics rest with the lawyer, as opposed to decisions concerning . . . inherently personal rights of fundamental importance to the defendant . . . .\u201d Id., 95; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hedman, </em>62 Conn. App. 403, 772 A.2d 603, (discussing fundamental posttrial right of defendant to allocution prior to imposition of sentence), cert. granted on other grounds, 256 Conn. 909, 772 A.2d 602 (2001). It is well established that \u201c \u2018[w]e may assume with confidence that most counsel, whether retained or appointed, will protect the rights of an accused.\u2019 <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 344, 100 S. Ct. 1708, 64 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1980).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">We conclude that decisions concerning the composition of a jury charge fall into the category of decisions concerning matters of trial strategy. Although the right not to testify is personal to the accused, the decision as to whether a court should include an instruction, pursuant to \u00a7 54-84 (b), regarding an accused\u2019s decision not to testify is a matter of trial strategy. There is little uncertainty about the fact that the defendant\u2019s counsel made a strategic and tactical decision concerning the instruction at issue in the present case. Counsel \u201cpersisted\u201d in asking the court to omit the instruction from its charge. The court reminded counsel of the statute and of the fact that the instruction was already a part of its base charge. Counsel, nonetheless, did not want to \u201chighlight\u201d the defendant\u2019s failure to take the witness stand. See footnote 4. Although it would not change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>our analysis, the defendant does not assert in his brief to this court that he disagreed with counsel\u2019s decision or that counsel did not follow his wishes concerning the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The defendant relies on our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 330. In <em>Burke, </em>the court found plain error where a trial court failed to include the instruction set forth in \u00a7 54-84 (b) despite the fact that defendant\u2019s counsel failed to except to the court\u2019s omission of the instruction at the close of the charge. <em>Burke </em>required courts to follow the plain language of the statute, but it did <em>\u201csuggest </em>that prior to delivering the charge to the jury, the trial court, in the absence of the jury, inquire of the defendant and of counsel if they would like the court to instruct the jury that jurors may not draw unfavorable inferences from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 334. The present case is distinguishable from <em>Burke. </em>Here, the defendant\u2019s counsel, certainly purporting to act on the defendant\u2019s behalf, specifically told the court, on two separate occasions, that he wanted the court to omit the instruction from its charge. Where, as in <em>Burke, </em>it would be better practice as a means of complying with the statute for the court to conduct such an inquiry, or to state in open court on the record that the defendant, through his counsel, had requested the omission, the court did not need to do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Likewise, the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>supra, 197 Conn. 574, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>182 Conn. 580, 438 A.2d 778 (1980), is of no avail. In those cases, as in <em>Burke, </em>the court omitted the instruction from its charge, and the defendant failed to except to the omission at trial. The failure to give the instruction, in the absence of a request to the contrary, is plain error. The present case presents a different issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">We hold, therefore, that the court did not improperly fail to inquire expressly of the accused, after Ms counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>requested that the court omit the instruction, whether he also wanted the court to omit the instruction from its charge. General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b) does not so require, and it was well within the province of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel to make the tactical and strategic decision to request that the court omit the instruction from its charge.
