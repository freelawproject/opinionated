The public policy of the State, as evinced by statute, being to require a speedy hearing on writs of error in criminal cases, a case of this class will not be postponed at the instance of parties or counsel except for providential cause, although counsel on both sides consent; and the absence of counsel for the plaintiff in error in attendance upon a conference of his church as a delegate, is not such cause.</p><p id=\"b128-9\">2.
