Especially is this so where, by inspection of the certificate of the judge to the bill of exceptions, it appears that it does not conform to the certificate prescribed by the act of November, 1889, for bringing cases to this court, and for lack of such conformity the writ of error is subject to be dismissed on motion of counsel representing the State.</p><p id=\"Ag\">\n<em>Motion to reinstate denied.</em>\n</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
