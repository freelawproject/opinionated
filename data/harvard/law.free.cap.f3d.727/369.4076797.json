SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">Mary Ernewayn sued her employer, Home Depot U.S.A., Inc. (\u201cHome Depot\u201d), in state court, claiming that Home Depot\u2019s negligence caused her on-the-job injury. The district court remanded after Home Depot removed, and Home Depot appeals the remand. Concluding that we are without jurisdiction, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"Aru\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">Because Home Depot was not a subscriber to the Texas Worker\u2019s Compensation Fund, Ernewayn filed a nonsubscriber action pursuant to Texas' Labor Code \u00a7 406.033. Home Depot removed to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. Ernewayn moved to remand, contending, as relevant here, that the suit arose under the Texas Worker\u2019s Compensation Act (\u201cTWCA\u201d) and therefore was not removable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445(c). Home Depot protested that the suit does not \u201caris[e] under the workmen\u2019s compensation laws\u201d of Texas and is therefore removable.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-15\">After concluding that it had subject-matter jurisdiction based on diversity, the district court considered whether Ernewayn\u2019s suit was removable. The court noted a division among district courts over whether claims such as Ernewayn\u2019s \u201carise under\u201d the TWCA, and it observed that this court had refused to \u201ccomment on whether the TWCA\u2019s mere \u2018contemplation]\u2019 of a cause of action provides sufficient justification to deny removal under section 1445(c).\u201d <em>Am. Int\u2019l Specialty Lines Ins. Co. v. Rentech Steel LLC, </em>620 F.3d 558, 569 (5th Cir.2010) (alteration in original). Therefore, the court found \u201cambiguity\u201d as to whether Ernewayn\u2019s suit was removable. Consistent with the underlying policy of \u00a7 1445(c) and with this court\u2019s canon that \u201c[a]ny ambiguities are construed against removal because the removal statute should be strictly construed in favor of remand,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court concluded that the suit was \u201cnot removable\u201d and \u201cmust be remanded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-17\">Ernewayn asks us to dismiss the appeal for want of appellate jurisdiction. \u2018We have jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Martin v. Halliburton, </em>618 F.3d 476, 481 (5th Cir.2010). Home Depot, as appellant, bears the burden of establishing appellate jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-18\">Congress has restricted our jurisdiction to review remand orders; subject to exceptions not relevant here, \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). Despite its broad language, \u201c \u00a7 1447(d) must be read <em>in pari materia </em>with \u00a7 1447(c), so that only remands based on grounds specified in \u00a7 1447(c) are immune from review under \u00a7 1447(d).\u201d <em>Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, </em>516 U.S. 124, 127, 116 S.Ct. 494, 133 L.Ed.2d 461 (1995). Section 1447(c) allows for remands \u201cbased on a timely raised defect in removal procedure or on lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the district court held that it had subject-matter jurisdiction, we must dismiss this appeal if, but only if, the court remanded based on a timely raised defect in removal procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Home Depot contends that \u00a7 1445(c) is not such a procedural defect. Under this court\u2019s binding precedents, however, \u201c[a] statutory restriction against removal like the one in \u00a7 1445(c) is a defect in removal procedure under \u00a7 1447(c).\u201d <em>Meeks v. Swift Transp., Inc., </em>398 Fed.Appx. 980, 982 (5th Cir.2010) (per curiam). Rather than spelunk in our caselaw yet again, we adopt the <em>Meeks </em>panel\u2019s persuasive, albeit unpublished, rejection of the very argument Home Depot makes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">We have consistently held that \u201c \u2018when section 1447(c) speaks of any defect in removal procedure, it includes within its reach the bringing of an action not within the court\u2019s removal jurisdiction but that could have been brought originally in that court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hopkins [v. Dolphin Titan Intern., Inc.], </em>976 F.2d [924] at 926 [ (5th Cir.1992) ] (quoting <em>Baris v. Sulpicio Lines, Inc., </em>932 F.2d 1540, 1544-45 (5th Cir.1991) (internal quotations omitted)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\"><em>Albarado v. S. Pac. Transp. Co., </em>199 F.3d 762, 765 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Williams v. AC Spark Plugs Div. of Gen. Motors Corp., </em>985 F.2d 783, 786-88 (5th Cir.1993) (Removal of an action contrary to statutory restrictions against removal\u2014 including those provided by \u00a7\u00a7 1445(a) and (c) \u2014 is a procedural defect subject to the requirements of \u00a7 1447(c)). Thus, based on this clear case law ... and under \u00a7 1447(d) this court has no jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s remand order. <em>Albarado, </em>199 F.3d at 765. <em>See also Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London v. Warrantech Corp., </em>461 F.3d 568, 572 (5th Cir.2006).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">[Arguing against this conclusion, Swift] relies on language in <em>Schexnayder v. Entergy Louisiana, Inc., </em>394 F.3d 280, 283 (5th Cir.2004), that in turn relies on <em>In re Excel Corp., </em>106 F.3d 1197 (5th Cir.1997). The language in <em>Schexnayder </em>suggests that a remand based on \u00a7 1445(c) is a non \u00a7 1447(c) ground for removal and thus reviewable on appeal. <em>Schexnayder </em>states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">Non \u00a7 1447(c) grounds for which a district court might remand a case include those remands made for purely discretionary reasons, ... abstention-based remands, ... <em>remands based on \u00a7 1115(c), In re Excel Corp., </em>106 F.3d 1197, 1200 (5th Cir.1997), and remands based on the district court\u2019s discretionary powers under \u00a7 1441(c) ... among others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">394 F.3d at 283 (emphases added; [internal citations omitted]). In <em>Albarado, </em>however, this court responded to a similar argument by stating expressly that <em>In re Excel </em>should not be relied on in resolving this issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">Thus, to the extent that our implicit holding in <em>In re Excel </em>can be read as inconsistent with our prior holdings in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number><em>Johnson}</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> Hopkins, </em>and <em>Williams, </em>our earlier decisions control.... Thus, remand based upon \u00a7 1445(a)\u2019s statutory restriction against removal is a procedural defect under \u00a7 1447(c), and the district court\u2019s remand order based thereupon is not subject to appellate review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\"><em>Albarado, </em>199 F.3d at 766.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-5\"><em>Id. </em>(alterations to first paragraph in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The question is whether the district court remanded based on \u00a7 1445(c) or, as Home Depot asserts, on a discretionary basis because of an ambiguity. According to Home Depot, the court declined to hold that \u00a7 1445(c) precluded removal but instead considered two contrary lines of cases and concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIc\">it is not yet established as to whether a negligence action against a nonsubscribing employer \u201carises under\u201d the TWCA. Because our sister courts are split on the issue and this Circuit has not expressly. ruled on the issue, the Court finds that ambiguity exists as to whether the instant action is in fact removable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag0F\">Home Depot reasons that in light of perceived \u201cambiguity,\u201d and without relying on the language of \u00a7 1445(c) or any other removal statute, the district court decided to remand. Home Depot labels that \u201cat best, a discretionary remand order without statutory authority\u201d and therefore reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Despite Home Depot\u2019s creative parsing, the remand was based on \u00a7 1445(c). The only ambiguity the court found was in whether that section precludes removal of suits like Ernewayn\u2019s. Because of the policy underlying \u00a7 1445(c) and this court\u2019s instruction that ambiguities in removal statutes should be construed against removal, the court construed \u00a7 1445(c) in favor of remand. We have no authority to review such remand orders, so the appeal is DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-13\">. <em>Manguno v.
