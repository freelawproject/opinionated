Upon a showing that plaintiff was a licensed broker, that defendant listed for sale with plaintiff exclusively for 30 days her certain real property, and that plaintiff obtained thereunder from Mr. and Mrs. Baker a written firm offer in accordance with the terms of the listing which was accepted by defendant, the trial court granted plaintiff a summary judgment against defendant. The holding in <em>Twogood </em>v. <em>Monnette, </em>191 Cal. 103 [215 P. 542], is to the effect that a broker employed to sell real or personal property has earned his commission when he has produced a person who is ready, willing and able to purchase the property on terms satisfactory to the seller, and has obtained a binding and valid contract for a sale on the terms proposed by the seller. (See, also, <em>Clements </em>v. Rankin, 83 Cal.App.2d 779, 786 [189 P.2d 725]; <em>Walter </em>v. <em>Libby, </em>72 Cal.App.2d 138, 142 [164 P.2d 21].)</p>\n<p id=\"b992-26\">The plaintiff, on making his motion for summary judgment, set out the above facts in his affidavit, and this would seem to support the summary judgment under section 437c of the Code of Civil Procedure unless defendant\u2019s affidavits, liberally construed, disclose an issue of fact to be tried <em>(Walsh </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>18 Cal.2d 439 [116 P.2d 62]; <em>Eagle Oil &amp; Refining Co. </em>v. <em>Prentice, </em>19 Cal.2d 553 [122 P.2d 264] ; <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Hibernia Sav. &amp; L. Soc., </em>23 Cal.2d 741 [146 P.2d 684]), in which latter event the motion should be denied. An examination of defendant\u2019s affidavits in resisting the motion discloses no fact which would defeat plaintiff\u2019s right, and in some respects strengthens plaintiff\u2019s showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-27\">Defendant averred that she had brought in superior court an action for specific performance against the purchasers, Mr. and Mrs. Baker, on the contract which resulted from defendant\u2019s acceptance of the Bakers\u2019 offer. Defendant also set out <em>in haec verba </em>the contract sued on by her, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 3\">*Supp. 3</page-number>the same contains a specific acknowledgment of a commission of $575 due plaintiff from defendant. The superior court action was dismissed with prejudice by defendant, April 23, 1952. Defendant contended on appeal that plaintiff\u2019s action should abate until decision in the superior court action. The point is mooted by defendant\u2019s dismissal, but we think plaintiff\u2019s right would exist independently of any outcome there. The contract upon which defendant sued the Bakers is admittedly the fruit of plaintiff\u2019s labors, but the action of specific performance may be defended on equitable considerations not pertinent to plaintiff\u2019s action. <em>(Kauffman, Inc. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>82 Cal.App.2d 302 [186 P.2d 11].) Defendant further undertook in her affidavit to show an agreement of compromise and settlement of plaintiff\u2019s claim for $50, which sum when offered was refused by plaintiff. The claimed agreement is unsupported by consideration, since the contract which resulted from defendant\u2019s acceptance of the Baker offer, unequivocally acknowledged the debt for commission to plaintiff in the sum of $575.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">It was alleged in the affidavits of Mr. and Mrs. Baker that they conferred with plaintiff on November 28, 1951, that he showed them another property on that date, and suggested to them that they might recover for use on the new purchase a sum of $1,500 which on August 18, 1951, had been deposited by them in escrow on the purchase of defendant\u2019s property. The Bakers were prepared so to testify. Neither of them avers that they were in any way influenced by the action to repudiate their contract with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">We find no fact averred in this connection to dirmuish or defeat plaintiff\u2019s claim. On November 28, 1951, plaintiff had fully performed according to the stipulations of his employment contract and his duty as a broker under the law, and defendant, according to her affidavit, was disputing the claim and seeldng to compromise it, but her affidavit gives us no material fact upon which she based her contention that the whole commission was not due. No other points are raised on appeal. We think the summary judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">Glen, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">Judge Turrentine, deeming himself disqualified, does not participate in the foregoing opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
