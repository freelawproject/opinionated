On appeal, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>petitioner claims that the trial court improperly concluded that he failed (1) to satisfy the threshold requirement of \u00a7 54-102kk (a) that \u201cthe evidence sought to be tested contains biological evidence\u201d and (2) to establish that a reasonable probability exists that he would not have been prosecuted or convicted if exculpatory results obtained through DNA testing had been available at his criminal trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Following a jury trial, the petitioner was convicted of assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (5), burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (1), risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53-21 and criminal possession of a firearm in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-217. <em>State </em>v. <em>Solman, </em>67 Conn. App. 235, 236, 786 A.2d 1184 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 917, 791 A.2d 568 (2002). On January 15, 1999, the court sentenced the petitioner to a total effective term of forty years imprisonment. The petitioner directly appealed to this court, and this court affirmed his conviction. Id., 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. \u201cIn September, 1997, the victim and his wife were employed at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Branford and became acquainted with the [petitioner], who was employed at a nearby Mobil gas station. The [petitioner\u2019s] nephew also was employed at the Mobil station and became friendly with the victim\u2019s wife. That friendship eventually progressed to the point where the victim felt that it was necessary to intervene and, accordingly, he told the [petitioner\u2019s] nephew to leave his wife alone. The victim\u2019s brother-in-law also confronted the nephew and recommended a curtailment of the relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"A2Z\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>\u201cShortly after midnight, on September 24, 1997, as he lay in bed with his wife and child, the victim heard a loud banging at the back door of their apartment. The victim walked to the kitchen to investigate the disturbance when the [petitioner] burst through the door and shot the victim several times before fleeing. Ten .22 caliber shell casings were found at the scene along with a live round. The [petitioner] was apprehended thereafter . . . .\u201d Id., 236-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">On June 3, 2010, the petitioner filed a postconviction petition for DNA testing of the live .22 caliber bullet recovered from the crime scene, pursuant to \u00a7 54-102kk. The petitioner alleged that the bullet was in evidence, it was capable of being subjected to DNA testing, it had not previously been subjected to DNA testing, and there was a reasonable probability that the petitioner would not have been prosecuted or convicted if exculpatory results had been obtained through DNA testing of the bullet.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">On June 30, 2010, the trial court held a hearing on the petition, during which counsel for the petitioner explained that the petitioner was seeking \u201ctouch DNA\u201d testing of the bullet to support his claim that the petitioner\u2019s nephew had committed the shooting, rather than the petitioner. Counsel for the petitioner described touch DNA testing as \u201ca procedure for testing really microscopic DNA evidence.\u201d Counsel further explained that \u201c[w]hen human beings touch objects, we leave skin cells on those objects.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>At the hearing, however, the petitioner stipulated that it was unlikely that the bullet actually contained any testable biological material. The stipulation submitted by the parties stated in relevant part: \u201c(5) It is possible that DNA evidence could be obtained from the live .22 caliber bullet that is in evidence. (6) There is a low probability that DNA evidence could be obtained from the live .22 caliber bullet that is in evidence. (7) There is a high probability that any relevant DNA evidence from the live .22 caliber bullet has been contaminated.\u201d Counsel for the petitioner stated on the record that the stipulation was based on information provided by a criminalist in the state police forensic science laboratory.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">Throughout the hearing, the court stated it was concerned that the petitioner failed to satisfy subsection (a) of \u00a7 54-102kk. Counsel for the petitioner responded by arguing that the statute does not require petitioners to \u201csay [with] absolute certainty\u201d that the evidence contains biological material because that would be impossible to establish without first conducting a DNA test of the evidence, and such a requirement would defeat the purpose of the statute. Instead, the petitioner contended that \u00a7 54-102kk (a) requires merely that the petition be filed in good faith.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court stated that it was satisfied that the petition was filed in good faith but explained that it would have to \u201cresearch whether I feel that it has to be established that the item contains biological evidence before I can proceed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">On July 6, 2010, the court denied the petition for DNA testing of the bullet. The order stated in relevant part: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>\u201c [The] [p] etitioner fails to satisfy the statutory condition that \u2018the evidence sought to be tested contains biological evidence.\u2019 Here, there is no evidence that the bullet contains biological evidence; only a \u2018possibility\u2019 that biological evidence could be obtained; and a \u2018high probability\u2019 that any such evidence obtained would be contaminated. ... If the above stated statutory language is to have any meaning, this petition must fail.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court erroneously concluded that he failed to satisfy \u00a7 54-102kk (a). The petitioner argues that, contrary to the trial court\u2019s analysis, \u00a7 54-102kk (a) merely requires that \u201cpetitions must be accompanied by statements under oath that the petitions are being filed in good faith.\u201d As a matter of first impression, we disagree with the petitioner that \u00a7 54-102kk (a) requires only a good faith assertion that the evidence contains biological material and conclude that the petition must be supported by a reasonable basis in fact. Accordingly, we conclude that the petitioner failed to satisfy this standard in light of the parties\u2019 stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">The petitioner\u2019s claim \u201cpresents a question of statutory construction, over which our review is plenary. . . . When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case .... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . The test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation. ... In addition, common sense must be used in statutory interpretation, and courts will assume that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Komondy </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>127 Conn. App. 669, 676, 16 A.3d 741 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">We begin our analysis with the language of the statute. Section 54-102kk (a) provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law governing postconviction relief, any person who was convicted of a crime and sentenced to incarceration may, at any time during the term of such incarceration, file a petition with the sentencing court requesting the DNA testing of any evidence that is in the possession or control of the Division of Criminal Justice, any law enforcement agency, any laboratory or the Superior Court. <em>The petitioner shall state under penalties of perjury </em>that the requested testing is related to the investigation or prosecution that resulted in the petitioner\u2019s conviction and <em>that the evidence sought to be tested contains biological evidence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Subsections (b) and (c) delineate the substantive requirements that a petitioner must meet in order to actually obtain DNA testing, namely, establishing that there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>the petitioner would not have been prosecuted or convicted, or that the verdict or sentence would have been different, if the testing had been conducted before trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dupigney, </em>295 Conn. 50, 64, 988 A.2d 851 (2010) (construing \u201c \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 \u201d requirement under \u00a7 54-102kk [b] [1] to mean \u201ca probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\u201d of the underlying conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">The petitioner contends that \u00a7 54-102kk (a) cannot be read to require petitioners \u201cto state under oath that microscopic biological material is definitely present on particular evidence . . . .\u201d According to the petitioner, this requirement would frustrate the purpose of the statute, which \u201cis to provide a mechanism to allow inmates to obtain DNA testing of biological evidence to prove they are innocent.\u201d The petitioner argues that because subsections (b) and (c) already contain substantive requirements for obtaining DNA testing, an additional condition mandating scientific certainty would impose too high a bar on petitioners and, thus, could not have been intended by the legislature. Additionally, the petitioner argues that such a requirement would encourage perjury because a petitioner would not be able to guarantee that evidence contains biological material prior to the actual DNA test, especially when seeking touch DNA testing. Rather, the petitioner argues that \u00a7 54-102kk (a) simply requires that the petitions be filed in good faith. The state argues that the statute clearly and unambiguously requires that the petitioner provide a threshold statement that the evidence contains biological material, which, according to the state, the petitioner failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">As directed by \u00a7 l-2z, we must determine whether the language of \u00a7 54-102kk (a) is plain and unambiguous and does not lead to unworkable results. As a preliminary matter, we find that the language of \u00a7 54-102kk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>(a) is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation. It is unclear from the face of the statute whether, for example, a petitioner satisfies this requirement by simply stating that the petitioner has a good faith belief that biological material is present; by stating that the petitioner is certain that biological material is definitely present; or by making some preliminary showing supported by facts. See <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>New Milford Hospital, Inc., </em>300 Conn. 1, 15, 12 A.3d 865 (2011) (noting \u201cthe relatively low threshold necessary to establish ambiguity for purposes of statutory interpretation, namely, the existence of more than one \u2018reasonable\u2019 reading for the statute\u201d). Therefore, in accordance with \u00a7 l-2z, we may consider extratextual guidance in our search to ascertain the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">In light of principles of statutory construction and the legislative policy behind \u00a7 54-102kk, we conclude that the petitioner\u2019s proposed good faith standard could not have been intended by the legislature. It is axiomatic that \u201cthe legislature did not intend to enact meaningless provisions. . . . Accordingly, care must be taken to effectuate all provisions of the statute. . . . [Statutes must be construed, if possible, such that no clause, sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Zoning Board of Appeals </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>66 Conn. App. 279, 285, 784 A.2d 383 (2001). The petitioner\u2019s good faith standard would reduce the language of \u00a7 54-102kk (a) requiring that \u201cthe evidence sought to be tested contains biological evidence\u201d to mere surplusage. We conclude that by including this language, the legislature intended to create a requirement that there be a factual basis to conclude that biological material is present on the evidence prior to testing. A good faith standard creates an insufficient threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Dupigney, </em>supra, 295 Conn. 64-67, our Supreme Court, in construing \u00a7 54-102kk (b) (1), identified the various policy interests related to the statute. After explaining that the statute was enacted as part of a broader piece of legislation \u201cintended to use DNA testing both to better identify and punish offenders as well as to prevent wrongful convictions\u201d; id., 64-65; the court linked the statute to a \u201cnationwide movement\u201d; id., 65; of postconviction DNA testing legislation. Id., 65-66. The court noted that, in order to \u201creconcile . . . competing interests, legislatures have imposed various threshold showings . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 67. Among the important state interests that conditioning access to DNA evidence serves are \u201crespect for the finality of court judgments and the efficient use of limited state resources.\u201d Id., 66. The interest in the efficient use of state resources is especially applicable in a situation like this case, where the petitioner seeks touch DNA testing of a physical object recovered from the crime scene. We agree with the trial court that a standard like the one the petitioner proposes would deprive the statute of meaning and would require that virtually every piece of evidence in the state\u2019s possession be subjected to DNA testing, provided the petitioner could satisfy subsection (b) or (c) of \u00a7 54-102kk. See footnote 4 of this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">We agree with the petitioner, however, that a construction of the statute requiring petitioners to state with certainty that the evidence sought to be tested contains biological material would lead to unworkable results and, thus, also could not have been intended by the legislature. It would be impossible for petitioners to be sure that biological material is present without conducting an extensive inquiry. Accordingly, petitioners willing to risk perjury would satisfy \u00a7 54-102kk (a), while honest petitioners would not. Therefore, \u201c[mjindful that we must avoid a construction that fails to attain a rational and sensible result\u201d; <em>Komondy </em>v. <em>Zoning </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number><em>Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 127 Conn. App. 683; we reject a construction that would require petitioners to state that biological material is incontrovertibly present. We recognize, in light of the purpose of the statute, that the threshold requirement of \u00a7 54-102kk (a) should not be unduly demanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">In accordance with the above analysis, we conclude that in order to satisfy \u00a7 54-102kk (a), a petitioner must make a preliminary showing supported by a reasonable basis in fact that the evidence sought to be tested likely contains biological material.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We trust our trial courts to evaluate the facts and circumstances presented on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">Applying this standard to the present case, we conclude that the petitioner falls short. As noted, the stipulation submitted by the parties to the trial court stated that \u201c[t]here is a low probability that DNA evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>could be obtained from the live .22 caliber bullet that is in evidence\u201d and \u201ca high probability that any relevant DNA evidence from the live .22 caliber bullet has been contaminated.\u201d While the stipulation was based on information provided by someone knowledgeable as to DNA evidence,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the contents of the statements provide inadequate support for the assertion that the bullet contains biological material which could be tested for DNA, as required by \u00a7 54-102kk (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">To the extent that the petitioner argues that there is a possibility that the bullet contains biological material because the bullet had to have been touched by someone; see footnote 4 of this opinion; we note that a petitioner\u2019s contention \u201cmust rest upon more than surmise or conjecture. ... A trier is not concerned with possibilities but with reasonable probabilities.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Milliun </em>v. <em>New Milford Hospital, </em>129 Conn. App. 81, 100, 20 A.3d 36, cert. granted on other grounds, 302 Conn. 920, 28 A.3d 338 (2011); see also <em>Curran </em>v. <em>Kroll, </em>118 Conn. App. 401, 410, 984 A.2d 763 (2009) (\u201c[i]nferences should be based on probabilities, not possibilities, surmise, or conjecture\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. granted on other grounds, 295 Conn. 915, 990 A.2d 866 (2010); <em>Daigles.

We therefore conclude that the trial court properly determined that the petitioner failed to satisfy \u00a7 54-102kk (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b871-11\"> If a petitioner satisfies subsection (a) of \u00a7 54-102kk, then the petitioner also must satisfy either subsection (b) or subsection (c) to be entitled to DNA testing of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b872-8\"> Because we affirm the court\u2019s finding that the petitioner did not satisfy the threshold requirement of \u00a7 54-102kk (a), we need not address the petitioner\u2019s second claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b873-8\"> A stipulation entered into by the petitioner and the state also described touch DNA testing as follows: \u201c(1) \u2018Touch DNA\u2019 testing involves the testing of biological evidence sometimes left on objects when someone touches an object. (2) The Connecticut State Police Forensic Science Laboratory has had the technology to conduct \u2018touch DNA\u2019 testing since 1998. (3) The Connecticut State Police Forensic Science Laboratory has been authorized to conduct \u2018touch DNA\u2019 testing for cases since 1999.

The court recognized, however, that such a reading \u201ccould lead to the deprivation of DNA testing in the rare case simply because of the inability to ascertain whether or not biological material exists.\u201d Id. The court then stated that an appellant must \u201cprovide facts in support of his motion\u201d; id.; and that \u201ca mere assertion or a general claim that existence of biological material is probable will fail to satisfy the appellant\u2019s burden.\u201d Id.
