We conclude that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to grant the permanent injunction and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>issue the order, and we affirm the well considered judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The parties stipulated to the relevance of certain facts and exhibits, which the trial court considered. The court also considered testimony, given at a hearing on whether to grant the permanent injunction, of three witnesses, namely, the executive director of the plaintiff, the former first selectman of the town of Ridgefield (town), and the current chairman of the defendant. The plaintiff introduced into evidence statutory histories of municipal sewer systems, the power and authority of water pollution control authorities and PILOT (payment in lieu of taxes) payments by local housing authorities. Also in evidence was a 1976 PILOT agreement between the plaintiff and the town.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In its memorandum of decision, the trial court found certain facts, which are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Beginning in 1988, the state department of environmental protection ordered the town to expand its sewerage system plant. Legal counsel to the town advised the first selectman concerning different options to raise the necessary capital to recover the costs of the sewer plant expansion. In 1992, the defendant published legal notices and heard public comment regarding various plans to allocate the costs of the loan repayment needed to fund the expansion. On April 8, 1992, the defendant adopted a plan, which provided for a yearly loan repayment of $445,850 to be paid by sewer users, plus $126,000 to be paid by future users, plus $78,150 to be paid from general revenues. Incorporated into this capital cost recovery plan was the fee at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The plaintiff, as a public housing authority, is subject to certain legislation, referred to as PILOT, or \u201cpayment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>in lieu of taxes\u201d statutes; see General Statutes \u00a7 8-119gg;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which legislation is designed to address the balance between a housing authority\u2019s limited revenue stream, the contributions it makes to a community and the need to pay for municipal services. Pursuant to \u00a7 8-119gg, instead of \u201creal property taxes, special benefit assessments and sewerage system use charges otherwise payable to a municipality,\u201d the plaintiff housing authority \u201cshall pay each year ... a sum to be determined by the municipality,\u201d as limited by the statute. The town entered into a PILOT agreement with the plaintiff executed in 1976, which, pursuant to the statute, provides in relevant part that \u201cthe town of Ridge-field has determined that the [plaintiff] shall pay to said municipality in lieu of property taxes, special benefit assessments and sewerage system use charges the sum of ten percent (10%) of the shelter rent paid by tenants for each occupied dwelling unit of the Project and the [plaintiff] agrees to make the [town] such payment in lieu of taxes, assessments and charges.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We will refer to this as the \u201cPILOT cap.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The plaintiff constructed four new buildings for low income housing in the town, each with five housing apartment units. The defendant\u2019s approval was required before certificates of occupancy of the units could issue. In 2007, the plaintiff applied to the defendant for a \u201cSewer Hookup/Connection Permit\u201d for each building. The defendant assessed a fee of $5700 per unit, for a total of $114,000 for the twenty unit development. The fee could be paid in a lump sum, or over a ten year period with an interest charge on the declining balance. The plaintiff has paid installments, including interest, to the defendant and has obtained the certificates of occupancy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The primary dispute between the parties is whether the disputed fee is a \u201cconnection fee,\u201d which is excluded from the PILOT cap, or whether it is actually a special benefit assessment, which is subject to the PILOT cap. Part of this disagreement arises out of the parties\u2019 conflicting interpretation of two statutes, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-255 and 7-249, which pertain to how the defendant may raise revenue. Section 7-255<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> relates to the \u201cfair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>and reasonable charges\u201d that a water pollution control authority may establish and revise \u201cfor connection with and for the use of a sewerage system.\u201d The plaintiff does not claim that it is exempt from paying connection charges. Section 7-249<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> concerns when a water pollution control authority may levy special benefit assessments on lands and buildings that are, in the judgment of the \u201cmunicipality,\u201d \u201cespecially benefited\u201d by the construction of a sewerage system. The plaintiff claims that the PILOT cap would apply. The defendant does not dispute that the fee was adopted to pay for 14 percent of the capital project cost of the sewer expansion. It maintains, however, that the fee is a sewer connection fee that was established pursuant to \u00a7 7-255 and that, because it was not calculated or levied as a special benefit assessment pursuant to \u00a7 7-249, it is not subject to the PILOT cap.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>The trial court concluded that, despite the defendant\u2019s label, the \u201chookup/connection\u201d fee was in actuality an assessment, not a connection fee, and as such, subject to the PILOT cap. The court concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to a permanent injunction enjoining the defendant from seeking further payments of the fee and that the defendant must refund to the plaintiff the sewerage payments made in excess of \u201ca fair and reasonable connection fee.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The defendant claims that the plaintiff failed to follow statutory administrative remedies available to it pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 7-255 and 7-246a, and, therefore, that the trial court was without subject matter jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs cause of action. Without such subject matter jurisdiction, the defendant argues that the plaintiffs action should have been dismissed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In essence, the defendant is arguing that the plaintiffs action cannot be a substitute for administrative appeals as provided by the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">As a threshold matter, we address our standard of review. \u201cWe have long held that because [a] determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>is a question of law, our review is plenary. . . . Moreover, [i]t is a fundamental rule that a court may raise and review the issue of subject matter jurisdiction at anytime. . . . Subject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of the court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it. . . . [A] court lacks discretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is without jurisdiction . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bloomfield </em>v. <em>United Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers of America, Connecticut Independent Police Union, Local 14, </em>285 Conn. 278, 286, 939 A.2d 561 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\u201cIt is a settled principle of administrative law that, if an adequate administrative remedy exists, it must be exhausted before the Superior Court will obtain jurisdiction to act in the matter. . . . This requirement reflects the legislative intent that such issues be handled in the first instance by local administrative officials in order to provide aggrieved persons with full and adequate administrative relief, and to give the reviewing court the benefit of the local board\u2019s judgment.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) O <em>&amp; G Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning </em>&amp; <em>Zoning Commission, </em>232 Conn. 419, 425, 655 A.2d 1121 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 7-255</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">The defendant first claims that the fee was adopted pursuant to the strictures of \u00a7 7-255 (a) and that the statute provides an administrative remedy to aggrieved parties, which the plaintiff failed to follow. The defendant maintains that none of the narrow exceptions to the exhaustion requirement apply here. The plaintiff argues that, even if this claim is reviewable as one that implicates subject matter jurisdiction, it is plain that the plaintiff had no administrative remedy under \u00a7 7-255. We conclude that \u00a7 7-255 did not deprive the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>court of subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The following additional facts are relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim. In 1992, pursuant to \u00a7 7-255, the defendant published legal notices and heard public comment regarding various plans to allocate the costs of the loan repayment of the state mandated expansion of the sewer treatment plant. On April 8,1992, the defendant adopted its plan to pay for the annual capital cost of $650,000 for the sewer plant expansion. On April 20, 1992, a copy of the charges that the defendant adopted was filed in the office of the town clerk. On April 23, 1992, legal notice was published according to the requirements of \u00a7 7-255.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Section 7-255 (a) allows a water pollution control authority such as the defendant to establish \u201cfair and reasonable charges for connection with and for the use of a sewerage system\u201d and provides that no such charge can be established without proper adherence to the notice and public hearing requirements set forth. Section 7-255 (a) further provides that an appeal must be taken within twenty-one days from the filing of sewer connection charges in the office of the town clerk. The essence of the defendant\u2019s claim is that, because the plaintiff was a landowner in the town in 1992, it can be charged with notice of the fee. It therefore failed to exhaust its administrative remedy because it did not challenge the imposition of the $5700 charge for \u201cfuture hook ups\u201d as outlined in the schedule of charges within twenty-one days of April 20, 1992, the date that a copy of the charges adopted by the defendant were filed in the office of the town clerk.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>We do not need to address the defendant\u2019s arguments concerning the exceptions to the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement because we conclude that the requirement does not apply to this case. Cf. <em>Forest Walk, LLC </em>v. <em>Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>291 Conn. 271, 283, 968 A.2d 345 (2009) (noting that parties seeking to appeal from \u201cdenials of applications for sewer connections or extensions had to exhaust certain administrative remedies prior to appeal\u201d before legislature enacted \u00a7 7-246a), citing <em>BRT General Corp. </em>v. <em>Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>265 Conn. 114, 116\u201427, 826 A.2d 1109 (2003); <em>River Bend Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>262 Conn. 84, 86-87, 809 A.2d 492 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Insofar as the defendant\u2019s claim can be read as an argument concerning the <em>timeliness </em>of the plaintiffs challenge to the fee, we are not persuaded that the twenty-one day appeal period of \u00a7 7-255 (a) barred the trial court from considering the plaintiffs claim in this case. The purpose of the exhaustion requirement is to further the legislative intent that certain issues be addressed first by local administrative officials. This purpose would not be served by dismissing the plaintiffs action because the plaintiffs complaint does not evince a dispute over the schedule of fees that the defendant adopted in 1992. Rather, the plaintiffs complaint evinces a disagreement between the parties concerning the applicability of the PILOT cap to the fee assessed attendant to the \u201chookup/connection\u201d of the plaintiffs property to the town\u2019s sewerage system. The plaintiff first applied for those permits in 2007. The disagreement did not exist in 1992.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>conclude that \u00a7 7-255 did not deprive the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 7-246a</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The defendant claims that the plaintiff failed to exhaust the remedies arguably available to it pursuant to \u00a7 7-246a.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The plaintiff responds that, by its terms, \u00a7 7-246a does not apply to the present case. We conclude that \u00a7 7-246a did not deprive the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The following additional facts are relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim. On March 13, 2007, in a letter to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>defendant, the plaintiff claimed that the fees assessed on its applications for \u201cSewer Hookup/Connection Permit\u00eds]\u201d did not apply to it because of the PILOT cap. The defendant, at its regular meeting, disagreed and found that the fees were due. No appeal to the Superior Court was taken from that decision pursuant to \u00a7 7-246a, which incorporates the familiar fifteen day administrative appeal procedure outlined in General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (b).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">We note that when a water pollution control authority performs its administrative functions, such as considering an application for sewer service, \u201ca reviewing court\u2019s standard of review of the [authority\u2019s] action is limited to whether it was illegal, arbitrary or in abuse of [its] discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Forest Walk, LLC v. Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>supra, 291 Conn. 286. In the present case, the trial court was presented with a dispute over whether the PILOT cap applied to the \u201cconnection/hookup\u201d payment sought by the defendant. This legal question of statutory interpretation is not one to which this court needs to accord deference to an agency. See id. (court defers to water pollution control authority on \u201ccredibility of witnesses and the determinations of issues of fact\u201d). Moreover, \u00a7 7-246a (a), by its terms, applies to applications or requests for, inter alia, \u201capproval to hook up to a sewer system at the expense of the applicant . . . .\u201d The defendant concedes in its principal brief that the plaintiffs request was \u201cto hook up to the [town] sewer system at a cost lower than [that] paid by other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>users . . . For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the application of \u00a7 7-246a did not deprive the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Having concluded that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to consider the merits of the plaintiffs claims, we next discuss the disposition of the defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">MERITS OF THE JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">We set forth the principles of law that guide our analysis and our standard of review of the trial court\u2019s judgment. The plaintiff commenced this action seeking a permanent injunction enjoining the defendant from collecting the connection fee and a \u201cpermanent injunction requiring [the defendant] to refund all payments made by the [plaintiff] in excess of a fair and reasonable connection fee,\u201d which relief the court granted. Injunctive relief is warranted when the party seeking it meets the burden of alleging and proving irreparable harm and lack of an adequate remedy at law. <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Brennan Associates, </em>293 Conn. 60, 86, 977 A.2d 107 (2009). The granting of an injunction rests within the sound discretion of the court and the court\u2019s ruling can be reviewed \u201conly for the purpose of determining whether the decision was based on an erroneous statement of law or an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 86-87. To the extent that the claims in this appeal require us to construe the relevant statutes, we note that the construction of a statute is a question of law subject to plenary review. See id., 87. \u201cIn examining the meaning of a particular statute, we are guided by fundamental principles of statutory construction. See General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> see also <em>Testa </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>v. <em>Geressy, </em>286 Conn. 291, 308, 943 A.2d 1075 (2008) ([w]hen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature . . .).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Shorten </em>v. <em>Cavanagh, </em>300 Conn. 383, 386-87, 15 A.3d 1042 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The primary dispute between the parties is whether the trial court properly determined that the disputed fee was a special benefit assessment, which the plaintiff would be exempt from paying pursuant to the PILOT cap, and, accordingly, whether the court properly issued the permanent injunction and ordered repayment to the plaintiff of any payment that it had made to the defendant in excess of a fair and reasonable connection fee. The defendant claims that the disputed fee properly was adopted pursuant to \u00a7 7-255 and that the plaintiff is not exempt from paying \u201cfair and reasonable charges for connection with and for the use of a sewerage system. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-255 (a). The plaintiffs argument is that the defendant\u2019s method of financing its sewerage expansion in 1992 was in contravention of the sewer system statutes. Specifically, the plaintiff maintains that \u00a7 7-249, the special benefit assessment statute, is the <em>exclusive </em>method that the defendant can use to recoup the cost of financing the sewage plant expansion, and that the defendant has \u201cavoided\u201d the statutory scheme by adopting the disputed fee in the manner that it did. The defendant, in response, argues that nothing in the case law or statutory scheme <em>prohibits </em>a municipality from using sewer connection charges to aid it in financing the expansion of a sewage treatment plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The defendant argues that the trial court improperly characterized the fee as a special benefit assessment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>It maintains that the fee is not akin to a special benefit assessment because, when it was adopted, no regard was given to the special benefit that accrued to any property in the town, including the plaintiffs property, nor would any property be charged the fee if it did not actually connect to the system. In response, the plaintiff maintains that there are indicia that the disputed fee is really a special benefit assessment by another name. For example, it is undisputed that the fee was imposed to recover 14 percent of the capital costs associated with the sewage treatment plant, and the defendant allows installment payments and charges interest on the declining balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The determinative issue presented to this court is much narrower than the claims asserted by the parties. The question to be resolved by us is whether the PILOT agreement between the plaintiff and the town and the PILOT statute, \u00a7 8-119gg, exempted the plaintiff from paying the disputed fee.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If the plaintiff is exempt, it is entitled to the injunctive relief ordered and is also entitled to the refund ordered by the trial court. The PILOT agreement, which incorporates the language of \u00a7 8-119gg, provides that the plaintiff shall pay the PILOT cap \u201cin lieu of property taxes, special benefit assessments and sewerage system use charges . . . .\u201d At issue is the meaning and application of the term \u201cspecial benefit assessment\u201d in the context of the PILOT statute and agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u201cSpecial assessments for local improvements, although bottomed on the taxing power, are based on the principle of special benefit to property. It is a local assessment imposed occasionally, as required, upon a limited class of persons interested in a local improvement; who are assumed to be benefitted by the improvement to the extent of the assessment .... <em>Bridgeport </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>v. <em>New York &amp; N.H. R Co., </em>36 Conn. 255, 262-63 (1869). The demand for the special contribution is justified by the fact that those who are to make it, while they are made to bear the cost of the public work, are supposed to suffer no pecuniary loss thereby, because their property is increased in value to an amount at least equal to the sum they are required to pay.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Shoreline Care Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>North Branford, </em>231 Conn. 344, 350-51, 650 A.2d 142 (1994). Our Supreme Court has concluded that a property can be specially benefited by a sewerage system, and therefore subject to an assessment, even if it does not actually connect to the system. See id., 351-52. The measure of the special benefit is the increase in the market value of the property because of the improvement. Id., 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">It is accepted that, because special benefit assessments levied may not exceed the special benefit that accrues to the property from the installation or presence of a sewerage system, the use of a special benefit assessment to fund the improvement may mean that the cost of the sewerage system cannot be fully recouped by the town. Id., 352; <em>Bridge Street Associates </em>v. <em>Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>15 Conn. App. 140, 144, 543 A.2d 1351 (1988); see also <em>Carlson-Lang Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Windom, </em>307 Minn. 368, 373, 240 N.W.2d 517 (1976) (\u201c[t]he legal limit on special assessments is that they may not exceed the increase in market value of the assessed property, and as a practical matter this means many improvements may not be fully assessed but must be funded through some other means, such as general property taxes\u201d). It follows, as posited by the defendant, that this shortfall must come from \u201csomewhere.\u201d In <em>Cyr v. Coventry, </em>216 Conn. 436, 441, 582 A.2d 452 (1990), our Supreme Court, in dicta, noted that a municipality has available to it \u201cnumerous means of funding [a] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>sewer project\u201d other than levying special benefit assessments, citing, inter alia, \u201c\u00a7 7-255 (a) (connection and use charges) . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">We accept the defendant\u2019s premise that the town had available a variety of means of funding a sewer expansion. These included increasing real property taxes and building debt service into the connection fee and use charges. It does not necessarily follow, however, that how the defendant chose to structure its debt controls whether the plaintiff, as a public housing authority, is hable to pay for the funding. The PILOT statute and PILOT agreement exempt the plaintiff from certain charges otherwise payable to the town. \u201c[L]ocal housing authorities do not operate for a profit and . . . to minimize their expenses and enable them to provide moderate rental housing within the financial reach of families of low income ... a reduction in their property tax burdens (including special benefit assessments and sewerage system use charges) was necessary while still balancing the municipality\u2019s need for revenue to provide services to the authority.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) See Opinions, Conn. Atty. Gen. No. 84-128 (November 15, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Costs of sewer expansion can be recouped in a number of ways, including special benefit assessments and general property tax revenue, both of which are subject to the PILOT cap. As found by the trial court, one of the proposed methods of funding the expansion was a \u201cyearly loan repayment . . . from general tax revenues,\u201d which was rejected. The fee was adopted pursuant to \u00a7 7-255, which governs \u201cconnection fees\u201d and which fees are not expressly subject to the PILOT cap. It is undisputed that the $5700 per unit fee was adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>to pay for 14 percent of the capital cost of the sewer expansion and that the fee is only charged to new users of the system when they connect. The defendant\u2019s position is that the method it chose to recoup its costs controls the question of whether the plaintiff must pay the fee. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">The clear purpose of the disputed fee was to shift some of the burden of paying for the upgrade to the system onto new users of the system, by which the defendant and the town avoided the need to assess special benefits and to raise property taxes. Because the plaintiff seeks equitable relief, we are not constrained to conclude that the title or name that the defendant applies to the fee and the method by which it adopted the fee govern the outcome of this dispute. It would be unjust to allow the defendant to circumvent the PILOT cap by denominating as \u201cconnection fees\u201d sums that would otherwise be subject to the cap.</p>\n<p id=\"ANqu\">The court correctly concluded that the purpose of \u00a7 8-119gg, which applies to low income housing projects such as the one operated by the plaintiff, is to control the expenses of municipal housing authorities by putting a cap on certain payments, such as special benefit assessments, property taxes and sewage usage charges. We also agree with the trial court that the name that the defendant applies to the fee does not override the statutory protection afforded to the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 8-119gg. This is particularly true when the defendant has admitted that the \u201cconnection fee\u201d was not imposed simply to connect to the sewerage system, but to repay the capital costs incurred as a result of the increased usage by the plaintiff. We agree with the trial court that this is the type of fee that the legislature intended to exempt the plaintiff from paying.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\"> The trial court concluded that the agreement bound the town and bound the defendant as a creation of the town.

The trial court found that the defendant was a municipality for the purposes of \u00a7 8-119gg. The court noted that \u201c[i]t would defeat the purpose and intent of \u00a7 8-119gg to control the expenses of a housing authority if the municipality could exempt itself from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>that statute by operating its sewer operations through a town sewer authority.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b280-7\"> The plaintiff has paid to the defendant $25,878 in fees and interest to date in order to obtain certificates of occupancy and to permit families to move into the housing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b280-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 7-255 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe water pollution control authority may establish and revise fair and reasonable charges for connection with and for the use of a sewerage system. The owner of property against which any such connection or use charge is levied shall be liable for the payment thereof. Municipally-owned and other tax-exempt property which uses the sewerage system shall be subject to such charges under the same conditions as are the owners of other property, but nothing herein shall be deemed to authorize the levying of any property tax by any municipality against any property exempt by the general statutes from property taxation. No charge for connection with or for the use of a sewerage system shall be established or revised until after a public hearing before the water pollution control authority at which the owner of property against which the charges are to be levied shall have an opportunity to be heard concerning the proposed charges.

It appears that the defendant advanced its first argument regarding \u00a7 7-255 in its trial brief and raises the second regarding \u00a7 7-246a for the first time on appeal. The question, however, of whether a trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to render judgment may be raised at any time, including on appeal. <em>Ajadi </em>v. <em>Commissioner of </em>Correction, 280 Conn. 514, 532-33, 911 A.2d 712 (2006). A challenge to subject matter jurisdiction is to be decided on the basis of the complaint alone, or the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts, or, if the facts are disputed, on the basis of an evidentiary hearing to establish jurisdictional facts. <em>Conboy </em>v. <em>State, </em>292 Conn. 642, 651-52, 974 A.2d 669 (2009). In the present case, the facts relating to subject matter jurisdiction are undisputed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 7-255 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen the water pollution control authority has established or revised such charges, it shall file a copy thereof in the office of the clerk of the municipality . . . .

At oral argument before this court, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>defendant addressed the anomaly inherent in its position that the plaintiff failed to exhaust its remedy pursuant to this section, which was an appeal to the Superior Court, by asserting that the same court, the Superior Court in the present action did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter. The defendant\u2019s position was that the distinction between an administrative appeal and a direct appeal is, in the latter, it is the court, and not the agency, which hears live testimony and makes determinations of credibility. Whether or not this is true, it is well established that \u201cwhen a party has a statutory right of appeal from the decision of an administrative agency, he may not, instead of appealing, bring an independent action to test the very issue which the appeal was designed to test.\u201d <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>176 Conn. 581, 598, 409 A.2d 1029 (1979). We conclude that this independent action does not test the very issue that the statutory appeal was designed to test because this action concerns the applicability of the PILOT agreement and statutes to the fee charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b286-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 7-246a provides: \u201c(a) Whenever an application or request is made to a water pollution control authority or sewer district for (1) a determination of the adequacy of sewer capacity related to a proposed use of land, (2) approval to hook up to a sewer system at the expense of the applicant, or (3) approval of any other proposal for wastewater treatment or disposal at the expense of the applicant, the water pollution control authority or sewer district shall make a decision on such application or request within sixty-five days from the date of receipt, as defined in subsection (c) of section 8-7d, of such application or request.
