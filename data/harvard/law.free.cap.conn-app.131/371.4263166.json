Baxter, appeals from the judgment of the trial court rendered in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>plaintiff, the Bohormon Law Firm, LLC, on its complaint against the defendant for, inter alia, breach of contract for legal services. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly: (1) denied his motion to dismiss, (2) denied his motion to open the default, (3) curtailed his defense as to damages, (4) awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff and (5) failed to protect his right to due process of law. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">The following facts and very detailed procedural history<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are relevant to our consideration of the defendant\u2019s claims on appeal. After successfully securing an order for prejudgment remedy in the amount of $20,000 against the defendant, the plaintiff directed a marshal of the county of New London to summon the defendant. The plaintiff did not use the standard civil summons, form JD-CV-1. Rather, the plaintiff prepared its own writ of summons, which provided: \u201cBy the authority of the state of Connecticut, you are hereby commanded to Attach and Garnish to the value of TWENTY THOUSAND Dollars ($20,000) in the goods or estate of JOHN H. BAXTER (69 NECK RD., OLD LYME, CONNECTICUT) and summon her/him/it/them to Appear before the Superior Court for the New Haven Judicial District at New Haven on or before the 23 day of DECEMBER, 2008,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> said Appearance to be made by the/each defendant or her/his/its/their attorney, by filing a written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>statement of Appearance with the Clerk of said Court on or before the second day following said Return Date, then and there to answer unto BOHONNON LAW FIRM L.L.C, a duly authorized Connecticut limited liability company maintaining a principal place of business in New Haven, Connecticut, in a civil action wherein the plaintiff complains and says . . . The plaintiffs three count complaint immediately follows the writ of summons, beginning on the same page. On the third page of the document, the plaintiff sets forth its claims for relief and states: \u201cOf this Writ, with your doings thereon, make due Service and Return. Dated at New Haven, Connecticut, this 5 day of December, 2008.\u201d The signature of Joshua H. Brown, Commissioner of the Superior Court, is affixed, and the address and telephone number of his law firm are listed, as is his juris number.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>On December 8, 2008, state marshal Neil Feinberg attested that he had attached all of the right, title and interest of John H. Baxter in 69 Neck Road, Old Lyme. Included on that document is a description of 69 Neck Road and the following further attestation: \u201cand on the 8th day of said December A.D., 2008,1 left in said Town Clerk\u2019s office in the Town of Old Lyme the original certificate of attachment with my endorsement thereon. And I also on the 8th day of said Dec. 2008 left a like true and attested copy of this application, order, affidavit and writ [of] summons, complaint and entire process, with my endorsement thereon ... at the usual place of abode of John H. Baxter, 69 Neck Road, Old Lyme, Connfecticut], said Defendant . . . .\u201d The return of service was filed with the court on December 11, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">On December 30, 2008, the plaintiff filed a motion for default for failure to appear, and, on January 9, 2009, the defendant\u2019s counsel filed an appearance. On January 23, 2009, the plaintiff filed a motion for default for failure to plead, which the clerk granted on February 5, 2009. The defendant filed a motion to open the default, #104, and a motion to discharge attachment, also #104, on February 19, 2009, and he filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, #105, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>at the same time.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant asserted in the motions that the writ of summons and complaint were never returned to the court. He further asserted that the only documents properly returned to the court were those for the prejudgment remedy, which contained an October 24, 2008 return day. See footnote 2 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">On February 20, 2009, the court sent out a \u201ccorrected order\u201d stating that the motion for default for failure to plead was denied because \u201cno return of writ was filed.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant alleges, however, that on February 26, 2009, the court sent another notice to the parties, stating that the corrected order was in error and that the default for failure to plead properly had been entered on February 5, 2009.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On March 10, 2009, the plaintiff filed a certificate of closed pleadings, claiming a hearing in damages. On March 26, 2009, the defendant again filed a motion to open the default, #109, and a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, #110. On April 23, 2009, the plaintiff filed an objection to the motion to dismiss. On May 11, 2009, the court held a hearing on the motion to dismiss and ruled that the marshal properly had made service, that the return day was December 23, 2008,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that the complaint and other documents were returned to the court on December 11, 2008. Accordingly, the court sustained the plaintiffs objection and denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">On May 13, 2009, the plaintiff filed an objection to the defendant\u2019s motion to open the default. On May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>15, 2009, the court ordered the case stricken from the inventory of cases for hearings in damages. On June 9, 2009, the court overruled without prejudice the plaintiffs May 13, 2009 objection to the motion to open the default, stating that it would reconsider the objection if the defendant failed to file his answer, with special defenses or counterclaims, if any, within seven calendar days. The record indicates that the clerk\u2019s office sent notice of this decision to the defendant\u2019s counsel on June 10,2009. On July 14,2009, the plaintiff filed another certificate of closed pleadings, and the court scheduled the matter for a September 9, 2009 hearing in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">On September 4, 2009, the defendant filed a motion entitled \u201cMotion to Correct Status of Pleadings, for Rectification of Court File and for Removal from Trial List.\u201d He also filed an affidavit in which counsel averred, inter alia, that he had never received notice of the court\u2019s June 9, 2009 ruling, in which the court gave the defendant seven days to file his answer. On September 9, 2009, the defendant filed his answer. Dining the hearing in damages held that day, the defendant argued that the court should set aside the default. In a February 5, 2010 memorandum of decision, the court stated that it would not reconsider the February 5, 2009 default, and it rendered judgment in the amount of $19,376.69, together with costs, in favor of the plaintiff. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly denied his motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant argues: \u201cThe process that was served upon [the] defendant was defective in that it failed to establish a return date. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>failed to be returned within [six] days of a return date and it failed to be served at least [twelve] days before a return date. Therefore, the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this action.\u201d He further argues that \u201cprejudgment remedy documents are insufficient to commence an action. ... [In this case] [t]he writ of summons and complaint are not sufficient... to commence an action.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Although the defendant argues that his claim implicates the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim implicates the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction over the defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Hillman </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>217 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Conn. 520, 526, 587 A.2d 99 (1991) (failure to comply with statutory prerequisite to commencement of civil action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-45a<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> implicates personal jurisdiction over defendant). Furthermore, we conclude that the defendant, by filing his motion to dismiss more than thirty days after the filing of his appearance, has waived any claim regarding lack of personal jurisdiction in this case. See footnote 9 of this opinion; <em>Pitched v. Hartford, </em>247 Conn. 422, 432-33, 722 A.2d 797 (1999) (claim of lack of jurisdiction over person as result of insufficiency of service of process is waived unless raised by motion to dismiss within thirty days after filing appearance).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The defendant next claims that the court abused its discretion in not opening the default for failure to plead. The defendant argues that \u201c[t]he granting, opening, mislogging of [the] motion to dismiss and regranting of the motion for default, despite the motion to dismiss, has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>deprived the defendant of his right to plead. It implicates the defendant\u2019s due process rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It also establishes good cause to open the default.\u201d The plaintiff argues that the court did not abuse its discretion in declining to open the default because the defendant had failed to file an answer and continued to persist in his erroneous argument that a motion to dismiss was a responsive pleading that required the opening of a default for failure to plead. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">A motion to open a default for failure to plead is governed by Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 17-32 and 17-42.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cThe opening of a default when a claim for a hearing in damages has been filed is controlled by Practice Book \u00a7 17-42 because that is the rule of practice that addresses the setting aside of a default by the judicial authority. . . . The distinction between whether Practice Book \u00a7 17-32 applies or Practice Book \u00a7 17-42 applies is whether a claim for a hearing in damages is filed before, or after, a motion to set aside the default is filed.\u201d <em>Snowdon </em>v. Grillo, 114 Conn. App. 131, 138, 968 A.2d 984 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">In this case, the defendant\u2019s first motion to open the default for failure to plead was filed on February 19, 2009, before a claim for a hearing in damages had been filed. That default, therefore, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-32, could have been opened by the clerk upon the defendant\u2019s filing of an answer to the plaintiffs complaint. The defendant, however, did not file an answer. Accordingly, the default could not be set aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>at that time. The defendant also filed a motion to open the default for failure to plead on March 26, 2009. The plaintiff, however, had filed a claim for a hearing in damages on March 10,2009, which, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-42, meant that the court, upon good cause shown, had the discretion to grant the motion to open the default for failure to plead. \u201c[T]he determination of whether to set aside [a] default is within the discretion of the trial court . . . and will not be disturbed unless that discretion has been abused or where injustice will result. In the exercise of its discretion, the trial court may consider not only the presence of mistake, accident, inadvertence, misfortune or other reasonable cause . . . factors such as [t]he seriousness of the default, its duration, the reasons for it and the degree of contumacy involved . . . but also, the totality of the circumstances, including whether the delay has caused prejudice to the nondefaulting party.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Higgins </em>v. Karp, 243 Conn. 495, 508, 706 A.2d 1 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">After consideration of the defendant\u2019s motion to open and the plaintiffs objection thereto, the court, on June 9, 2009, overruled the objection, without prejudice, giving the defendant seven days to file an answer. Again, the defendant did not file an answer.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although the defendant continued to argue to the court that the court did not have jurisdiction because service of process had not been effectuated and returned to the court properly, the court had denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss claiming such lack of jurisdiction on May 11, 2009. The defendant did not file an answer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>plaintiffs complaint until the day of the hearing in damages, September 9, 2009. The court, at that time, stated that it would not reconsider its earlier ruling. Although the defendant argues that the irregularities in the clerk\u2019s office procedure established good cause for opening the default, he does not explain why it was an abuse of discretion for the court to refuse to set aside the default.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Practice Book \u00a7 17-42 permits the court to set aside a default \u201cfor good cause shown upon such terms as it may impose. ...\u201d In this case, the court, on June 9, 2009, gave the defendant seven days to file his answer to the plaintiffs complaint, which would have set aside the default previously issued. The defendant, however, failed to comply with that order and did not file his answer for another three months. Reviewing the record in conjunction with the arguments raised on appeal, we conclude that the defendant has failed to establish that the court abused its discretion in this case. The court acted within its discretion in June, 2009, when it gave the defendant seven days to file an answer to a complaint that had a return date of December 23, 2008. Furthermore, the defendant has failed to establish that it was an abuse of discretion for the court to decline to revisit the default during the hearing in damages, which was held on September 9, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The defendant next claims that \u201c[t]he court improperly curtailed [his] defense as to damages in violation of [his] due process rights.\u201d The defendant also argues that he objected to the admission of an affidavit on the issue of the attorney\u2019s fees and that the court improperly overruled the objection, thereby precluding him from cross-examining the affiant on the issue of damages.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>We conclude that this claim is briefed inadequately, the entire briefing consisting of only two small paragraphs.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Although setting forth one conclusory statement that the court\u2019s actions violated his due process rights, the defendant does not set forth in his appellate brief a due process analysis of this claim, nor does he indicate whether his claim concerns procedural due process, substantive due process or both. See <em>Columbia Air Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept, of Transportation, </em>293 Conn. 342, 358 n.7, 977 A.2d 636 (2009) (party should indicate and provide separate cases and analysis on procedural due process claim and substantive due process claim). \u201c[W]e are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief. . . . Analysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>275 Conn. 785, 826, 882 A.2d 604 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1025,126 S. Ct. 1578,164 L. Ed. 2d 309 (2006).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, we decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The defendant also claims that the court improperly awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff in connection with this litigation. He argues that \u201c[t]he court violated the defendant\u2019s rights to due process of law, both under the Connecticut and U.S. Constitutions, when it allowed an affidavit for attorney\u2019s fees but precluded a cross-examination or challenge to the affidavit by defense counsel.\u201d After citing some general law on the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>litigate the reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees, he provides the following, which represents the entire analysis of his claim: \u201cWhen it errantly allowed an [affidavit for attorney\u2019s fees but precluded a cross-examination or challenge not only to the [affidavit but the admission of the [a]ffidavit, the [c]ourt violated the [defendant's rights to [d]ue [p]rocess of law. Therefore, such award should be reconsidered, or considered for argument once again.\u201d We again conclude that the defendant had failed to provide adequate briefing on this alleged constitutional issue. See part III of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Furthermore, we note that the defendant\u2019s counsel expressly waived this issue during the hearing on damages when he, initially, told the court that the plaintiffs counsel did not have to testify concerning the affidavit of attorney\u2019s fees. The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: I would like to submit an affidavit of my claim for interest and an affidavit for my claim of attorney\u2019s fees in this case, based on . . . language in exhibit A [the retainer agreement], if the court should find that I\u2019m entitled to those extra damages based on exhibit A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: I have to see them first to see if I have an objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: I would ask the court, if the court would take a moment to review my affidavit of attorney\u2019s fees. I did approximate one entry on my affidavit, which was approximated that this matter would take one hour this morning and, Judge, in fact, it\u2019s taken three hours. So, if the court feels it\u2019s appropriate at my normal billing rate of $250 an hour, I would ask the court to, I believe, increase my claimed legal fees of $2100 to $2600, if the court felt that was appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">\u201c [The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Your Honor, I don\u2019t think that he is going to have to testify to it, I think, because, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>at this point it\u2019s a contested hearing, it\u2019s not where you could just throw an affidavit in. I mean, this isn\u2019t a default where nobody is here. We\u2019re defending this case. And, in terms of his calculations of interest, you know, I guess the court can calculate what it calculates if it wants, but I don\u2019t know that it necessarily\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Is that it, gentlemen?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: Your Honor, I have rested, and I have nothing further. I would ask that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: We would request a continuance for an opportunity to have [the defendant], when he is available, to be able to testify. He may be\u2014 it may be short. I think I would like to have the opportunity to put him on.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">\u201cThe Court: Yes, I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: I\u2019m also going to request an opportunity to file a brief. There are some issues that need to be briefed in this case that have come out in this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: Your Honor, my position is that this is a molehill that is being turned into a mountain. That this is a very simple, straightforward commercial collection matter, and it doesn\u2019t require a brief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-11\">\u201cThe Court: I will give you two weeks to file your brief, counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-12\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Okay. Can I have the opportunity to put [the defendant] on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>\u201cThe Court: No. [The defendant] had his opportunity. I don\u2019t know how long this calendar\u2014and I don\u2019t know how long he has been away, wherever he is, he should have been present if he wanted to be heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: I can\u2019t have him testify either? I couldn\u2019t get a continuance, I couldn\u2019t have him testify, we haven\u2019t been allowed to file an answer, but the errors that the clerk\u2019s office made, they are okay? Okay. Okay. Your Honor, in two weeks, I will file a brief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Counsel then stated that he now was objecting to the use of an affidavit to prove attorney\u2019s fees in the case and that testimony should be required. Specifically, he stated: \u201cI do, for the record, I object to using an affidavit of attorney\u2019s fees and an affidavit of interest, too. I think he has to be able to be prepared to testify to that, and you are not requiring him to testify.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The court, however, essentially advised him that the hearing was over.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that a trial court must [afford] the parties the opportunity to present evidence and to be heard on the issue of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. . . . [A] party seeking attorney\u2019s fees must satisfy the undisputed requirement that the reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees and costs ... be proven by an appropriate evidentiary showing. . . . This protects the opposing party\u2019s right to litigate fully the reasonableness of the attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Arcano </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>81 Conn. App. 761, 770-71, 841 A.2d 742 (2004). Our Supreme Court, in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>267 Conn. 456, 479, 839 A.2d 589 (2004), clarified the evidentiary burden required in a claim forf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees, holding that \u201cthe proponent must present to the court at the time of trial ... a statement of the fees requested and a description of services rendered.\u201d The court in <em>Smith </em>determined that although the plaintiffs\u2019 mere request for attorney\u2019s fees was inadequate under this standard, the court would not reverse the award of attorney\u2019s fees because opposing counsel did not object to the request. Id., 481. The court concluded that \u201cthe defendants, in failing to object to the plaintiffs\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees, effectively acquiesced in that request, and, consequently, they now will not be heard to complain about that request.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In the present case, the record reveals that the plaintiffs counsel provided to the court an affidavit on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees. The defendant\u2019s attorney initially stated that the plaintiffs attorney did not need to testify on the matter. It was only after the court again denied his request for a continuance that the defendant\u2019s counsel voiced any concern about the affidavit or about a desire to cross-examine the plaintiffs attorney. The transcript from the hearing reveals that the hearing in damages had concluded at that point, however, and that the parties merely were wrapping up a briefing schedule. \u201cWhen a party consents to or expresses satisfaction with an issue at trial, claims arising from that issue are deemed waived and may not be reviewed on appeal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Smith, 289 Conn. 598, 621, 960 A.2d 993 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Finally, the defendant claims that the court failed to protect his right to due process of law. The defendant\u2019s brief sets forth the following: \u201cIn totality, the failure to \u2018code\u2019 the defendant\u2019s pleadings when filed, the entrance, vacation of reentrance of default against the defendant, and the imposition of attorney\u2019s fees on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>simple basis of [an] affidavit without allowing the defendant his right and benefit to cross-examine or challenge such imposition, have combined to effect a deprivation of the defendant\u2019s right to due process in the above captioned matter.\u201d This one sentence, however, sets forth the entire briefing on this alleged constitutional claim by the defendant. The defendant does not explain whether he is claiming a violation of procedural due process or substantive due process. See <em>Columbia Air Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Transportation, </em>supra, 293 Conn. 358 n.7. There is no citation to authority, no standard of review and no analysis set forth in his brief. Accordingly, we decline to review this claim. See <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>270 Conn. 815, 823 n.8, 856 A.2d 358 (2004) (\u201cWe consistently have held that [a]nalysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly. . . . Where the parties cite no law and provide no analysis of their claims, we do not review such claims.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-5\"> To determine the dates of pleadings, we thoroughly have examined the court file and examined the date stamps on the individual documents. We also have examined the documents included in the appendix supplied by the defendant, which include several orders of the court, which we are unable to find in the actual court file. We note that some of the pleadings also do not appear to have been coded properly into the case detail sheet at the time of filing, if at all. For example, the date stamp on the defendant\u2019s motion to open default, #109, is March 26, 2009. On the case detail sheet, however, the filing date is June 26, 2009. Also, the defendant\u2019s February 19, 2009 motion to dismiss contains the notation that it is entry # \u201c105\u201d on the actual document, yet the motion is not recorded on the case detail sheet. There is no entry #105 on the sheet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-6\"> The court case detail sheet, however, shows the return date as October 24, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b398-5\"> Although the plaintiff did not use form JD-CV-1, which is the preprinted civil summons form prepared by the judicial department, the record reveals that the plaintiffs summons substantively complied with General Statutes \u00a7 52-45b, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">\u201cUnless otherwise provided by rule, the forms of legal process for commencement of civil actions may be as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">\u201c(1) Summons for appearance before the Superior Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">\u201cTo any proper officer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">\u201cBy authority of the state of Connecticut, you are hereby commanded to summon A.B. of . . .
