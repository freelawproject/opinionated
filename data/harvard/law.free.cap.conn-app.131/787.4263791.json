On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court abused its discretion by (1) denying his petition for certification to appeal and (2) denying his petition for a writ of habeas coipus grounded in ineffective assistance of trial counsel. We conclude that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal and therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">\u201cFaced with the habeas court\u2019s denial of certification to appeal, a petitioner\u2019s first burden is to demonstrate that the habeas court\u2019s ruling constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 612, 646 A.2d 126 (1994). To prove an abuse of discretion, the petitioner must demonstrate that the issues are debatable among jurists of reason; that a court could resolve the issues [in a different manner]; or that the questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further. . . . Id., 616, quoting <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>498 U.S. 430, 432, 111 S. Ct. 860, 112 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991). If the petitioner succeeds in surmounting that hurdle, the petitioner must then demonstrate that the judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>the habeas court should be reversed on its merits. Id., 612. We examine the petitioner\u2019s underlying claim[s] of ineffective assistance of counsel in order to determine whether the habeas court abused its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal. . . . <em>J.R </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>105 Conn. App. 827, 831, 941 A.2d 348, cert. denied, 286 Conn. 915, 945 A.2d 976 (2008). A criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled to adequate and effective assistance of counsel at all critical stages of criminal proceedings. <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>125 Conn. App. 632, 637, 9 A.3d 407 (2010), cert. denied, 300 Conn. 919, 14 A.3d 1006 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">\u201cA claim of ineffective assistance of counsel consists of two components: a performance prong and a prejudice prong. To satisfy the performance prong, a claimant must demonstrate that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed ... by the [s]ixth [ajmendment. . . . Put another way, the petitioner must demonstrate that his attorney\u2019s representation was not reasonably competent or within the range of competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law. ... To satisfy the prejudice prong, a claimant must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The record discloses the following relevant facts. In 2002, a jury found the petitioner guilty of attempt to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-54a (a), assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (5) and carrying a dangerous weapon in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-206 (a). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliston, </em>86 Conn. App. 479, 480, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>861 A.2d 563 (2004), cert. denied, 273 Conn. 906, 868 A.2d 746 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petitioner was committed to the custody of the respondent, the commissioner of correction, for a period of twenty-five years. Id., 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Following his conviction, the petitioner filed an appeal with this court, claiming that the denial of his motion to suppress the out-of-court and in-court identifications; see footnote 1 of this opinion; violated his right to due process. <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliston, </em>supra, 86 Conn. App. 480. This court disagreed with the petitioner\u2019s claim, concluding that, \u201cdespite the suggestiveness of the identification procedure, the identification itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>was reliable based on the totality of the circumstances. \u2018[Reliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of the identification testimony . . . .\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>[81 Conn. App. 264, 270, 839 A.2d 622, cert. denied, 268 Conn. 915, 847 A.2d 312 (2004)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliston, </em>supra, 484-85. This court found that the record made clear that the petitioner met the general description the victim gave of his assailant at trial. Id., 485. Moreover, \u201cthis is not a case in which the victim had been attacked by an unknown assailant. The victim knew the [petitioner] from his place of employment, from his neighborhood and from the Yellow Bird Social Club. [In addition], the victim was first shown a single photograph of someone other than the [petitioner]. It is thus highly unlikely that the use of a single photograph to identify the [petitioner] in any way hampered the victim\u2019s ability to accurately identify his assailant.\u201d Id., 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">In his amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the petitioner alleged, in part, that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by conducting a deficient cross-examination of the victim, failed to articulate the applicable decisional law regarding a suggestive identification process and failed to file a memorandum of law in support of the petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress. With respect to those claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, the habeas court found that the petitioner\u2019s trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance with regard to the filing of a memorandum of law in support of the motion to suppress and that there is a complete absence of prejudice on that ground. The court also found that the petitioner failed to prove that counsels cross-examination of the victim at trial was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">The petitioner also alleged that his trial counsel\u2019s representation was ineffective in that he failed (1) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>investigate an eyewitness identification of the assailant, (2) to file a motion to suppress that identification and (3) to conduct an adequate cross-examination of that witness at trial. The habeas court found the allegations unproven, primarily on the basis of its credibility determinations. <em>See Necaise v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>112 Conn. App. 817, 820, 964 A.2d 562, cert. denied, 292 Conn. 911, 973 A.2d 660 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">The petitioner further alleged that his trial counsel was negligent in failing to present the testimony of certain individuals to provide an alibi defense. The habeas court credited the testimony of the petitioner\u2019s trial counsel and determined that counsel\u2019s decision not to call certain witnesses was a valid tactical decision. As to prejudice, the habeas court found that the state\u2019s case was strong given the circumstances of the victim\u2019s identification of his assailant; the petitioner and the victim were well-known to one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">On the basis of our review of the record and the briefs of the parties, we conclude that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal. This is not a case in which the issues are debatable among jurists of reason, a court could resolve the issues in a different manner or the questions should be encouraged to proceed further. See <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-6\"> The following facts underlie the petitioner\u2019s conviction. On or about November 16, 2001, the victim, Kirk Reid, was shot by an assailant outside the Yellow Bird Social Club in Bridgeport. <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliston, </em>supra, 86 Conn. App. 480. \u201cDuring the incident, the street was well lit and the victim was able to see the assailant\u2019s face.\u201d Id., 480-81. Detective Juan P. Gonzalez interviewed the victim at the hospital and was informed that \u201cthe assailant was \u2018Dave,\u2019 a Jamaican male who lived in the area of Beechwood Avenue in Bridgeport. . . . [TJhe victim described the assailant ... as a black male, five feet, nine inches tall, clean shaven, with a thin build and \u2018com rolls.\u2019 \u201d Id., 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Thereafter, Gonzalez took \u201ca single photograph of someone who met the victim\u2019s description of his assailant to the hospital for the purpose of identification. The victim indicated that the photograph was not of his assailant. Subsequently, on December 1, 2001 . . . Gonzalez brought a single photograph of the [petitioner] to the hospital for identification purposes. The victim identified the [petitioner] as his assailant.\u201d Id. On December 12, 2001, Gonzalez presented the victim with a photographic array that included a photograph of the petitioner. Id. \u201c[T]he victim immediately identified the photograph of the [petitioner] and stated that he was \u2018100 percent positive\u2019 that the man depicted in the photograph was his assailant. The victim knew the [petitioner] as \u2018Dave\u2019 from Colonial Toyota in Milford, where they both worked, and by the nickname \u2018Bartley\u2019 from the neighborhood and from the Yellow Bird Social Club.\u201d Id., 481-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">At trial, the petitioner filed a motion to suppress the out-of-court and in-court identifications of him. Id., 482. He argued that \u201cthe use of the single photograph was unnecessarily suggestive and that the inclusion of that picture in the array made that identification and all subsequent identifications unreliable because the picture had already been identified by the victim as depicting the assailant, and it was lighter than the other photographs in the array. The court <em>[Hon. JohnP. Maiocco, Jr., </em>judge trial referee] denied the [petitioner\u2019s] motion, holding that although the identification procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>bore a hint of suggestiveness, it was not unnecessarily suggestive and, at any rate, it was reliable under the totality of the circumstances.\u201d Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
