On appeal, the plaintiff claims that it was improper for the trial court (1) to grant motions in limine precluding it from presenting evidence of (a) lost profits, (b) lost overhead and (c) bribery and other wrongdoing, and (2) to limit the evidence it considered in awarding punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In their cross appeal, the defendants Alfred Lenoci, Sr., Alfred Lenoci, Jr., United Properties, Ltd., and Crescent Avenue Development Company (Lenoci defendants) claim that it was improper for the court to deny their motions for a directed verdict and to set aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the verdict as a result of concluding that the plaintiffs action was not barred by (1) the doctrine of collateral estoppel and (2) the statute of limitations. In his cross appeal, the defendant Joseph P. Ganim claims that it was improper for the court to (1) award excessive and unreasonable punitive damages, (2) conclude that there was sufficient evidence to prove fraudulent misrepresentation and (3) conclude that the action is not barred by the statute of limitations, General Statutes \u00a7 52-577. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ARg\">The plaintiffs second revised complaint sounds in ten counts alleged against eighteen defendants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>court summarized the litigation in its thorough January 25, 2008 memorandum of decision in which it ruled on the defendants\u2019 motions in limine to preclude evidence of lost profits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cThe gravamen of the complaint is the plaintiffs claim that the . . . city . . . breached a November, 1998 [development] agreement with the plaintiff concerning the plaintiffs development of Steel Point (also known as Harbour Place) located in Bridgeport. Among its claims, the plaintiff alleges that . . . Ganim, the then [mayor of the city], had a secret plan with other defendants to oust the plaintiff as the developer of the project so that it could be replaced by the defendant United Properties, Ltd. United Properties, Ltd., was owned or controlled by . . . Lenoci, Sr., and . . . Lenoci, Jr. The complaint charges that the Lenocis had agreed to pay bribes to Ganim in exchange for the selection of United Properties, Ltd., as the developer of Steel Point. . . . The complaint alleges that the city wrongfully terminated the agreement and that the other defendants either participated in the corrupt scheme or wrongly facilitated it.\u201d (Citation omitted.) In its prayer for relief, the plaintiff sought, among other things, \u201ccompensatory damages incurred by the plaintiff for expenses incurred, costs in excess of $5 million and lost profits in excess of $100 million . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>In the same memorandum of decision, the court summarized undisputed facts, quoting frequently from the development agreement. \u201cIn November, 1998, the plaintiff, the city and the United Illuminating Company entered into a development agreement regarding the development of Steel Point. According to the complaint . . . this [development] agreement was executed \u2018after more than a year of protracted negotiations and delays.\u2019 The completion of the agreement required satisfaction of numerous conditions, studies and financial and regulatory requirements. These conditions included approvals from the Connecticut development authority, the state of Connecticut bond commission, the Bridgeport city council, as well as from \u2018all required City officials and entities\u2019 and \u2018other state authorities as required by law.\u2019 . . . After full performance of the development agreement, the precise cost, financial obligations and construction \u2018plans, specifications timetable and . . . standards\u2019 of the construction would be set forth in either a restated agreement or a land disposition agreement. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u201cIn summary, the development agreement was a very extensive and detailed preliminary understanding which contemplated the negotiation and execution of subsequent property conveyance and construction contracts after substantial preparatory and investigatory work had been completed and after the \u2018amount of public funding [had] been more definitively ascertained and at such time as the Parties [had] achieved a more definite assessment of the precise cost of developing the Project.\u2019<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, the exact obligations and responsibilities of the parties regarding the actual construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>and completion of the project were not addressed in the [development] agreement but would be established in a restated agreement or the land disposition agreement, which the parties would negotiate and finalize after completion of the development agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u201cThe development agreement was amended three times, but its requirements were never completed. In or about 2000 or 2001, the city terminated the [development] agreement. . . . [T]he complaint alleges that this termination was a breach of the city\u2019s obligations under the [development] agreement. The complaint further alleges [that] the plaintiffs ability to perform or complete the [development] agreement fully or satisfactorily was frustrated and interfered with by the criminal or corrupt conduct of the other defendants. These claims are denied by the defendants .... Assuming, arguendo, the plaintiff\u2019s allegations of the defendants\u2019 wrongful conduct, there is no dispute that when the development agreement was terminated, all of the conditions and requirements of the [development] agreement had not been met. All the governmental approvals or permits, particularly from the city council and the state bonding commission, had not been obtained. No contracts for the transfer and construction of the property, either through a restated agreement or a land disposition agreement, had been negotiated or finalized.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Jury selection commenced on February 6, 2008, and the jury returned its verdict on June 6, 2008.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The jury found in favor of the plaintiff against the Lenoci defendants, Ganim and Kasper Group, Inc., awarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>plaintiff $366,524 in damages.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiff filed a motion to set the verdict aside, claiming, in part, that the verdict as to Ganim, the Lenoci defendants and Kasper Group, Inc., was inadequate. The plaintiff also claimed that the court improperly precluded testimony from its expert witness, Ira Kaplan, as to overhead damages, and evidence of its lost profits, and limited the scope of evidence presented regarding a conspiracy and the specific acts of conspiracy implicating Joseph T. Kasper, Jr., Charles J. Willinger, Jr., the Lenoci defendants and Ganim. In addition, the plaintiff filed a motion for additur. The Lenocis and Ganim, too, filed motions to set aside the verdict against them.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>The court denied the plaintiffs motions for additur and to set aside the verdict, noting that the evidence at trial was conflicting and citing <em>Skrzypiec </em>v. <em>Noonan, </em>228 Conn. 1, 11, 633 A.2d 716 (1993) (\u201c[t]he existence of conflicting evidence limits the court\u2019s authority to overturn a jury verdict\u201d). The court concluded that it could not find that \u201cthe jury could not have reasonably and legally reached the verdict it rendered.\u201d The court also denied Ganim\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict on the jury\u2019s finding in favor of the plaintiff on the fraudulent misrepresentation claim. The court concluded that the plaintiffs claims were not barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel or the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Thereafter, the court awarded the plaintiff punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to the jury\u2019s finding against the Lenoci defendants on the CUTPA claim and against Ganim on the fraudulent misrepresentation claim. The plaintiff appealed, and Ganim and the Lenoci defendants cross appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">PLAINTIFF\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">The plaintiff has appealed from the judgment of the trial court claiming that the court improperly (1) precluded it from presenting evidence of (a) lost profits, (b) lost overhead expenses and (c) prior misconduct, and (2) awarded it inadequate punitive damages. We disagree with the plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">We first address the plaintiffs claims that the court improperly precluded it from presenting certain evidence of damages and prior misconduct on the part of the defendants. The plaintiff cannot prevail on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The plaintiff claims that it was improper for the court to grant the defendants\u2019 motions in limine precluding it from presenting evidence of lost profits, i.e., the profits the plaintiff claims it would have made had the city not terminated the development agreement. In granting the defendants\u2019 motions to preclude such evidence, the court concluded that the evidence was grounded in speculation and therefore inadmissible. We agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The plaintiff and the Lenoci defendants disagree as to the applicable standard of review for the plaintiffs claim. The plaintiff contends that the de novo standard applies to legal determinations, citing <em>Duffy </em>v. <em>Flagg, </em>279 Conn. 682, 688-89, 905 A.2d 15 (2006) (ruling on motion in limine based on court\u2019s legal determination regarding informed consent claim). It claims that the court\u2019s granting of the motions in limine was predicated on the court\u2019s finding that there was insufficient evidence of lost profits, a question of law. The Lenoci defendants<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> claim that the court\u2019s ruling was an evidentiary one and, therefore, the abuse of discretion standard applies. We agree that the discretionary standard generally applies to evidentiary rulings. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>260 Conn. 466, 481, 797 A.2d 1101 (2002) (reviewing court will set aside evidentiary ruling only for clear abuse of discretion). In this instance, however, the court based its decision on its analysis of a question of law. The court undertook a causal relationship analysis between the termination of the development agreement and the plaintiffs claimed losses, and concluded that there was an insufficient causal relationship between them. See <em>Abrahams </em>v. <em>Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., </em>240 Conn. 300, 307, 692 A.2d 709 (1997) (issue of causation generally question reserved for trier of fact; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>issue becomes one of law when mind of fair and reasonable person could reach only one conclusion). We therefore agree with the plaintiff that the de novo standard of review applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u201cWhile evidentiary determinations are usually reviewed for abuse of discretion; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Popeleski, </em>291 Conn. 769, 774, 970 A.2d 108 (2009); the type of decision made by the trial court does not, in isolation, determine the appropriate standard for appellate review. To the contrary, [r]ather than invoke a rule based strictly on a category, we conclude that the better approach is . . . [to] examine the nature of the ruling at issue in the context of the issues in the case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Norwalk Hospital, </em>299 Conn. 241, 250 n.9, 9 A.3d 364 (2010). The question to be answered by the court in ruling on the motions in limine was not what evidence was admissible to prove recoverable damages but whether the plaintiffs claimed damages were recoverable at all, which is a legal question.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\u201cIn [the] context of [a] tortious interference claim, [a] plaintiff must show more than that he was about to enter into [a] contract and must, instead, show that he would have done so .... A damage theory may be based on assumptions so long as the assumptions are reasonable in light of the record evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schatz &amp; Schatz, Ribicoff &amp; Kotkin, </em>247 Conn. 48, 70, 717 A.2d 724 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">We turn now to the facts underlying the plaintiffs claim. In December, 2005, the plaintiff disclosed two witnesses to provide expert testimony as to its claim of lost profits, Robert B. Pauls and Stephen J. Kieras. Pauls has extensive experience in real estate development and, in 1999, completed a market analysis and a rent forecast report for the plaintiff. Pauls predicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the rental revenue the plaintiff could expect upon completion of the project. In reaching his conclusions, Pauls relied on a 1999 report prepared by Rothschild, Inc., on behalf of the city, and a construction costs report. Kieras, who at the time the plaintiff was negotiating with the city, was the vice president for development of the Taubman Company (Taubman). In the summer of 2000, Kieras sent letters to Ganim explaining that Taubman had completed its due diligence on the project and was committed to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">In September, 2006, several of the defendants filed, or joined in,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> motions for partial summary judgment, claiming that, as a matter of law, judgment should enter against the plaintiff on its demand for lost profits because such damages could not be proven with reasonable certainty. In ruling on those motions for summary judgment, the court noted the claims raised by the plaintiff and the associated demand for \u201c[c]ompensatory damages incurred . . . for expenses incurred, costs in excess of $5 million and lost profits in excess of $100 million . . . .\u201d The court denied the motions for summary judgment as to lost profits, finding, pursuant to the plaintiffs claims for relief, that the plaintiff was seeking various forms of interrelated damages.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court concluded that, if it were to render judgment as to lost profits alone, its decision would not dispose fully of any cause of action or claim. It reasoned, in short, that the plaintiffs demand for lost profits was not sufficiently distinct so that a disposition of those damages could be severed effectively from the remaining causes of action. In a footnote, however, the court stated that another type of motion, such as a motion to preclude or a motion in limine as to lost profits, might be available to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>In November, 2007, certain defendants filed, or adopted, motions in limine to preclude the plaintiff from presenting evidence of lost profits. In granting the motions to preclude, the court examined the allegations of the second revised complaint and the undisputed facts. It found, assuming the plaintiffs allegations of the defendants\u2019 wrongful conduct, that when the city terminated the development agreement, all of the conditions and requirements of the agreement had not been met, and that no contracts for the transfer and construction of the property, either through a restated agreement or a land disposition agreement, had been negotiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The defendants\u2019 motions in limine contended that \u201cevidence regarding the plaintiffs claim for lost profits should be excluded because, as a matter of law, the claim is premised on so many assumptions and contingencies that its consideration by the jury would require the jury to engage in surmise and guesswork.\u201d In ruling on the motions in limine, the court found that \u201cto preclude evidence of lost profits implicate [s] the issue of causation, an essential element that must be proven by the plaintiff under all causes of action asserted in the complaint.\u201d The court, quoting <em>Paige </em>v. <em>St. Andrew\u2019s Roman Catholic Church Corp., </em>250 Conn. 14, 734 A.2d 85 (1999),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> set forth the law of causation in this jurisdiction and noted the rule that \u201ccausal connection must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>be based upon more than conjecture and surmise.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The court found that the plaintiffs opposition to the defendants\u2019 motions in limine emphasized the first component of legal cause, i.e., cause in fact, and deemphasized the second component of legal cause, i.e., proximate cause. We agree with the reasoning of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The court stated that the \u201cdeficiency of the plaintiffs claim for lost profits is fundamental. The plaintiff bases the lost profits claim on a nonexistent contract whose potential realization and returns are remote as a matter of law because its evidentiary support is contingent and speculative. . . . [T]he development agreement did not provide for the construction of the project; it was merely a contract to pursue a restated development agreement or a land disposition agreement where the precise cost, plans and specifications of the construction would be set forth. Assuming, hypothetically, that all of the conditions and contingencies of the development agreement were achieved, the city was only required to engage in good faith negotiations to reach an agreement on a land disposition contract, and was not unequivocally bound to execute one.\u201d The court found <em>Goodstein Construction Corp. </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>80 N.Y.2d 366, 604 N.E.2d 1356, 590 N.Y.S.2d 425 (1992),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>In <em>Goodstein Construction Corp., </em>the Court of Appeals of New York stated, in part, \u201c[t]o allow the profits that [Goodstein] might have made under the prospective [land development agreement] as the damages for breach of the exclusive negotiating agreements would be basing damages not on the exclusive negotiating agreements but on the prospective terms of a nonexistent contract which the City was fully at liberty to reject. It would, in effect, be transforming an agreement to negotiate for a contract into the contract itself.\u201d Id., 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\u201c[A] party\u2019s alleged failure to bargain in good faith is not abut-for cause of [Goodstein\u2019s] lost profits, since even with the best faith on both sides the deal might not have been closed [and] attributing [Goodstein\u2019s] lost profits to [the city\u2019s] bad faith may be speculative at best .... [A]n award based on [the expectation interest] would give the injured party the benefit of the bargain that was not reached. But if no agreement was reached and ... it cannot even be known what agreement would have been reached, there is no way to measure the lost expectation . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 373-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In their motions in limine, the defendants emphasized the numerous requirements and contingencies of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>development agreement that the plaintiff had not met at the time the city terminated the development agreement. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court focused on the approvals the plaintiff was required to get from state and local governments and regulatory authorities, including the state bonding commission, department of transportation and the Bridgeport city council, to demonstrate the contingencies affecting the Steel Point development project. There is no dispute that the plaintiff did not obtain all of the approvals required by the development agreement. The court found that the plaintiff had not, and could not, advance any sufficient, nonspeculative arguments or evidence that the required governmental and regulatory approvals would have issued in its favor, thereby establishing the foundation necessary to submit the question of lost profits to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The court identified the issue as \u201cwhether, in the <em>absence </em>of the defendants\u2019 wrongdoing or corrupt influences, the plaintiff can provide evidence, beyond surmise and conjecture, that the necessary city council authorizations would have been acquired.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The court reasoned that the state and local authorities, acting in good faith and within the legitimate exercise of their governmental authority, could have accepted or rejected the plaintiffs proposal even if the proposal had been finalized. The court concluded that the approvals that the plaintiff needed from the state bonding commission and the Bridgeport city council were not \u201c \u2018merely perfunctory or ministerial [acts]. On the contrary, the required approvals] contemplated . . . discretionary legislative action that was political in nature and not subject to judicial review,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Goodstein Construction Corp. </em>v. <em>City of New </em>York, supra, 80 N.Y.2d 372. On appeal, the plaintiff does not challenge the court\u2019s conclusion that the approvals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>were discretionary acts of governmental entities, and we do not disagree with the court\u2019s conclusion.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In its appellate brief, the plaintiff relies on 2 Restatement (Second), Torts, Unintended Consequences of Intentional Invasions \u00a7 435 B, p. 455 (1965),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> for the proposition that because the defendants\u2019 wrongdoing was wilful, a more lenient standard of admissibility applies. The plaintiff has quoted in part from comment (a) to \u00a7 435 B, to wit: \u201cresponsibility for harmful consequences should be carried further in the case of one who does an intentionally wrongful act than in the case of one who is merely negligent or is not at fault. The rule applies not merely to physical harm to the person but also ... to business.\u201d Id., \u00a7 435 B, comment (a).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Thus, the plaintiff argues that \u201cwhen detemiining proximate cause in intentional tort cases, the court may consider: (1) the defendant\u2019s intent to do harm, (2) the degree of moral wrong involved and (3) the seriousness of the harm originally intended.\u201d The plaintiff also addressed the five factors to be used to determine whether a plaintiff has proven lost profits to a reasonable certainty, citing <em>Cheryl Terry Enterprises, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>270 Conn. 619, 639-40, 854 A.2d 1066 (2004) (plaintiffs prior experience in same business, plaintiffs experience in same enterprise subsequent to interference, experience of plaintiff in similar business, average experience of participants in same line of business as injured party, prelitigation projections).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The shortcoming in the plaintiffs arguments, which contain accurate statements of the law, is that the court never got to the point of considering what evidence was admissible. The issue before the court was not what evidence the plaintiff could present to prove recoverable damages, but whether there were any damages to be recovered. It is not that the evidence the plaintiff sought to present was not admissible as to lost profits but that the evidence was not admissible on the ground of relevance, the court concluded, because there was insufficient evidence that the Steel Point project would come to fruition.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>\u201cAlthough we recognize that damages for lost profits may be difficult to prove with exactitude . . . such damages are recoverable only to the extent that the evidence affords a sufficient basis for estimating their amount with <em>reasonable </em>certainty.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schatz &amp; Schatz, Ribicoff &amp; Kotkin, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 69.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The trial court \u201chas the discretion to exclude speculative evidence, expert or otherwise.\u201d <em>Message Center Management, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Products Co., </em>85 Conn. App. 401, 421, 857 A.2d 936 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The plaintiff claims that the only question before this court is whether the Steel Point \u201cproject would have been completed in the absence of the defendants\u2019 conspiracy . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The plaintiff further argues that this is a question of fact that should have been resolved by the jury. We agree that factual questions should be determined by the finder of fact. We disagree, however, as to the question before us. The appropriate question is whether the com\u00ed; properly determined that there was sufficient, nonspeculative evidence to properly submit the issue to the jury. In fulfilling its gatekeeper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>function, the court properly determined that there was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">As the Lenoci defendants point out, the development agreement contemplated that the plaintiff and the city would finalize their rights and obligations regarding the Steel Point project through three agreements, a restated agreement, aland disposition agreement and a purchase and sale agreement related to the transfer of real property owned by the United Illuminating Company.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Moreover, the development agreement made clear that the amount of public funding available for the project was undetermined and that the plaintiff had no definite measure of its costs of development. The Lenoci defendants argue that where the plaintiff did not have a measure of the costs under the development agreement, it was speculative for the plaintiff to calculate and submit purported evidence of lost profits on the basis of the development agreement. Also, pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>development agreement, the plans, specifications, timetables and construction standards, all of which affect potential profits, were to be established in agreements that were to be entered into subsequent to the development agreement.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> On the basis of the plain language of the development agreement that the costs, timetables and specifications of the project had not yet been agreed upon, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the plaintiffs proffered experts could not provide evidence of lost profits with a reasonable degree of certainty. <em>See Leisure Resort Technology, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trading Cove Associates, </em>277 Conn. 21, 36, 889 A.2d 785 (2006) (formula to calculate damages flawed where values relied on have not yet been negotiated).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the court properly granted the defendants\u2019 motions in limine to preclude evidence of the plaintiffs alleged lost profits.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The plaintiffs second claim is that the court erred when it precluded the plaintiff from presenting evidence of damages related to overhead expenses.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>During the lengthy testimony of Alexius C. Conroy, owner of the Conroy Development Company,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the plaintiff filed a memorandum of law in support of its claim for the overhead expenses it incurred as a result of its efforts to fulfill its obligations under the development agreement. The plaintiff proffered Conroy\u2019s testimony that the plaintiffs overhead, excluding executive time, was approximately $800,000 per year over four years<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and a summary of its overhead costs. The plaintiff argued that corporate overhead is a standard and typical item of damages in both tort and contract actions, citing <em>Southern New England Contracting Co. </em>v. <em>State, </em>165 Conn. 644, 663-64, 345 A.2d 550 (1974), and that executive salaries are considered part of overhead, citing <em>Cives Corp. </em>v. <em>Callier Steel Pipe &amp; Tube, Inc., </em>482 A.2d 852, 859-60 (Me. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The defendants objected to Conroy\u2019s proposed testimony regarding lost overhead as speculative, lacking foundation and hearsay, among other things, and in violation of the rules of practice regarding discovery. Counsel for certain of the defendants pointed to Conroy\u2019s deposition testimony in which he was unable to \u201cbreak down the various expenses\u201d of the plaintiffs damages claim.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Moreover, the defendants argued, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>two cases cited by the plaintiff in its memorandum of law are inapposite because the contracts at issue in them are construction contracts.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The plaintiffs in those construction contract cases claimed damages for overhead costs they incurred due to delays caused by the respective defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Following the plaintiffs voir dire of Conroy, the court sustained the defendants\u2019 objections to the testimony and summary. It concluded that the overhead expenses were not compensable as a matter of law. It found, as well, that the defendants had inquired about the damages at Conroy\u2019s deposition and that he could not provide the information. The plaintiff never provided the information at a later time. In ruling, the court stated, \u201calthough damages are not required to be proven with mathematical certainty, the plaintiff must present evidence that provides a reasonable basis for the jury to determine damages without resort to speculation or surmise.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> This evidence is based on rank estimates. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>And the evidence supporting those estimates are such that they are\u2014it\u2019s uncertain, it\u2019s conjectural and speculative.\u201d We agree with the court and for the reasons it stated. See <em>Marandino </em>v. <em>Prometheus Pharmacy, </em>105 Conn. App. 669, 681, 939 A.2d 591 (2008) (witness\u2019 opinion devoid of basis in fact therefore not competent evidence but speculation and conjecture), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 294 Conn. 564, 986 A.2d 1023 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Several weeks later, the plaintiff again sought to introduce evidence of overhead expenses through the testimony of its expert witness, Ira Kaplan, an accountant. The defendants objected, arguing that the court previously had ruled on the issue at the time Conroy testified. The plaintiff countered that it had disclosed Kaplan as an expert witness subsequent to Conroy\u2019s deposition and provided the substance of his testimony in the disclosure, but the defendants never deposed Kaplan.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The defendants objected to evidence of overhead expenses on the ground that it violated the court\u2019s discovery order and the rules of practice.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>counsel acknowledged, however, that documents were not produced at Conroy\u2019s deposition, but claimed that the information had been provided to the defendants in \u201ctwenty-six file boxes and indicated very clearly a full year before, in April of 2005, what the calculations are. So, there is no surprise.\u201d The plaintiff claimed that in face of the defendants\u2019 failure to depose Kaplan, it was entitled to offer his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The defendants argued that the plaintiff had abused the discovery process and, to the extent that Kaplan would testify about overhead and the value of Conroy\u2019s time, that the court previously had precluded its admission in evidence. Moreover, to the extent that Kaplan would testify about various financial statements that underlie the summary, the defendants have never had an opportunity to see those documents,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and the proffered testimony was more in the nature of fact testimony than expert testimony. The court sustained the defendants\u2019 objections in a lengthy oral ruling that the evidence was not admissible, as a matter of law,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> because it was speculative, as it was based on estimates and because of the plaintiffs abuse of the discovery process.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> On appeal, the plaintiff challenges both of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>the court\u2019s reasons for precluding the evidence of its overhead expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Practice Book \u00a7 13-14<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) If any party has failed to . . . respond to requests for production . . . the judicial authority may, on motion, make such order as the ends of justice require, (b) Such orders may include the following ... (4) The entry of an order prohibiting the party who has failed to comply from introducing designated matters in evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>. . . .\u201d \u201cWe have long recognized that, apart from a specific rule of practice authorizing a sanction, the trial court has the inherent power to provide for the imposition of reasonable sanctions, to compel the observance of its rules.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>DuBois </em>v. <em>William W. Backus Hospital, </em>92 Conn. App. 743, 748, 887 A.2d 407 (2005), cert. denied, 278 Conn. 907, 899 A.2d 35 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">It is not an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion to preclude evidence as a sanction for the plaintiffs failing to comply with discovery. \u201c [T]he primary purpose of a sanction for violation of a discovery order is to ensure that the defendant\u2019s rights are protected, not to exact punishment on the [plaintiff] for its allegedly improper conduct. . . . The determinative question for an appellate court is not whether it would have imposed a similar sanction but whether the trial court could reasonably conclude as it did given the facts presented. Never will the case on appeal look as it does to a [trial court] . . . faced with the need to impose reasonable bounds and order on discovery.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Usowski </em>v. <em>Jacobson, </em>267 Conn. 73, 85, 836 A.2d 1167 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">On the basis of the record before us, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion by precluding evidence of the proffered overhead expenses. The defendants\u2019 notice of deposition to the plaintiff requested it to present the most knowledgeable person within the plaintiff to testify about damages and to bring any damages evidence to the deposition. At the time of the deposition, Conroy was not able to provide specific information in response to questions posed, and he did not bring any documents with him. Kaplan was disclosed as an expert who would provide the facts underlying Conroy\u2019s estimates of the overhead costs. The defendants did not depose Kaplan. At the time the plaintiff sought to present Kaplan\u2019s testimony, it made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the documents available to the defendants for the first time. We agree with the court that no counsel should be burdened for the first time at trial with documents that underlie the testimony of a witness who should have been produced earlier pursuant to a discovery request. We conclude therefore that the court properly precluded the plaintiffs proffered evidence of overhead expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The plaintiffs third evidentiary claim is that the court improperly precluded evidence of prior misconduct on the part of Kasper<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> that would demonstrate that he had knowledge of a conspiracy of corruption in the city. We do not agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">We generally review claims of evidentiary impropriety for abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, 275 </em>Conn. 785, 815, 882 A.2d 604 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1025, 126 S. Ct. 1578, 164 L. Ed. 2d 309 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The following procedural history and facts are relevant to the plaintiffs claim. In its second revised complaint, the plaintiff alleged tortious interference, a violation of CUTPA and violation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-564 (statutory theft)<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> against Kasper.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Paul J. Pinto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>testified that he was employed simultaneously by United Properties, Ltd., which gave money to Pinto to share with Ganim, and Kasper Group, Inc. In addition to a salary and insurance benefits, Kasper Group, Inc., gave Pinto a credit card in the name of Ron Rapice to pay for the dining and entertaining expenses Pinto was incurring to \u201c[take] care of . . . Ganim . . . .\u201d Pinto purchased Kasper Group, Inc., in 1999, but he and Kasper agreed to represent to the world that Kasper was still the president. Pinto and Kasper reasoned that it would be easier for Kasper Group, Inc., to continue to do work for the city if it was not known that Pinto was the owner, given his close ties to Ganim and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">The plaintiff sought to enter evidence of Kasper\u2019s alleged prior misconduct to establish that Kasper was aware of the corrupt conspiracy to terminate the development agreement the city had with the plaintiff so that United Properties, Ltd., could acquire the rights to develop Steel Point. The defendants objected to each instance of alleged prior misconduct on Kasper\u2019s part as being outside the scope of the pleadings, irrelevant and collateral to the plaintiffs claim of damages arising from the Steel Point project.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The plaintiff contends on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>appeal that without evidence that Kasper made illegal payments to Ganim, the jury rendered a verdict in Kasper\u2019s favor because it did not have sufficient evidence from which to infer that Kasper was part of a conspiracy that led to the plaintiffs loss of the Steel Point development project.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Apparently, at some time prior to trial,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> the defendants had filed motions in limine with respect to prior misconduct evidence. The court stated that it would not issue a broad ruling, but would rule on the admissibility of evidence when it knew the precise evidence being offered, the context in which it was offered and the parties\u2019 positions at that time. \u201c[T]he court did not want to issue a broad ruling on these issues . . . because of the difficulties which are inherent in the balancing of the issues involved. The general rule is that evidence of misconduct is inadmissible to prove that a party acted in a particular way or had a propensity to act in a particular way. And there are exceptions to this general rule. Whether or not any of those exceptions apply involves a fairly difficult balancing . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">At trial, the court made prehminary statements regarding prior misconduct evidence. \u201cFirst, there is no cause of action for . . . conspiracy under Connecticut law. That which makes a conspiracy actionable, if you will, or legally significant under Connecticut law, is not the conspiracy itself but the conspiratorial acts done in furtherance of tortious conduct that causes damages.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> . . . [N]o civil cause of action is created in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>favor of the plaintiff solely due to public corruption in the city of Bridgeport. The plaintiff does not stand in the capacity of a private attorney general on behalf of the citizens of Bridgeport. [The] plaintiff in this case is not seeking monetary compensation for the specific and direct benefit of the citizens of Bridgeport. The plaintiff here seeks monetary compensation for itself for losses that it allegedly suffered for civil wrongs done to it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">\u201cIn the complaint, the tortious cause of action at issue, therefore, is not civil conspiracy and is not some general claim of public corruption but is a claim for tortious interference with contractual relations. Part of this claim involves an allegation that this tort was accomplished through concerted or conspiratorial acts of one or more of the defendants and/or other parties. Thus, the precise legal issue presented and relevant to this evidentiary issue is whether the offered evidence is relevant to proving conspiratorial acts committed in furtherance of or in order to accomplish an interference with the plaintiffs contractual rights regarding the development of the property known as Steel Point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Before ruling on the first proffered evidence of prior misconduct, the court further stated: \u201cThree provisions of the [Connecticut Code of Evidence] are pertinent to the court\u2019s evaluation of this offer. They include \u00a7 4-1 of the code of evidence,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> \u00a7 4-3<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>\u00a7 4-5.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Particularly, under \u00a7 4-5, the general rule is that evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts of a person are inadmissible to prove the bad character of that individual or the individual\u2019s tendencies to commit the act in question. There are exceptions. Thus, the case law is clear that under the rule, the task of the court is first to determine whether or not one of the exceptions applies and, if it does or in addition thereto, whether or not the probative value outweighs any prejudicial tendency of the evidence at issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">In deciding whether Kasper\u2019s alleged knowledge of or participation in a conspiracy concerning the renewal of a contract for wastewater treatment held by Professional Services Group, the court explained its ruling at length: \u201cThe plaintiff claims that the evidence regarding [Professional Services Group] is relevant under the exception of common plan or scheme or the related exception, a system of criminal activity, which is provided under \u00a7 4-5 (b) of the code of evidence. The law regarding the application of this particular exception to the general rule has recently been explained . . . by our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>284 Conn. 328, [338-61, 933 A.2d 1158 (2007)]. Among the comments which the Supreme Court stated in that case is that this particular rule, and its exception, is applied more expansively for cases involving sex offenses or charges of sex offenses than nonsex offenses. And [our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Supreme] Court indicates that the general rule is that the rule announced in \u00a7 4-5 is more narrowly and stringently applied to instances that do not involve sex crimes or sex offenses.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\">\u201cThe [Supreme] Court in that decision . . . proceeded at length to indicate that the exception to the general rule, common plan or scheme is fairly narrow.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> And in this court\u2019s view, the narrowness of that exception has a purpose. And its purpose is not to allow the exception to consume . . . the general rule, which is to prohibit evidence of such bad acts to prove that an individual committed an act at issue or has a criminal or wrongful propensity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The court summarized two scenarios discussed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>supra, 284 Conn. 343, in which the common scheme or plan is applied under \u00a7 4-5 of the code of evidence, to wit: \u201cthe first [type of scheme] is where the conduct at issue is so similar to the conduct alleged in the complaint that it represents a signature. . . . Thus, as a general exception to the general rule, evidence of other conspiracies of the conspirators charged with conduct alleged in the complaint may, therefore, be admissible under the signature exception.\u201d The court also relied on <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Maislen, </em>116 Conn. 433, 165 A. 455 (1933) (conspiracy to defraud seller of real property), which \u201cstands for the general proposition [that] when a civil conspiracy has been alleged, evidence of other conspiracies by the conspirators may be admitted when those [other] conspiracies . . . factually are such that they may be viewed as a signature of the alleged conduct at issue.\u201d See id., 439 (\u201c[t]o render it admissible as evidence against those participating [in the alleged conspiracy], it is sufficient if a method and scheme of the same character and nature was used in the other transaction as was used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>in that practiced on the plaintiff\u2019). The court also explained that \u201c[t]he second scenario addressed . . . in <em>Randolph </em>is when the separate events are such that they may be viewed as being an integral part of an overarching plan explicitly conceived and executed by the conspirators.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The court then ruled on the plaintiffs proffer of evidence regarding the sale of Kasper Group, Inc., to Professional Services Group. \u201c[T]he claim is that concerted activity or conspiratorial acts were committed to accomplish an interference with contractual relations. Based on the offer of proof provided by the plaintiff, the evidence involving Professional Services Group is not evidence of such an integral part of the plan to accomplish interference with contractual relations as alleged in this case .... [The] plaintiff has not shown that any exceptions under \u00a7 4-5 (b) [of the code of evidence] are applicable.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The court sustained the defendants\u2019 objections to other proffered evidence of prior misconduct on the ground of relevance. See footnote 46 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">On the basis of our review of the record and the law; see <em>State </em>v. Randolph, supra, 284 Conn. 338-61; we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in precluding the evidence of Kasper\u2019s alleged prior misconduct. The proffered evidence, even if true, was evidence of a general pattern of corruption among the defendants for personal gain; it was not related to the city\u2019s termination of the development agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The plaintiff also claims that it was improper for the court not to consider evidence of certain misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>on the part of the Lenocis and their financial status when awarding the plaintiff punitive damages under CUTPA.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> We disagree that the court improperly excluded evidence that was not relevant to the claims alleged in the second revised complaint and that the court did not carefully weigh the factors to be considered when awarding CUTPA punitive damages. \u201cAn award of punitive damages is discretionary, and the exercise of such discretion will not ordinarily be interfered with on appeal unless the abuse is manifest or injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Arnone </em>v. <em>Enfield, </em>79 Conn.

The court may, in its discretion, award punitive damages and may provide such equitable relief as it deems necessary or proper.\u201d \u201cThe language is clear and unambiguous; the awarding of punitive damages is within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Staehle v.

While the CUTPA statutes do not provide a method for determining punitive damages, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>courts generally award punitive damages in amounts equal to actual damages or multiples of the actual damages.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Advanced Financial Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Associated Appraisal Services, Inc., </em>79 Conn.

Punitive damages must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Whitaker </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>99 Conn. App. 719, 735, 916 A.2d 834 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The following facts are relevant to the plaintiffs claim. After the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on its CUTPA claim, the court held a hearing on July 24, 2008, regarding punitive damages to be awarded to the plaintiff. During the coruse of the hearing, the plaintiff sought to introduce evidence through the testimony of the Lenocis that they made payments to a city zoning official with respect to a supermarket on Dewhirst Street and to municipal officials in other cities in order to obtain approvals for construction projects. The defendants objected to the testimony as irrelevant. The court sustained the objections and excluded evidence of the Lenocis\u2019 alleged bribery as not directly related to the failure of the Steel Point project. In that regard, Lenoci, Sr., testified that he knew Pinto was paid to take care of Ganim, and Lenoci, Jr., testified that the Lenocis paid Pinto and Ganim for each square foot of development that the city awarded to them.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The plaintiff, also, presented evidence of the Lenocis\u2019 net worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The plaintiff sought an award of $5 million in punitive damages from each of the Lenocis. The Lenocis argued that no punitive damages should be awarded against them because their acts did not rise to the level of wilful, wanton or reckless conduct. In the alternative, the Lenocis argued that punitive damages should not exceed the jury\u2019s award of compensatory damages, or $20,000.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>After the plaintiff and the Lenocis submitted post-hearing briefs, the court issued its ruling in a memorandum of decision on October 31, 2008. Although the Lenocis had argued that the evidence against them failed to support an award of punitive damages, the court found that their position did not \u201csquare with the jury\u2019s verdict,\u201d as \u201cthe jury found that the Lenoci defendants violated CUTPA by soliciting, accepting, paying or promising to pay bribes in order to tamper with, interfere or deny the plaintiffs development of Steel Point. The [Lenocis\u2019] deliberate interference with the plaintiffs legitimate contract rights through conduct involving bribes to a public official is reprehensible behavior and evidences a reckless indifference to the rights of another sufficient to support an award of punitive damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court abused its discretion in not awarding it $5 million in punitive damages against each of the Lenocis because the court was wedded to a damages multiplier that bore no relation to the severity of the Lenocis\u2019 conduct, did not consider the Lenocis\u2019 misconduct in having bribed other city officials and officials in other municipalities and did not consider the Lenocis\u2019 wealth. The Lenocis argue that the court did not abuse its discretion with respect to the punitive damages it awarded the plaintiff under CUTPA.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">We first address the plaintiffs claim that the court improperly failed to consider evidence of the Lenocis having bribed public officials. Section 42-1 lOg (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, <em>as a result of the use or employment of </em>a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>method, act or practice prohibited by section 42-110b, may bring an action ... to recover actual damages. . . . [Although CUTPA includes a number of provisions that serve to encourage private litigation . . . the opportunities for private enforcement are not unlimited. . . . The plain language of \u00a7 42-1 lOg (a) provides one limitation by requiring that the plaintiff suffer an ascertainable loss that was caused by the alleged unfair trade practice.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Haesche </em>v. <em>Kissner, </em>229 Conn. 213, 223-24, 640 A.2d 89 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">As we explained in part IA of this opinion in affirming the court\u2019s preclusion of evidence that was not related to the allegations of the second revised complaint, when considering punitive damages, the evidence must be relevant, or directly related to the plaintiffs ascertainable loss. Evidence of the Lenocis\u2019 having paid off zoning officers for approvals of construction projects elsewhere in the city or bribing officials in other municipalities, as reprehensible as it may be, is not relevant to the losses the plaintiff sustained with regard to the Steel Point project. We completely agree with the plaintiff\u2019s position that the Lenocis\u2019 conduct in bribing officials is reprehensible and violates \u201cthe public\u2019s trust in our elected officials . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bergin, </em>214 Conn. 657, 662, 574 A.2d 164 (1990). Again, as noted in part I A of this opinion, in bringing this action, the plaintiff was not acting as a private attorney general but was seeking damages for the losses it sustained with respect to the Steel Point project. The jury found that the Lenoci defendants tortiously interfered with the plaintiffs contractual rights and that the Lenocis violated CUTPA. Paragraph 80 of the second revised complaint alleges wrongdoing on the part of the defendants that resulted in the termination of the development agreement and the plaintiffs being ousted from the Steel Point project. As a matter of law, we cannot conclude that the Lenocis\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>conduct in bribing public officials for construction projects that were unrelated to Steel Point caused the plaintiff an ascertainable loss. Compare <em>Abrahams </em>v. <em>Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., </em>supra, 240 Conn. 307 (addressing foreseeable injuries in bribery cases).<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">We now turn to the plaintiffs argument that the court was wedded to a simple multiplier and failed to consider the Lenocis\u2019 wealth in awarding punitive damages. We point out that the court\u2019s memorandum of decision demonstrates that it was well informed of the factors to be considered when assessing punitive damages under CUTPA. The court discussed at length the legal issues, both state and federal, that must be considered. The court observed that \u201cthe nature of the [Lenocis\u2019] conduct, the actual harm to the plaintiff and the harm the [Lenocis] intended to inflict are all relevant considerations. As compared to punitive damages under Connecticut common law, punitive damages under CUTPA are focused on deterrence, rather than mere compensation. [See] <em>Lenz </em>v. <em>CNA Assurance Co., </em>[supra, 42 Conn. Sup. 514]. Consequently, the defendants\u2019 financial condition is a relevant consideration. \u2018Once deterrence rather than compensation becomes the focus of CUTPA punitive damages . . . then the financial standing of the party against whom damages are sought becomes relevant and material.\u2019 Id., 516.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The court looked to prior opinions of this court for guidance. It found that \u201cthe Appellate Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>observed that awarding an amount equal to the plaintiffs actual damages \u2018is a recognized method for determining punitive damages under CUTPA. ... It is not an abuse of discretion to award punitive damages based on a multiple of actual damages.\u2019 (Citation omitted.) <em>Staehl </em>v. <em>Michael\u2019s Garage, Inc., </em>[supra, 35 Conn. App. 463]. \u2018[C]ourts generally award punitive damages in amounts equal to actual damages or multiples of the actual damages.\u2019 . . . <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Colonial Cemeteries, Inc., </em>[53 Conn. App. 646, 649, 734 A.2d 1010 (1999)]. Indeed, it appears that in terms of consistency or frequency, punitive damages awards under CUTPA are generally equal to or twice the amount of the compensatory award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The court also considered the analysis of punitive damages in the federal courts and federal constitutional concerns. In <em>Exxon Shipping Co. </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>554 U.S. 471, 515, 128 S. Ct. 2605, 171 L. Ed. 2d 570 (2008) (imposing 1:1 ratio of punitive to compensatory damages in maritime case for reckless conduct),<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court addressed its concern about the tension between the function of punitive damages and the unpredictability of high punitive damages awards.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Id., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>502. In this case, the court concluded that it may consider \u201cthe need for at least a modicum of predictability and consistency in the amount of CUTPA punitive awards.\u201d Moreover, the court found that \u201cin determining the amount of punitive damages, the court may consider that a frequent or consistent range of punitive damages awarded under CUTPA is a ratio that is equal to or twice the amount of the compensatory damages, and that particularly when it is claimed that the award should exceed this range, the award ordinarily should be premised on aggravating factors that are identifiable and articulable. . . . [W]hen \u2018high\u2019 punitive damages are being claimed, a consideration of the normative range of punitive awards and an identification of articulable, aggravating factors supporting an award outside this range are wholly consistent with a reasonable exercise of the court\u2019s discretion to award punitive damages that are rationale, predictable and consistent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The court, then, as directed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Exxon Shipping Co., </em>identified the factors that militate in favor of a high, rather than a low, award of punitive damages in this case, specifically \u201cthe illegal and deliberate nature of the [Lenocis\u2019] conduct; the general policy inimical to the bribing of public officials; the financial wealth of the [Lenocis]<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> and the potential breadth of the consequences of an effort or plan to interfere with a property development agreement as expansive and monumental as the plaintiffs Steel Point project.\u201d The court also considered the actual loss suffered by the plaintiff and how the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>compensatory damages awarded the plaintiff militates against a high punitive damage award. The court found that although the Steel Point project \u201ccontemplated a multimilhon-dollar construction and the plaintiff sought more than $2 million in compensatory damages, the jury awarded only $10,000 against each of the Lenoci defendants in actual damages for the CUTPA violations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">The court found that \u201camong the more vexing, competing considerations presented to the court in determining the amount of the punitive award in this case is, on one hand, the issue of deterrence, particularly in light of the [Lenocis\u2019] financial net worth, and on the other hand, the issue of the overall reasonableness and rationality of a high punitive award in light of the amount of the plaintiffs actual recovery and the considerations highlighted by <em>[Exxon Shipping Co. </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>supra, 554 U.S. 471] . . . [and] note[d] that because neither compensation nor enrichment is a valid purpose of punitive damages, an award should not be so large as to constitute a windfall to the individual litigant. <em>Vasbinder </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>976 F.2d 118, 121 (2d Cir. 1992).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The court also was mindful that, in addition to statutory factors bearing on its discretion, a broader, threshold consideration is that high punitive awards may implicate constitutional concerns. In <em>Bristol Technology, Inc. </em>v. <em>Microsoft Corp., </em>114 F. Sup. 2d 59 (D. Conn. 2000), vacated on other grounds, 250 F.3d 152 (2d Cir. 2001) , the District Court stated, \u201cthe United States Constitution imposes a substantive limit on the size of punitive damages awards. . . . This is because [p]unitive damages pose an acute danger of arbitrary deprivation of property. . . . Still, [i]n our federal system, States necessarily have considerable flexibility in determining the level of punitive damages that they will allow in different classes of cases and in any particular case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>. . . Only when an award [of punitive damages] can fairly be categorized as grossly excessive in relation to [the State\u2019s legitimate interests in punishment and deterrence] does it enter the zone of arbitrariness that violates [dueprocess].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">To satisfy federal due process concerns, the United States Supreme Court has \u201cinstructed courts reviewing punitive damages to consider three guideposts: (1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s misconduct; (2) the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and (3) the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.\u201d <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>supra, 538 U.S. 418. The court in this case sought additional guidance with regard to applicability of the second factor, the disparity between the actual and potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the contemplated punitive award.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The United States Supreme Court has \u201cbeen reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio between harm, or potential harm, to the plaintiff and the punitive damages award. . . . We decline again to impose a bright-line ratio which a punitive damages award cannot exceed. Our jurisprudence and the principles it has now established demonstrate, however, that, in practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process. In <em>[Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Haslip, </em>499 U.S. 1, 23-24, 111 S. Ct. 1032, 113 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1991)], in upholding a punitive damages award, we concluded that an award of more than four times the amount of compensatory damages might be close to the line of constitutional impropriety. . . . We cited that 4-to-l ratio again in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number><em>[BMW of North America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gore, </em>517 U.S. 559, 581, 116 S. Ct. 1589, 134 L. Ed. 2d 809 (1996)]. The Court further referenced a long legislative history, dating back over 700 years and going forward to today, providing for sanctions of double, treble, or quadruple damages to deter and punish. . . . While these ratios are not binding, they are instructive. They demonstrate what should be obvious: Single-digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process, while still achieving the State\u2019s goals of deterrence and retribution, than awards with ratios in range of 500 to 1 ... .</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u201cNonetheless, because there are no rigid benchmarks that a punitive damages award may not surpass, ratios greater than those we have previously upheld may comport with due process where a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages. . . . The converse is also true, however. When compensatory damages are substantial, then a lesser ratio, perhaps only equal to compensatory damages, can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee. The precise award in any case, of course, must be based upon the fact and circumstances of the defendant\u2019s conduct and the harm to the plaintiff.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State Farm Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>supra, 538 U.S. 424-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">After considering and balancing the issues presented in this case, the court awarded the plaintiff six times the actual damages, or $60,000 in punitive damages against both Lenoci, Sr., and Lenoci, Jr. We also cannot agree with the plaintiffs claim that the court was wedded to a simple multiplier when awarding punitive damages. The court clearly articulated its findings with regard to factors militating in favor of a high and a low punitive damages award, including the Lenocis\u2019 wealth, their reprehensible acts and the deterrent purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>CUTPA punitive damages awards. It awarded the plaintiff punitive damages that were six times the actual damages awarded by the jury. The plaintiff takes exception to that amount because it was seeking $5 million from each of the Lenocis. The plaintiff, however, cannot escape the fact that the jury awarded it only $10,000 in compensable damages. Section 42-1 lOg permits the court, <em>in its discretion, </em>to award punitive damages in relation to ascertainable loss. For the foregoing reasons, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in carefully crafting the punitive damages award of $60,000 against each of the Lenocis.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">DEFENDANTS\u2019 CROSS APPEALS</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The following procedural history is relevant to the cross appeals of the Lenoci defendants and Ganim. In 2001, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (federal action). In the federal action, the plaintiff alleged claims against the defendants under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO); see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 et seq.; violation of its civil rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and various state statutory and common-law causes of action. The defendants filed motions to dismiss the federal action for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6). The district court, Nevas, J., found that the plaintiff had failed to allege facts sufficient to establish standing under RICO; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964 (c); and to state a civil rights claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Judge Nevas therefore granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the federal action without prejudice and declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the plaintiff\u2019s state law claims. Because the plaintiff had represented that it had obtained information and evidence from Ganim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>federal criminal trial, Judge Nevas granted the plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint within thirty days. The plaintiff, however, did not plead over. On September 29, 2003, judgment was rendered in favor of the defendants in the federal action.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">In December, 2003, the plaintiff commenced the present action, in which it alleged the same state causes of action that it had alleged in the federal action. At paragraph 21 of the original and second revised complaint, the plaintiff alleged: \u201cThe plaintiff originally filed this action in Federal District Court, in Bridgeport on November 19, 2001. On September 22, 2003, the district court, per Honorable Alan Nevas, dismissed without prejudice a portion of plaintiff\u2019s complaint which gave the federal court jurisdiction, and then using its discretion refused to exercise jurisdiction over the state law claims. The plaintiff refiles this complaint containing the state court claims pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 52-592.\u201d Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">On cross appeal, the Lenoci defendants claim that the trial court improperly denied their motion for a directed verdict in which they asserted that the plaintiff could not prevail, as a matter of law, as its claims were barred by (1) the doctrine of collateral estoppel and (2) the statute of limitations. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">The following procedural history is relevant to the Lenoci defendants\u2019 cross appeal. When they responded to the plaintiff\u2019s second revised complaint,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> the Lenoci <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>defendants alleged by way of special defense that the plaintiffs tortious interference with contractual relations and CUTPA claims were barred by the statute of limitations<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> and the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel. The plaintiff filed a single general denial to all of the Lenoci defendants\u2019 special defenses.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the presentation of evidence, the Lenoci defendants moved for a directed verdict on the basis of those special defenses. The court denied the motions for a directed verdict as to the statute of limitations special defense, concluding that the plaintiffs action was saved by the accidental failure of suit statute, \u00a7 52-592.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> After the court heard argument with respect to the res judicata and collateral estoppel special defenses, it concluded that the doctrine of res judicata did not apply<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> and reserved judgment regarding the doctrine of collateral estoppel special defense. Ultimately, the court denied the motion for a directed verdict on the ground of collateral estoppel and also denied the Lenoci defendants\u2019 motions to set aside the verdict predicated on the same ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Ordinarily, \u201c[t]he proper appellate standard of review when considering the action of a trial court granting or denying a motion to set aside a verdict . . . [is] the abuse of discretion standard.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tornaquindici </em>v. <em>Keggi, </em>94 Conn. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>828, 833, 894 A.2d 1019 (2006). \u201cA verdict may be directed where the decisive question is one of law . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>104 Conn. App. 824, 827, 936 A.2d 241 (2007), cert. denied, 286 Conn. 920, 949 A.2d 481 (2008). The questions presented by the Lenoci defendants in their cross appeal raise questions of law. See <em>Blackwell </em>v. <em>Mahmood, </em>120 Conn. App. 690, 694, 992 A.2d 1219 (2010) (collateral estoppel question of law); <em>Vanliner Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>98 Conn. App. 125, 139, 907 A.2d 1220 (2006) (whether claim barred by statute of limitations question of law). The plenary standard of review applies when appellate courts review questions of law. See <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Cerullo, </em>282 Conn. 109, 118, 918 A.2d 867 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The Lenoci defendants claim that the court improperly denied their motions for a directed verdict predicated on the doctrine of collateral estoppel because the plaintiffs claims were litigated in the federal action. They further contend that, in denying their motions for a directed verdict and to set aside the jury verdict, the court improperly concluded that the standard necessary to prove proximate cause under RICO is different from that required to prove common-law proximate cause, which is applicable to the plaintiffs tortious interference and CUTPA claims.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\u201cCollateral estoppel means simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit. . . . To assert successfully the doctrine of issue preclusion, therefore, a party must establish that the issue sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>to be foreclosed actually was litigated and determined in the prior action between the parties or their privies, and that the determination was essential to the decision in the prior case.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vanliner Ins.

App. 683, 686, 886 A.2d 850 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In its memorandum of decision issued on October 31, 2008, the court noted with regard to the plaintiffs federal action that Judge Nevas had found that the plaintiff lacked standing to maintain a RICO action; see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964 (c);<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> because it failed to satisfy RICO\u2019s stringent proximate cause requirement.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> In seeking a directed verdict, the Lenoci defendants argued that the factual basis of the plaintiffs RICO claim is the same basis of its state law claims and because Judge Nevas concluded that the plaintiffs RICO claim failed on the element of proximate cause, the issue had been litigated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>and the plaintiff is collaterally estopped from relitigating it in the present action. In denying the motions for a directed verdict and to set the verdict aside, the court, however, concluded that the standard required to prove proximate cause under RICO is different from the standard necessary to prove common-law proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u201cThe application of the collateral estoppel doctrine may not be proper when the burden of proof or legal standards differ between the first and subsequent actions. See, e.g., <em>Bath Iron Works Corp. </em>v. <em>Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>125 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 1997) (\u2018[c]ertainly a difference in the legal standards pertaining to two proceedings may defeat the use of collateral estoppel . . .

The court found persuasive a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, <em>Lerner </em>v. <em>Fleet Bank, N.A., </em>459 F.3d 273 (2d Cir. 2006).<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The Lenoci defendants contend that the court\u2019s decision is contrary to the weight of authority that the proximate cause standard under RICO is the same as that required under the common law.

RICO\u2019s use of the clause by reason of has been held to limit standing to those plaintiffs who allege that the asserted RICO violation was the legal, or proximate, cause of their injury, as well as a logical, or but for, cause.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 283-84. \u201cWhen a plaintiff brings suit under RICO\u2014as with any suit on a statute\u2014 he or she must show both that he [or she] is within the class the statute sought to protect and that the harm done was one that the statute was meant to prevent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 284. In this context, proximate causation takes on a meaning different from its meaning at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u201cAt common law, so long as the plaintiff category is foreseeable, there is no requirement that the risk of injury to the plaintiff, and the risk of the harm that actually occurred, were what made the defendant\u2019s actions wrongful in the first place. With statutory claims, the issue is, instead, one of statutory intent: was the plaintiff (even though foreseeably injured) in the category the statute meant to protect, and was the harm that occurred (again, even if foreseeable), the mischief the statute sought to avoid.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Abrahams </em>v. <em>Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., </em>supra, 79 F.3d 237. \u201c[T]he use of no proximate cause language as the ground for dismissal in statutory cases frequently leads to confusion when the issue of proximate cause is raised in related common law claims because the phrase proximate cause may cover a greater or lesser swath of injuries and victims when used in the statutory context.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lemerv. Fleet Bank, N.A., </em>supra, 459 F.3d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">In <em>Lemer, </em>the Second Circuit held that when plaintiffs have not \u201cpleaded facts sufficient to support a finding of proximate cause in the RICO action, [that] does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>necessarily mean that their injuries were, under the facts alleged, not proximately caused by the [defendants\u2019] actions for purposes of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the common law.\u201d Id. The Court of Appeals \u201cconcluded that the plaintiff could not bring a RICO suit because he was neither an intended target of the scheme nor an intended beneficiary of the laws prohibiting it. . . . But we also concluded that the RICO ruling is not dispositive of [the plaintiffs\u2019] negligence claim. . . . [T]he duty to act with reasonable care establishes a general standard of conduct and is not limited to protecting certain classes of person[s] from particular kinds of harms.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 284-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u201cEven when stemming from the same fact pattern, then, proximate causation may be present or absent depending on the cause of action under which the plaintiff brings suit. . . . [W]e [have] concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries were not proximately caused by the defendants\u2019 <em>racketeering activity, </em>not that their injuries were not proximately caused by the defendants\u2019 <em>conduct. . . . </em>[W]e have . . . interpreted our decision ... to stand for the proposition that a plaintiff does not have standing if he suffered an injury that was indirectly (and hence not proximately) caused by the racketeering activity or RICO predicate acts, <em>even though the injury was proximately caused by some non-RICO violations committed by the defendants. . . . </em>RICO and common law-claims will often depend on different chains of causation stemming from the same underlying conduct.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">On the basis of our review of the federal law on the standard of proximate cause applied in RICO cases and the standard applicable to common-law proximate cause; see <em>Paige </em>v. <em>St. Andrew\u2019s Roman Catholic </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number><em>Church Corp., </em>supra, 250 Conn. 25;<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the plaintiffs state statutory and common-law claims were not actually litigated in the federal action and consequently were not barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. We first note that Judge Nevas declined to assume pendent jurisdiction over the state\u2019s claims. Second, the proximate cause standards for tortious interference and CUTPA are distinguishable from the RICO proximate cause standard. For these reasons, the Lenoci defendants\u2019 claim that the court improperly concluded that the plaintiffs claims were not barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The Lenoci defendants also claim that the court improperly determined that the plaintiffs claims were not barred by the statute of limitations by concluding that the claims were saved by the accidental failure of suit statute, \u00a7 52-592.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>\u201cDeemed a saving statute, \u00a7 52-592 enables plaintiffs to bring new causes of action despite the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. ...

App. 540, 553, 915 A.2d 314, cert. denied, 282 Conn. 902, 919 A.2d 1037 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">At the conclusion of evidence, the Lenoci defendants moved for a directed verdict, claiming, in part, that the plaintiffs claims were barred by the statute of limitations. The court rendered an oral decision, finding that the Lenoci defendants had alleged a statute of limitations defense to the plaintiffs intentional interference and CUTPA claims against them, which are governed by a three year statute of limitations. The Lenoci defendants argued that the dismissal of the plaintiffs federal action did not fall within the protection afforded by \u00a7 52-592 because the federal action was dismissed without prejudice<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> and the plaintiffs failure to plead over essentially was a voluntary withdrawal. In <em>Southport Manor Convalescent Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>216 Conn. 11,16-17, 578 A.2d 646 (1990), our Supreme Court held that \u201c[i]n determining whether [to grant a motion to dismiss], the inquiry usually does not extend to the merits of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>case. . . . The decision [granting a motion to dismiss] is rendered in the form of a final judgment dismissing the action. . . . [H]owever, only the present action has been terminated and no decision on the merits has been made. In some situations the plaintiff by amendment may cure the defect and have the case reinstated. In others, the plaintiff can proceed only by initiating a new action.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In ruling on the motion for a directed verdict, the court construed the language of Judge Nevas\u2019 ruling on the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the federal action and the judgment entered by the clerk. The court concluded that the plaintiffs federal action was dismissed for failure to prosecute, as the \u201cdismissal here was not entirely or fully voluntary. The dismissal was clearly definitive, and it was not curable as a matter of right.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> The court found that it was unclear, as a matter of law, whether an amended complaint, if one had been filed, would have cured the deficiencies in the federal action. See <em>Daoust </em>v. McWilliams, 49 Conn. App. 715, 721, 716 A.2d 922 (1998) (plaintiff may pursue state law claims dismissed without prejudice in federal court).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">On appeal, the Lenoci defendants claim that the plaintiff should not be able to rely on the accidental failure of suit statute because the plaintiff failed to plead the statute in its reply to their statute of limitations special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>defense. They rely on <em>Beckenstein Enterprises-Prestige Park, LLC </em>v. <em>Keller, </em>115 Conn. App. 680, 690-91, 974 A.2d 764, cert. denied, 293 Conn. 916, 979 A.2d 488 (2009), to support their position. Given the procedural history of this case, the Lenoci defendants cannot prevail under <em>Beckenstein Enterprises-Prestige Park, LLC, </em>which states, in relevant part, \u201c[w]hile it has been suggested that it might be desirable for the plaintiff to plead sufficient facts necessary to bring the matter within the purview of \u00a7 52-592 . . . [our Supreme Court] has never held this to be a requirement. ... It has been and is the holding of [our Supreme Court] that matters in avoidance of the Statute of Limitations need not be pleaded in the complaint but only in response to such a defense properly raised.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 690. Although a plaintiff need not allege in its complaint facts sufficient to bring a cause of action within the purview of \u00a7 52-592, our Supreme Court has never held that a plaintiff who does allege such facts in its complaint has failed to invoke the protection of the accidental failure of suit statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In this matter, the plaintiff alleged at paragraph 21 of its complaint and second revised complaint that it had commenced an action in the District Court that was dismissed without prejudice and that it was bringing the present action containing state law claims pursuant to \u00a7 52-592.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> By virtue of this allegation, the issue was before the court. Our Supreme Court has stated, indirectly, that \u201c\u00a7 52-592 is considered to be a matter to be pleaded in avoidance of a statute of limitations special defense.\u201d Id., 690-91. The trial court, therefore, properly concluded that \u00a7 52-592 applied to the plaintiff s cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>of action and denied the Lenoci defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict predicated on its statute of limitations special defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">In his cross appeal, Ganim claims that the court improperly (1) awarded punitive damages that are arbitrary and excessive, (2) concluded that the plaintiff had presented sufficient evidence to prevail on its claim of fraudulent misrepresentation and (3) concluded that the plaintiffs claims were not barred by the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The plaintiff alleged four counts against Ganim; see footnote 4 of this opinion; and Ganim filed motions to strike all four of those counts. The court granted the motions to strike the counts that alleged breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and a violation of CUTPA, and granted his motion for summary judgment on the statutory theft count. On May 1, 2008, near the conclusion of evidence, the court granted Ganim\u2019s motion to amend his answer, thereby permitting him to allege that the remaining claim against him was barred by the statute of limitations. On May 5, 2008, Ganim filed a motion for a directed verdict pursuant to \u00a7 52-577, which the court denied. On June 6, 2008, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on the count of fraudulent misrepresentation and awarded the plaintiff $182,000 in compensatory damages. On July 18, 2003, Ganim filed a memorandum of law in support of his motion to set aside the verdict, claiming that the plaintiffs claimed reliance was not reasonable and justifiable as a matter of law. On July 24, 2008, the court held a hearing to determine common-law punitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>damages as to Ganim. In a memorandum of decision issued on October 31, 2008, the court rejected Ganim\u2019s statute of limitations defense and justifiable reliance argument and awarded the plaintiff punitive damages of $210,039 less taxable costs.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Additional facts will be addressed as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Ganim claims that the court\u2019s award of common-law punitive damages was arbitrary and unreasonably excessive. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u201cIn an action for fraud, the plaintiffs are entitled to punitive damages, in addition to general and special damages. . . . The [purpose] of awarding punitive damages is not to punish the defendant for his offense, but to compensate the plaintiff for his injuries. . . . The rule in this state as to torts is that punitive damages are awarded when the evidence shows a reckless indifference to the rights of others or an intentional and wanton violation of those rights. ... An award of punitive damages is discretionary, and the exercise of such discretion will not ordinarily be interfered with on appeal unless the abuse is manifest or injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Whitaker </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>supra, 99 Conn. App. 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Ganim claims on cross appeal that the court\u2019s $155,439 award of costs, as part of the punitive damages award against him, calculated as 42 percent of the plaintiffs costs of prosecuting the fraudulent misrepresentation claim, should be set aside as arbitrary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>unreasonable. He contends that the \u201coverarching rationale for an award of punitive damages for a civil wrong is to vindicate the public\u2019s interest, and not that of a particular plaintiff,\u201d citing <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Alamo Management Co., </em>221 Conn. 674, 679, 607 A.2d 370 (1992).<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> Ganim argues that the public\u2019s interest in punishing him was vindicated by the jury\u2019s award of consequential damages and the criminal penalties imposed on him by the federal court.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> <em>Freeman, </em>however, is not on point, as the issue there was whether \u201cin an action for unlawful entry and detainer under General Statutes \u00a7 47a-43 (a) (3), entitlement to an award of statutory punitive damages, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 47a-46, may be established by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Id., 675. The amount of damages that could be awarded in <em>Freeman </em>was established by statute; id., 680; not in accordance with the court\u2019s discretion, as is the case here. See <em>Whitaker </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>supra, 99 Conn. App. 730. Moreover, the federal criminal sentence imposed on Ganim pertained, not to fraudulent misrepresentations the jury found he made to Conroy, but for the \u201c \u2018$1 per square foot\u2019 agreement\u201d he had with Pinto and the Lenocis.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">In accordance with the parties\u2019 stipulation; see footnote 76 of this opinion; the court found that the jury\u2019s finding of fraudulent misrepresentation was premised on Ganim\u2019s false representations concerning the Steel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Point project. The court noted that \u201cConnecticut courts have . . . consistently limited punitive or exemplary damage awards in Connecticut to costs in excess of taxable costs.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Alamo Management Co., </em>supra, 221 Conn. 680. The plaintiff was seeking punitive damages of attorney\u2019s fees that were consistent with its fee agreement with counsel and $370,092 in costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">On the basis of the jury\u2019s finding against Ganim on the plaintiffs fraudulent misrepresentation claim, the court was satisfied that the plaintiff had proven a reckless indifference to its contractual and business interests to warrant an award of punitive damages against Ganim. The court further found that the plaintiffs fee agreement with counsel was 30 percent of the first $6 million recovered and therefore the plaintiff was seeking $54,600 in attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> The court agreed with the plaintiff that it could consider its fee agreement with counsel to determine its award of attorney\u2019s fees. We conclude that the court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees did not constitute an abuse of its discretion, as it is consistent with the guidance provided by our Supreme Court. See, e.g., <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 210, 268-70, 828 A.2d 64 (2003); <em>Sorrentino v. All Seasons Services, Inc., </em>245 Conn. 756, 773-77, 717 A.2d 150 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The court found, however, that the plaintiffs claim for $370,092 in costs reflected the total of the costs the plaintiff incurred to prosecute the entire litigation, but that the plaintiff prevailed on only one of the claims it alleged against Ganim, fraudulent misrepresentation, and that that claim was not inextricably intertwined with the claims against the city and other defendants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>In applying the Connecticut rule that punitive damages are limited to the prevailing party\u2019s litigation expenses, the court concluded that it would not be an appropriate exercise of its discretion to award the plaintiff all of the costs it incurred when the majority of those expenses were incurred to pursue claims that it lost and were not related to the claims on which it prevailed. On the basis of the court\u2019s \u201cevaluation of the totality of the relevant considerations,\u201d it concluded that the plaintiff should recover 42 percent of its costs as part of the punitive damages award. It awarded the plaintiff punitive damages against Ganim in the amount of $210,039, consisting of $54,600 in attorney\u2019s fees and $155,439 for costs.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">On cross appeal, Ganim claims that the 42 percent factor the court used to calculate the award of costs against him is arbitrary and unreasonable because the court did not provide a bona fide reason to assess against him and the Lenoci defendants each 42 percent of the plaintiffs costs, despite the \u201cobvious differences\u201d in the quantum of proof and the different rationales at play between the plaintiffs verdict as against the Lenoci defendants and as against him. In its memorandum of decision awarding punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees under CUTPA, the court stated in detail the factors it considered with regard to the propose of punitive damages, the plaintiffs success and the interrelatedness of its claims. Those evaluative factors apply equally to the Lenoci defendants and to Ganim. It is true, however, that the court did not distinguish between the Lenoci defendants and Ganim and explain why it applied the same 42 percent factor to both sets of defendants. Ganim, however, failed to seek an articulation.

We disagree, as the claim is controlled by the general verdict rule.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">On cross appeal, Ganim claims that any reliance by the plaintiff on representations he made after it received notice of termination of the development agreement clearly was not reasonable or justified. The court denied the motion because it could not determine from the record, and on the basis of the general verdict rule,<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> at what point in time the jury found that Ganim had made fraudulent misrepresentations on which the plaintiff relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the jury reasonably could have found that Ganim promised Conroy that he would work together with the plaintiff and that Ganim appeared to support the Steel Point project and wanted to work with Conroy. Ganim encouraged public financing of the project and tried to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>help Conroy find financing partners. When Conroy\u2019s financial partner, Lend Lease, withdrew, Ganim reassured Conroy of the city\u2019s continued interest in working with him. After signing the second development agreement and as the August, 1999 deadline approached, Ganim encouraged Conroy to keep working. There were design meetings in early 2000 after which Ganim told Conroy to pursue the Steel Point project and that he supported Conroy. Beginning in April, 1999, however, Ganim had an agreement with the Lenocis that they would pay him $1 for each square foot of development in the city that was awarded to the Lenocis. When Conroy brought Taubman to the Steel Point project, Ganim initially reacted positively but, within weeks, the city sent Conroy a termination notice. After Conroy received the termination notice, Ganim told him to pay no attention to the notice because it was sent by lawyers and that he, Ganim, was pleased that Taubman was involved. Ganim and Conroy thereafter attended meetings with the governor\u2019s staff and government agencies. Pinto testified about Ganim\u2019s ability to manipulate individuals to his benefit and that Ganim was using the plaintiff as a placeholder until he could move the Lenocis into the Steel Point project.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Ganim argues that in August, 2000, when the city terminated the development agreement, Conroy executed a written acknowledgment of the termination. In light of the termination, Ganim contends that no jury rationally could find that the plaintiff justifiably relied on any misrepresentation that he could have made concerning the plaintiffs involvement in the project. The court found Ganim\u2019s position problematic because there is no definitive or reliable basis to conclude that the representations that the jury found to be fraudulent were made after the city terminated the development agreement. No interrogatories were submitted to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>jury requesting that it identify the fraudulent misrepresentations it found Ganim made and when they were made. The court concluded that in the absence of specific findings, the plaintiff was entitled to rely on the general verdict rule. Because the jury reasonably could have relied on evidence of fraudulent representations made by Ganim prior to the time the city terminated the development agreement, the court properly denied his motion to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">b</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Ganim\u2019s last claim is that the court improperly denied his motion to set aside the verdict in which he claimed that the plaintiffs action was barred by the statute of limitations. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">At trial, Ganim relied, in part, on the same arguments made by the Lenoci defendants with regard to the statute of limitations. On cross appeal, in addition to the Lenoci arguments, which we addressed in part II A of this opinion, Ganim claims that the court improperly applied \u00a7 52-592 pursuant to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Daoust </em>v. <em>McWilliams, </em>supra, 49 Conn. App. 715. It is Ganim\u2019s position that \u00a7 52-595 does not apply because the plaintiff never alleged fraudulent misrepresentation in the federal action, but did so for the first time in the present action. The plaintiff contends that the claim is not properly before this court because Ganim waived it at trial.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Although Ganim raised the claim in a postverdict motion, he did not argue it to the jury and the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>did not charge the jury on the statute of limitations, we will address the claim because the court ruled on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">In its October 31, 2008 ruling on Ganim\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict, the court made the following findings. The gravamen of the second revised complaint against Ganim is that in 1998, the plaintiff entered into an agreement with the city to develop Steel Point. The court stated: \u201cAmong its claims, the plaintiff alleges that Ganim . . . had a secret plan with other defendants to oust the plaintiff as the developer of the project so that it could be replaced by . . . United Properties, Ltd. . . . According to the complaint, the Lenocis had agreed to pay bribes to Ganim in exchange for the selection of United Properties, Ltd., as the developer of Steel Point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The court also found that count eight of the second amended complaint alleges that \u201cGanim made fraudulent misrepresentations as part of this corrupt scheme. . . . [T]he jury was charged to consider whether Ganim made false statements concerning the status of the Steel Point project, the requirements to be fulfilled by the plaintiff, the manner in which project money was expended, or the time periods relating to demolition, destruction, or land acquisitions. The trial evidence establishes that on December 19, 2000, as part of a criminal investigation into Ganim\u2019s activities, the Federal Bureau of Investigation executed search and seizure warrants on various residences and establishments, including Ganim\u2019s office and personal residence. The evidence is undisputed that none of the alleged misrepresentations were made by Ganim to the plaintiff or its agents after the execution of these warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u201cBecause none of the alleged representations took place after December, 2000, and because the present action was not instituted until January, 2004, Ganim claims that the plaintiffs fraudulent misrepresentation claims [are] barred by the three year statute of limitations of ... \u00a7 52-577. \u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> The court noted, however, that the plaintiff had alleged that the present action was saved by the accidental failure of suit statute, \u00a7 52-592. The court then articulated the facts surrounding the federal actions. See part II A 1 of this opinion. After analyzing the procedural history of the federal and present actions, \u00a7 52-592 and <em>Daoust </em>v. <em>McWilliams, </em>supra, 49 Conn. App. 715, the court concluded that \u201cthere is no dispute that the claims for relief sought in the present case and the federal case all emanate from the same factual allegations, and, consequently, \u00a7 52-592 applies to extend the statute of limitations even though one such claim, fraudulent misrepresentation, was not asserted in the federal action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Section 52-592 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cIf any action, commenced within the time limited by law, has failed ... to be tried on its merits because . . . the action has been dismissed for want of jurisdiction . . . or for any matter of form . . . the plaintiff . . . may commence a new action . . . <em>for the same cause </em>at any time within one year after the determination of the original action . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court concluded that <em>Daoust </em>v. <em>McWilliams, </em>supra, 49 Conn. App. 715, was dispositive of the parties\u2019 opposing claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In <em>Daoust, </em>William J. Daoust, Jr., commenced an action in federal court, alleging violation of his civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988 and state law causes of action. Id., 717. The federal court, Covello, J., first granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and thereafter granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants with regard to all of Daoust\u2019s federal claims. Id., 718. Judge Covello declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Daoust\u2019s state law claims. Id. Within one year, Daoust commenced an action in the Superior Court, where the court, <em>Stanley, J., </em>granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, concluding that \u201cthe savings provisions of \u00a7 52-592 operate only to save the exact state law claims that were dismissed without prejudice in federal court, but do not permit the bringing of additional state law claims arising from the same set of facts.\u201d Id., 721. This court disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u201cSection 52-592 uses the words action and cause of action, and not claim, to refer to what is allowed to be brought under its provisions. Section 52-592 (a) provides that the plaintiff . . . may commence a new <em>action . . </em>. for the same <em>cause </em>.... Section 52-592 (d) provides that the above language applies] to . . . any <em>action </em>brought to the United States . . . district court for the district of Connecticut .... It is well settled that [a] cause of action is that single group of facts which is claimed to have brought about an unlawful injury to the plaintiff and which entitles the plaintiff to relief. ... A right of action at law arises from the existence of a primary right in the plaintiff, and an invasion of that right by some delict on the part of the defendant. The facts which establish the existence of that right and that delict constitute the cause of action. . . . Even though a single group of facts may give rise to rights for several different kinds of relief, it is still a single cause of action.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 721-22. This court concluded that because Daoust\u2019s \u201cclaims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>of assault and battery, spoliation of evidence, invasion of privacy and abuse of process are part of a new action ... for the same cause brought within one year after the determination of the original action, as required by \u00a7 52-592 (a), they are not barred by the three year statute of limitations.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">On cross appeal, Ganim contends that the trial court in the present action improperly determined that <em>Daoust </em>controls, but he failed to explain the basis of his argument. At oral argument, he claimed that there is no common nucleus of facts between the federal action and the present one. On the basis of our review of the allegations of fact in the federal action and the allegations in the second revised complaint, we disagree. See <em>O\u2019Halloran </em>v. <em>Charlotte Hungerford Hospital, </em>63 Conn. App. 460, 463, 776 A.2d 514 (2001) (construction of complaint question of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">On the basis of our review of the complaint in the federal action and the second revised complaint in the present action, we conclude that the court properly determined that the allegations of state law claims emanate from a common nucleus of facts.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> The court therefore properly denied Ganim\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>We conclude that the court thoughtfully resolved the issues presented and carefully exercised its discretion throughout the lengthy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-11\"> This litigation previously was before this court. On October 19, 2004, the plaintiff filed a one-count complaint claiming that the defendants violated the Connecticut Antitrust Act, General Statutes \u00a7 35-24 et seq., by engaging in an illegal conspiracy in restraint of trade. The court, <em>Alander, J., </em>granted the defendants\u2019 motion to strike, concluding that the plaintiff had failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>allege facts necessary to state a cause of action. The plaintiff filed an amended complaint, and six of the defendants filed motions to strike that complaint, \u201cclaiming that the plaintiff failed to allege any additional facts that could constitute a cognizable antitrust claim.\u201d The court, <em>Stevens, J., </em>granted the motions to strike, and the plaintiff appealed.

Paul J. Pinto was a close associate of Ganim\u2019s, having worked on Ganim\u2019s mayoral campaigns and, as a college intern, in Ganim\u2019s mayoral office. He was a Ganim fundraiser. From 1993 through 1999, Pinto was employed by Kasper Group, Inc., an architectural firm, and also by United Properties, Ltd., a real estate development firm, which was owned by Lenoci, Sr., Lenoci, Jr., Paul Lenoci and Michael Schinella.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">According to Pinto, the Lenocis wanted to obtain the development rights for the Steel Point project, as well as the site of the former Father Panik Village and the waterfront property directly across the river from Steel Point known as CarTech. The Lenocis intended to use the Father Panik Village and CarTech land as relocation sites for businesses that were displaced by the Steel Point project. Beginning in April, 1999, the Lenocis agreed to pay Pinto $1 for each square foot of development space in the city that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>obtained. Pinto shared those moneys with Ganim. The Lenocis also were providing Ganim with entertainment, meals, trips and shopping. They made substantial contributions to Ganim\u2019s political campaigns, as well. The Lenocis paid Pinto approximately $500,000 in consulting fees that were shared with Ganim. With regard to Steel Point, the city devoted significant time and effort to finding a developer, as it wanted the project to succeed in light of the city\u2019s recent bankruptcy. In October, 1997, the city selected the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in interest to redevelop Steel Point. The Conroy Development Company, which is owned by Alexius C. Conroy, was the principal, and Lend Lease, a large retail development firm from Australia, was its financial partner. According to Michael Freimuth, the director of the city\u2019s office of planning and economic development at the time, the plaintiffs \u201cproposal was presented as the largest proposal and one that would return to the public side the most benefits, that is, in the sense of jobs and taxes . . . .\u201d The key elements of the plaintiffs proposal were retail-entertainment facilities that would draw large numbers of people.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The initial goal of the plaintiff and the city was to obtain public funding from the legislature for the Steel Point project. They secured passage of a bill for $200 million in public financing that required contributions from the city. In June, 1998, the state bonding commission approved the initial $20 million in public financing, which was to be used to acquire, clear and remediate Steel Point and to construct utilities and bulkheads.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In the fall of 1998, the city and the plaintiff signed a development agreement, which required the plaintiff to make a commitment by March, 1999. The commitment date was later extended with Ganim\u2019s approval. In December, 1998, Lend Lease had second thoughts about the Steel Point project and withdrew. Joseph T. Kasper, Jr., whose firm, Kasper Group, Inc., had done the base plotting and map work at Steel Point for United Properties, Ltd., suggested to Conroy that he and the Lenocis become partners. Conroy rejected the suggestion on the basis of his prior experience working with the Lenocis.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The city sent the plaintiff a draft of the restated agreement in May, 1999, and a draft of the land disposition agreement on July 16, 1999. According to Conroy, the restated agreement contained numerous provisions that were not commercially reasonable, particularly with respect to Steel Point tenants. The city wanted (1) the right to approve or reject the tenants the plaintiff brought to Steel Point, (2) the plaintiff to disclose financial information regarding tenants before a lease was signed and (3) the plaintiff to waive its right to legal remedies, i.e., if the city \u201cis unable to transfer title and/or meet its obligations under the terms of the [restated development agreement], after using its best efforts, the [plaintiff] knowingly, voluntarily and upon advice of counsel, waives any and all rights to proceed to court.\u201d Conroy had never encountered such provisions in his experience as a developer. Negotiations with prospective tenants must remain confidential, and the city would not be a party to the lease. Moreover, the waiver, default and indemnification provisions were unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Conroy considered two other matters related to the project to be irregular. First, attorney Charles J. Willinger, Jr., represented the city with regard to the Steel Point project. Between 1998 and 2000, Willinger paid Pinto more than $100,000, as Ganim\u2019s intermediary, to obtain that legal work. Willinger also represented the Lenocis\u2019 business, United Properties, Ltd. Second, Conroy thought it was unusual that in early 1999, Ganim appointed the city\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>chief administrative officer, Dennis C. Murphy, to oversee the development of Steel Point. It was the only time in his thirteen years as the head of economic development that Freimuth was replaced on a development project.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">After Lend Lease withdrew from the Steel Point project, Conroy and CBL &amp; Associates Properties, Inc., a real estate developer, formed a joint venture in March, 1999. The August 31, 1999 deadline to sign the restated development agreement passed, but the city did not send Conroy a default notice. Ganim told Conroy that he wanted him to continue working on the Steel Point project. Conroy continued to meet with city officials to discuss infrastructure issues at Steel Point. Kasper again suggested to Conroy that he and the Lenocis become partners. Conroy declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Conroy found another financial partner in the Taubman Company, an organization that has managed more than 20 million square feet of mall space, with whom Conroy previously had worked. They signed a joint venture agreement on February 29, 2000. Immediately thereafter, Murphy wrote to Conroy on March 1, 2000, telling him that it was good that Conroy had found another partner, but because he had \u201cfailed to provide the city with a firm, irrevocable and legally binding commitment to build Phase One of the project, all agreements by and between all parties have been automatically terminated.\u201d According to Conroy, Ganim, however, continued to treat the plaintiff as the Steel Point developer and told Conroy to ignore Murphy\u2019s letter. Taubman conducted due diligence and in June, 2000, sent a commitment letter to the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">In June, 2000, Ganim added conditions to be fulfilled before the Steel Point project could move forward, including an irrevocable $10 million letter of credit from Taubman. Pinto described Ganim\u2019s demand for a letter of credit as leverage. One of the ways in which Ganim gained control, according to Pinto, was to make high demands that were difficult to meet. Although the plaintiff was asked to sign an irrevocable letter of credit, the city had not obtained all the land for the Steel Point project and did not know when it would get it. In Freimuth\u2019s thirteen years as director of the city\u2019s office of planning and economic development, no developer had ever signed an irrevocable letter of credit before the land was acquired. Taubman refused to provide an irrevocable letter of credit before the city had acquired the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">According to Pinto, Ganim wanted people to come to him, Pinto or Grimaldi for help. Ganim thought that he could \u201cthrow Conroy off of the project\u201d but wanted to keep him on the project \u201cas sort of a bookmark\u201d for political reasons and the $1 dollar per square foot agreement. Ganim did not want to create a void with the project by discharging Conroy before he was \u201cready to put [the Lenocis] in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">OnJuly21,2000, Ganim announced a request for proposals for the separate development of the waterfront. From the beginning of its involvement in the Steel Point project, the plaintiff had proposed a master plan for development of the entire site. Taubman construed Ganim\u2019s request for proposals as the city\u2019s having lost interest in the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>On August 25, 2000, Ganim asked Conroy and Taubman to produce five letters of commitment from prospective tenants. Murphy testified that Ganim told Conroy and Stephen J. Kieras, then Taubman\u2019s vice president of development, that without the letters, the plaintiff was out. The plaintiff submitted letters of interest from tenants to the city on October 30, 2000. Taubman, however, had lost faith in the idea of a public-private partnership and withdrew from the Steel Point project on November 17, 2000. Conroy remained involved in the Steel Point development project and submitted a proposal when the city issued a new request for proposals but was not selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Three days after Murphy sent Conroy the March 1, 2000 letter terminating the development agreement, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) taped Lenoci, Jr., and Pinto discussing a way to force Conroy out of the Steel Point project. The FBI executed search warrants at the Lenocis\u2019 place of business, Willinger\u2019s law firm and the Kasper Group, Inc., on December 19, 2000, and at Ganim\u2019s home on January 6, 2001. The searches culminated a four year investigation of \u201ccontractors and developers who were . . . bestowing benefits on public officials in exchange for lucrative contracts and excellent development deals in the city of Bridgeport.\u201d As a result of being charged with federal offenses, Lenoci, Sr., Lenoci, Jr., and others pleaded guilty and were sentenced to prison. Ganim was charged with and convicted of sixteen federal felonies, including racketeering and bribery, and was sentenced to nine years in federal prison.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b135-13\"> The following chart summarizes the claims disposed of prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"A2Bo\">Ciniint claim Defendant Pisnosition</p>\n<p id=\"Avc\">Two: tortious interference United Environmental Development Company summary judgment</p>\n<p id=\"AK6\">Six: negligence city summary judgment</p>\n<p id=\"AF8A\">Seven: quantum meruit city summary judgment</p>\n<p id=\"AWS\">Nine: CUTPA Ganim motion to strike</p>\n<p id=\"AF7\">Ten: General Statutes \u00a7 52-564 Ganim, Lenoci, Sr., Lenoci, Jr., summary judgment</p>\n<p id=\"Auj\">Charles J.

We need not decide this contention to resolve the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b153-9\"> In ruling, the court stated: \u201cAs I indicated before, this overhead is premised on financial information, financial statements from companies other than the plaintiff. This evidence, I\u2019ll be specific, I\u2019m looking at the last page of court exhibit nine, [is] premised on estimates. There was, in fact, a disclosure of experts, and there was, in fact, a production provided to the defendants as indicated in the court\u2019s exhibit nine. So, the issue presents itself as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">\u201cOn the one hand, there was some information which was provided to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>the defense regarding these issues. On the other hand, there was a failure to produce the supporting documents regarding these issues as requested in appropriate and proper discovery. On one hand, I guess from the plaintiffs view, sufficient information was provided so that if the production was inadequate, the defendants knew that they could have moved for further compliance or could have moved for the taking of the deposition of Mr. Kaplan. Query what production would have been produced if Mr. Kaplan\u2019s deposition had been taken, but I\u2019m not going to speculate as to that. But certainlyin response to the deposition notice of Mr. Conroy, documents were not produced. The documents were not produced in response to discovery request. I\u2019ve already indicated that the existence of this information in twenty something boxes and a direction to the defendants to find it, if you can or if you will, is equivalent to a document dump, which is procedurally inappropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">\u201cThus, in evaluating this issue, the court\u2019s view is that the nature of this claim, as I\u2019m looking at it, this is again the last page of court exhibit nine, is a matter which defense counsel should not have to address, the documents regarding it for the first time at trial. These are issues which, plaintiff had the burden pursuant to discovery order and scheduling order to produce and upon that production counsel would have had the opportunity to review it and to inquire concerning it, particularly, as to Mr. Conroy. Thus, the court\u2019s ruling stands. This document, which, essentially, I understand is the last page of court exhibit nine concerning the overhead expenses, court\u2019s ruled that it\u2019s inadmissible. Offer of proof regarding Mr. Kaplan\u2019s testimony is not going to be able to address or cure the basis of the court\u2019s concern.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b154-8\"> At trial, the court stated, in relevant part: \u201cLet me start with that last point first because that\u2019s one in which I emphasized in the case that\u2019s before me, which is that there is information which a party wants or needs or if there\u2019s information which a party believes that has not been produced, then the party should use the mechanism under chapter thirteen of the Practice Book to acquire. So, that is a factor here. Also, it has to be balanced against the fact that the underlying documentation here was not produced. It should have been produced.
