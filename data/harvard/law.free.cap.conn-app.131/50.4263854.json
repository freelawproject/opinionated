We conclude that the defendant implicitly waived this unpreserved claim and we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Sometime after 10 p.m. on July 12,2008, the defendant, Thaddeus Lowery and Brian Backman were passengers in an automobile being operated by Gerard Jones. Jones drove to a deli in West Haven, spoke with two other men there and then walked toward the victim, Dayshon Caple, who was standing near a restaurant that was close by. Jones, who was acquainted with the victim, discussed obtaining marijuana from him. Following their conversation, Jones and the victim, who believed that Jones had offered him a ride home in exchange for marijuana, approached Jones\u2019 automobile. The defendant and Lowery exited the automobile. The defendant brandished a revolver that he held close to the victim\u2019s chest and Lowery brandished a shotgun that he pointed at the victim\u2019s head. The victim, perceiving that he was about to be robbed, told the men that he did not \u201chave anything.\u201d The defendant cocked the hammer on his revolver and asked the victim, \u201cyou <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>think we playin\u2019?\u201d Thereafter, the defendant and Lowery searched the victim\u2019s clothing and stole his cellular telephone, a quantity of marijuana in his possession and his wallet that contained approximately $40. Jones stood nearby while these events unfolded. After the defendant, Lowery and Jones got back into their automobile with the victim\u2019s possessions and drove away, the victim fled to a nearby gas station where he called family members for assistance. Later, Jones provided information concerning these events to the police.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The defendant claims that the court, in its instructions concerning robbery in the first degree, improperly instructed the jury that it could find the defendant guilty on the basis of a theory of liability that was not set forth in the state\u2019s information. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court instructed the jury that he could be found guilty of the crime if it found that the other elements of the crime had been proven and that any person participating in the commission of the crime possessed a firearm. The defendant relies on the fact that the state, in count one of its long form information, alleged that \u201cduring the commission of the crime [the defendant] was armed with what he represented by his words or conduct to be a firearm . . . .\u201d The defendant acknowledges that he did not preserve this claim for appellate review and seeks review under the doctrine set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Under <em>Golding, </em>\u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id. <em>Golding's </em>first two prongs focus on the reviewability of the claim while the third and fourth prongs focus on the merits of the claim, namely, whether the defendant is entitled to a new trial. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Michael A., </em>297 Conn. 808, 817, 1 A.3d 46 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">There does not appear to be any dispute that the record, which contains the full transcript of the relevant trial court proceedings, is adequate to review the present claim. Nor is there any dispute that the claim is of constitutional magnitude, as the defendant claims that the court, by virtue of its instruction to the jury concerning robbery, violated his right to fair notice of the charges against him as afforded by article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution and the sixth amendment to the United States constitution. The state urges us to conclude that the defendant cannot prevail under <em>Golding </em>because he implicitly waived any claim related to the instructional language underlying his claim. \u201cA defendant in a criminal prosecution may waive one or more of his fundamental rights. ... In the usual <em>Golding </em>situation, the defendant raises a claim on appeal which, while not preserved at trial, at least was not waived at trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricatore, </em>281 Conn. 469, 478, 915 A.2d 872 (2007). \u201cThe rationale for declining to review jury instruction claims when the instructional error was induced or the claim was implicitly waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>is precisely the same: [T]o allow [a] defendant to seek reversal [after] ... his trial strategy has failed would amount to allowing him to . . . ambush the state [and the trial court] with that claim on appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kitchens, </em>299 Conn. 447, 470, 10 A.3d 942 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\"><em>In Kitchens, </em>our Supreme Court reexamined and clarified Connecticut law concerning the doctrine of implied waiver in the context of jury instruction claims. Id., 473-85. The court explained that implicitly waived claims fall into three broad categories. Id., 475. The first category includes \u201ccases in which courts have found that the defense expressly acknowledged and agreed by words or conduct to the instruction challenged on appeal.\u201d Id. The second category includes cases in which \u201cthere was no on-the-record discussion of the challenged jury instruction but the defense acquiesced in, or failed to object to, the instruction as given, and engaged in other trial conduct consistent with the acceptance of the instruction.\u201d Id., 477. Finally, the third category includes cases in which \u201cthe defense failed to take exception to, and acquiesced in, the jury instructions following one or more opportunities to review them.\u201d Id., 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The claim at issue in <em>Kitchens </em>fell into this third category of implicit waiver claims. With regard to such claims, the Supreme Court explained: \u201c[W]hen the trial court provides counsel with a copy of the proposed jury instructions, allows a meaningful opportunity for their review, solicits comments from counsel regarding changes or modifications and counsel affirmatively accepts the instructions proposed or given, the defendant may be deemed to have knowledge of any potential flaws therein and to have waived implicitly the constitutional right to challenge the instructions on direct appeal. Such a determination by the reviewing court must be based on a close examination of the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>and the particular facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d Id., 482-83. Ultimately, the court in <em>Kitchens </em>reviewed the unique facts surrounding the instructional language challenged on appeal and concluded that the defendant had implicitly waived his right to raise the instructional issue. Id., 498-500.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Having set forth the relevant legal principles, we turn to the unique circumstances surrounding the instructional language at issue in the present case. Our careful review of the record reflects that, by means of a long form information, the state alleged that the defendant committed the crime of robbery in the first degree and the crime of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree. On January 4, 2010, the defendant filed six written requests to charge covering different instructions. Although one of these requests to charge bore the title \u201cDefendant\u2019s Request to Charge: Robbery First Degree,\u201d neither this request nor any other submitted by the defendant covered the elements of robbery in the first degree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On January 4, 2010, the state filed a written request to charge that, among other topics, covered the elements of robbery in the first degree. Following the portion of the request to charge that covered the elements of robbery in the first degree,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the state cited to \u201cSection 6.4-1 Connecticut Selected Jury Instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>On January 5,2010, immediately after the state rested, the court held a charge conference with the attorneys in this case. The following is an excerpt from the colloquy that took place dining the conference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">\u201cThe Court: I have received the robbery charge [filed by the state], which is the standard charge. I intend to give the robbery [charge] in essence, maybe not exactly, but the robbery charge will be given. The usual charges, the function of the court and the jury, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, burden of proof, circumstantial and direct evidence, they will be given. I\u2019ve the request for conspiracy. Counsel . . . that\u2019s your charge, conspiracy? Yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Use the state\u2019s conspiracy charge, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">\u201cThe Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">\u201cThe Court: Counsel, any objection to the conspiracy charge as presented by \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-11\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I have not seen a charge submitted by the state. I . . . could have left it in my office, but I haven\u2019t had time to review it. Is it the standard charge? It\u2019s robbery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-12\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Throughout the computer. I\u2019m not very fair.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-13\">\u201cThe Court: Right off the cyberspace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-14\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Based upon [the prosecutor\u2019s] representation, Your Honor, there\u2019s no objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>\u201cThe Court: It\u2019s conspiracy. You\u2019ve offered, while we\u2019re on the subject, accomplice testimony. You wish to be heard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: No, Your Honor. I believe that\u2019s the standard charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: I have nothing to add to that, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">\u201cThe Court: Any objection to the court giving that charge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: No, I think that\u2019s [the] status of the law, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Any other request that has been offered that I am not discussing? I think that\u2019s about robbery. Defendant\u2019s request for prior convictions or misconduct of witnesses. I intend to give them that charge. May come in tomorrow regarding credibility. That\u2019s one. Accomplice testimony, the motion in limine, we\u2019ll reserve that. Is that correct, counsel, regarding [the defendant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-11\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Yes, Your Honor. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-12\">\u201cThe Court: Defendant\u2019s request to charge, option not to testify. We\u2019ll reserve that. I have [the defendant\u2019s requested] robbery [instruction] which also includes [an instruction concerning] the credibility of witnesses, which I intend to give . . . and maybe add more. Request to charge, testimony of police. That\u2019s given. We have no expert testimony here and, so, I need to adopt the larceny charge and then we are completed. Anything else that I\u2019m missing?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-13\">Thereafter, the defendant\u2019s attorney made an oral motion for a judgment of acquittal. After hearing argument concerning the motion, the court denied it. Following its ruling, the court asked counsel, \u201canything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>else?\u201d The state replied in the negative and the defendant\u2019s counsel did not raise any additional matters for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The next day, January 6, 2010, the court addressed counsel, noting that it had received a written motion for a judgment of acquittal from the defendant. After stating that the motion was denied, the court stated, \u201c[a]nything else before the jury comes out?\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney replied, \u201c[n]o, Your Honor.\u201d Following closing arguments, the court delivered its charge to the jury. After it instructed the jury as to the elements of the offenses at issue,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the court excused the jury for a recess. The court, addressing counsel, stated: \u201c[T]hat completes the substantive charge. Any comments? Anything I need to correct now? Think about it.\u201d Following the morning recess, the court asked counsel: \u201cAnything I need to add or detract?\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney replied, \u201cI have nothing, Your Honor.\u201d After the court delivered the remainder of its charge, the defendant\u2019s attorney did not raise any objection related to the court\u2019s robbery instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The defendant acknowledges that, at trial, the prosecutor represented that his request to charge incorporated language from the criminal jury instructions found on the judicial branch website. The defendant does not assert that his trial counsel was not provided with a copy of the state\u2019s written request to charge. Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>the defendant acknowledges that his trial attorney represented to the court that there was no objection to such requested robbery instruction. There is no dispute that the state\u2019s request to charge for robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) mirrored the standard criminal jury instruction in all material respects. There is no dispute, and we conclude, that for purposes of the present claim, the court\u2019s robbery instruction was identical to that requested by the state. In arguing that he, nonetheless, did not waive the present claim, the defendant asserts: (1) after the court referred to the state\u2019s requested robbery instruction, it stated that it might not deliver the exact same instruction to the jury; (2) the court did not provide counsel with a written copy of its proposed jury instructions, and the first time that the defendant heard the robbery instruction was when the court delivered its charge to the jury; (3) the court did not bring to the attention of counsel the fact that it intended to expand upon the theory of criminal liability set forth in the information; (4) after the court delivered the instruction at issue, the defendant\u2019s attorney merely stated that he had \u201cnothing\u201d to bring to the court\u2019s attention and did not expressly agree with the robbery instruction; and (5) \u201c[a]fter the trial court gave the oral instruction, there was no personal colloquy with the defendant.\u201d We are not persuaded by these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">As a preliminary matter, the fact that the court, in discussing the state\u2019s requested robbery instruction, stated that it might not use the state\u2019s exact language is of no consequence to our analysis. Plainly, the court stated that it intended to deliver \u201cin essence\u201d the state\u2019s requested robbery instruction. Afforded its reasonable interpretation, this statement conveyed that the court intended to deliver an instruction that mirrored the state\u2019s instruction in all material respects. As discussed previously, this, in fact, occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>The defendant asserts that the court did not provide counsel with a copy of its proposed jury instructions, but that the defendant heard the robbery instruction for the first time when the court delivered its charge to the jury. Although the defendant is correct in that the court did not physically deliver to counsel written copies of its proposed charge, this fact does not lead us to conclude that the rationale of <em>Kitchens </em>is inapplicable to the facts at hand. In describing the class of implicitly waived claims in which defense counsel acquiesced in a challenged instruction following one or more opportunities to review such instruction, the Supreme Court in <em>Kitchens </em>referred to scenarios in which a trial court has \u201cprovid[ed] counsel with a copy of the proposed jury instructions\u201d and has \u201cailow[ed] a meaningful opportunity for their review.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kitchens, </em>supra, 299 Conn. 482-83. The court in <em>Kitchens </em>did not describe any particular method by which the court, in such a scenario, must provide its proposed instructions to counsel. The court\u2019s analysis strongly suggests that, for there to be an implied waiver, the court must provide such instructions in a written form rather than orally. Id., 485 (highlighting \u201copportunity to review the charge in writing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Although a trial court is not required to provide the parties with a copy of its proposed jury instructions, it may do so effectively by distributing a written document setting forth such instructions. Nonetheless, based upon our careful review of <em>Kitchens, </em>we do not conclude that the distribution of a written document containing its proposed jury charge is the only means by which a court may provide counsel with its proposed charge such that counsel may conduct a meaningful review of the charge. As the courts, attorneys and parties adapt to an increasingly paperless court system, we expect that trial courts will utilize methods of conveying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>proposed instructions which take advantage of technological advances and deemphasize the written page. In our view, the dispositive factor is whether the court has provided counsel with an opportunity to conduct a meaningful review of its proposed charge so that \u201cthe defendant may be deemed to have knowledge of any potential flaws therein . . . .\u201d Id., 483. An opportunity for review necessarily entails that the court convey the substance of its charge in such a manner that the parties may review proposed instructional language, but we do not inteipret <em>Kitchens </em>to require that the court provide such opportunity by any particular means.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Here, at the charge conference, the prosecutor and the court referred to the robbery instruction set forth in the state\u2019s written request to charge. The prosecutor represented that his proposed instructions concerning the offenses were the same as those posted on the judicial branch website, a fact that the court confirmed. The court stated that, in terms of substance, it intended to deliver that instruction. Immediately after hearing these representations, the defendant\u2019s counsel informed the court that the defendant did not object to the requested instruction. Although he indicated that he had yet to review the state\u2019s written request to charge, the defendant\u2019s counsel did not state that he was unfamiliar with the requested instruction or that he was unable to review such instruction. Rather, at a juncture in the proceedings when the content of the court\u2019s instruction was under consideration, the defendant\u2019s attorney gave every indication that he was familiar with the instruction at issue and that he did not object to its inclusion in the charge. The court did not deliver its instruction until the next day of trial. At this later time, the defendant\u2019s attorney did not inform the court that he was unable to locate or to review the proposed instruction referred to the prior day. Under these circumstances, we conclude that by referring to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the robbery instruction set forth in the state\u2019s written request to charge\u2014which was materially similar to that posted on the judicial branch website\u2014the court provided the defendant with its proposed jury instruction such that the defendant had a meaningful opportunity to review it well in advance of the court delivering the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The defendant argues that the court did not otherwise bring to the attention of counsel the fact that it intended to expand upon the theory of criminal liability set forth in the information. This argument is not persuasive because, by stating that it intended to instruct the jury in accordance with the robbery instruction set forth in the state\u2019s request to charge, it adequately apprised counsel of the principles of criminal liability that it intended to, and did, convey to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Further, the defendant argues that he did not waive the claim because, after the court delivered the instruction at issue, his attorney merely stated that he did not have anything to bring to the court\u2019s attention, but did not expressly agree with the robbery instruction. By this argument, the defendant appears to suggest that because he did not request or otherwise expressly refer to and expressly approve the specific instructional language at issue, he did not implicitly waive any objection to it. The court in <em>Kitchens, </em>however, rejected this legal proposition, reasoning that the grounds upon which a court may find implied waiver may be greater than those required for a finding of induced error. Id., 469-70. Here, after the court afforded counsel a meaningful opportunity to review the substance of its robbery instruction and after the court delivered its charge to the jury, the defendant\u2019s attorney affirmatively stated that he did not have any objection to the charge. Under these circumstances, the conduct of the defendant\u2019s attorney constituted an implicit waiver of any objection to the instructional language challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Finally, in arguing that he did not implicitly waive the present claim, the defendant relies on the fact that \u201c[a]fter the trial court gave the oral instruction, there was no personal colloquy with the defendant.\u201d In this regard, the defendant suggests that this court should not conclude that the defendant implicitly waived the claim because the trial court directed its inquiries concerning the content of the charge to the defendant\u2019s attorney, rather than to the defendant personally. This argument is not persuasive either. In <em>Kitchens, </em>our Supreme Court stated that issues concerning the content of jury instructions are among the matters of trial management entrusted to a defendant\u2019s attorney and that \u201camong the rights that may be waived by the action of counsel in a criminal proceeding is the right of a defendant to proper jury instructions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kitchens, </em>supra, 299 Conn. 467. The court did not have a duty to engage the defendant in a dialogue concerning the content of its charge, but properly addressed such matters to the defendant\u2019s attorney. Furthermore, in crafting its charge, the court properly relied on the representations and conduct of the defendant\u2019s counsel. \u201cAbsent some indication to the contrary, a court is entitled to rely on counsel\u2019s representations on behalf of his or her client.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>64 Conn. App. 340, 349-50, 780 A.2d 209, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 909, 782 A.2d 1250 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Having conducted a careful review of the circumstances in the present case, we conclude that the defendant waived the present claim related to the court\u2019s robbery instruction. By stating that it would deliver, in substance, the robbery instruction requested by the state\u2014an instruction that the state and court represented was taken from the judicial branch website\u2014 the court afforded the defendant an opportunity to review its proposed robbery instruction. Moreover, the court afforded the defendant a <em>meaningful </em>opportunity for review in that the court did not deliver its charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>until the following day. At the time of the charging conference, the defendant\u2019s attorney indicated that he did not object to the instructions filed by the state. Following inquiries by the court related to the legal sufficiency of the charge, the defendant\u2019s attorney did not take exception to the charge delivered to the jury. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the defendant acquiesced in the instruction given and, thus, implicitly waived the present claim. Accordingly, the defendant cannot prevail under <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-8\"> Following the jury\u2019s verdict, the defendant pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine; see <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 37-39, 91 S.
