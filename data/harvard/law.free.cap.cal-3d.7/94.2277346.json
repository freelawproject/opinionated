(Merchants),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a licensed collection agency, to challenge the agency\u2019s alleged practice of knowingly and wilfully filing actions in improper counties, pursuant to statutorily inadequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>complaints, for the purpose of impairing its adversaries\u2019 ability to defend these actions, and with the intent, and effect, of obtaining an increased number of default judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">To remedy the consequences of the foregoing alleged misfiling practice, plaintiffs sought a variety of relief, including (1) an injunction to restrain the agency from continuing to utilize the challenged practice in the future and (2) an order setting aside, as void, all judgments obtained by defendant in the two years prior to the suit, pursuant to complaints which did not comply with the requirements of section 396a of the Code of Civil Procedure or with the requirements of section 1812.10 of the Civil Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant demurred to plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint on the grounds that such complaint failed to state a cause of action; the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and subsequently entered a judgment dismissing the action. It is from this judgment of dismissal which plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">For the reasons discussed below, we have concluded that under the allegations of the amended complaint the judgment for defendant with respect to the claim for injunctive relief must be reversed. In alleging that the collection agency has <em>wilfully </em>commenced actions in <em>improper counties, </em>with <em>knowledge </em>that such counties are improper, and for the improper <em>ulterior purpose </em>of impairing its adversaries\u2019 ability to defend such suits, plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged facts which, if true, demonstrate that the agency has in the past been continually committing a gross \u201cabuse of process\u201d and that the agency threatens to continue this unlawful, tortious conduct in the future. If such allegations can be substantiated at trial, we conclude that plaintiffs are entitled to an injunction to restrain the alleged conduct because it constitutes both a continuing mass tort against which other legal remedies are inadequate and an \u201cunlawful . . . business practice\u201d which may be enjoined under Civil Code section 3369.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">With respect to plaintiffs\u2019 attempted wholesale attack on past judgments obtained on complaints inadequate under section 396a of the Code of</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Civil Procedure, however, we conclude that the challenged final judgments may not be set aside as \u201cvoid.\u201d Although we recognize that section 396a is intended to protect litigants against the evil of distantly obtained default judgments, the section contemplates that the trial judge\u2019s independent scrutiny of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint in the original action will afford such protection. As we explain below, if the trial judge fails to discover a deficient complaint and erroneously permits the entry of a default judgment, a defendant retains the right to challenge such judgment either on appeal or by motion to set aside the default judgment. We conclude, however, that such error does not deprive the trial court of \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in the fundamental sense, and therefore that plaintiffs may not collaterally attack such judgments long after they have become final.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Finally, we conclude that inasmuch as plaintiffs concede that the judgments which they attack as violative of Civil Code section 1812.10 concern actions on \u201cinstallment accounts,\u201d rather than on \u201cinstallment contracts,\u201d as defined by the applicable code sections, plaintiffs\u2019 attack on pre-1968 judgments cannot succeed. In view of the specificity of the statutory definition of \u201cinstallment contract\u201d contained in the Unruh Retail Installment Sales Act, and the fact that at the time of the commencement of this litigation section 1812.10 covered only suits on such \u201ccontracts,\u201d we cannot find that the actions questioned by the instant suit were subject to the provisions of section 1812.10 when brought. Plaintiffs accordingly are not entitled to any relief under the Unruh Retail Installment Sales Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">1. <em>The facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In reviewing the sufficiency of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint against defendant\u2019s demurrer, we, of course, must treat the demurrer as admitting all properly pleaded factual allegations of that complaint. (See, e.g., <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591 [96 Cal.Rptr. 601, 487 P.2d 1241, 41 A.L.R.3d 1187].) As described in the complaint, defendant Merchants is one of the largest collection agencies in Alameda County, filing over 2,000 actions in the Oakland-Piedmont municipal court each year\u2014almost 14 percent of the entire number of suits filed in that court annually. Merchants does collection work primarily for large retail establishments, such as J. C. Penney Co. and H. C. Capwell Co., which maintain retail stores throughout the entire State of California; these establishments assign their customers\u2019 allegedly overdue obligations\u2014unpaid balances remaining on their patrons\u2019 charge accounts\u2014to Merchants for collection. The named plaintiffs in this action are all defendants in actions filed by Merchants in the Oakland-Piedmont Municipal Court in Alameda County; hone of the individual plaintiffs resides in Alameda County and all contend that, as to them, the actions brought by defendant were improperly filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Plaintiffs brought the instant action on their own behalf and on behalf of similarly situated individuals<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to combat the strategy that they allege to be a conscious \u201cpattern and practice\u201d of Merchants in filing inadequate complaints in improper courts. As described in the complaint, the defendant\u2019s practice involves two related, but analytically distinct, features. First, the practice involves the agency\u2019s commencement of suits in a county which is not the proper place for trial under the applicable statutory provisions (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 395; Civ. Code, \u00a7 1812.10), with knowledge that such venue is improper, and for the ulterior purpose of impairing a defendant\u2019s ability to present his defense. Second, the practice involves the initiation of these actions by means of \u201cform complaints\u201d which, in contravention of section 396a of the Code of Civil Procedure, fail to state sufficient facts to enable a trial court to determine whether the action is in fact filed in the proper venue. As a consequence of this combination of improper procedures, defendant agency allegedly obtains many default judgments and favorable settlements which it would not otherwise secure.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Although plaintiffs\u2019 objection is directed at defendant\u2019s single, alleged pattern of consciously filing inadequate complaints in improper venues, plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint is divided into three distinct causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The first cause of action attacks defendant\u2019s use of its improper filing practice .in all contract actions in which the amount in controversy does not exceed $500. Code of Civil Procedure section 395, the general venue provision, establishes that in contract actions the proper court for trial is \u201ceither [1] the county where [the] obligation is to be performed,\u201d [2] the county \u201cin which the contract in fact was entered into\u201d or [3] \u201cthe county in which the defendant . . . resides at the commencement of the action\u201d and provides further that \u201cthe county in which such obligation is incurred shall be deemed to be the county where it is to be performed unless there is a special contract in writing to the contrary.\u201d At all times relevant to this action section 396a of the Code of Civil Procedure provided that: \u201cIn all actions and proceedings . . . within the subject matter jurisdiction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>justice courts [$500 or less at the time this suit was commenced], <em>plaintiff must state facts in the complaint verified by oath ... or in an affidavit </em>. . . <em>from which it can be determined which court is, under the provisions of this title, the proper court for the trial of such action! or proceeding, . . </em>.\u201d (Italics added.) Thus, in contract actions involving a claim of less than $500, under Code of Civil Procedure sections 395 and 396a the complaint \u201cmust state facts\u201d demonstrating that the county in which suit is brought is either (1) the present residence of the defendant, (2) the place where the contract was entered into or (3) the place where the contract was to be performed as set forth in a <em>special written contract </em>to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Plaintiffs allege that the collection agency continually failed to bring such actions in a proper county and that the complaints it filed in these actions regularly failed to meet the requirements set out above. Plaintiffs incorporated into their first amended complaint copies of the verified municipal court complaints\u2014\u201cform complaints\u201d\u2014which the defendant agency had filed in the Oakland-Piedmont Judicial District against several of the named plaintiffs. In each instance, the collection agency\u2019s complaint alleged that the individual sued had become indebted to the agency\u2019s assignor in a specified amount\u2014under $500\u2014for merchandise sold on an open book account by a designated large retailer, and that the agency was \u201cinformed and believe[d]\u201d that the account was \u201cpayable in the City of Oakland, County of Alameda.\u201d The form complaint, drafted by defendant, failed to declare, however, either where the individual being sued resided, where the obligation sued upon was entered into or whether there was a special contract in writing providing for the performance, i.e., payment, of the obligation either in the Oakland-Piedmont Judicial District or in Alameda County generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In this initial count, plaintiffs contend that such form complaints do not satisfy the requirements of section 396a, and, relying on section 396a\u2019s mandate that \u201cif such complaint or affidavit be not so filed, no further proceedings shall be had in the action except to dismiss the same . . . ,\u201d assert that all judgments obtained pursuant to these inadequate form complaints are void and should be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">In addition to alleging the stratagem of this \u201cpattern of practice\u201d of filing inadequate complaints in an improper county, plaintiffs\u2019 first cause of action specifically alleges that defendant agency filed such suits \u201cwith knowledge\u201d that the county in which such suits were brought was not a proper county for trial under section 395, and that the agency filed the factually deficient form complaints \u201cto avoid stating the relevant facts which would indicate that their actions were not commenced in the proper court for trial.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>complaint further alleges that as a result of the agency\u2019s practice, a large number of debtors have been greatly hampered in their fundamental right to a meaningful opportunity for a trial on the merits, that defendant has obtained numerous undeserved default judgments and inequitable settlements, and that defendant has carried on its practice with the <em>intention </em>of inflicting this harm on the debtors and for the <em>purpose </em>of reaping these improper benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The allegations of plaintiffs\u2019 second cause of action substantially parallel those of the first cause, but this count is directed at those actions filed by the collection agency on the basis of <em>retail sales agreements </em>(as distinguished from other contract actions), and is not limited to actions claiming damages under $500. Plaintiffs assert that suits instituted by defendant on the basis of installment open book accounts in 1967 and 1968, the years covered by this action, were governed by the provisions of Civil Code section 1812.10 and that under that section such actions were also brought in an improper venue. Section 1812.10, a provision of the Unruh Retail Installment Sales Act, specifies the four locations in which an action on a \u201ccontract\u201d governed by the Unruh Act may be brought: (1) \u201cthe county in which the contract was in fact signed by the buyer,\u201d (2) \u201cthe county in which the buyer resided at the time the contract was entered into,\u201d (3) \u201cthe county in which the buyer resides at the commencement of the action\u201d or, (4) \u201cthe county in which goods purchased pursuant to such contract have been so affixed to real property as to become a part of such real property.\u201d Plaintiffs again claim that with respect to these \u201cinstallment sales\u201d actions defendant agency knowingly commenced its suits in an improper venue in order to make the defense of these actions more difficult and thereby to obtain an increased number of default judgments. Plaintiffs also claim that judgments obtained in actions falling within the provisions of section 1812.10, but brought in an improper county, are void.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The third cause of action, incorporating the allegations of the first and second causes, alleges that the improper \u201cpattern and practice\u201d set out in those counts constitutes an \u201cunlawful and frauduleht business practice\u201d within the meaning of Civil Code section 3369 and seeks an injunction, as provided by that section, to restrain the collection agency from continuing the practice in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In sum, on the basis of the allegations of defendant\u2019s intentional misfiling practice, plaintiffs sought both injunctive relief and a nullification of all past judgments obtained over a two-year period as a result of defendant\u2019s practice; the trial court sustained a general demurrer to the first amended complaint. We turn first to the sufficiency of the complaint in relation to the prayer for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>2. <em>Under the allegations of the complaint, plaintiffs are entitled to an injunction restraining the collection agency from continuing its practice of intentionally filing actions in improper venues.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Although plaintiffs ground their request for injunctive relief solely on the basis of Civil Code section 3369, we are not limited to plaintiffs\u2019 theory of recovery in testing the sufficiency of their complaint against a demurrer, but instead must determine if the <em>factual </em>allegations of the complaint are adequate to state a cause of action under any legal theory. The courts of this state have, of course, long since departed from holding a plaintiff strictly to the \u201cform of action\u201d he has pleaded and instead have adopted the more flexible approach of examining the facts alleged to determine if a demurrer should be sustained. (See, e.g., <em>MacIsaac </em>v. <em>Pozzo </em>(1945) 26 Cal.2d 809, 815 [161 P.2d 449]; <em>Zellner </em>v. <em>Wassman </em>(1920) 184 Cal. 80, 88 [193 P. 84]; 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Pleading, \u00a7 301, p. 1974.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint alleges that defendant has knowingly and wilfully instituted actions against consumers in the wrong county, under inadequate complaints, for the ulterior purpose of impairing these individuals\u2019 defenses of the actions and with the intent of securing default judgments by virtue of the inconvenience of the improper forum. The complaint also alleges that defendant agency threatens to continue this practice in 'the future, undeterred by the fact that such conduct contravenes specific statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">If plaintiffs can prove these allegations at trial, they will have established that defendant is engaged in a mass \u201cabuse of process.\u201d In light of the apparent inadequacy of other legal remedies, we conclude that plaintiffs would be entitled to an injunction restraining this threatened multiple tort. Moreover, we also find that this behavior, when utilized as a general practice by a collection agency whose primary business is litigation, additionally constitutes an \u201cunlawful . . . business practice,\u201d and thus that the conduct may alternatively be enjoined under Civil Code section 3369.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">a.  <em>Under the alleged facts, defendant\u2019s conduct amounts to a tortious abuse of process, which may be enjoined since alternative legal remedies are inadequate to protect the interests of the plaintiff class.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">In <em>Templeton Feed &amp; Grain </em>v. <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 461, 466 [72 Cal.Rptr. 344, 446 P.2d 152], we recently reiterated the two fundamental elements that constitute-the basis of the tort of abuse of process: \u201c \u2018first an ulterior purpose; and second, a wilful act in the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the process not proper in the regular conduct of the proceeding.\u2019 \u201d Under the present pleadings, defendant\u2019s alleged conduct clearly embraces both elements of this tort. First, in alleging that defendant has <em>wilfully </em>and <em>knowingly </em>filed actions in an <em>improper </em>county pursuant to statutorily <em>inadequate </em>pleadings, the complaint clearly sets out \u201ca wilful act in the use of process[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] not proper in the regular course of the proceeding\u201d; second, the complaint just as explicitly alleges that such action was undertaken for the <em>ulterior purpose </em>and with the intent to impair individuals\u2019 rights to defend suits and, in effect, to coerce inequitable settlements and default judgments by making it inconvenient for defendants to defend suits on their merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The recent case of <em>Czap </em>v. <em>Credit Bureau of Santa Clara Valley </em>(1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 1 [86 Cal.Rptr. 417], provides an apt analogy. In <em>Czap </em>the plaintiff instituted an action for abuse of process alleging that the defendant collection agency, with knowledge that plaintiff\u2019s wages were exempt from garnishment, was threatening to bring repeated levies on the debtor\u2019s salary, for the purpose of forcing the debtor to pay the judgment out of her exempt wages; the agency allegedly recognized that the repeated levies on the debtor\u2019s salary, though improper, would still, as a practical matter, jeopardize her employment. The plaintiff in <em>Czap, </em>as the plaintiffs here, sought an injunction to restrain the collection agency from continuing the alleged \u201cabuse of process.\u201d The trial court in <em>Czap </em>sustained the agency\u2019s demurrer to the complaint; the Court of Appeal, however, reversed, concluding that plaintiff\u2019s allegations did indeed present a case of an abuse of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The <em>Czap </em>court observed: \u201cHere it is alleged that respondent, knowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>that appellant\u2019s wages were exempt from execution, nevertheless procured a levy and threatens to procure others for the ulterior purpose of jeopardizing appellant\u2019s employment and thus forcing her to apply to the payment of the debt earnings or other assets which under the statute are exempt.\u201d (7 Cal.App.3d at pp. 5-6.) The court concluded: \u201cIf [these allegations] are true, they state a cause of action for abuse of process.\u201d (7 Cal.App.3d at p. 6.) In our case, to paraphrase the <em>Czap </em>court, plaintiffs similarly allege that defendant collection agency <em>knowing </em>that the county in which it was instituting suit was an improper one, <em>nevertheless </em>has instituted such suits and threatens to continue instituting such suits <em>for the ulterior purpose </em>of making the action more difficult to defend and thereby forcing its adversary to default or to settle on terms favorable to the agency. If proven, these allegations, like the allegations in <em>Czap, </em>sufficiently demonstrate that defendant has committed an abuse of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">The <em>Czap </em>court, after finding sufficient allegations of an abuse of process, went on to hold that an injunction could properly issue to enjoin the collection agency from continuing the repeated tortious conduct, since plaintiff\u2019s complaint sufficiently established the inadequacy of other legal remedies to prevent irreparable injury. (7 Cal.App.3d at p. 7.) As discussed hereafter, we believe that in the instant case alternative legal remedies similarly fail to prevent the on-going injuries caused by defendant\u2019s alleged tortious conduct, and that injunctive relief must be afforded to avoid irreparable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Defendant first suggests that since all of the challenged actions are, by hypothesis, brought in the wrong county, plaintiffs have an obvious adequate legal remedy to the agency\u2019s alleged misfiling practice since any person sued in an improper county may obtain a change of venue. Thus, defendant contends, the complaint fails to establish any need for an injunction. Although, as a theoretical matter, this right to a change in venue does exist, plaintiffs persuasively explain that it is the very serious <em>practical limitations </em>of this \u201cright\u201d which the agency\u2019s misfiling practice seeks to exploit.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">As plaintiffs point out, as a practical matter the mere filing of an action in an inconvenient forum will inevitably deter many debtors from voicing any objection to the suit. Two factors coalesce to produce this result. First, and most importantly, since the amount claimed in the agency\u2019s actions is relatively small, the cost of travel to a distant county, or of hiring an attorney for that purpose, even simply to interpose a motion of a change of venue, renders such counteraction by the debtor financially infeasible. Second, the bulk of individuals sued by defendant agency allegedly command low incomes and few resources and cannot afford to engage counsel to advise them of their \u201cvenue\u201d rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>According to the complaint, defendant agency is well aware of these realistic limits on its adversaries\u2019 theoretical right to move for a change of venue. Since, by commencing suits in an inconvenient forum, the agency can deter most of its adversaries from responding to complaints, plaintiffs insist that the agency does, and will, utilize this practice because the returns are \u201cprofitable,\u201d even if the agency must concede the impropriety of the selected forum on those rare occasions when a debtor does in fact challenge the venue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These allegations clearly illustrate the inadequacy of the legal remedy\u2014the right to move for change of venue\u2014as a means of protection to potential litigants from the adverse effects of defendant\u2019s unfair filing practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Defendant further contends, however, that the Legislature has already perceived the practical limitations on the plaintiff class\u2019 ability to interpose change of venue motions, and has met the problem in section 396a of the Cod\u00e9 of Civil Procedure. This provision requires the <em>trial court, </em>in actions falling within the section\u2019s terms, to dismiss \u201con its own motion\u201d complaints filed in the wrong venue, thereby obviating the necessity of a defendant\u2019s appearance in such actions. As described more fully later in this opinion, section 396a is indeed designed to protect defendants in actions on small claims from the inconvenience and harassment incident to suits brought in improper venues; the section attempts to afford such protection by placing a responsibility on trial courts to protect such defendants\u2019 interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Once again, however, according to the allegations of the present complaint, the theoretical protection extended by this provision fails in the face of the realities of the situation. Plaintiffs allege that defendant agency has specifically designed its \u201cform complaints\u201d to avoid stating facts which would demonstrate that its actions are brought in an improper venue. They urge that, although these complaints do not satisfy section 396a, and thus should have been dismissed under this section, defendant has in fact succeeded in obtaining large numbers of default judgments on the basis of such complaints. In this respect defendant agency again has allegedly devised a procedure to take advantage of the practical limitations of the situation, this time exploiting the harried trial court\u2019s inability to scrutinize fully each complaint that is brought before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Defendant, of course, attempts to shift the entire onus for plaintiff\u2019s plight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>onto the trial courts for failing to dismiss on their own motion all actions brought on inadequate complaints. While we cannot excuse any failure of the trial courts in this respect, we nevertheless do not think that defendant can so easily avoid the responsibility of intentionally and systematically seeking to obtain the improper benefits resulting from any practical flaws in the judicial implementation of section 396a. Plaintiffs do have a right to prevent the defendant agency from continuing the future exploitation and exacerbation of the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">In sum, if the facts concerning defendant\u2019s pattern of misfiling complaints are true, an injunction, and the additional sanctions that can be employed to enforce such a remedy, may be the only practicable means of curtailing such practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In finding an injunctive remedy appropriate in this case, we note additionally that the judiciary itself has a strong interest in eliminating any systematic misuse of the judicial machinery; indeed, an effective remedy is particularly necessary under the present allegations for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">First, we recognize that the \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of knowingly filing actions in distant counties in order to gain an unconscionable advantage is not a unique or isolated practice, but instead has been continuously identified in both the legal literature<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and in public hearings;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as a widespread and common abuse in the debt collection field. The potential magnitude of the problem is suggested by the testimony of Richard Givens, the chief of the consumer fraud unit of the United States Attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York during one such federal hearing. Mr. Givens related a conversation he had recently had with an attorney, in which the lawyer admitted that a single client \u201chad obtained <em>10,000 </em>default judgments <em>during the past year </em>through the use of \u2018inconvenient forums.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.) <em>(Summary of Hearings on Debt Collection Practices, National Commission on Consumer Finance </em>(1971) 88 Banking L.J. 291, 293-294.) The Federal Trade Commission has recently conducted extensive hearings on a variety of debt collection abuses, prominent of which is the practice of \u201c[initiating suits against consumer debtors in distant locations resulting in default judgments due to the debtor\u2019s failure to defend.\u201d (36 Fed. Reg. 15473, 15474 (1971).) In light of the apparent prevalance of the practice attacked by the instant complaint, the importance of providing an effective injunction remedy becomes manifest.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Second, the widespread misuse o\u00ed the courts in this manner contributes to an undermining of confidence in the judiciary by reinforcing the unfortunate image of courts as \u201cdistant\u201d entities, available only to wealthy or large interests,\u2014an image evidently subscribed to by a significant proportion of our citizenry.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For many low income citizens, the only contact with the judicial system comes as a defendant in a debt collection suit; many studies have pointed out that the extremely high default rate in such actions \u2014often well over 90 percent<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\u2014frequently leads such consumers to conclude that the legal system is merely a \u201crubber stamp\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> for the improper practices utilized by predatory agencies. Under these conditions, courts have a strong interest in ensuring that abuses of the legal process by collection agencies are not perpetuated.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Having noted the widespread occurrence of the alleged misfiling abuse, we must emphasize that, at this stage of the proceedings, defendant collection agency\u2019s actual use of such a practice remains only an allegation. For the purpose of reviewing defendant\u2019s demurrer, however, we must of course treat the complaint\u2019s allegations as true; in this posture, we believe that plaintiffs have stated a cause of action for injunctive relief from an abuse of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">b.  <em>Defendant\u2019s alleged conduct additionally constitutes an \u201cunlawful </em>. . . <em>business practice\u201d which may be enjoined under Civil Code section 3369.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">We additionally conclude that inasmuch as the alleged repeated violation of statutory requirements has been adopted as a \u201cpattern\u201d or \u201cpractice\u201d of conduct by a collection agency, for whom the filing of litigation is a primary part of its business activity, this \u201cpattern\u201d of misfiling complaints <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>amounts to an \u201cunlawful . . . business practice,\u201d which may be enjoined under section 3369 of the Civil Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Section 3369 provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person performing or proposing to perform an act of unfair competition within this State may be enjoined in any court of competent jurisdiction. [Par.] <em>As used in this section, unfair competition shall mean and include unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business practice </em>.... [Par.] Actions for injunction under this section may be prosecuted by the Attorney General or any district attorney ... or by any person acting for the interests of itself, its members or the general public.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Defendant agency contends initially that section 3369\u2019s prohibition of \u201cunfair competition\u201d is confined to practices involving competitive injury, i.e., resulting in an unfair injury to a <em>competitor, </em>and thus that the injury to a <em>consumer </em>resulting from its alleged misfiling practice does not fall within the province of the statute. Defendant further claims that even if the section is not limited to anti-competitive acts, it should not be expanded so broadly beyond the concepts of common law \u201cunfair competition\u201d or \u201cdeceptive advertising\u201d as to include the misuse of judicial procedures. For the reasons discussed below, we reject both of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Although in a common law context, competitive injury originally composed an essential element of the tort of \u201cunfair competition,\u201d the Legislature, by adopting section 3369, broadened the scope of legal protection against wrongful business practices generally, and in so doing extended to the entire consuming public the protection once afforded only to business competitors. Thus, section 3369 indicates that \u201cunfair competition\u201d as used in the section cannot be equated with the common law definition of \u201cunfair competition,\u201d but instead specifies that, for the purposes of its provisions, unfair competition \u201cshall mean and include <em>unlawful, unfair </em>or fraudulent business practice . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">In 1938 the United States Congress amended the Federal Trade Commission Act to give the commission authority to regulate <em>\u201cunfair </em>or deceptive acts or practices\u201d (italics added), in addition to its original powers over \u201cunfair methods, of competition\u201d; as the United States.Supreme Court has observed, the addition of this \u201cunfair . . . practices\u201d language, represented \u201ca significant amendment showing Congress\u2019 concern for <em>consumers </em>as well as for competitors.\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(FTC </em>v. <em>Colgate Palmolive Co. </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 374, 384 [13 L.Ed.2d 904, 913, 85 S.Ct. 1035]; see <em>FTC </em>v. <em>R.F. Keppel &amp; Bros., Inc. </em>(1934) 291 U.S. 304, 310 [78 L.Ed. 814, 818, 54 S.Ct. 423]; <em>FTC </em>v. <em>The Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co. </em>(1972) 405 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>233, 244 [31 L.Ed.2d 170, 179, 92 S.Ct. 898].) Section 3369\u2019s parallel broad proscription of \u201cunlawful [or] unfair . . . business practice^]\u201d illustrates no less a concern for wronged consumers. Moreover, the section demonstrates a clear design to protect consumers as well as competitors by its final clause, permitting inter alia, any member of the public to sue on his own behalf or on behalf of the public generally. If the Legislature had been solely concerned with protection against the evil of unfair competitive advantage, it would certainly have more narrowly circumscribed the class of persons permitted to institute such actions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Given this strong statutory indication that section 3369 is not confined to anti-competitive business practices, we cannot be surprised that the courts, in interpreting the section, have long declared that the provision is at least as equally directed toward \u201cthe right of the <em>public </em>to protection from fraud and deceit[,]\u201d as toward the preservation of fair business competition. (Italics added.) <em>(American Philatelic Soc. </em>v. <em>Claibourne </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 689, 698 [46 P.2d 135].) In <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Mosk </em>v. <em>National Research Co. of Cal. </em>(1962) 201 Cal.App.2d 765, 771 [20 Cal.Rptr. 516], the court directly confronted the contention proffered by defendant in the instant case and held that \u201c[t]he equitable relief authorized by Civil Code section 3369 is not circumscribed by any prerequisite showing that the conduct in question be limited to the field of business competition.\u201d (See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>also <em>Athens Lodge No. 70 </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1953) 117 Cal.App.2d 322, 325 [255 P.2d 482].)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">We conclude that in a society which enlists a variety of psychological and advertising stimulants to induce the consumption of goods, consumers, rather than competitors, need the greatest protection from sharp business practices. (Cf. <em>Vasquez </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 800, 807-808 [94 Cal.Rptr. 796, 484 P.2d 964].) Given the terms of the section, the purpose of the enactment and the controlling precedent, we reject defendant\u2019s suggested limitation of section 3369 to \u201canti-competitive\u201d business practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Defendant additionally contends, however, that even if section 3369 is not limited to \u201ccompetitive injuries,\u201d the section\u2019s proscription of \u201cunfair competition\u201d should not be read so broadly so as to include the agency\u2019s alleged misfihng practice; that, instead, the provision be confined to more traditional \u201cdeceptive\u201d or \u201cfraudulent\u201d conduct, conduct sharing at least some of the common features of misrepresentation that characterized the precedent of \u201cunfair competition.\u201d We recognize that most of the cases arising under section 3369 to date have challenged \u201cbusiness practices\u201d in which a business enterprise was presenting itself, or its \u201cmerchandise,\u201d to the public in a deceptive manner so as to defraud consumers (see, e.g., <em>Academy of Motion Picture, etc. </em>v. <em>Benson </em>(1940) 15 Cal.2d 685 [104 P.2d 650]; <em>American Philatelic Soc. </em>v. <em>Claibourne </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 689 [46 P.2d 135]) and also that these decisions frequently refer to the \u201cessence\u201d of section 3369 as the protection from any conduct likely to deceive the consumer. (See, e.g., <em>West </em>v. <em>Lind </em>(1960) 186 Cal.App.2d 563, 567 [9 Cal.Rptr. 288].)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The language of section 3369, however, does not limit its coverage to such \u201cdeceptive\u201d practices, but instead explicitly extends to any \u201cunlawful, unfair <em>or </em>deceptive business practice\u201d; the Legislature, in our view, intended by this sweeping language to permit tribunals to enjoin on-going wrongful business conduct in whatever context such activity might occur.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>although most precedents under section 3369 have arisen in a \u201cdeceptive\u201d practice framework, even these decisions have frequently noted that the section was intentionally framed in its broad, sweeping language, precisely to enable judicial tribunals to deal with the innumerable \u201c \u2018new schemes which the fertility of man\u2019s invention would contrive.\u2019 \u201d <em>(American Philatelic Soc. </em>v. <em>Claibourne </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 689, 698 [46 P.2d 135].) As the <em>Claibourne </em>court observed: \u201cWhen a scheme is evolved, which on its face violates the fundamental rules of honesty and fair dealing, a court of equity is not impotent to frustrate its consummation because the scheme is an original one. There is a maxim as old as law that there can b\u00e9 no right without a remedy, and in searching for a precise precedent, an equity court must not lose sight, not only of its power, but of its duty to arrive at a just solution of the problem.\u201d (3 Cal.2d at pp. 698-699; see, <em>Ojala </em>v. <em>Bohlin </em>(1960) 178 Cal.App.2d 292, 301 [2 Cal.Rptr. 919]; accord, <em>FTC </em>v. <em>The Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co. </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 233, 240 [31 L.Ed.2d 170, 177, 92 S.Ct. 898].) With respect to \u201cunlawful\u201d or \u201cunfair\u201d business practices, section 3369 specifically grants o-ur courts that power.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">In permitting the restraining of all \u201cunfair\u201d business practices, section 3369 undeniably establishes only a wide standard to guide courts of equity; as noted above, given the creative nature of the scheming mind, the Legislature evidently concluded that a less inclusive standard would not be adequate. In the instant case, however, we need not undertake the task of determining the \u201cfairness\u201d of defendant\u2019s alleged conduct in light of contemporary standards, because insofar as defendant\u2019s alleged practice involves the repeated violation of specific venue statutes, the practice is enjoinable under section 3369 as an <em>\u201cunlawful . . . </em>business practice,\u201d totally apart from its inherent \u201cfairness.\u201d As originally enacted in 1933, section 3369 defined \u201cunfair competition\u201d only in terms of \u201cunfair or fraudulent business practice[s]\u201d; most of the reported cases, dealing in deceptive conduct, arose under the statute as so worded. In 1963, however, the Legislature amended section 3369 to add the word \u201cunlawful\u201d to the types of wrongful business conduct that could be enjoined. Although the legislative history of this amendment is not particularly instructive,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> nevertheless, as one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>commentator has noted \u201cit is difficult to see any other purpose than to extend the meaning of unfair competition to anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.\u201d (Note, <em>Unlawful Agricultural Working Conditions as Nuisance or Unfair Competition </em>(1968) 19 Hastings L.J. 398, 408-409.)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The recent case of <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Kay-Dix Ranch </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 588 [88 Cal.Rptr. 443] represents the first reported appellate decision in an action brought under section 3369 to enjoin an \u201cunlawful\u201d business practice.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In <em>Diaz </em>plaintiff agricultural workers brought a class action to enjoin defendant farm owners from continuing an alleged practice of knowingly employing Mexican nationals who had entered this country in violation of federal immigration laws. Although the <em>Diaz </em>court ultimately concluded that considerations of federalism warranted the withholding of equitable relief in the case before it, the court did not dismiss the suit as improper under section 3369, but indicated that the alleged activity could constitute an \u201cunlawful . . . business practice\u201d under section 3369. (See 9 Cal.App. 3d at pp. 591-593 and fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">As discussed above, under the allegations of plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint, defendant\u2019s practice consists of repeated violations of specific statutory provisions of both the Code of Civil Procedure and the Civil Code; such a pattern of behavior clearly constitutes \u201cunlawful\u201d conduct, and if an enterprise pursues such a course of conduct as a \u201cbusiness practice,\u201d we conclude that the activity may be enjoined under section 3369. Defendant agency does not, and could not, claim that under the allegations of the complaint the challenged conduct is not a \u201cbusiness practice.\u201d The complaint specifically alleges that the agency undertakes its alleged misfiling \u201cas a pattern and practice\u201d and obviously such practice, if in fact conducted, directly relates to the defendant collection agency\u2019s conduct of its \u201cbusiness.\u201d We thus conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 allegations sufficiently state a cause of action for injunctive relief under Civil Code section 3369, and that the trial court erred in sustaining defendant\u2019s demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 third cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>3.  <em>Default judgments obtained by defendant agency pursuant to complaints inadequate under Code of Civil Procedure section 396a, although vulnerable to attack on appeal or to timely motion for relief from default, are not \u201cvoid\u201d for lack of jurisdiction in the fundamental sense.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Having determined, that, under the. allegations of the complaint, plaintiffs are entitled to an injunction enjoining the continuation of defendant\u2019s alleged \u201cdistant filing\u201d practice, we now reach the question of whether plaintiffs are entitled to the additional, more sweeping remedy of setting aside all judgments obtained by defendants pursuant to this practice during the two-year period preceding the institution of this action. As noted above, plaintiffs seek to set aside two separate categories of judgments: those falling within section 396a of the Code of Civil Procedure and those purportedly covered by section 1812.10 of the Civil Code. We initially address the contentions relating to the former category of cases, involving section 396a.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">As detailed above, plaintiffs contend that defendant has continually filed suits in the wrong county, utilizing \u201cform complaints\u201d inadequate under section 396a, and has improperly obtained numerous judgments on the basis of such inadequate complaints. Plaintiffs base their present attempt to set aside all such judgments on the ground that the provisions of section 396a are \u201cjurisdictional\u201d and thus that all judgments obtained on the basis of complaints violative of section 396a are \u201cvoid.\u201d In opposing the granting of such relief, defendant primarily emphasizes that venue objections are traditionally waived by a party if not raised in the original litigation. Accordingly defendant contends that because plaintiffs, as a class, failed to raise the alleged noncompliance with section 396a in their original actions, they may not now attack such final judgments in the instant proceeding.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Defendant is, of course, correct in maintaining that a party\u2019s failure to raise a timely objection to venue has traditionally been considered a waiver of any \u201cright\u201d to a proper venue. (See, e.g., <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Brunswick-Balke etc. Co. </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 579, 582 [127 P.2d 924, 141 A.L.R. 1173]; <em>Wadleigh </em>v. <em>Phelps </em>(1905) 147 Cal. 541, 542 [82 P. 200].) Section 396b of the Code of Civil Procedure represents an explicit codification of the general \u201cwaivability\u201d of venue defects, providing that, notwithstanding the governing venue provisions, an action may generally be tried \u201cin the court where commenced\u201d unless the defendant makes a timely motion for change of venue;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> if no such motion is urged, the defendant is considered to have waived any defect. Plaintiffs do not dispute that this is the general rule under section 396b.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Section 396b explicitly recognizes, however, that the cases governed by the immediately preceding section, section 396a, i.e., actions within the subject matter jurisdiction of justice courts, constitute an exception to its general rule.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Plaintiffs contend that both the statutory language of section 396a, and the purpose underlying its enactment, reveal the section as a distinct provision to which the general principles of \u201cwaiver\u201d of venue rights, relied on by defendant, do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Although, for the reasons discussed below, we agree with plaintiffs\u2019 contention that section 396a embodies an exception, in cases involving small monetary claims, to the general rule that a failure to move for a change of venue constitutes a \u201cwaiver\u201d of any venue defects, it does not follow that this \u201cnonwaivability\u201d feature of section 396a automatically renders all final judgments obtained under inadequate complaints subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>either collateral or direct attack. As we explain <em>infra, </em>we recognize that a defendant\u2019s failure to move for a change of venue does not waive his statutory right to the trial court\u2019s dismissal or transfer of the action to the proper venue. Nor does such failure preclude the defendant from attacking an improperly entered judgment on appeal or by a timely motion for relief from default. On the other hand, when a trial court erroneously fails to dismiss or transfer the action and the defendant <em>does not raise a timely objection </em>to such error, we conclude that a final judgment rendered on an inadequate complaint is not void for lack of jurisdiction and thus cannot be set aside at any time in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">a. <em>Under section 396a, a party\u2019s failure to move for a change of venue does not constitute a \u201cwaiver\u201d of his venue rights.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">In general, section 396a is designed to protect defendants in actions involving relatively small monetary claims from the inequitable harassment that may ensue when the action is filed in a distant venue. A brief historical review will place the section in a proper perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Prior to 1933, the justice courts, which had jurisdiction over such small claims, operated with strict territorial limitations on their jurisdiction; during this early era, defendants were insulated from the harassment of actions brought in distant, inconvenient forums by the provisions of section 848 of the Code of Civil Procedure (since repealed), which in most cases limited the service of summons in justice court matters to defendants residing within the township of the justice court in which suit was brought.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Under the governing case law, if an action were brought in the justice court of the wrong township, and the summons was improperly served on a distant defendant, any default judgment obtained was \u201cvoidable\u201d for lack of jurisdiction over the defendant\u2019s person and was thus subject to collateral attack. (See, e.g., <em>Isert </em>v. <em>Riecks </em>(1925) 195 Cal. 569 [234 P. 371]; <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Barnet </em>(1913) 165 Cal. 423 [132 P. 588].)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">In 1933 the code provisions dealing with the jurisdiction of municipal and justice courts were completely reorganized, and both courts were given statewide jurisdiction over the person. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 83, 84.)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Legislature, however, endeavored to maintain some protection for defendants against distant suits on small claims by enacting section 396a.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Under section 396a, unlike general pleading provisions, a plaintiff who institutes an action which falls within the subject matter jurisdiction of justice courts must state facts, in a verified complaint or affidavit, revealing the proper venue of the action, and the <em>court </em>then has the obligation to dismiss the action <em>\u201con its own motion, </em>or on motion of the defendant\u201d (italics added) if the complaint lacks such factual declarations.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">By the section\u2019s terms, if an adequate complaint is not filed \u201cno further proceedings shall be had in the action . . . except to dismiss the same . . . unless the defendant consents in writing, or in open court ... to the keeping of the action ... in the court where commenced.\u201d Thus, whereas under section 396b a defendant is required to make a timely motion for change of venue to preserve venue rights, under section 396a the defendant is explicitly absolved of this burden and, unless he consents in writing or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>open court to the maintenance of the action in the county where commenced, the trial court is instructed to dismiss <em>on its own motion </em>any action brought pursuant to an inadequate complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Section 396a places these special requirements on both the plaintiff and the trial court in recognition of the serious potential for harassment that arises if a plaintiff, in a small monetary action, commences his action in a distant forum. As we have discussed above, defendants in such cases will often be financially unable to expend the money to travel to a distant forum, or to hire an attorney to do so, even simply to move for a change of venue. Without the protection of section 396a, a plaintiff, aware of these practical limitations, could exploit the situation by filing all such actions in distant counties where a defendant could not afford either to defend or to move for change of venue, and could thereby unfairly obtain default judgments or favorable settlements in such actions. To eliminate such abuse, section 396a requires the plaintiff to reveal facts demonstrating where the action should be tried, and then places upon the trial court the initial responsibility for protecting an absent defendant\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">In light of both the language and the purpose of the provision, we believe that the present, plaintiffs\u2019 failure to appear and to move for a change of venue in their earlier litigation cannot properly be considered a \u201cwaiver\u201d of their venue rights under section 396a. Notwithstanding these individuals\u2019 failure to make such change of venue motions, section 396a required, the trial courts in the prior actions to scrutinize independently the collection agency\u2019s complaints and to dismiss or transfer such complaints on the court\u2019s own motion if they proved to be inadequate. As we have already noted, the \u201cform complaints\u201d allegedly utilized by the defendant agency with regularity are insufficient under sections 395 and 396a (see fn. 15, <em>supra), </em>and thus, as plaintiffs suggest, the trial courts in the earlier actions properly should not have permitted the entry of default judgments pursuant to such complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The instant plaintiffs, however, possessed a variety of means of avoiding the adverse consequences resulting from the trial court\u2019s erroneous failure to independently protect their interests in the earlier litigation. First, although section 396a does not require defendants to move for a change of venue, the provision clearly permitted these parties to file such a motion to advise the court of any defect in the complaint; in fact, since a formal motion is not required, plaintiffs could have protected their interests, and assisted the trial court in its statutory duty, by bringing any inadequacies of the complaint to the court\u2019s attention through an informal letter or by any other appropriate means. (See 1 Chadbourn, et al., Cal. Pleading, \u00a7 405, p. 373.) Moreover, after a trial judge had erroneously entered a default <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>judgment pursuant to an inadequate complaint, the instant plaintiffs were, of course, free to attack such error on appeal of the judgment, or alternatively, to seek relief through a timely motion to set aside the default judgment pursuant to section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> For the reasons discussed above, the parties\u2019 initial failure to move for a change of venue would not have constituted a \u201cwaiver\u201d under section 396a and thus would not have precluded such attack on appeal or by motion for relief from default.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">b.  <em>The venue requirements of section 396a are not \u2018\u2018jurisdictional\u201d in a fundamental sense, and final judgments\u2014including those entered pursuant to faulty complaints\u2014may not be set aside as \u2018\u2018void.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Plaintiffs contend, however, that in addition to being subject to reversal on appeal, or to being set aside under section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure, default judgments entered pursuant to inadequate complaints are \u201cvoid\u201d for lack of jurisdiction and are thus vulnerable to direct or collateral attack at any time. It is on this \u201cjurisdictional\u201d theory\u2014a theory quite distinct from the \u201cwaiver\u201d issue discussed above\u2014that plaintiffs\u2019 instant attempt to set aside all default judgments entered in favor of the defendant collection agency during the two years preceding the commencement of this suit ultimately rests. As discussed below, we have concluded that section 396a does not affect the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction in a fundamental sense, and thus that improperly entered judgments which have become final are not subject to collateral attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 characterization of section 396a as a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d provision rests primarily on the mandatory nature of the section\u2019s terminology. Plaintiffs point out that section 396a declares that the \u201cplaintiff <em>must </em>state facts in the complaint . . . from which it can be determined which court is . . . the proper court for trial [and] ... if such complaint be not so filed, no further proceeding shall be had in the action . . . except to dismiss the same, ...\u201d (Italics added.) Relying on the case of <em>State of California </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1936) 14 Cal.App.2d 718, 721-723 [58 P.2d 1322],<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> plaintiffs reason from this mandatory language that a judgment entered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>contravention of the statute\u2019s directive is \u201cin excess of jurisdiction\u201d and \u201cvoid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">As this court has cautioned on many occasions, however, the term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d carries a variety of meanings;<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the <em>State of California </em>decision to support their present attack on final judgments reveals a failure to appreciate the distinctions between different levels of \u201cjurisdictional\u201d defects. To be sure, the <em>State of California </em>decision, like the instant case, did involve a mandatory venue provision, but the \u201cjurisdictional\u201d issue in that case turned only on whether a writ of prohibition could issue to restrain a trial court from acting in contravention of the venue provision. The Court of Appeal\u2019s finding of an \u201cexcess of jurisdiction\u201d in that context of prohibition was not the equivalent of a finding of a lack of jurisdiction in the fundamental sense so as to render any final judgment \u201cvoid\u201d and subject to collateral attack. \u201cIn certiorari and prohibition proceedings the term jurisdiction has a very broad meaning, and a writ may be granted where the court has no jurisdiction to act except in a particular manner, even though it has jurisdiction, in the fundamental sense, over the subject matter and the parties.\u201d <em>(Rescue Army </em>v. <em>Municipal Court (1946) 28 </em>Cal.2d 460, 463-464 [171 P.2d 8].) The other \u201cjurisdictional\u201d precedents relied on by plaintiffs are generally distinguishable from the instant case on the same ground.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In <em>Newman </em>v. <em>County of Sonoma </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 625 [15 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>914, 364 P.2d 850], on the other hand, our court did confront the question of whether a mandatory venue provision\u2014in that case section 394 of the Code of Civil Procedure relating to\u00a1 actions brought against counties<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>\u2014 affected the trial court\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction in the fundamental sense, that is, . . . [its] power to try the action.\u201d (56 Cal.2d at pp. 626-627.) In concluding that the provision, though mandatory, did not affect the court\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in a fundamental sense, Chief Justice Gibson, writing for a unanimous court, declared: <em>\u201cExcept in a few cases in which the Constitution makes the place of trial jurisdictional (see art. VI, \u00a7 5) or a statute makes a local place of trial part of the grant of subject matter jurisdiction, venue is not jurisdictional [in the fundamental sense.] </em>[Citation.] Section 394 is not the statute granting subject matter jurisdiction in this type of case and does not purport to specify the place of trial as part of such a grant. The authority to sue counties is set forth in the Government Code, without any limitation as to the place of the suit. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 23004, subd. (a).) The Legislature, instead of including the provision before us as part of the authorization in the Government Code, placed it in the Code of Civil Procedure among several venue provisions which are clearly not jurisdictional. [Citation.] It should also be noted that section 394 provides that upon stipulation of the parties actions referred to in the section may be tried in any county.\u201d (Italics added.) (56 Cal.2d at p. 627.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">The <em>Newman </em>court\u2019s analysis with respect to Code of Civil Procedure section 394 applies equally to Code of Civil Procedure section 396a. Although the language of the section is mandatory, the present action is not one in which the Constitution makes venue jurisdictional, nor is section , 396a a statute which specifies a particular place of trial as part of the grant of subject matter jurisdiction. (Cf. <em>McPheeters </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1946) 74 Cal.App.2d 46, 49 [168 P.2d. 65]; Civ. Code, \u00a7 1812.10 (found jurisdictional in (1968) 51 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 179).) The grant of general subject matter jurisdiction for the contract actions which plaintiffs now attack is, of course, encompassed in, a variety of provisions in the Civil Code (see Civ. Code, \u00a7 1427 et seq.); instead of including section 396a as a limitation on that grant of jurisdictional power, the Legislature included the section in the Code of Civil Procedure \u201camong several venue provisions which are clearly not jurisdictional.\u201d (56 Cal.2d at p. 627.) In addition, section 396a, like section 394 involved in <em>Newman, </em>permits a defendant to stipulate to the trial of the action in a venue other than provided by the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Given these similarities to the <em>Newman </em>decision, we conclude that noncompliance with section 396a does not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the litigation and does not render a judgment erroneously entered \u201cvoid\u201d for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Although we recognize that a prime purpose of the section is to protect absent defendants from default judgments obtained in improper counties, the section seeks to accomplish this purpose not by rendering void all judgments obtained in improper counties, but by placing an independent responsibility on the trial court to scrutinize all complaints, even when no change of venue motion is filed. If the court improperly enters a default judgment on an inadequate com-. plaint, the defendant can still protect himself by appealing the judgment or by moving to set aside the default. A plaintiff\u2019s failure to file an adequate complaint under section 396a does not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the claim, however, and thus we conclude that final judgments entered on such complaints are not void. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 first cause of action was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">4.  <em>At the time of the commencement of this action Civil Code section 1812.90 did not govern defendant\u2019s actions on open book accounts, and thus plaintiffs are not entitled to have judgments in such actions set aside.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">In addition to attacking final judgments obtained by defendant agency in the small monetary matters governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 396a, plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint also seeks\u2014in the second cause of action\u2014to set aside past judgments in actions \u201con installment sales,\u201d allegedly obtained in violation of Civil Code section 1812.10,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>datory venue provision established by the Unruh Retail Installment Sales Act. Although, the complaint describes these challenged actions as based simply on \u201cinstallment sales,\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 own description of the defendant collection agency\u2019s practice, and the numerous \u201cform complaints\u201d appended to plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings, reveal that the actions against which plaintiffs\u2019 second cause of action is directed are actions brought by the collection agency on debts allegedly outstanding on its clients\u2019 \u201copen book accounts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Defendant claims that in 1968, when plaintiffs\u2019 present action was filed, suits brought on such \u201caccounts\u201d were not suits on \u201ccontracts\u201d within the meaning of Civil Code section 1812.10, and thus that plaintiffs cannot properly challenge judgments obtained prior to 1968 for noncompliance with that section. Plaintiffs, while conceding in this court that the actions they attack involve \u201cinstallment accounts,\u201d contend that suits on such accounts have been covered by section 1812.10\u2019s requirements since the section\u2019s enactment in 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">As originally enacted, section 1812.10 set out the mandatory venue requirements for all actions \u201con a <em>contract </em>under the provisions of this chapter.\u201d (Italics added.) In 1969, the Legislature amended the section to include all actions \u201con a contract <em>or installment account </em>under the provisions of this chapter,\u201d (italics added) and the critical question is whether this addition was merely a \u201cremedial\u201d change, simply making explicit the broad scope that the Legislature had always intended, or whether the amendment was essential to bring actions on installment accounts within section 1812.10\u2019s reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">From the initial enactment of the Unruh Retail Installment Sales Act in 1959, the act has separately defined \u201cretail installment contracts\u201d and \u201cretail installment accounts\u201d in distinct statutory sections. Civil Code section 1802.6<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> provides in brief that \u201c \u2018[rjetail installment contract\u2019 or \u2018contract\u2019 means any contract for a retail installment sale . . . which provides for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>repayment in installments\u201d; the kind of transaction covered by this section is typified by the normal purchase of a substantial \u201cconsumer durable,\u201d such as a refrigerator or television set, in which the purchaser signs a distinct agreement to pay for the merchandise in installments. In contrast, Civil Code section 1802.7<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> defines the terms \u201cretail installment account,\u201d \u201cinstallment account\u201d and \u201crevolving account\u201d as \u201can account established by an agreement . . . pursuant to which the buyer promises to pay, in installments, to a [retailer], his outstanding balance incurred in retail installment sales\u201d; this section reaches the typical retail store \u201ccharge account,\u201d so prevalent in contemporary consumer financing. Although these two types of installment financing have many features in common, the Unruh Retail Installment Sales Act, from its inception, has defined the two categories of transactions separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">In light of the clear distinction drawn by the act between \u201cretail installment <em>contracts\u2019'' </em>and \u201cretail installment accounts\u201d we cannot interpret section 1812.10\u2019s original reference to \u201cactions on a contract\u201d as also embodying actions brought on an \u201cinstallment account.\u201d Although the terms of the Unruh Act must certainly be construed liberally to protect the consumer (see <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Reasor Corp. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 881, 889 [73 Cal.Rptr. 398, 447 P.2d 638]), we believe that in light of the definition provided by the act itself, creditors who brought suits on \u201cinstallment accounts\u201d prior to the 1969 amendment of section 1812.10 could not reasonably be expected to comply with the requirements of that provision. Under the present section as amended, of course, there is no question but that such actions on installment accounts are fully subject to section 1812.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">We thus conclude that plaintiffs cannot under Civil Code section 1812.10 properly attack final judgments in actions on installment accounts which the defendant agency had secured prior to the institution of this suit in 1968. Consequently, defendant\u2019s demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 second cause of action was properly sustained. '</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">5. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">According to the allegations of the complaint,'.which we must assume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>to be true in reviewing the sustaining of a demurrer, defendant collection agency has, for a number of years, been following a course of conduct that can fairly be described as a gross abuse of process. In order to impair debtors\u2019 ability to defend litigation, the collection agency has been wilfiilly filing actions in improper venues, under inadequate \u201cform complaints,\u201d with full knowledge that such venue is improper. By virtue of that practice, the collection agency has secured many undeserved default judgments as well as overly favorable settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Initially, we have concluded that on the basis of these allegations, plaintiffs have stated a cause of action entitling them to injunctive relief, either on a theory that defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes a recurring \u201cabuse of process\u201d against which other legal remedies are inadequate, or alternatively, because such conduct constitutes an \u201cunlawful . . . business practice\u201d enjoinable under section 3369 of the Civil Code. Accordingly, the demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 third cause of action was improperly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Second, we have determined that final default judgments, though secured in violation of Code of Civil Procedure section 396a, are not \u201cvoid\u201d for lack of jurisdiction in the fundamental sense. Consequently, defendant\u2019s demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 first cause was correctly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Finally, we have concluded that plaintiffs are not entitled to attack judgments obtained by defendant prior to 1968 under section 1812.10 of the Civil Code, because prior to 1969, the agency\u2019s actions on \u201cinstallment accounts\u201d were not governed by the provisions of that section. The demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 second cause of action was thus properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">We recognize that mass production of goods accounts for the mass selling of goods, a process that, by means of advertising, often entices the installment purchase of products for which the buyer cannot pay. Yet this mass merchandising does not justify the mass filing of law suits at places where they do not belong. Despite any claims of economy or expedition the exponents of such selling and such litigation can offer, a defendant may still insist that in order to exert his individualized right of defense, he be sued in the proper venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The judgment is reversed with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 third cause of action; in all other respects the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Wright, C. J., McComb, J., Peters, J., Mosk, J., Burke, J., and Sullivan, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b129-10\"> Plaintiffs joined the agency\u2019s attorney, Irwin Eskanos, as a party defendant. For convenience, both the agency and its attorney will be referred to in this opinion simply as \u201cdefendant,\u201d \u201cdefendant agency,\u201d or \u201cthe agency.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b130-7\">As explained below, section 396a of the Code of Civil Procedure applies only to actions which fall within the jurisdiction of the justice courts; at the commencement of this suit, this covered actions involving claims of $500 or less. Section 1812.10 of the Civil Code, at the date this suit was commenced, covered only actions brought on \u201cretail installment contracts\u201d as defined in the Unruh Installment Sales Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1800 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">In addition to the main prayers for injunctive relief and the setting aside of final judgments, plaintiffs requested that defendant agency be required to deposit in court all moneys collected on the allegedly \u201cvoid\u201d judgments, and that the agency be required to disclose the names of all defendants in such actions to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs also prayed for such general and punitive damages as might be appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b132-6\">In the trial court, defendant contended that the instant action was not an appropriate \u201cclass action,\u201d apparently on the grounds that the plaintiff class did not have a sufficiently shared interest to make a representative suit appropriate. Under the flexible standards articulated in our recent decisions in <em>Vasquez </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 800 [94 Cal.Rptr. 796, 484 P.2d 964] and <em>La Sala </em>v. <em>American Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 864 [97 Cal.Rptr. 849, 489 P.2d 1113], however, it is apparent that at least at this stage of the pleadings the plaintiffs, in attacking a uniform practice allegedly utilized with respect to all the class members, have demonstrated a sufficient common interest to survive a demurrer on these grounds. Apparently in light of these recent cases, decided during the pendency of this appeal, defendant has not challenged the \u201cclass\u201d nature of the action in this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u201cProcess,\u201d as used in the tort of \u201cabuse of process,\u201d has never been limited to the strict sense of the term, but instead has been interpreted broadly to encompass the entire range of \u201cprocedures\u201d incident to litigation. For example, in <em>Thornton </em>v. <em>Rhoden </em>(1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 80, 94-95 [53 Cal.Rptr. 706, 23 A.L.R.3d 1152], the court recognized that while \u201cthe giving of a notice that a deposition will be taken is not \u2018process\u2019 in the strictest sense of the word ... in a proper case [the] abuse of the powers which a litigant derives from the taking of a deposition on proper notice gives such notice the status of \u2018process\u2019 for the purpose of the tort [of abuse of process].\u201d Similarly, in <em>Tellefsen </em>v. <em>Key System Transit Lines </em>(1961) 198 Cal.App.2d 611, 613 [17 Cal.Rptr. 919], the court, while finding no abuse in the case before it, recognized that under certain circumstances, the <em>taking of an appeal </em>could give rise to an abuse of process. (See also <em>Tranchina </em>v. <em>Arcinas </em>(1947) 78 Cal.App.2d 522 [178 P.2d 65] (eviction under false pretense constituted abuse of process)). Other jurisdictions have recognized the propriety of an abuse of process action when a plaintiff has intentionally misfiled an action for an improper purpose. (See <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Chapin </em>(1844) 49 Mass. (8 Met.) 31.) This broad reach of the \u201cabuse of process\u201d tort can be explained historically, since the tort evolved as a \u201ccatch-all\u201d category to cover improper uses of the judicial machinery that did not fit within the earlier established, but narrowly circumscribed, action of malicious prosecution. (See <em>Italian Star Line </em>v. <em>United States Shipping Board. E. F. Corp. </em>(2d Cir. 1931) 53 F.2d 359, 361 [80 A.L.R. 576].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\"> Actually the risk defendant agency takes by misfiling complaints is not very great, because even in the rare case when venue is challenged, the only \u201csanction\u201d consists of the transfer of the suit to the proper venue. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 396a.) Thus if the agency succeeds in making the defense difficult enough, it will obtain a default judgment; if not, it will at worst face the trial of the case in the proper venue. Under these circumstances, the agency has everything to gain and nothing to lose by initially filing actions in improper courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b139-7\">See, e.g., Comment, <em>Small Claims Courts and the Poor </em>(1969) 42 Southern California Law Review 493, 499; cf. 51 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 179, 180a (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b139-8\">See, e.g., <em>Summary of Hearings on Debt Collection Practices, National Commission on Consumer Finance </em>(1971) 88 Banking Law Journal 291 (summary of hearings held on June 22 and 23, 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Chief Justice Burger has stressed that courts must improve the \u201cmachinery of justice\u201d so that the sense of confidence in the courts will not be destroyed by the belief among people \u201cwho have long been exploited\u201d that \u201cthe courts cannot vindicate their legal rights from fraud and overreaching in the smaller daily transactions of life.\u201d (Burger, <em>What\u2019s Wrong With the Courts: The Chief Justice Speaks Out, </em>U.S. News &amp; World Report (vol. 69, No. 8, Aug. 24, 1970) 68, 71 (address to ABA meeting, Aug. 10, 1970).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b140-8\">See, e.g., <em>Summary of Hearings on Debt Collection Practices, National Commission on Consumer Finance </em>(1971) 88 Banking Law Journal 291, 313 (testimony of Prof. David Caplovitz); Project, <em>Resort to the Legal Process in Collecting Debts from High Risk Credit Buyers in Los Angeles\u2014Alternative Methods for Allocating Present Costs </em>(1967) 14 University of California Los Angeles Law Review 879, 890-891; Schrag, <em>The Rights of Consumers </em>in The Rights of Americans (Dorsen ed. 1970) page 136.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b140-9\">See, e.g., Comment, <em>Small Claims Court and the Poor </em>(1969) 42 Southern California Law Review 493, 494; Note, <em>Abuse of Process: Sewer Service </em>(1967) 3 Columbia Journal of Law and Social Problems 17, 22, 29; <em>Summary of Hearings on Debt Collection Practices, National Commission on Consumer Finance </em>(1971) 88 Banking Law Journal 291, 323 (testimony of Mrs. Gardiner Jones, FTC Commissioner) .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b142-5\"> In <em>Colligan </em>v. <em>Activities Club of New York, Ltd. </em>(2d Cir. 1971) 442 F.2d 686 [170 U.S.P.Q. 113], cert. den. (1971) 404 U.S. 1004 [30 L.Ed.2d 557, 92 S.Ct. 559], the Second Circuit interpreted section 43(a) of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a)) providing for'suit by \u201cany person who believes that he is . . . damaged by the use of . . . [a] false description of representation!,]\u201d as permitting such actions to be brought only by injured commercial entities and not by consumers. In so finding, however, the court relied heavily on a statement of congressional purpose included in section 45 of the Lanham Act, which declared that \u201c[t]he intent of this chapter ... is to protect persons engaged in such commerce against unfair competition.\" (442 F.2d at pp. 691-692.) Section 3369 contains no comparable provision evidencing an intention to limit its protection to \u201cpersons engaged in . . . commerce,\u201d and in the absence of such explicit limiting language we cannot properly read the section\u2019s broad, unambiguous language as inapplicable to consumers, whose interests are certainly directly affected by unlawful or unfair business practices. (Cf. <em>Data Processing Service </em>v. <em>Camp </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 150, 153 [25 L.Ed.2d 184, 188, 90 S.Ct. 827].)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Moreover, in. adopting its restricted interpretation of section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, the <em>Colligan </em>court drew considerably on principles of federalism, which it believed warranted the limiting of federal \u201cinvolvement\u201d in the area of unfair competition and consumer protection, fields traditionally subject to state regulation. (442 F.2d at pp. 692-693.) Such considerations of federalism are, of course, entirely inapplicable to our court\u2019s present task of interpreting a state statute; indeed, the restrained federal stance exhibited in <em>Colligan </em>makes the recognition- of an effective state consumer remedy all the more imperative. In sum, we find nothing in the <em>Colligan </em>decision which requires us to constrict the natural reach of section 3369\u2019s broad standing provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The case of <em>International etc. Workers </em>v. <em>Landowitz </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 418 [126 P.2d 609] is not necessarily contrary to this reading of section 3369. In <em>Landowitz </em>the plaintiff union sought to enjoin defendant cleaners from violating statutory minimum price regulations. At the time of the filing of the litigation, the minimum price legislation, which afforded criminal sanctions, also provided injunctive relief, but, by the time the case had reached this court, the Legislature had amended the statute to eliminate the injunctive remedy. Despite this amendment, however, plaintiffs continued to seek an injunction under Civil Code section 3369.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">In denying such relief, our court was influenced both by the fact that the recent amendment evidenced an obvious legislative decision that such violations not be enjoinable and also by the traditional reluctance of equity to enjoin criminal behavior. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lim </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 872, 880 [118 P.2d 472].)

Moreover, as we discuss <em>infra, </em>in 1963, well after <em>Landowitz, </em>section 3369 was amended to cover any <em>\u201cunlawful\u201d </em>business practice and thus, in any event, <em>Landowitz\u2019s </em>view of the reach of the unamended provision cannot be regarded as controlling in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The 1963 amendment was passed unanimously by both chambers without debate.

L.Rev. 889, 963.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Although the agency argues preliminarily that its form complaints are not inadequate under section 396a, the \u201cfacts\u201d stated by such complaints\u2014that the agency is \u201cinformed and believes\" that the debt is \u201cpayable\u201d in Oakland\u2014are not sufficient to comply with sections 395 and 396a. The purpose of section 395\u2019s requirement of a \u201cspecial contract\u201d specifying the place of \u201cperformance,\u201d if suit <em>is to </em>be brought in such a location, is to prevent a defendant\u2019s venue rights from being destroyed by a plaintiff\u2019s unilateral assignment of the obligation to a distant assignee. Since the agency\u2019s complaint fails to allege the existence of a \u201cspecial contract\u201d under which the defendant in effect agreed to suit in Oakland, and also fails to allege facts demonstrating that the defendant in the suit resides in the county or entered into the contract in the county, the form complaint does not satisfy the statutory requirements.

The <em>Burtnett </em>court emphasized, however, that in that particular context section 580 implemented the constitutional requirements of due process, since the defaulting husband had been afforded <em>no notice </em>that the community property would be adjudicated in the prior litigation.

This conclusion, an alternate ground of decision not crucial to the result in <em>Carlon, </em>preceded our court\u2019s controlling decision in <em>Newman </em>by more than two decades and reflected an unfortunately common failure of early decisions to distinguish between different levels of \u201cjurisdictional\u201d defects.
