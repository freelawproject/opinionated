Plaintiff was assigned to work in a warehouse operated under a lease by defendant United States Lines at Wilmington, California. The warehouse was adjacent to a dock and was used to store cargo unloaded from vessels. On the occasion in question, 100-pound burlap sacks of fishmeal, stacked on wooden pallets, had been unloaded from the hold of a vessel and moved by forklifts into the warehouse for storage. Plaintiff\u2019s job was to \u201cbreak down\u201d the stacks in the warehouse with a forklift so that they were no more than two pallets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>high and could be more easily loaded by the truckers picking up the cargo for delivery to its consignees.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">The fishmeal was a difficult cargo to handle, because the sacks had a tendency to tear and to spill their contents. As a result the stacks were subject to shifting and tilting. The sacks of fishmeal were usually piled onto palletboards three or four layers high, with 18 to 22 sacks on each pallet. As a general practice the sacks were \u201cbulkheaded\u201d or tied in. In other words, they were so arranged that no one sack was directly on top of another, but rested on several sacks for firmer support, analogous to the arrangement of bricks in a building.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Upon arriving at defendant\u2019s warehouse on a Monday, plaintiff noticed that some of the fishmeal stacks were unusually arranged. They appeared to have more than 30 sacks to a pallet, and were not \u201cbulkheaded.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">There was a conflict in the testimony as to plaintiff\u2019s actions following these observations. Plaintiff testified that on the first morning he complained to defendant\u2019s chief marine clerk, Kenneth Noel, asking the latter, \u201cHow do you expect me to break this down with this hazardous condition that you have over here on this land side?\u201d According to plaintiff, Noel replied, \u201cJohn, there is nothing I can do about it. Just do the best you know how.\u201d Called as a defense witness, on direct examination, Noel denied that he had any conversation with plaintiff about the safety of the loads. On cross-examination, he reiterated this denial even when challenged with a statement in his deposition, taken a year and a half after the accident, that he did not remember whether or not such a conversation had taken place.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Plaintiff, who was the only longshoreman assigned to \u201cbreaking down\u201d the stacks, spoke to no one else about the condition of the cargo. The only supervisory personnel with whom he had contact on this job were his foreman and defendant\u2019s marine clerk, Noel. The record is unclear as to the extent of the latter\u2019s authority over the longshoremen. The major function of defendant\u2019s warehouse employees was to keep track of the movement of the cargo. However, defendant\u2019s marine clerks directed Asso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>dated Banning\u2019s forklift operators on such matters as where to place the pallets of cargo and how they should be stacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Plaintiff testified that the only effective supervision of his work was by defendant\u2019s marine clerks, that he was under orders from his own foreman to take directions from defendant\u2019s employees, and that refusal to do so could subject him to discharge by his own employer. He stated that he complained about the cargo to Noel \u201c[bjecause he was the only one there acting on part of supervision, and, also, as chief supervisor for the U.S. Lines.\u201d However, the record also indicates that it was not the function of defendant\u2019s marine clerks to supervise the work methods of Associated Banning. Plaintiff\u2019s own foreman, who was supervising 15 to 20 other longshoremen at a pier six to eight blocks away, appeared at the warehouse for only a few minutes each day. His primary function was to ascertain for payroll purposes whether plaintiff was working and whether or not he would be needed for another day on this job.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s safety expert, Joseph Bayer, testified on cross-examination that it was both the duty and the right of a longshoreman to refuse to handle clearly dangerous overloads. Bayer also stated that there is \u201c[n]o way whatsoever\u201d for a longshoreman to remove the cargo once it is stacked three pallet boards high, with 30 or more stacks per pallet board, without exposing himself to danger. Noel testified that it was the custom on the docks for a longshoreman who found a dangerous condition to report it to his business agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Herman Hargett, manager of labor relations for Associated Banning, was subpoenaed, and called as a witness by defendant. His duties were to represent not only Associated Banning but the industry as a whole in negotiations and disputes pertaining to contracts between the longshoremen and the various employers belonging to the Pacific Maritime Association. He testified that the dock foreman was the immediate superior of the longshoremen working on the dock and in the warehouse, including those operating forklifts, but that defendant\u2019s marine clerks told the forklift operators where to place the cargo and how high to arrange the stacks of pallets. He stated that \u201cif [a condition] is unsafe, he should immediately stop work until it is made safe. This is contractual language,\u201d referring to the contract between the Pacific Maritime Association and the International Longshoremen\u2019s Union.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>According to Hargett, under this contract, if a longshoreman encountered an unsafe condition, he was supposed to stop work immediately. \u201cIn Gyerman\u2019s case, if there was no supervision there immediately to take care of the situation, why, he would have to surmount it by setting it aside or getting another lot to work on, or have supervision called, which in this case the U.S. Lines would have called us, and we would have sent men there to take care of the situation, if he was in such a condition he couldn\u2019t operate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">After his conversation with Noel, plaintiff proceeded to break down the fishmeal stacks by using a forklift, which was equipped with a canopy to protect the operator against being struck by falling cargo. During his first three days on the job, more than the usual number of sacks tumbled from loads which plaintiff was moving, but all were deflected from striking him by the forklift\u2019s canopy. At 4 p.m. on Thursday a dozen or more sacks fell at once from the top of a load that plaintiff was moving, causing a ricochet effect. At least one of the sacks was apparently propelled toward plaintiff from an unprotected side of the forklift. Plaintiff recalls seeing the entire load shifting towards him, as if sacks were falling off the top pallet. He found himself on the floor on the left side of the forklift opposite the seat, without knowing exactly what knocked him off the vehicle. As a result he sustained injuries to his lower back and legs.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Plaintiff commenced the present action for damages for the personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>injuries allegedly caused by defendant\u2019s negligence. Defendant denied the material allegations of the complaint and as an affirmative defense asserted that plaintiff himself was guilty of contributory negligence in that he carelessly and negligently drove and operated the forklift so as to cause the accident. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the first trial a jury returned a verdict for defendant. The court granted a new trial on the ground of the insufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The order granting a new trial was affirmed on appeal. <em>(Gyerman </em>v. <em>United States Lines Company, </em>2 Civ. 31209, filed March 25, 1968, certified for nonpublication.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>\u201cSupplement III.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>The appellate court rejected defendant\u2019s threefold contention that the trial court had abused its discretion in granting a new trial because (1) there was no evidence of defendant\u2019s negligence, (2) there was no evidence that any negligence of defendant was a proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury, and (3) the evidence established that plaintiff was contributorily negligent as a matter of law. In its opinion, the Court of Appeal set forth the conversation between plaintiff and Noel, defendant\u2019s employee. It also referred to defendant\u2019s statutory duty as an employer, under Labor Code sections 6302, 6304, and 6400-6404,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to furnish plaintiff a safe place to work, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>and found abundant evidence that defendant had breached its duty to plaintiff by using a method of pallet-stacking which violated section 3256, subdivision (b) of the General Safety Orders of the Division of Industrial Safety.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Court of Appeal concluded that, \u201cAlthough there was some evidence from which there might arise a whisper of contributory negligence on respondent\u2019s part, that hint of contributory negligence cannot be converted into negligence upon his part as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">On retrial, it was stipulated by the parties that the matter could be heard by the court sitting without a jury on the transcript of the first trial. After considering the pleadings, the transcript and the arguments of counsel, the trial court found in substance that defendant negligently maintained and stored the fishmeal cargo in a dangerous and unsafe condition \u201cwhich was a proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries\u201d; that jt was plaintiff\u2019s duty to stop work immediately when he encountered an unsafe condition and report it to his own supervisor; that plaintiff encountered what he considered to be an unsafe condition, for four days prior to his accident but \u201cfailed to report these conditions to his own supervisor, even though he had contact with his supervisor daily, and in so failing to report the condition he violated a duty of care owed for his own protection, which violation amounted to the failure to use ordinary care, and which failure was the proximate cause of his injuries\u201d; and that the condition \u201cwas not impossible to correct\u201d and there was no reason to excuse plaintiff from failing to perform his duty of care for his own protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The court concluded that defendant was negligent and that its negligence was the proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries; that plaintiff was contributorily negligent and \u201cthat his contributory negligence was the proximate cause of [his] injuries\u201d; and that defendant was entitled to judgment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Judgment was entered accordingly. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Only plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence is at issue on this appeal. Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>tiff challenges the adverse judgment on this point on the grounds that (1) the trial judge ignored the doctrine of law of the case, (2) defendant was estopped from asserting plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence, and (3) defendant failed to sustain its burden of proving plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">1. <em>The Law of the Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The opinion in the first appeal does not, as plaintiff urges, foreclose subsequent determination of contributory negligence by operation of the law of the case doctrine.  As stated by Witkin, \u201cThe doctrine of \u2018law of the case\u2019 deals with the effect of the <em>first appellate decision </em>on the subsequent <em>retrial or appeal: </em>The decision of an appellate court, stating a rule of law necessary to the decision of the case, conclusively establishes that rule and makes it determinative of the rights of the same parties in any subsequent retrial or appeal in the same case.\u201d (6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, \u00a7 633, p. 4552, original italics; see <em>Tally </em>v. <em>Ganahl </em>(1907) 151 Cal. 418, 421 [90 P. 1049].)  But, the \u201cdiscussion or determination of a point not necessary to the disposition of a question that is decisive of the appeal is generally recorded as obiter dictum and not as the law of the case.\u201d <em>(Stockton Theatres, Inc. </em>v. <em>Palermo </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 469, 474 [304 P.2d 7].) \u201cIt is fundamental that the point relied upon as law of the case must have been <em>necessarily involved </em>in the case.\u201d (Witkin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 647, p. 4564, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">In the case at bench, the first appeal by defendant unsuccessfully challenged the order granting plaintiff a new trial. In affirming that order, it was necessary for the Court of Appeal to determine only that the trial court had not abused its discretion. If it had concluded that plaintiff had been contributorily negligent as a matter of law, then it would have been obliged to reverse the new trial order. But the Court of Appeal held that plaintiff could not be considered contributorily negligent <em>as a matter of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number><em>law. </em>(See, e.g., <em>M &amp; M Transport </em>v. <em>Cal. Auto Transport </em>(1955) 43 Cal.2d 847, 850-851 [279 P.2d 13]; <em>Anthony </em>v. <em>Hobbie </em>(1945) 25 Cal.2d 814, 818 [155 P.2d 826].)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">In other words, the decision on the first appeal left the issue of contributory negligence for the determination of the trier of fact upon retrial, holding that the evidence was not so clear that reasonable men could not reach, different conclusions. Indeed, the Court of Appeal\u2019s statement that \u201cthere was some evidence from which there might arise a whisper of contributory negligence on [plaintiff\u2019s] part\u201d lends support to this interpretation. Although the record included <em>some </em>evidence of contributory negligence, it was not sufficient to support a conclusion that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering a new trial. Therefore the judge on retrial, as the trier of fact, was free to decide the issue of contributory negligence as it appeared to him, regardless of the identity of the record in the two trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">2. <em>Estoppel to Assert Contributory Negligence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Plaintiff next contends that defendant should be estopped from asserting contributory negligence as a defense because its marine clerk, Noel, misled plaintiff by informing him that nothing could be done about the dangerous condition of the palletized cargo. But this contention is raised for the first time on appeal and was not a part of the theory on which the case was tried. Plaintiff did not claim in the trial court that he was misled by Noel\u2019s statement and he \u201cis not permitted to change his position . . . on appeal.\u201d <em>(Ernst </em>v. <em>Searle </em>(1933) 218 Cal. 233, 240-241 [22 P.2d 715].) Plaintiff seeks to bring himself within the exception to this rule which permits a change of theory if \u201ca question of law only is presented on the facts appearing in the record . . . .\u201d <em>(Panopulos </em>v. <em>Maderis </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 337, 341 [303 P.2d. 738]; see also <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Taggart </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 736, 742 [336 P.2d 534].) We have said that the \u201cexistence of an estoppel is generally a question of fact for the trial court whose determination is conclusive oil\"appeal unless the opposite conclusion is the only one that can be reasonably drawn from the evidence. [Citation.] When the evidence is not in conflict and is susceptible of only one reasonable inference, the existence of an estoppel is a question of law. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Driscoll </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 297, 305-306 [61 Cal.Rptr. 661, 431 P.2d 245].) The crucial fact upon which plaintiff must base his estoppel argument is his purported conversation with Noel, defendant\u2019s employee, but all of the facts pertinent to that conversation were strongly disputed at trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under the circumstances, we cannot conclude that as a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>of law defendant should be held estopped from asserting the defense of contributory negligence. To that defense we now direct our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">3. <em>Contributory Negligence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">As we have already pointed out, the trial court essentially found that (1) defendant negligently maintained and operated its warehouse by storing fishmeal sacks in a dangerous and unsafe condition and (2) plaintiff himself, upon encountering this condition, was negligent in failing to report it to his own supervisor and that such \u201cfailure was the proximate cause of his injuries.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court further found that the unsafe condition \u201cwas not impossible to correct.\u201d The nucleus of the court\u2019s decision then was that plaintiff\u2019s failure to report was a proximate cause- of his injuries because-if he had reported it, the condition would have been corrected. Plaintiff contends that in the light of all the evidence indicating that the condition could not be corrected and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, defendant failed to sustain its burden of proof as to both contributory negligence and proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u201cContributory negligence is conduct on the part of the plaintiff which falls below the standard to which he should conform for his own protection, and which is a legally contributing cause co-operating with the negligence of the defendant in bringing about the plaintiff\u2019s harm.\u201d (Rest. 2d Torts (1965) \u00a7 463; see Prosser, Torts (4th ed. 1971) \u00a7 65, pp. 416-417.)  The question of contributory negligence is ordinarily one of fact for the determination of the trier of fact. <em>(Pike </em>v. <em>Frank G. Hough Co. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 465, 473 [85 Cal.Rptr. 629, 467 P.2d 229]; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Brinkerhoff </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 180, 183-184 [258 P.2d 834].)  \u201cA plaintiff is required to exercise only that amount of care which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>would be exercised by a person of ordinary prudence in the same circumstances.\u201d <em>(Werkman </em>v. <em>Howard Zink Corp. </em>(1950) 97 Cal.App.2d 418, 421 [218 P.2d 43].)  Where a person must work under possibly unsafe or dangerous conditions, the amount of care he must exercise for his own safety may well be less than would otherwise be required by reason of the necessity of his giving attention to- his work. <em>(Pike </em>v. <em>Frank G. Hough Co., supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 473; <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Riverside Portland Cement Co. </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 225, 239 [282 P.2d 69].) The burden of proving that the plaintiff was negligent and that such negligence was a proximate cause of the accident is on the defendant. <em>(Anthony </em>v. <em>Hobbie, supra, </em>25 Cal.2d at p. 818; <em>Gett </em>v. <em>Pacific G. &amp; E. Co. </em>(1923) 192 Cal. 621, 631 [221 P. 376]; Rest. 2d Torts, \u00a7 477.)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">In the instant case, absent evidence of the contract governing plaintiff\u2019s employment and of the custom and practice affecting stevedoring, we doubt that the record would provide evidentiary support for the finding that plaintiff violated a standard of due care for his own safety. Considered in the light of the realities of his working life (see <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Riverside Portland Cement Co., supra, </em>44 Cal.2d at p. 239), the laborer\u2019s duty may become considerably restricted in scope. In some instances he may find himself powerless to abandon the task at hand with impunity whenever he senses a possible danger; in others, he may be uncertain as to which person has supervision of the job or control of the place of employment, and therefore unsure as to whom he should direct his complaint; in still others, having been encouraged to continue working under conditions where danger lurks but has not materialized, he may be baffled in making an on-the-spot decision as to the imminence of harm. All of these factors enter into a determination whether his conduct falls below a standard of due care.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In the case before us the standard of due care required of laborers in general is explicated by evidence of duty imposed by contract and by custom upon the particular type of laborer involved. Custom alone, of course, does not create the standard of proper diligence. \u201cIndeed in most cases reasonable prudence is in fact common prudence; but strictly it is never its measure . . . .\u201d <em>(The T. J. Hooper </em>(2d Cir. 1932; Hand, L., J.) 60 F.2d 737, 740, cert. den. <em>sub nom. Eastern Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>Northern Barge Corp., </em>287 U.S. 662 [77 L.Ed. 571, 53 S.Ct. 220]; see <em>Complete Serv. Bur. </em>v. <em>San Diego Med. Soc. </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 201, 214 [272 P.2d 497]; Prosser, Torts, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 33, pp-, 166-168.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>\n                   Never<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>theless, although custom does not fix the standard of care, evidence of custom is ordinarily admissible for its bearing upon contributory negligence. <em>(Fowler </em>v. <em>Key System Transit Lines </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 65, 68 [230 P.2d 339]; 2 Harper and James, Torts (1956) \u00a7 173, pp. 977-978.)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">In the case at bench, the fact that a longshoreman faced with a safety hazard would generally report it to his own supervisor and would thereafter proceed with the job only as further directed by his superior suggests that plaintiff should have been more diligent in registering his complaint. Furthermore, the collective bargaining agreement under which plaintiff worked (see fn. 3, <em>ante) </em>and with which he was familiar indicates that a longshoreman had a significant amount of responsibility in respect to the reporting of unsafe working conditions. Testimony corroborates an interpretation of this contract as giving the longshoreman an absolute right to stop work if there is a safety hazard, and, by complaining to his steward, to set in motion the arbitration process.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Plaintiff testified that he complained only to Noel \u201c[b]ecause he was the only one there acting on part of supervision\u201d; nevertheless his justification in relying on Noel\u2019s response was ultimately a question of fact appropriately left to the trier of fact <em>(Meloy </em>v. <em>Texas Co. </em>(1953) 121 Cal.App.2d 691, 700 [263 P.2d 897]). Although the unsafe condition in the storage of the fishmeal was created by defendant\u2019s employees, in view of the foregoing evidence we conclude that there is sufficient support in the record for the finding that plaintiff failed to use ordinary care for his own protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">We must now inquire whether defendant sustained its burden of establishing that plaintiff\u2019s failure to report the unsafe condition was a \u201clegally contributing cause ... in bringing about the plaintiff\u2019s harm.\u201d (Rest. 2d Torts, \u00a7 463.) As previously noted, the trial court appears to have deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>mined that plaintiff\u2019s failure was a proximate cause of his injuries because if plaintiff had reported the condition it would have been corrected.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">On this issue the positions of the parties may be summarized thusly: Plaintiff argues that the burden was on defendant to prove that if plaintiff <em>had </em>reported the condition to his own supervisor instead of to defendant\u2019s supervisor, the condition would have been corrected or made safer. Defendant asserts that it was not incumbent upon it to prove that the condition complained of was correctable and that in any event there is evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The burden of proof rests on each party to a civil action as to each fact essential to his claim or defense (Evid. Code, \u00a7 500). A party claiming a person failed to exercise due care has the burden of proof on that issue (Evid. Code, \u00a7 521).  The burden of proving all aspects of the affirmative defense of contributory negligence, including causation, rests on the defendant <em>(Anthony </em>v. <em>Hobbie, supra, </em>25 Cal.2d at p. 818; <em>Gett </em>v. <em>Pacific G. &amp; E. Co., supra, </em>192 Cal. at p. 631; Rest. 2d Torts, \u00a7 477), unless the elements of the defense may be inferred from the plaintiff\u2019s evidence. <em>(Blanton </em>v. <em>Curry </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 793, 804 [129 P.2d 1].) The burden must be met by more than conjecture or speculation <em>(Reese </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1937) 9 Cal.2d 324, 328 [70 P.2d 933]; Prosser, <em>Proximate Cause in California </em>(1950) 38 CffiX.Rev. 369, 381.) Merely because plaintiff asserts that his own negligence, if any, could not have caused his injury, does not shift to him the burden of proof on the issue. Otherwise denial of any essential element of the defense case would shift the burden of proof on that issue to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">\u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s negligence is a legally contributing cause of his harm if, but only if, it is a substantial factor in bringing about his harm and there is no rule restricting his responsibility for it.\u201d (Rest. 2d Torts, \u00a7 465(1).) The rules determining this causal connection between the plaintiff\u2019s negligence and his harm are the same as those determining the causal relation between the defendant\u2019s negligence and the harm resulting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>others. (Rest. 2d Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 465(2), 430, 431; Prosser, Torts, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 65, p. 421.)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The fundamental question, then, is whether the plaintiff, as \u201cthe negligent actor has so produced the harm to himself ... for which he is sought to be held responsible ... as to make the law regard his conduct as the cause of the harm . . .'(Rest. 2d Torts, pp. 425-426.) His \u201cconduct must be a substantial factor operating with the defendant\u2019s negligence in bringing about the plaintiff\u2019s harm ....\u2019\u2019 (Rest. 2d Torts, \u00a7 465, com. b); that is, it must have \u201csuch an effect in producing the harm as to lead reasonable men to regard it as a cause, using that word in the popular sense, in which there always lurks the idea of responsibility . . . .\u201d (Rest. 2d Torts, \u00a7 431, com. a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">We turn now to the facts of the case before us. It is obvious, of course, from what we have said that plaintiff did not create or maintain the dangerous and unsafe conditions of storage. The trial court found upon substantial evidence that defendant negligently maintained and operated its warehouse under those conditions. It was defendant who had control of the cargo and directed its disposition and high stacking throughout the warehouse. Defendant alone created this risk of harm which materialized in the toppling of the stacks. \u25a0&gt;,</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Nor did the trial court find that plaintiff was negligent in his operation of the forklift<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> or in his \u201cbreaking down\u201d the particular stack of fishmeal whose sacks fell from the top of the load and injured him. In short there is no finding that any negligent conduct of plaintiff, operating with defendant\u2019s negligence, brought about the shifting and eventual dislodging of the sacks. According to the trial court\u2019s findings, plaintiff\u2019s negligence consisted solely in <em>his failure to report </em>the dangerous condition to his own supervisor. Our task then is to find in the record evidence showing, or from which it can be reasonably inferred, that this omission was a substantial factor in bringing about plaintiff\u2019s harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Defendant\u2019s theory of causation is that if plaintiff had reported the dangerous condition to his Associated Banning supervisor, that firm would have made the condition safer. An examination of the record, however, discloses no evidence establishing this theory. Indeed, although defendant vigorously asserts that the record supports a finding of proximate cause, it points to only one page of the extensive record for such evidence. At this part of the record, defendant\u2019s witness Hargett responded on direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>examination to a question about what a longshoreman should do upon encountering an unsafe condition. Hargett replied that he would have to get another lot to work on or \u201chave supervision called, . . . and we would have sent men there to take care of the situation, if he was in such a condition he couldn\u2019t operate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">In our view this testimony does not show that the stacks would have been made safer. Although it indicates that the problem would have received immediate attention, it provides no clue as to what, if anything, could have been done to break down the stacks of fishmeal more safely than by the use of forklifts. Indeed, other than the vague statement, as to sending \u201cmen there to take care of the situation\u201d no evidence at all was offered as to specific measures that would be taken. Nor does evidence as to the existence of a grievance procedure, formalized in the ILWU-PMA contract (see fn. 4, ante) constitute proof that in the particular situation culminating in plaintiff\u2019s injury, steps would have been taken to make the situation safer. Finally the trial court\u2019s suggestions made in its memorandum of decision (see fn. 15, ante) that the offending bags could have been removed by using ladders or having other forklift drivers remove them one at a time are not based upon evidence in the record and therefore do not support the finding. Indeed such suggestions only point up the complete lack of defense evidence in the record on this critical issue. The record does not establish that plaintiff\u2019s failure to- report the dangerous condition was a substantial factor in bringing about the fall of the sacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In view of the foregoing we conclude that defendant did not meet its burden of proving that plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence was a proximate cause of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u201cThe appellate courts have power to order a retrial on a limited issue, if that issue can be separately tried without such confusion or uncertainty as would amount to a denial of a fair trial. [Citations.] Whether it can or not depends upon the circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>(Brewer </em>v. <em>Second Baptist Church </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 791, 801 [197 P.2d 713]; see also <em>Templeton Feed &amp; Grain </em>v. <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 461, 469 [72 Cal.Rptr. 344, 446 P.2d 152]; <em>Little </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 55 Cal. 2d 642, 645 [12 Cal.Rptr. 481, 361 P.2d 13].)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The issue of plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence is separate and distinct from that of defendant\u2019s negligence. Although there are two aspects of the former issue, namely the question whether plaintiff was himself negligent and the question whether such negligence, if any, was a proximate cause of the accident, we are not satisfied that in the instant case they are so separate and distinct that the issue of proximate cause can be separately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>tried \u201cwithout such confusion or uncertainty as would amount to a denial of a fair trial,\u201d especially if it were tried to a jury.

Defendant alleged that Associated Banning was negligent in failing to provide plaintiff with a safe place to work, and that the employer and insurance company had expended funds to reimburse plaintiff for medical and disability benefits for which it could assert subrogation rights against plaintiff should he recover in this action. This appeal raises no issues relevant to the cross-complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b484-10\">In its specification of reasons, the court stated: \u201cThe evidence clearly established that defendant United States Lines Company was guilty of negligence in the operation, maintenance and control <em>of </em>its warehouse, the place wherein plaintiff was injured, and such negligence was the sole proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Having control of the warehouse, it caused cargo to be stored therein in a negligent manner. Stacks of cargo were maintained in an unstable condition and in such a manner as to endanger any longshoreman required to handle the same in the usual and customary manner. The evidence discloses that plaintiff, as a longshoreman, attempted to handle such cargo in the usual manner and in doing so conducted himself in every respect as a reasonable and prudent man would have done under the circumstances existing at the time of the accident. The evidence does not support any claim of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. Negligence of the defendant United States Lines Company was the sole proximate cause of the accident and plaintiff\u2019s injuries and plaintiff himself was not guilty of any negligence proximately contributing to the happening of the accident or the injuries sustained by him. For that reason the evidence does not justify the verdict of the jury and a new trial is required on that ground.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b484-11\">Sections 6302 and 6304 define \u201cplace of employment\u201d and \u201cemployer,\u201d respectively.

Plaintiff is not charged with accepting.a known risk created by defendant\u2019s conduct, but rather with violating a duty of care to himself by his own omission. In assumption of the risk the negligent party\u2019s liability is' negated by the injured party\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable acceptance of a risk.
