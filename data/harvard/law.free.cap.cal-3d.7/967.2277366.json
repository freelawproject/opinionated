In February 1967 petitioner was hired as a bookkeeper by Albright Express, owned by A. Chase Albright as a sole proprietor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mrs. Albright kept the company\u2019s books and sometimes signed the payroll checks. In. May 1967, Joseph Rasbidoski began working for the company as a salesman and dispatcher. The company also employed drivers and other office personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">In the spring of 1968, petitioner and Rasbidoski began to have personal difficulties with the Albrights, and by the following July were making plans to form a partnership and start their own trucking business.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">On Friday, August 9, 1968, petitioner informed Mrs. Albright that she wanted to leave the company because of the tensions of her job. In response, Mrs. Albright suggested that petitioner take a week or two of vacation to reconsider her decision. Petitioner agreed. However, she and Ras<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>bidoski proceeded to carry out their plans for a new business. Within a few days they established the J.R.L. Trucking Company and purchased three trucks for it. Immediately thereafter Rasbidoski quit his job with Albright Express and about the same time two of Albright\u2019s truck drivers also quit to work for petitioner\u2019s new business. The J.R.L. Trucking Company then commenced hauling operations, acquiring some of Albright\u2019s customers who transferred their business to the new firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">Petitioner, Rasbidoski and the truck drivers were owed wages by Al-bright Express and upon inquiry were told that Mr. Albright required them to pick up their final payroll checks in person at his office. On August 23, 1968, petitioner and Rasbidoski went there together. As they walked up to the establishment, they were confronted by Mr. Albright, who asked, \u201cAre you all prayed up?\u201d He then shot petitioner and Rasbidoski and killed himself. Each of the two former employees was seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Petitioner sought benefits under the workmen\u2019s compensation laws upon the theory that she had sustained an injury arising out of and in the course of her employment by Albright Express when she went to be paid for her past services. She also brought a civil action against Mr. Albright\u2019s executrix to recover damages for assault and battery. We proceed to set forth the pertinent chronology of all of these proceedings upon which, as we shall explain, the main issue before us turns.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">On September 17, 1968, petitioner filed with the Board an application for adjudication of claim. On April 11, 1969, she commenced a civil action for damages against Mr. Albright\u2019s executrix.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On October 3, 1969, a trial referee of the Board issued findings and award, finding that petitioner\u2019s injury did not arise out of and occur in the course of the employment with Albright Express, awarding petitioner reimbursement for certain medical-legal costs against Allstate, and ordering that petitioner take nothing further against the express company or Allstate. On November 18, 1969, the Board granted petitioner\u2019s petition for reconsideration. On <em>April 14, 1970, </em>in the civil actions for damages brought against Mr. Albright\u2019s estate by petitioner and Rasbidoski and consolidated for trial, the court, sitting without a jury, entered a judgment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in favor of \u201cplaintiffs jointly\u201d in the amount of $500,000 general damages and $150,000 punitive damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Notice of entry of judgment was mailed to the parties by the clerk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>of the court on the same day. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 664.5.) No appeal was taken and on June 15, 1970, said judgment became final. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rules 2(a), 45(a); Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 12a.) Meanwhile, in the workmen\u2019s compensation proceeding, on <em>May 6, 1970, </em>the Board issued its opinion and decision after reconsideration which in effect affirmed the findings and award of the trial referee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The instant petitions for a writ of review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">\n<em>The Busick Petition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">The positions of the parties in respect to this petition may be summarized as follows. Petitioner contends that the Board\u2019s decision that her injury did not arise out of and occur in the course of her employment is without any support in the evidence. She argues that the act of receiving compensation for services is one within the course of employment, particularly when, as here, it is done pursuant to- the direction of the employer. Allstate, on the other hand, contends that the shooting was the result of personal grievances and, therefore, not employment related; that, assuming petitioner returned to her former employer\u2019s place of business merely to obtain her paycheck, such act was not one within the course of her former employment; and that, in any event, the judgment of the superior court is res judicata on the issue of whether the assault by Albright on petitioner arose out of and occurred in the course of the employment. We have concluded that, as Allstate claims, the superior court judgment should be given res judicata effect precluding recovery before the Board and that, therefore, the decision of the Board should be affirmed. In view of this conclusion, we deem it unnecessary to reach the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">\u201cThe doctrine of res judicata precludes parties or their privies from relitigating a cause of action that has been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(Bernhard </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 807, 810 [122 P.2d 892]; see <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 752, 758 [87 Cal.Rptr. 526, 470 P.2d 662].) We have said that the doctrine \u201crests upon the ground that the party to be affected, or some other with whom he is in privity, has litigated, or had an opportunity to litigate the same matter in a former action in a court of competent jurisdiction, and should not be permitted to litigate it again to the harassment and vexation of his opponent. Public policy and the interest of litigants alike require that there be an end to litigation.\u201d <em>(Panos </em>v. <em>Great Western Packing Co. </em>(1943) 21 Cal.2d 636, 637 [134 P.2d 242]; see generally Note, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number><em>Developments in the Law\u2014Res Judicata </em>(1952) 65 Harv.L.Rev. 818.) As Witkin puts it, \u201cThe doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>gives certain <em>conclusive effect </em>to a <em>former judgment </em>in subsequent litigation involving the same controversy.\u201d (Original italics.) (4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Judgment, \u00a7 147, p. 3292.)</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\">Generally speaking, under the above doctrine a valid final judgment, if in favor of the plaintiff, merges the cause of action in the judgment. <em>(Edmonds </em>v. <em>Glenn-Colusa Irr. Dist. </em>(1933) 217 Cal. 436, 445-446 [19 P.2d 502]; <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1960) 182 Cal.App.2d 206, 210 [5 Cal.Rptr. 875]; <em>California Nat. Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Porter </em>(1927) 83 Cal.App. 758, 761-763 [257 P. 161]; 4 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>Judgment, \u00a7 189, p. 3329; Rest., Judgments (1942) \u00a7 47),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, if in favor of the defendant, constitutes a bar to any further suit on the same cause of action <em>(Panos </em>v. <em>Great Western Packing Co., supra, </em>21 Cal.2d 636, 639; 4 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>Judgment, \u00a7 192, p. 3332; Rest, Judgments, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 48).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">We proceed to analyze the effect of res judicata as a merger in the context of situations where the plaintiff has one of two mutually exclusive remedies for the enforcement of a single cause of action. We begin with section 64 of the Restatement of Judgments which states: \u201cWhere the plaintiff obtains judgment for the payment of money against the defendant in an action to enforce one of two or more alternative remedies, he cannot thereafter maintain an action to enforce another of the remedies.\u201d (See <em>Slater </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>(1943) 58 Cal.App.2d 864, 869 [137 P.2d 713]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Temple </em>(7th Cir. 1962) 299 F.2d 30, 32.) This rule implements the general principles of res judicata and prevents multiple recoveries by a plaintiff. In contradistinction to the doctrine of election of remedies, it gives conclusive effect to the <em>judgment </em>in plaintiff\u2019s favor, and does not consider plaintiff\u2019s conduct in choosing a remedy (Rest., Judgments, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 64, com. a; \u00a7 65, com. f).  More specifically, when a plaintiff has two mutually exclusive remedies, and judgment is rendered in his favor giving him one of the remedies, he cannot thereafter maintain an action for the other. For example, if a plaintiff is entitled to damages for personal injuries either under a federal statute, if the injury arose out of employment in <em>interstate </em>commerce, or under a state statute, if it arose out of employment in <em>intrastate </em>commerce, a judgment for the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>under the federal statute would preclude a later action under the state statute and vice versa. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 64, com. g.)</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">We point out, however, that this rule is not applicable where judgment is rendered for the <em>defendant </em>because the plaintiff has sought a remedy not available to him. In such cases, the plaintiff is not necessarily precluded from bringing another proceeding to obtain a recovery which is available.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For example, \u201c[wjhere the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for personal injuries or for causing death in an action based upon a federal statute if, but only if, it arose out of an employment in interstate commerce, and he is entitled to recover such damages in an action based upon a State statute if, but only if, it arose out of an employment in intrastate commerce, and the plaintiff brought an action based upon the State statute, and judgment was given for the defendant on the ground that the employment was in interstate commerce, the plaintiff is not precluded from thereafter maintaining an action for the same injury based upon the federal statute. Conversely, a judgment for the defendant in an action based upon the federal statute on the ground that the employment was in intrastate commerce does not preclude the plaintiff from maintaining an action based upon the State statute.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Rest., Judgments, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 65, com. k; cf. <em>Kipbea Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Strauss </em>(E.D.N.Y. 1963) 218 F.Supp. 696, 699.) The rationale supporting the rule precluding a successful plaintiff\u2019s second action obviously does not apply when the first judgment is for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">We now consider Allstate\u2019s contention that the do'ctrine of res judicata precludes petitioner from recovering in the instant proceeding before the' Board.  Only a final judgment on the merits between the same parties or their privies and upon the same cause of action is entitled to the res judicata effect of bar or merger, <em>(Olwell </em>v. <em>Hopkins </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 147, 152 [168 P.2d 972].)</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">The finality of the judgment in which petitioner\u2019s cause of action has allegedly merged and its status as an adjudication on the merits are indisputable. The superior court judgment became final on June 15, 1970, when the time to appeal elapsed. Petitioner and Rasbidoski were awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>money damages for defendant Albright\u2019s tortious behavior; the judgment determined the merits of all the issues in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\">The requirement that the same parties or their privies be involved in both actions, which assures that every party has one day, but no party two days, in court, also is satisfied herein. In the instant proceedings before the Board, as in those brought in the superior court, petitioner seeks recovery from the estate of her former employer, A. Chase Albright. The fact that under Board procedure the compensation insurance carrier for the employer is also a named defendant has no effect on the executrix\u2019s role as a defendant in both proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">It is also clear that the Board proceeding is brought on the same cause of action as that brought in the superior court. Although several different concepts have been advanced (see generally Note, <em>Developments in the Law </em>\u2014 <em>Res Judicata, supra, </em>65 Harv.L.Rev. at pp. 824-831), we have defined a cause of action as \u201cthe obligation sought to be enforced\u201d <em>(Panos </em>v. <em>Great Western Packing Co., supra, </em>21 Cal.2d at p. 638) and we have indicated that there is but one cause of action for one personal injury by reason of one wrongful act. <em>(Panos </em>v. <em>Great Western Packing Co., supra, </em>21 Cal.2d at p. 638; 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Pleading, \u00a734, p. 1717.) In the instant case, petitioner seeks redress for injuries suffered from, one tortious act, the shooting incident. (See Rest., Judgments, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 63, com. b.) Violation of one primary right in the instant case constitutes a single cause of action even though two mutually exclusive remedies are available. <em>(Wulfjen </em>v. <em>Dolton </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 891, 895-896 [151 P.2d 846]; <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>182 Cal.App.2d at p . 211.)</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">There is no doubt that petitioner\u2019s cause of action is extinguished and \u201cthe prior judgment is <em>res judicata </em>on matters which were raised or could have been raised, on matters litigated or litigable.\u201d (Original italics.) <em>(Sutphin </em>v. <em>Speik </em>(1940) 15 Cal.2d 195, 202 [99 P.2d 652, 101 P.2d 497]; Rest, Judgments, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 47, 48.) Therefore, it is irrelevant whether or not the issue of the injury arising out of and in the course of employment was specifically resolved by the .superior court. Even if we assume that the injury were employment-related and the superior court\u2019s judgment incorrect on that issue, \u201c[a]n erroneous judgment is as conclusive as a correct one.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (See <em>Panos </em>v. <em>Great Western Packing Co., supra, </em>21 Cal.2d at p. 640; Rest., Judgments, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 47, com. b.)</p>\n<p id=\"b964-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that in the light of the foregoing principles the superior court judgment satisfies the criteria for the application of the doctrine of res judicata. Because petitioner was faced with two mutually exclusive remedies and received a money judgment by pursuing one of them, her claim merged in that judgment and she cannot seek the alternative remedy. Her situation in the instant case falls within the reach of Restatement of Judgments, section 64, which in our view sets forth the correct rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Petitioner challenges the application of these principles on the ground that the superior court judgment is void for lack of jurisdiction. She argues that since she filed her claim with the Board before she brought her civil action for damages the superior court should have stayed the action on its own motion pending determination by the Board of the jurisdictional question whether the injury was employment-related.  We recognize that the two tribunals in which petitioner sought relief have concurrent jurisdiction only to determine jurisdiction. In such a case, \u201c[T]he tribunal first assuming jurisdiction retains it to the exclusion of all other tribunals in which the action might have been initiated.\u201d <em>(Scott </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 76, 81 [293 P.2d 18]; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 513, 521 [89 Cal.Rptr. 651].) Once that decision has been made, jurisdiction becomes exclusive, and the final determination' as to jurisdiction is res judicata before the other tribunal between the same parties and those privy to them. <em>(Scott </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at p. 83; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.3d at p. 521.)</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">A party may obtain an order preventing the second tribunal from acting pending determination by the first tribunal of the jurisdictional question.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But the court need not on its own motion await the first tribunal\u2019s action. In <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 148 [301 P.2d 866], which petitioner suggests as authority for her position, we issued a writ of prohibition requiring the superior court to grant such a stay where the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>were similar to those in the instant case. In <em>Taylor, </em>however, the plaintiff took affirmative action to obtain the writ prohibiting further superior court proceedings.  Here neither party made any objection to bringing the superior court action to trial, and petitioner prosecuted that action to final judgment fully aware that the Board action had been commenced some seven months bef\u00f3te the complaint was filed in the superior court. As Witkin makes clear, \u201cIn such event the priority of jurisdiction loses its significance; <em>the first final judgment </em>becomes conclusive, even though it is rendered in the action which was filed later in time. \u2018Where two actions involving the same issue are pending at the same time, it is not the final judgment in the first suit, but <em>the first final judgment, </em>although it may be rendered in the second suit, that renders the issue <em>res judicata </em>in the other court. . . .\u2019 <em>(Domestic &amp; Foreign Pet. Co. </em>v. <em>Long </em>(1935) 4 C.2d 547, 562 . . . .)\u201d (Original italics.) (4 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>Judgment, \u00a7 166, p. 3309.)</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\">Petitioner contends that Allstate has waived the defense of res judicata. Since res judicata is not a jurisdictional.defense, it may be waived if not timely raised. <em>(Domestic &amp; Foreign Pet. Co., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Long </em>(1935) 4 Cal.2d 547, 562 [51 P.2d 73]; 4 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>Judgment, \u00a7 148, p. 3293.) However, the facts of the instant case do not support petitioner\u2019s contention. The defense was raised by Allstate before the Court of Appeal when it first became available. It could not have been raised earlier because the superior court judgment did not become final until June 15, 1970, which was after the Board had issued, on May 6, 1970, its opinion and decision after reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">My esteemed colleague in dissent speculates that petitioner\u2019s civil action for damages might have been one brought against Mr. Albright as her <em>co-employee, </em>who was a working member of a partnership. (Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3359, 3601.) As previously mentioned (see fn. 2, <em>ante) </em>there is no evidence in the record indicating that Albright Express was a partnership. Nor was the contention now advanced by the dissenting opinion ever urged by petitioner in this court, or the Court of Appeal, or before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">To recapitulate, petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of the Board to determine jurisdiction by filing her application for adjudication of claim in that proceeding prior to filing her complaint in her civil action in the superior court. But by prosecuting the superior court action to final judgment before the Board action was final, she allowed her cause of action to merge in that judgment. Whether or not the judgment of the superior court is based upon an erroneous conclusion on the question of \u201ccourse of employment\u201d is irrelevant. <em>(Panos </em>v. <em>Great Western Packing Co., supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>21 Cal.2d 636, 640.) That judgment clearly satisfies all criteria for the application of the doctrine of res judicata. Petitioner\u2019s cause of action merged therein and she is thereby precluded from seeking an additional remedy before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">\n<em>The Allstate Petition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">Allstate admits its coverage of Albright Express, but contends that Employers Mutual Liability Insurance Company of Wisconsin (hereafter Employers Mutual) was also Albright\u2019s compensation carrier on the date of the shooting, August 23, 1968, and should be jointly responsible for any recovery. Allstate urges that no effect should be given to the retroactive cancellation of the Employers Mutual policy issued to' Albright. In light of our decision denying petitioner recovery in L.A. 29862, the question of coverage pertains only to the medical-legal costs awarded by the referee and affirmed by the Board.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">The Employers Mutual policy covering Albright Express was valid for the period from June 11, 1968, to June 11, 1969. However, Allstate issued a policy to Albright covering the same risks effective August 15, 1968, and, according to Mrs, Albright, Allstate\u2019s agent told her he would cancel the Employers Mutual policy. The Allstate agent never gave written notice of cancellation to Employers Mutual as the policy required. Soon thereafter, Employers Mutual learned of the new policy from the California Inspection Rating Bureau. On September 10, 1968, Employers Mutual cancelled its policy effective August 15, 1968, in accordance with the practice of cancellation by replacement. According to the testimony of experts, this practice is based on the first carrier\u2019s belief that it would be unsuccessful in collecting premiums for any period of dual coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">As heretofore noted, the referee awarded petitioner Busick medical-legal expenses, \u201c[t]he amounts ... tot be adjusted between Busick and Allstate Insurance Company, failing which to' be adjudicated herein upon petition and supporting documents.\u201d In his order dated October 3, 1969, the referee concluded, \u201cIt is found that the liability [for medical-legal costs] attaches to Allstate Insurance Company.\u201d Only petitioner Busick sought reconsideration of the referee\u2019s order. In its opinion and decision after reconsideration issued May 6, 1970, the Board expressly found Allstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>to be Albright Express\u2019s insurance carrier on the date of the incident, affirmed the award of medical-legal costs, and ordered the dismissal of Employers Mutual.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">On May 25, 1970, within 20 days of the decision after reconsideration by the Board, Allstate petitioned for reconsideration of that decision, urging that the Board erred in not finding Employers Mutual jointly liable as compensation carrier. On June 11, 1970, the Board, sitting en banc, issued its opinion and order denying reconsideration. The Board observed that the petition was not timely filed because Allstate had not sought reconsideration of the referee\u2019s award of October 3, 1969, which granted medical-legal costs against Allstate. In said opinion and order denying reconsideration, the Board agreed with the referee\u2019s implied finding that, on the merits, Employers Mutual was not liable, having cancelled its policy effective August 15, 1968, several days before the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Allstate contends that its petition for reconsideration filed with the Board on May 25, 1970, was timely. The Board disagreed, indicating that Allstate should have sought reconsideration of the referee\u2019s award of medical-legal costs. Allstate claims such action was unnecessary because the referee did not specifically determine the issue of coverage, whereas the Board in its decision after reconsideration issued May 6, 1970, did expressly dismiss Employers Mutual as a party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">We agree with the Board\u2019s and Employers Mutual\u2019s analysis that Allstate did not timely seek reconsideration. Although the referee\u2019s award did not specifically dismiss Employers Mutual, that award implied Allstate\u2019s sole responsibility at least for the medical-legal costs. The issue of coverage was before the referee, and \u201cAny issue not . . . determined will be deemed decided adversely as to the party in whose interest such issue was raised.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5815.) Furthermore, the referee specifically awarded the medical-legal costs against Allstate, putting Allstate on notice that it should have challenged that aspect of the award at once. We need not decide whether such a failure to seek timely reconsideration of the referee\u2019s award would have precluded Allstate\u2019s challenge to the broader issue of its sole responsibility for a general award, as. that issue is now moot. Nor need we decide, on the merits, whether Employers Mutual remained Albright\u2019s insurer on the date of the incident even though it thereafter issued a post-dated cancellation of its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">We, therefore, reach these final conclusions. Since petitioner\u2019s cause of action arising out of the shooting incident merged in the judgment entered in her favor in the superior court, such final judgment upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>principles of res judicata precludes any recovery in the instant proceedings before the Board. Under the circumstances it is unnecessary for us to determine the question whether petitioner\u2019s injury was one arising out of and. in the course of her employment by Albright Express. Although the Board denied recovery for another reason, namely that the petitioner\u2019s injury did not arise out of her employment, the result it reached was a correct one and must be affirmed. As to Allstate, the order determining it to be solely responsible for petitioner\u2019s medical-legal costs became final because of Allstate\u2019s failure to file a timely petition for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">In L.A. 29862, the decision of the Board following reconsideration is affirmed.

The majority do not deal with this question but hold that Mrs. Busick\u2019s claim foi* workmen\u2019s compensation benefits has merged in her judgment for damages for personal injuries. The question of merger could not have been and was not determined by the board, and I believe that this court on the record before us cannot properly determine whether or not there has been a merger. To determine the question as the majority have done deprives Mrs. Busick of any opportunity to prove facts which might show that no merger has occurred. Because the majority decision is based on the merger doctrine I will treat that issue first.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">The majority rely upon section 64 of the Restatement of Judgments which states: \u201cWhere the plaintiff obtains judgment for the payment of money against the defendant in an action to enforce <em>one of two or more alternative remedies, </em>he cannot thereafter maintain an action to enforce another of the remedies.\u201d (Italics added.) Comment f of that section, which is not discussed by the majority, sets forth the obvious limitation on the rule: \u201cThe rule stated in this Section is not applicable where the plaintiff is entitled to two or more remedies which are <em>cumulative </em>and <em>not alternative. </em>This is the situation where the plaintiff is entitled to two kinds of relief, and the relief sought in one action could not be obtained in the other action.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">Damages for assault and battery and workmen\u2019s compensation benefits cannot be obtained in the same forum in California, and the crucial ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>tion presented is whether those remedies are cumulative or alternative in the circumstances of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\">The subject is specifically dealt with by section 3601 of the Labor Code, which makes the remedies mutually exclusive in some situations but cumulative in others. The section provided in part at the times relevant here that where \u201cthe conditions of compensation exist,\u201d the compensation remedy is exclusive against the employer or any other employee of the employer \u201cexcept that an employee . . . shall, in addition to the right to compensation against the employer, have a right to bring an action at law for damages against such other employee, as if this division did not apply, in the following cases: [1[] (1) When the injury or death is proximately caused by the willful and unprovoked physical act of aggression of such other employee. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Section 3359 of the Labor Code, which, like section 3601, is found in division 4 of the code, provides that a \u201cworking member of a partnership receiving wages irrespective of profits from such partnership is an employee under this division.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">It is- clear from the foregoing statutory provisions that Mrs. Busick, who was shot by Mr. Albright, has cumulative rather than alternative remedies and is not barred by the merger doctrine if Albright was a working member of a partnership receiving wages irrespective of profits. In other words, she would be entitled to both compensation benefits from the board and damages, and there could be no merger. On the other hand, if Albright was the sole proprietor of Albright Express Company, her remedies would be alternative, and, as the majority conclude, her claims would merge in the superior court judgment. The crucial question presented in determining the merger question thus is whether Albright was a working member of a partnership receiving wages irrespective of profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">It must be recognized that the partnership question was not presented to the board and was not material at the time the board rendered its decision on rehearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that time the question presented was whether Mrs. Busick\u2019s injury arose out of and occurred in the course of employment. If this question had been answered in the affirmative, as it should have been, she would have been entitled to benefits, and it would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>immaterial whether or not Albright Express Company was a partnership. If the question had been answered in the negative, as the board erroneously answered it, she was not entitled to benefits, and again it would have been immaterial whether or not Albright Express. Company was a partnership. Accordingly, it must be concluded that the partnership issue was not material and could not have been material in the case presented to the board.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">The partnership question only became material to these proceedings after the superior court judgment became final, and it did not become final until after these proceedings were pending on review. Since the partnership issue depends on factual determinations and since such determinations were not material to the proceedings before the board, it seems improper to me for the majority to proceed to make those determinations, as they have done, on the record before us. It seems to me that the proper procedure is to return the case to the board to permit it to take evidence to determine whether there has been a merger or whether Albright was a working member of a partnership receiving wages irrespective of profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">There are a number of evidentiary matters which might bear on the issue of partnership which are nof shown by the record before us because there was no reason to place them in evidence either before the board or the superior court. For example, documentary evidence such as the certificate of the Public Utilities Commission or the fictitious name statement of Albright Express Company might indicate that the firm, was a partnership. Likewise, it would now be relevant whether Mrs. Albright is continuing the business after her husband\u2019s death as. executrix of his estate or as surviving partner. But the point need not be belabored; it is clear to me that Mrs. Busick is entitled to a day in court where she can produce evidence on the partnership issue. The majority deny her that day in court. Contrary to the suggestion in the majority opinion (see p. 975), the problem is not whether Mrs. Busick will get two days in court; she will get two days in court only if she is entitled to them under section 3601 of the Labor Code; in any event she is entitled to one day in court to determine the partnership question; and the majority have denied her any days in court on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">The denial of the right to present evidence on the partnership issue is especially unfair in that it is the majority and not Allstate which have pleaded, attempted to prove, made findings for the board, and then decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>that the case is barred by the merger doctrine. Although Allstate has urged that the claim for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits is <em>barred </em>by res judicata, it has never relied on the merger doctrine or cited section 64 of the Restatement of Judgments. It has failed to do so even after we permitted further briefs on the res judicata issue at oral argument. The board made no findings as to sole proprietorship or partnership. If the majority are going to plead and prove defenses for Allstate and make findings for the board, the majority should at least give Mrs. Busick the opportunity to show that those defenses are factually inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\">Moreover, if we were to decide the partnership issue on the record before us, I believe that we have to conclude that Mrs. Busick should prevail. There is no finding by the board or by the superior court that Albright Express Company was a sole proprietorship. Mrs. Albright testified that she did not know whether the operation should be called a partnership. The Allstate policy was issued to \u201cA. Chase Albright and Wilhelmina Albright and/or Albright Express.\u201d It is clear that the business was operated by both of the Albrights. The majority state that \u201cMr. Albright operated the business and Mrs. Albright assisted\u201d (p. 970, fn. 2), but the record nowhere shows that Mr. Albright owned the business as a sole proprietorship or that Mrs. Albright did not claim an ownership interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Most important in this connection, however, is that, as shall be demonstrated later in this opinion, the injury arose out of and occurred in the course of the employment, and that in order to hold that the superior court judgment was not erroneous, this court should conclude that the action was proper under section 3601 on the basis of the working partner exception. In light of the fact that the injury arose out of and occurred in the course of employment, the majority\u2019s determination that a merger occurred is in effect a determination that the superior court did not have subject matter jurisdiction and that the superior court judgment was erroneous. The majority should not presume that the superior court judgment was erroneous but unless error is shown should presume it was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">For the foregoing reasons, it is my view that the record before us does not establish that a merger has occurred and that it is improper to dispose of the case on that basis. I thus turn to the contentions of the parties which the majority have not found it necessary to reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>The res judicata argument made by Allstate is that by awarding damages the superior court <em>impliedly </em>determined that the injury did not arise out of and occur in the course of employment. However, if this court is to imply findings, it should imply findings, if possible, which would make the judgment correct, not erroneous, in the light of the evidence before us, and this can be done in view of the clear evidence of employment relation only by implying findings that the co-employee exception in section 3601 of the Labor Code is applicable. Accordingly, this court should not imply the finding requested by Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">The remaining question is whether the injury arose out of and in the course of employment by Albright Express Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">The board found that the injury was not sustained in the course of employment \u201cbecause it occurred long after the employment relationship was terminated.\u201d The board stated that Mrs. Busick resigned on August 9. Conceding that obtaining compensation for one\u2019s services is generally part of the employment relationship, the board implied that it might deem the employment relationship to have existed until August 16, the date on which Albright employees would usually be paid for services performed during the week ending August 9. The board reasoned that Mrs. Busick became a creditor, rather than an employee, after August 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">The facts found by the board are a slim foundation for such conclusions. Although Mrs. Busick offered to resign on August 9, she was told to take her vacation (which she originally had intended to take the month before) to consider the matter. She acceded to this request, taking her vacation pay with her. She decided to try to start her own business during this vacation, but stated that she might well have returned to work had the new venture not panned out. Certainly it was not clear to her employer on August 9 that she had quit; he assumed she might be on vacation. Nor did the board find that vacationing employees usually interrupted their vacations in order to pick up their checks on the following Friday. The purpose of taking an extra vacation check, one would assume, is to tide one over until he does get back to town and/or the workplace. In any event, while Mrs. Busick was no doubt entitled to appear on the 16th and demand her paycheck, there was no understanding that she was to be paid on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">Whether she effectively quit her job on August 9 or should have been paid on August 16, however, is immaterial in the instant case. Obtaining compensation for one\u2019s services, even after those services have terminated, is a necessary and integral part of the employment relationship. <em>(Pacific Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com., </em>26 Cal.2d 509 [159 P.2d 625]; <em>Argonaut </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number><em>Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>221 Cal.App.2d 140 [34 Cal.Rptr. 206].) The delay of a week in payment does not destroy that relationship. Mrs. Busick, instructed by her employer that checks could be picked up only by appearing personally at the business premises, was clearly within the <em>course of her employment </em>at the time of the shooting.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The contrary determination of the board should be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\">The board also found that the injury did not <em>arise out of the employment </em>\u201cbecause it was a wilful act which was not traceable to an incident of the employment but was triggered by the tensions of trade warfare between business competitors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">An injury caused by a wilful (intentional) act arising out of and in the course of employment is, of course, compensable. (See, e.g., <em>California Comp. &amp; Fire Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., </em>68 Cal.2d 157 [65 Cal.Rptr. 155, 436 P.2d 67]; <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com., </em>38 Cal.2d 659 [242 P.2d 311]; <em>Western Greyhound Lines </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>225 Cal.App.2d 517 [37 Cal.Rptr. 580].) The fact that the tortfeasor is the employer in no way bars compensation. <em>(Azevedo </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>243 Cal.App.2d 370 [52 Cal.Rptr. 283]; <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>142 Cal.App.2d 350 [298 P.2d 598].) The sole question here, therefore, is whether the shooting \u201carose out of\u201d the employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">In <em>Madin </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>46 Cal.2d 90, 94-95 [292 P.2d 892], we construed the meaning of the phrase \u201carising out of\u201d the employment. There the employees, employed as 24-hour-a-day caretakers and managers, were injured when a bulldozer accidentally hit their house. The bulldozer was not under the control of the employer, nor was it used on the employer\u2019s property. Because the risk of injury to the employees was increased by having to remain in proximity to the uncontrolled bulldozer as a condition of employment, we held that the injury arose out of the employment. In doing so we set forth the following rule of construction: <em>\u201cWhere the injury occurs on the employer\u2019s premises, while the employee is in the course of the employment, the injury arises out of the employment unless the connection is so remote from the employment that it is not an incident of it.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>In <em>California Comp. &amp; Fire Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 157, 160-161, we followed the <em>Madin </em>rule and allowed recovery where a saleswoman who entered private homes as a condition of employment, was killed by her ex-husband, who had rented an apartment specifically for the purpose of luring her there in the course of her employment and killing her. (See also <em>Wiseman </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>46 Cal.2d 570 [297 P.2d 649]; <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Indus. Acc. Com., </em>194 Cal. 28 [227 P. 168]; <em>Western Greyhound Lines </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>225 Cal.App. 2d 517.)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">The instant case fits squarely within the <em>Madin </em>rule. Mrs. Busick was injured on the employer\u2019s premises while in the course of her employment. The causal connection between the assault and her employment was not remote. Albright shot her because she had left to form, a competing business and had taken important accounts with, her when, she left. The risk of such injury was manifestly a direct result of her employment. As stated in <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Wm. C. Crowell Co., </em>28 Cal.2d 652, 656 [171 P.2d 5], \u201c \u2018In bringing men together, work . . . causes, frictions between them [and] creates occasions for . . . emotional flare-up. . . . These expressions of human nature are incidents inseparable from working together. They involve risks of injury and these risks are inherent in the working environment.\u2019 \u201d If anything, the connection here is far more apparent than in the <em>Madin </em>or <em>California Comp, </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">In <em>Azevedo </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>243 Cal.App.2d 370, 377, a test more stringent than that in <em>Madin </em>is enunciated, relying on <em>Globe Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>2 Cal.2d 8, 12 [37 P.2d 1039], to the effect that compensation will be denied where the injury is \u201cthe result of personal grievances unconnected in any way with the employment.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">The <em>Globe Indemnity </em>test has been severely undermined, if not impliedly overruled, by subsequent cases. (See <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com., supra, </em>38 Cal.2d 659, 671, disapproving <em>Globe Indemnity </em>in part.) In <em>California Comp. &amp; Fire Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 157, the ex-husband\u2019s murder of his ex-wife was the result of a personal grievance unconnected with the employment. The <em>injury, </em>on the other hand, was held, to be connected with the employment relationship, and therefore compensable. In <em>Western Greyhound Lines </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>225 Cal.App.2d 517, cited with approval in <em>California Comp. &amp; Fire Co., </em>a female bus driver was assaulted during a paid layover when she refused to converse with a restaurant patron. Although the <em>grievance </em>was clearly unrelated to her employment, the injury was held to be related, since the driver\u2019s employment increased the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>risk of this type of incident. <em>Globe Indemnity </em>should be disapproved insofar as it states that the grievance must be work related.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">Even were the <em>Globe Indemnity </em>test given full application, however, Mrs. Busick\u2019s claim would not be barred. Her employer\u2019s grievance\u2014starting a competing business, stealing accounts\u2014was so obviously connected to the employment relationship that the matter bears no further discussion. \u201cEven if, arguendo, the issue [were] debatable, we are bound by the fundamental principle that to effectuate the purposes of the compensation statute, all reasonable doubts as to whether an injury is compensable are to be resolved in favor of the employee.\u201d <em>(California Comp. &amp; Fire Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 157, 161.)</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">I am satisfied that for purposes of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law the injury was one \u201carising out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">I would annul the order of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board in L.A. No. 29862. I agree with the majority that Allstate did not timely seek reconsideration and would affirm the order denying reconsideration in L.A. No. 29863.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">Tobriner, J., and Mosk, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">The application of petitioner Busick for a rehearing was denied November 1, 1972. Peters, J., Tobriner, J., and Mosk, J., were of the opinion that the application should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-8\"> In the proceedings before the administrative agency a different partnership question was litigated. Petitioner claimed that J.R.L. Trucking Company was a partnership and that as a working member of the partnership receiving wages irrespective of profits she was entitled to workmen\u2019s compensation benefits from J.R.L.\u2019s compensation insurer. After receiving substantial evidence as to whether J.R.L. was a partnership or a sole proprietorship owned by petitioner, it was concluded that J.R.L. was not a partnership, and the issue is not now before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b970-7\">It is true that the partnership question could have been litigated in the superior court. However, the defendant did not raise the question of exclusive jurisdiction in the board, and thus there was no reason to raise the subsidiary question of partnership. The record of the superior court reflects no evidence on the partnership issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b971-7\">The majority also point out that it is I who have raised the partnership question and that petitioner has not raised the issue. Since the majority is practicing law by pleading the merger doctrine which has never been urged by respondent, T feel it is appropriate to point out that the doctrine might not be appli v YY: '* *ve'v. given her day in court on the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b973-7\">The board\u2019s reliance on <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co., </em>85 Cal.App.2d 811 [193 P.2d 956], is misplaced. In that case husband and wife both worked for the same company. Company had a policy of allowing all wives, not only those who were employees, to pick up their husbands\u2019 paychecks. Wife was injured when she appeared during her off hours, asked for husband\u2019s paycheck, and fell while accompanying the payor to another office to get the check. Recovery was properly denied because she was injured in her role as <em>wife, </em>rather than her role as employee. In the instant case petitioner went to the Albrights\u2019 solely for the purpose of picking up her check.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
