The respondent court\u2019s judgment restrained petitioner City of Inglewood-Los Angeles County Civic Center Authority (Authority) from executing or performing a contract awarded to Swinerton &amp; Walberg Co. (Swinerton) relating to the construction of a civic center project. The mandate proceeding in respondent court was instituted by real party in interest, Argo Construction Co., Inc. (Argo), to have the contract award annulled and set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Section 25454 of the Government Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides that a contract for a \u201cconstruction project\u201d exceeding $6,500 must be awarded to the \u201clowest responsible bidder.\u201d Argo was the lowest bidder and it claims that the contract was improperly issued to Swinerton. The primary issues involved in this proceeding are (1) whether the section is applicable to the type of contract awarded here; (2) whether, if so, the Authority applied the appropriate standard in determining that Swinerton was the lowest responsible bidder, and (3) whether a contractor who has submitted the lowest monetary bid is entitled to a full judicial hearing to determine if he is responsible. The trial court found in Argo\u2019s favor, and it issued a writ of mandate ordering petitioners to refrain from executing or performing the contract awarded to Swinerton unless a hearing is held \u201cof the type described in the Administrative Procedure Act\u201d to evaluate Argo\u2019s responsibility and a contract awarded in accordance with the result of such hearing or, in the alternative, to refrain from paying out any funds for the construction work until the project is again opened for competitive bidding.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Petitioner Authority was constituted pursuant to' a \u201cjoint exercise of powers agreement\u201d entered into in February 1970 by the City of Inglewood and the County of Los Angeles, as authorized by section 6500. et seq. The Authority is a separate and distinct public entity (\u00a7 6507). It was established to construct the City of Inglewood-Los Angeles County Civic Center, which was planned to include both city and county buildings. The governing board of the Authority is the five-member Civic Center Authority Commission. As directed by section 6503, the joint agreement creating the Authority provides \u201cfor the method by which the purpose [of the Authority] will be accomplished or the manner in which [its] power will be exercised.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>Charles Luckman Associates (Luckman) was retained by the Authority as architects, and prepared preliminary plans for the civic center buildings, a $12,000,000 project. Luckman recommended that the Authority proceed with the construction of the project by means of a management contract. The operation of the management contracting method was summarized by Luckman as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-4\">\u201cUnder the traditional lump sum method of bidding, contractors enter the project process upon the completion of working drawings. At this point in time they have little opportunity or incentive to contribute to cost reduction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-5\">\u201cThe Management Contracting Method . . . differs from this traditional lump sum method in that the contractor is brought into the building project through competitive bidding at or shortly after, the completion of preliminary plans, rather than working drawings. He is then called upon to contribute his practical expertise during the development of the working drawings, and subsequently apply this expertise during construction, in order to achieve maximum economies. He is expected to provide cost estimates from time to time during development of working drawings to determine that the project is within budget so that some of the early phases of construction can proceed prior to completion of all of the drawings. This makes it possible to save a significant amount of time in the' total building process.\u201d The management contractor performs none of the construction itself unless he is awarded a separate contract therefor as the lowest responsible bidder in subsequent bidding under the traditional \u201clump sum\u201d bidding procedures. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>The management contracting procedure was approved by the Inglewood City Council, and Swinerton was awarded the contract after various proceedings which will be described in detail <em>infra,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Petitioners urge that the management contract here at issue was basically a contract for services as a consultant and supervisor-manager rather than a contract for a \u201cconstruction project\u201d and thus did not fall within the competitive bidding requirements upon which Argo relies. Those requirements are found in the Government Code and in the charter of the City of Inglewood<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as well as in the joint exercise of powers agreement. They provide that public construction of the magnitude here involved shall be accomplished by contract let to the lowest responsible bidder;</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">It is true that the management contractor was. to perform services and to lend his experience and expertise in the preparation of the final plans, and in that respect may be likened to an engineer or an architect whose services may be procured without strict compliance with competitive bidding requirements. (See <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Ross </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 569, 581-582 [170 P.2d 904]; <em>San Francisco </em>v. <em>Boyd </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 606, 620 [110 P.2d 1036]; <em>Cobb </em>v. <em>Pasadena City Bd. of Education </em>(1955) 134 Cal.App.2d 93, 95 [285 P.2d 41].) However, our review of the other duties and obligations which were required of the management contractor in this case, including his guarantee of the outside price based on the subcontract bids, persuades us that the management contracting procedure as proposed and followed here is too closely akin to traditional lump sum general construction contracting to be held exempt from the statutory competitive bidding requirements. To hold otherwise as a broad principle would open the door to possible favoritism, fraud or corruption in the letting of other public construction contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">The next issue is whether petitioners applied the proper standards in determining that Swinerton was the lowest responsible bidder, as that term is used in section 25454.  It bears emphasis that the word \u201cresponsible\u201d in the context of the statute is not necessarily employed in the sense of a bidder who is trustworthy so that a finding of nonresponsibility connotes untrustworthiness. Rather, while that term includes the attribute of trustworthiness, it also has reference to the quality, fitness and capacity of the low bidder to satisfactorily perform the proposed work. (See <em>West </em>v. <em>Oakland </em>(1916) 30 Cal.App. 556, 560 [159 P. 202].) Thus, a contract must be awarded to the lowest bidder unless it is found that he is not responsible, i.e., not qualified to do the particular work under consideration. Whether or not an express finding of nonresponsibility is required (see <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Fresno City Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1954) 123 Cal.App.2d 626, 629-630 [267 P.2d 69]), if a contract is awarded to one other than the lowest monetary bidder, the ineluctable implication is that the latter is not responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The parties are in agreement that factors such as those set forth above may be considered in determining whether a bidder is responsible. Argo challenges the award of the management contract to Swinerton not because petitioners employed such criteria but because petitioners made no determination, either express or implied, that Argo was not responsible. Instead, it is asserted, petitioners found Swinerton to be the relatively superior bidder and awarded the contract on this basis. Argo cogently argues; \u201cTo permit a local public works contracting agency to expressly or impliedly reject the bid of a qualified and responsible lowest monetary bidder in favor of a higher bidder deemed to be more qualified frustrates the very purpose of competitive bidding laws and violates the interest of the public in having public works projects awarded without favoritism, without excessive cost, and constructed at the lowest price consistent with the reasonable quality and expectation of completion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">We agree with these assertions, and we hold that the contract for a public construction project must be awarded to the lowest monetary bidder as commanded by section 25454 unless it is found that the lowest bidder is not responsible, in the sense defined above. There is no basis for the application of a relative superiority concept under that section, and if petitioners applied such standard in selecting Swinerton rather than Argo as the contractor the award cannot stand.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>The trial court found that petitioners chose to award the contract to Swinerton because they viewed Swinerton as more qualified than Argo and that the qualifications of Argo to perform the contract were never questioned. An examination of the procedure followed in malting the award lends credence to the trial court findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Petitioners proceeded as follows: The \u201cNotice Inviting Bids\u201d for the fee to be charged the Authority as management contractor stated, inter alia, that final evaluation and award would be made on the basis of the proposal submitted by the lowest responsible bidder, the contractor\u2019s financial resources, his surety and insurance experience, construction experience, completion ability, personnel, equipment, work load, and other factors pertinent to a project of the scope involved. Bidders were required to include eight informational items in their bids, the first six of which related to financial responsibility. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A uniform point system was applied to the financial responsibility information submitted. The highest score attainable was 38, but any contractor who scored 30 or more on this scale was to be considered \u201cqualified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Twelve bids were received. They were reviewed, analyzed, and evaluated by Luckman as an architect and by the staff of the director of public works of the city (reviewing panel). The bids of nine were rejected, and it was ultimately determined that Argo and Swinerton were among the three lowest bidders. Under the formula applied to determine the total bid cost Argo\u2019s bid was some $70,000 lower than that of Swinerton.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>Swinerton achieved 34 on the financial responsibility information questionnaire, while Argo obtained a score of 30, the minimum necessary for qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">Thereafter, each of the three lowest bidders was interviewed by the reviewing panel, and further information was sought with respect to its experience and capabilities. The three contractors were evaluated in terms of their construction experience, completion ability, personnel, work load, and client relationships. Again, a uniform, point system was applied, this time to reflect the performance capabilities of the three low bidders. Out of a maximum of 61 points, Swinerton rated highest with 55 points, while Argo scored second with 42 points.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The reviewing panel, in a report to the Authority which set forth the details of the procedure it had followed in its investigations including the results of the evaluation scores attained by Swinerton and Argo, recommended that Swinerton be awarded the contract as the lowest responsible bidder. The report did not state that Argo was unqualified to perform the job but pointed out that, based upon the evaluation scores and the interviews, the panel believed that by selecting Swinerton the city would obtain excellent construction talent, experience, and other qualities important to the successful completion of the project. The architect representative on the panel, in a separate report to the Authority, stated that while Argo was considered capable within its field of construction, Swinerton\u2019s qualifications were considered to be so superior as to justify its selection as the lowest responsible bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The recommendations of the reviewing panel were discussed by members of the Authority on December 17, 1970. At that meeting, the public works director, a member of the panel, explained the panel\u2019s choice of Swinerton. He emphasized, for example, that Argo was primarily a school contractor and the maximum height it had built was four stories, whereas Swinerton had experience with high rise structures (the city\u2019s project was deemed a high rise building). He offered other reasons as well for the panel\u2019s choice of Swinerton over Argo-. Representatives of Argo contended at the meeting that the contract could only be awarded to Swinerton if the Authority found Argo to be irresponsible, and that Argo was in fact qualified, to do the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>The Authority adopted a resolution awarding the contract to Swinerton. The resolution pointed out that both the architect and the public works department had submitted their reports and had recommended that the contract be awarded to Swinerton, and that their recommendations were based upon a bid evaluation procedure which. included such categories as construction experience, financial qualifications, and similar factors. The resolution concluded with the statement that the Authority finds that the lowest responsible bid was submitted by Swinerton, based upon, the report of the reviewing panel and the fact that Swinerton had obtained the highest scores on both the financial responsibility and performance capability questionnaires.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">It is evident from the procedure followed by the Authority that, as Argo charges and the trial court found, petitioner merely determined that Swinerton was superior to Argo in its ability to perform the contract, and that no determination was made whether in fact Argo, the lowest bidder, was also qualified to perform the contract. Since petitioners did. not comply with the mandate of section 25454 that the contract be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, the award must be set aside. <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>McKinnon </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 83, 87-88 [124 P.2d 34, 140 A.L.R. 570].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ANsk\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Finally, it is contended that the award to Swinerton must be set aside because Argo was not afforded a full evidentiary hearing as to whether it was a responsible bidder.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Due process requires, asserts Argo, that prior to awarding a contract to one who is not the low monetary bidder, the Authority must conduct a hearing, which shall include a full panoply of judicial trial procedures, including pleadings, cross-examination of witnesses, and formal findings. No case so holding is called to our attention, and <em>Housing Authority of Opelousas, La. </em>v. <em>Pittman Const. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number><em>Co. </em>(5th Cir. 1959) 264 F.2d 695, upon which Argo places great reliance, is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">In that case, Louisiana law provided that a public works contract must be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, but a higher bidder had received the award primarily on the basis of evidence received by the awarding authority from the higher bidder casting doubt upon, the low bidder\u2019s responsibility. The contractor submitting the low bid was not present at the meeting and was not afforded an opportunity to rebut the charges prior to the award. It was held that the low bidder was entitled to be informed of the charges made against him and to reply to those charges. However, opined the court, the awarding authority was not required to \u201cconduct FBI investigations, hold elaborate hearings, adhere to legal rules of evidence, and function as a judicial body.\u201d (264 F.2d at p. 704.)</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">We hold that prior to awarding a public works contract to other than the lowest bidder, a public body must notify the low monetary bidder of any evidence reflecting upon his responsibility received from others or adduced as a result of independent investigation, afford him. an opportunity to rebut such adverse evidence, and permit him to present evidence that he is qualified to perform the contract. We do not believe, however, that due process compels a quasi-judicial proceeding prior to rejection of the low monetary bidder as a nonresponsible bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the trial court to vacate its judgment and the peremptory writ of mandate issued thereon, and to make new findings and conclusions of law and enter a new judgment in accordance with the principles set forth herein.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Peters, J., Tobriner, J., and Sullivan, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b852-6\"> AU section references are to the Government Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b852-7\"> Section 4 of the joint agreement states in pertinent part that \u201cThe Authority shall have the powers common to City and County set forth in Section 1 of this Agreement, to wit: acquiring, constructing, maintaining . . . public buildings ....

While it is possible to interpret the use of the term \u201cbest\u201d as meaning that the standard to be applied is one of relative superiority, an examination of the holding of <em>West </em>as well as other cases which .quote its language (e.g., <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Fresno City Unified Sch. Dist., supra, </em>123 Cal.App.2d 626, 629) reveals that this is not the intention since these cases hold that the lowest bidder was properly rejected as not responsible either because (as in <em>West) </em>his product was not satisfactory or (as in <em>Raymond) </em>because he was found to have provided poor workmanship in another public project.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b856-11\">The eight informational items were: (1) financial statement; (2) letter of credit from bidder\u2019s bank showing credit available and bidder\u2019s borrowing experience over the past five years; (3) name of bidder\u2019s surety company and broker and number of times, if any, surety had to complete any of bidder\u2019s work during past five years; (4) names of other surety companies used in past five years; (5) names of insurance companies and their brokers; (6) statement of insurance losses incurred during past five years and of workmen\u2019s' accidental deaths during that period; (7) best estimate of cost of the work; (8) estimated progress schedule for completion of the work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b856-12\">Petitioners make the belated suggestion that Argo was not in fact the lowest monetary bidder because, according to its bid, 42 months would be required to complete the contract, while Swinerton estimated only 30 months. The argument is made that in view of escalating costs the shorter construction period would result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>in. substantia] savings. However, both at the trial court level and in the petition for writs of mandate and prohibition filed before the Court of Appeal, petitioners conceded that Argo was determined by the reviewing panel and found by the Authority to be the lowest monetary bidder, although not the lowest responsible bidder. In view of these concessions, petitioners may not now claim that Argo, because of its longer estimated completion time, was not the lowest monetary bidder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b858-7\">The parties argue at some length about the question whether the findings of a governing body that a contractor is not the lowest responsible bidder may only be attacked for fraud and collusion (see, e.g., <em>West </em>v. <em>Oakland, supra, </em>30 Cal.App. 556, 560-561) or whether it is sufficient to establish an abuse of discretion (see, e.g., <em>Diablo Beacon Printing &amp; Pub. Co. </em>v. <em>City of Concord </em>(1964) 229 Cal.App.2d 505, 508 [40 Cal.Rptr. 443]). We need not discuss this issue since we have concluded that no finding express or implied was made by petitioners that Argo was not a responsible bidder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b858-8\">Since we hold the award improper on other grounds it is not necessary to decide whether the lowest monetary bidder is entitled to a hearing before the contract is awarded to another.

The judgment expressly provided that it should not be construed to prevent the Authority from acting as owner-builder and from letting all necessary construction contracts in connection with the project. We have been informed by the parties that such construction contracts have been awarded, and that the actual work of construction is under way. Petitioners obtained a stay from the Court of Appeal which had the effect of permitting the Authority to enter into a new and separate contract with Swinerton for consulting and supervising services in connection with the project, without prejudice to the validity of any such new contract. However, we have not been advised whether the Authority has availed itself of Swinerton\u2019s services, nor have we been informed whether the services of a management contractor are still required in view of the progress of the construction work.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b860-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>BURKE, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALJ\">I dissent. If this case had involved an ordinary muncipal construction contract, I would concur without reservation in the view that a \u201crelative superiority\u201d test is inappropriate to determine the \u201clowest responsible bidder,\u201d as that phrase is used in applicable charter or statutory provisions. It seems evident to me, however, that the management contract here at issue was more in the nature of a contract for services as a consultant and supervisor-manager, and that in the award of such contracts the governing board may properly consider a number of factors in addition to the amount bid in discharging its responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">In the instant case, the services to be rendered by the management contractor may be likened to those provided by the Authority\u2019s architectural firm, and indeed those services were proposed by the architect to complement its own services in preparing final plans and specifications and in supervising the work of construction, in an attempt to provide the city and the Authority with the most efficient and desirable construction at the lowest cost. The management contractor was to perform no actual work of construction nor furnish any materials, labor, supplies or equipment for the project. All of such work and materials were to be let. out to bid to the lowest responsible bidders in subsequent bidding under the traditional bidding procedure applicable to ordinary lump sum contracts. At the time when Swinerton was chosen as the management contractor, only the preliminary plans for the project had been prepared; bids for the actual work of construction were to await completed final plans and specifications, which the management contractor would assist in preparing.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">As the majority acknowledge, strict compliance with competitive bidding requirements need not be maintained in procuring an expert\u2019s services to prepare plans and specifications. <em>(Kennedy </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>28 Cal.2d 569, 581 [170 P.2d 904] [engineer retained to prepare plans for sewage treatment and disposal plant].) As noted in <em>San Francisco </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>17 Cal. 2d 606, 620 [110 P.2d 1036], \u201cThe employment of a person who is highly and technically skilled in his science or profession is one which may properly be made without competitive bidding.\u201d In <em>San Francisco, </em>the approved employment was of a civil engineeer to aid in the solution of traffic and transit problems. (See also <em>Cobb </em>v. <em>Pasadena City Bd. of Education, </em>134 Cal.App.2d 93, 95 [285 P.2d 41].)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">I do agree, however, that the management contract in the instant case contains certain provisions, such as the \u201cguaranteed outside price\u201d clause, which justified the Authority\u2019s action in requiring that contract to be competitively bid. Yet as the management contract is more in the nature of a contract for expert services than an ordinary lump sum construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>contract, I would construe the applicable competitive bidding provisions liberally to provide the Authority the broadest discretion consistent with protecting the taxpayers from fraud, favoritism or collusion. The bid evaluation system used by the Authority in the instant case, permitting it to consider the respective quality, fitness and capacity of bidders in accordance with preselected and announced, objective standards and criteria, satisfactorily met the competitive bid requirements in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">The majority opinion accurately describes the elaborate rating and evaluation system used by the Authority to determine which bidder would be chosen as the \u201clowest responsible bidder.\u201d I would emphasize that every bidder was given advance notice of the bid evaluation system; bidders were told that an award would be made on the basis of the bidder\u2019s financial resources, surety and insurance experience, construction experience,' completion ability, personnel, equipment and work load, as well as the amount of the bid. On the basis of the information received from, the bidders, bids were evaluated or rated in accordance with a uniform point system reflecting the performance capabilities of each bidder. In short, the evaluation system employed in the instant case seems well suited to achieve an accurate assessment of the bidder\u2019s qualifications while minimizing the risks of favoritism or collusion. It is significant that at no time prior to the bid opening did Argo or any of the bidders object to the method of evaluating or awarding bids or to- the method of bid solicitation. And nothing in the record suggests that the Authority may have acted with an improper motive in awarding the contract to Swinerton.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">As the majority concede, the term \u201clowest responsible bidder\u201d is broad enough to include the attributes of quality, fitness and capacity to perform. (See <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Fresno City Unified Sch. Dist., </em>123 Cal.App.2d 626, 629 [267 P.2d 69]; <em>Swanson </em>v. <em>Hilderbrand, </em>94 Cal.App.2d 161, 164 [210 P.2d 95]; <em>Cyr </em>v. <em>White, </em>83 Cal.App.2d 22, 27-29 [187 P.2d 834]; <em>Hodgeman </em>v. <em>City of San Diego, </em>53 Cal.App.2d 610, 615-616 [128 P.2d 412]; <em>West </em>v. <em>Oakland, </em>30 Cal.App. 556, 560-561 [159 P. 202]; 10 McQuillan, Municipal Corporations, \u00a7\u00a7 29.73, 29.73a, pp. 423-425, 429-430.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the context of the \u201chybrid\u201d management contract involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>herein, I see no reason whatever for denying the Authority the right to evaluate, on the basis of objective criteria selected and announced, in advance of bid solicitation, the quality, fitness and capacity of the respective bidders, and to award that contract to the bidder shown by application of those criteria to be the best qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">I would hold that the Authority\u2019s award to Swinerton was. within its powers and did not constitute an abuse of its discretion. Accordingly, I would annul the trial court\u2019s judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Wright, C. J., and McComb, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-6\"> As stated in the <em>West </em>case, \u201cThere are many occasions in the experiences of municipal government when the quality of the thing to be supplied in the course of the public service depends upon conditions which differentiate bidders, and require the exercise of a sound discretion on the part of city officials in determining whether the wares or device which each individual bidder offers in the form of his own exclusive design are such as will meet the particular requirements of the intended work. In order to cover such cases it is quite usual in the provisions of city charters to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>find such terms as \u2018lowest and best bidder,\u2019 or as \u2018lowest responsible bidder,\u2019 and the like; and these phrases have been given by the courts a particular meaning, in which it must be presumed they are used by the framers of city charters in the absence of other limiting clauses. The term \u2018lowest responsible bidder\u2019 has been held to mean the lowest bidder whose offer best responds in quality, fitness, and capacity to the particular requirements of the proposed work; and that where by the use of these terms the council has been invested with discretionary power as to which is the lowest responsible bidder, having regard to the quality and adaptability of the material or article to the particular requirements of its use, such discretion will not be interfered with by the courts in the absence of direct averments and proof of fraud.
