Subsequently, and without notice, and upon evidence satisfactory to them, the assessment was increased to $357,468.13. This, we think, was error, because, having corrected the assessment, they were without authority to thereafter increase is, except upon 20 days\u2019 notice to the relator. Laws 1882, c. 410, \u00a7 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-17\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and printing disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
