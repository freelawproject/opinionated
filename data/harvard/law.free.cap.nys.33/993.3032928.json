The injury was from the wetting of the contents of a trunk. The trunk was brought by railway from Baltimore, and at Communipaw was delivered into defendant\u2019s custody for carriage to plaintiff\u2019s residence. The evidence is ample to support the conclusion that, when delivered t\u00f3 the railroad company in Baltimore, the trunk and its contents were in good condition, and that, when examined by the plaintiff at her residence on the day she received them from the defendant, they were damaged by water. The complaint is of a defect of proof of the condition of the baggage when taken into the defendant\u2019s custody. But it could not have sustained the injury while in transit by rail, for no rain fell during that interval. Indeed, that, when delivered to defendant, the trunk was in good condition, is established by 'the testimony of defendant\u2019s own servants. Its superintendent, who saw the trunk in the baggage room, says it was \u201cin good order\u201d; and the driver who received it for delivery to plaintiff swears that it was \u201cperfectly dry.\u201d Waiving, then, the presumption that a connecting carrier receives goods in the condition in which they were delivered to the initial carrier (Myerson v. Woolverton, 9 Misc. Rep. 186, 29 N. Y. Supp. 737), here was positive proof that plaintiff\u2019s baggage was uninjured when taken by the defendant. Receiving the baggage in good condition, and delivering it in bad, it was incumbent on defendant to exonerate itself from liability. 4 Lawson, Rights, Rem. &amp; Prac. \u00a7 I860, and citations in note. Supposing, however, the burden on plaintiff to prove defendant\u2019s negligence the cause of the damage, evidence enough was adduced to authorize the inference that the injury was the effect of a careless exposure of the trunk to the perils of a rainstorm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-15\">The judgment, being unaffected by error, and manifestly just, is affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
