It is necessary, in order that there should not be confusion and dispute as to the papers used upon a motion, that they should be so definitely specified that they can be easily identified, and that there may be no confusion or dispute in reference thereto. This is manifestly the requirement of rule 3 of the general rules of practice, which requires that, in every order -entered on a nonenumerated motion, all the papers used or read \u2022on the motion on either side shall be specified in the order. The words objected to are too indefinite, and do not comply with the \u2022rule. The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
