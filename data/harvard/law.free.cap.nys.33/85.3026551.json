D. Barber at and from at noon the thirteenth day of March (warranted by the assured to be then in safety), until at noon on the thirteenth day of March, 1894; * * * to be confined to the general freighting business in the navigation of the rivers and canals of the state of New York, the port, bay, and harbor of the city of New York,\u201d etc. No limitation upon the amount of freight which could be carried was made in this policy, but at the time of its delivery a marginal clause was inserted in writing by defendant\u2019s agent, as follows: \u201cPrivilege of present trip New York to Baltimore, and return to New York, with not exceeding one hundred and fifty tons of cargo on board either way.\u201d On March 13, 1893, the plaintiff Mosher entered into a contract for the transportation of 250 tons of iron borings from New York to Wilmington, Del., and loaded that quantity upon the boat at its dock in New York. Thereafter he applied to defendants for a change in the privilege clause to cover the amount loaded for the contemplated trip, which application was refused, and plaintiff announced his intention of abandoning the trip rather than proceed uninsured. On March 20th the boat, while still lying at her dock, was destroyed by fire,\u2014one of the perils insured against,\u2014and became a total loss. Defendant sought to avoid payment of the amount called for by the policy upon the ground that by loading in excess of 150 tons, with the intention of making the trip to Wilmington, the plaintiff had deviated from its terms. Upon the trial, both parties moved for the direction of a verdict, and the trial court made such direction in favor of the plaintiffs for the amount claimed. The judgment was affirmed by the general term.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b117-10\">Argued before BOOKSTAVER, BISCHOFF, and GIEGERIGH, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-11\">Carpenter &amp; Mosher, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-12\">Hyland &amp; Zabriskie, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b117-13\">BISCHOFF, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ArEx\">Upon an appeal from a judgment entered upon a verdict directed by the court after both sides have moved for a direction, it is to be assumed that the facts essential to the judgment were found by the court in favor of the successful party (Daly v. Wise, 132 N. Y. 309, 30 N. E. 837; Dillon v. Cockcroft, 90 N. Y. 649); and we are concluded as to the weight of the evidence by the judgment of affirmance below (Dearing v. Pearson, 8 Misc. Rep. 269, 28 N. Y. Supp. 715). There being evidence that the plaintiff owner, Mosher, had abandoned his intention of male<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>ing the trip permitted by the marginal clause in the policy, that fact must here be taken as established.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\">But appellant contends that the privilege clause intended an immediate voyage, to the completion of which the operation of the general clauses of the policy was suspended, and that, therefore, by reason of the plaintiffs\u2019 loading in excess of the amount allowed by such clause, there had been an actual violation of the policy, which could not be affected by the insured\u2019s subsequent change of intention, in the absence of a new agreement. Where there is an inconsistency between provisions of an insurance policy, a written clause will control over one which is printed, and special provisions over general. Chadsey v. Guion, 97 N. Y. 333; Insurance Co. v. Hazelett (Ind. Sup.) 4 N. E. 582. But there is a further rule of construction which requires that words of exception to or limitation upon a risk be taken more strongly against the insurer, and in the sense in which they would be naturally understood by the insured. Phil. Ins. \u00a7 131; 14 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 285, 286, note 1. In the application of the rules noted, we are unable to give to this policy and its marginal clause the construction contended for by appellant. Some insurance upon the boat while lying at her dock after March 13th must necessarily have been intended from the wording of the general clauses, and, there being no provision in the special clause covering insurance while at the dock, nothing inconsistent with the general clauses is thereby presented. True, if a policy provides for insurance \u201cat and from\u201d a given point, a deviation may be predicable of the vessel\u2019s loading at the port of departure, if an intention to substitute a voyage other than that provided for can be clearly shown; and so of a policy insuring \u201cfrom\u201d a certain port, but there the intention is to be looked for only in connection with actual sailing. Phil. Ins. \u00a7 992. Where the word \u201cat\u201d is omitted, a,nd the policy reads merely, \u201cfrom\u201d a certain port, the risk attaches only from the time when the vessel weighs anchor a.nd breaks ground for the voyage with all the preparations completely made. Phil. Ins. \u00a7 945. Here the special clause gave the privilege of a trip specified merely \u201cNew York to Baltimore,\u201d etc.; and an assumption that the insurance thereunder, with the restriction against loading (which did not apply under the general policy), should commence \u201cat\u201d the place of mooring in New York, to the exclusion of the general insurance effected, would be to import a term into the clause for the purpose of defeating the policy; and this, too, in contravention of the meaning which the insured most reasonably could put upon the words used, and which, as appears from the evidence, he actually did.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">The judgments of the general and trial terms below should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
