The complaint neither makes' claim for the value of the service nor alleges the value of the service; and so was plaintiffs\u2019 evidence. The testimony of Eilau was to an express contract by the defendant to pay the plaintiffs $250 for the specific service. The case was so presented to the jury in the charge of the court,\u2014as depending upon an agreement to pay that sum; and the plaintiffs acquiesced in such submission of that single issue. How, now, may they object that they were not allowed to claim the value of their service, and recover upon a quantum meruit? Suggesting no amendment of the complaint on the trial, they are not to be permitted on -appeal to impute error to the court in excluding proof of a cause \u25a0of action of which before there was no intimation. By the pleadings and by plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, the defendant was admonished to prepare for a trial of no other issue than the fact of the alleged agreement; and he was not to be surprised by the litigation of another and inconsistent controversy. Romeyn v. Sickles, 108 N. Y. 650, 15 N. E. 698. It results that the learned trial judge ruled rightly in excluding testimony as to the value of plaintiffs\u2019 services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-15\">The other exceptions as to evidence are equally untenable. Explanation of plaintiffs\u2019 demand upon Baaden for a part of the fee received by him was clearly in order, as tending to support defendant\u2019s contention that their client was not he, but Baaden. So, proof that the plaintiffs agreed to assist Baaden in the probate in requital of past favors negatives the allegation of an agreement with defendant for compensation. The evidence that the executor never employed plaintiffs went straight to the main issue in litigation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>If the court erred in permitting proof of a possible allowance to plaintiffs by the surrogate, to which only a general objection is interposed, the error was repaired by the explicit and repeated instruction that such allowance would not affect the validity of plaintiffs\u2019 claim under the alleged contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Plaintiffs complain that \u201cthe verdict is against the evidence and weight of evidence\u201d; but, as they made no motion for the direction of a verdict in their favor, \u201cno exception presents the question whether there was sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict; and, however unjust it may be, this court is powerless to give relief.\u201d Schwinger v. Raymond, 105 N. Y. 648, 11 N. E. 952. We may add, however, that, upon an attentive examination of the evidence, our conclusion is in accordance with the jury\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
