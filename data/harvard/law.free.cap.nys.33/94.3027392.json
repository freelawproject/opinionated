Judgment for the defendants. Amount paid into court is sufficient to pay the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">As there was no evidence of tender before suit, we are to assume that no such plea was intended by the answer, and that the $17.05 was meant to be a tender at the time of the joining of issue. The provisions of the Code authorizing tender after suit brought (section 731 et seq.) do not appear to be made applicable to district courts (section 3347, subd. 6); and, if they were, there was yet no tender of costs, and it was ineffectual. Eaton v. Wells, 82 N. Y. 576. If the offer of judgment allowed by the old Code (sections 64, 68) is still applicable to district courts, then that practice was not pursued in this case, for there was no offer of judgment made. As the justice found that the plaintiff had a claim which the money paid into court was sufficient to satisfy, he should have rendered judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor for the amount due. He could only render judgment in defendants\u2019 favor on proof that tender had been made before suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered., with costs to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
