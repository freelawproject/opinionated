Museovitz and Michol the admission that has been proven in this case,\u2014that he was getting off the car while it was in motion, and before it stopped,\u2014that defendant is entitled to a verdict.\u201d I charged: \u201cIf he made that admission, and the jury believed it [i. e. that he made this admission], I charge you. that in that event the verdict would have to be in favor of defendant.\u201d In effect, I charged that although, if the jury believed that plaintiff was entitled to a verdict because of defendant\u2019s negligence, and his freedom from contributory negligence, yet their verdict must be for defendant, if they believed that defendant stated to Drs. Museovitz and Michol that he was injured by getting off the car while it was in motion. It seems to me that it is not necessary to cite any authorities, or indulge in any argument, to prove the error of such direction. Error is apparent on its face. Surely, the mere admission referred to, made out of court, could not have defeated a recovery by plaintiff of a verdict herein, providing he proved defendant\u2019s negligence, and that he was free from contributory negligence. Yet I so charged, and for that reason a new trial must be granted. Settle order upon notice.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1152-9\">Argued before EHRLICH, C.
