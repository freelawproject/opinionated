There is nothing set out in the complaint showing any covenant in the deed against incumbrances. Plaintiff\u2019s claim, therefore, rests upon a claimed breach of the covenant of warranty and peaceable enjoyment. But there can be no breach of such covenant without an eviction, or by the establishment of facts showing paramount title. Mead v. Stackpole, 40 Hun, 473; Boreel v. Lawton, 90 N. Y. 293. There is nothing appearing in the complaint to show that his possession was for a moment disturbed, or that a paramount title in fact existed, and consequently there was no breach of the covenant. There is no allegation that any judgment was ever entered adjudicating that the taxes were a lien upon the premises, or that any judgment whatever was entered in the foreclosure action. The decision of a court upon issues which never passed into judgment cannot avail the party. As this court is unable to see what the issue was presented by the pleadings, or if the pleadings were admissible for that purpose, or any other purpose; it would still be in the dark respecting what the court adjudicated. The judgment roll is essential and necessary to establish such facts. Forsyth v. Campbell, 15 Hun, 235; Baker v. Kingsland, 10 Paige, 366; Lansing v. Russell, 3 Barb. Ch. 325. The pleading, therefore, fails in the statement of a cause of action. Judgment should be directed sustaining the demurrer, with costs, with leave to the plaintiff to serve an amended complaint within 20 days on payment of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\">WHITE, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b696-4\">TITU8, C.
