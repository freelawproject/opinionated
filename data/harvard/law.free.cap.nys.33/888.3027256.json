J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3bS\">In Burke v. Candee, 63 Barb. 552, it was held, viz.: \u201cAn additional allowance is made\" by way of an indemnity to the party succeeding in the litigation.\u201d That case was referred to with approval in Gooding v. Brown, 21 Wkly. Dig. 47; Tolman v. Railroad Co., 31 Hun, 403; and Delcomyn v. Chamberlain, 48 How. Prac. 413. Section 3253 of the Code proAddes that in an action which is \u201cdifficult and extraordinary,\u201d where a defense has been interposed, the court may, in its discretion, award to any party \u201ca sum not exceeding five per centum upon the sum recovered, or claimed, or the value of the subject matter involved.\u201d The affidavits produced upon the motion tend to indicate that the case was difficult and extraordinary. In Morrison v. Agate, 9 Wkly. Dig. 286, it was said that the determination of the question as to whether an action should be regarded as difficult and extraordinary, within the meaning of the Code, involves so many considerations which are addressed to the discretion of the judge that the appellate court rarely interferes. The doctrine of that case was approved by this court in Tolman v. Railroad Co., 31 Hun, 403. In the latter case an order had been made for an extra allowance, and the court observed, \u201cTo reArerse the order, we should be obliged to say that the discretion of the trial judge was improperly exercised.\u201d In the case in hand we are not inclined to say that the discretion of the special term was improperly exercised, as the appeal book does not contain \u201call the proceedings had and taken in this action.\u201d It may be that the order in question was based upon a knowledge possessed by the court \u201cof all the proceedings had and taken m this action,\u201d and that such knowledge is not revealed fully to us by the appeal book. This feature of the case is rendered probable by the circumstance \u2022 that the judge who presided at the' special term presided at the circuit where the issues of. fact were tried, and the trial thereof was presided over by him during the whole of a week of the circuit. We are not prepared to attribute to the judge the views imputed to him found in the affidavits in the appeal book. The circumstances of the trial may have induced him to insert in the order the clause, \u201cIn case motion for a new trial is made or appeal taken by defendants, then and in that case this motion may be renewed.\u201d Inasmuch as no motion for a new trial has been made or appeal taken by the defendants, the privilege given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>by the clause just quoted is unavailing to the plaintiff. Some force and effect may have been given to the affidavits read by the defendants relating to the intimations theretofore made by the court in respect to the nature and character of the action, which affidavits the plaintiff had no opportunity to answer at the time the motion was heard. Possibly, upon other and further affidavits, the plaintiff may be able to obtain leave to renew the motion, and, having done so, to secure a further determination by the special term of the question whether, under all the circumstances surrounding the question as to the propriety of an extra allowance, the discretion of the court should be exercised in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Rule <em>\u00e1i </em>of the general rules of practice of the supreme court provides that \u201capplications for an additional allowance can only be made to the court before which the trial is had.\u201d We think, upon the papers before us, we\" ought not to pass conclusively upon the question whether the plaintiff is entitled to an extra allowance, as that question cannot well be solved, except upon a mature consideration of \u201call the proceedings had and taken\u201d in the action, and upon all the affidavits presented by either party relating thereto. We therefore affirm the order, without costs, and without prejudice to the plaintiff\u2019s application at special term for leave to renew its motion. Order affirmed, without costs, and without prejudice to an application by the plaintiff for leave to renew its motion for an extra allowance. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
