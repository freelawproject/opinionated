The questions submitted to this court upon this case are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-10\">Was it and is -it the duty of the defendant, Alfred H. Neal, as such keeper of the Erie county penitentiary, to pay over said fines and penalties to the treasurer of the city of Buffalo every week, pursuant to the provisions of section 385 of the charter of the city of Buffalo, which provides as follows? \u201cAll fines and penalties imposed by any or either'of said justices, collected by them or the keeper of the Erie county penitentiary, or otherwise, shall be paid over every week, by the person receiving the same, to the treasurer of the city of Buffalo, and be by said treasurer credited to the police fund of the said city for the use and benefit thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-11\">Or was it and is it his duty to pay said moneys over to \u00abthe treasurer of Erie county, pursuant to the provisions of sections 233, 234, c. 686, of the Laws of 1892, which became of force May 18,1892, and which are as follows?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-12\">\u201cSec. 233. Annual Beport of County Officers. Each county officer who shall receive, or is authorized by law to receive, any money on account of fines or penalties or other matter in which his county, or any town or city therein, shall have an interest, shall annually make'a written report to the board of supervisors. of his county, verified to be true, bearing date the first day of November, stating the time when, and the name of every person from whom, such money has been received, the amount thereof, on what account received, and the sums remaining due and unpaid; and if no such money has been received, his report shall so state.

The defendant retains that money in his possession. Whether or not it is the duty of the defendant to pay that money to the treasurer of the city of Buffalo is the question to be determined. By the charter of the city it is provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-17\">\u201cAll fines and penalties imposed by any or either of said justices, collected by them or the keeper of the Brie county penitentiary or otherwise shall be paid over every week by the person receiving the same, to the treasurer of the city of Buffalo, and be by the said treasurer credited to the police fund of said city for the use and benefit thereof.\u201d Laws 1891, c. 105, \u00a7 385.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>The duty of the defendant to pay the money to the treasurer of the plaintiff would not be questioned, if it were not for a later statute, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">\u201cBach county officer who shall receive, or is authorized by law to receive, any money on account of fines or penalties or other matter in wliicli his county, or any town or city therein, shall have an interest, shall annually make a written report to the board of supervisors of his county, verified to be true, bearing date the first day of November, stating the time when, and the name of every person from whom, such money has been received. * * * Such report shall be filed with the clerk of the board, on or before the fifth day of November; and no officer shall be entitled to receive payment for his services, unless he shall file with the supervisors, or other officers performing their duties, his affidavit that he has made such report, and paid over all moneys which he is required to pay over, within ninety days after receiving any such money, such officers shall pay the same without any deduction to the treasurer of the county, * * * but nothing herein shall be construed to apply to moneys received by any town or city officer in his official capacity, as such, specially appropriated for any town or city purpose.\u201d Laws 1892, c. 686, \u00a7 233.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Also:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">\u201cThe district attorney shall sue for and recover, in behalf of and in the name of his county the money received by any officer for or on account of his county, or any town or city therein, and not paid to the county treasurer as herein required.

This cannot be so, unless those provisions of the charter before mentioned, so far as relates to the manner of receiving the money, were rendered inoperative by force of those of the later act. It is the well-settled and prevailing rule applicable to the construction and effect of statutes, in their relation to each other, that repeal by implication is not favored, and that the provisions of a local or special act will not be deemed repealed by a later general enactment, unless it is manifest that such is the legislative intent, although the provisions of the latter are in terms sufficiently comprehensive to embrace the subject of the special or local one, and, in its absence, would do so. In re Evergreen, 47 N. Y. 216; In re Commissioners of Central Park, 50 N. Y. 493; People v. Quigg, 59 N. Y. 83; Whipple v. Christian, 80 N. Y. 523; Buffalo Cemetery Ass\u2019n v. City of Buffalo, 118 N. Y. 62, 22 N. E. 962. The act of 1892 is known as the \u201cCounty Law.\u201d It was intended as a codification of the laws on the subject to which it relates, and thus^to embrace the entire statutory system, governmental and otherwise, of the counties of the state, other than the county of New York, in a single chapter. And by its provisions in question the purpose evidently was to render the action of this class of officers of the several counties subject to the supervision of the board of supervisors, so far as relates to moneys which should come into their hands, whatever should be the ultimate disposition of the funds. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>By their terms, those provisions appear to be no less applicable to Erie county than to other parts of the state. There is therefore an apparent repugnancy. The plaintiff's charter provides that such money, so received by the keeper of Erie county penitentiary, shall be paid by him to the city treasurer weekly, while the later general \u25a0act provides that he shall pay such moneys to the county treasurer. There is nothing in the act of 1892, other than in its general scope and purpose, bearing upon the question whether it has superseded the provisions in question of the city charter. But, to effect the repeal by implication of provisions of a statute by those of a subsequent one, it is sufficient that they are necessarily repugnant. This does not follow merely because they cover the same subject, and in the absence of either, the other would be operative upon it. The repugnancy which has the effect to retire provisions of the former statute is dependent upon the intent of the later one, as manifested in its purpose. In determining the question of the comprehensive \u2022effect intended by the act of 1892, the fact that it was designed as a code of statutory law relating to the counties of the state is entitled to some consideration. In Harrington v. Trustees, 10 Wend. 547, the question was whether the Revised Statutes, upon the subject of excise, operated to repeal a provision upon the same subject in the prior act, incorporating the village of Rochester. The court, by Mr. Chief Justice Savage, there said, \u201cThe repugnancy is apparent, and the consequence of that repugnancy is palpable\u201d; that the Revised Statutes \u201care a new code of laws, and were intended by the legislature to supersede existing laws which were repugnant to them.\u201d And it was held that such was the effect of the provi\u25a0sions there in question. In People v. Board of Supervisors of Westchester Co., 73 N. Y. 173, it was held that a general act limiting the \u25a0compensation to which county treasurers should be entitled on account of moneys derived from state taxes operated to repeal local \u25a0acts upon the subject, because it was intended to be applicable to the entire state, and it was there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">\u201cIt is a rule that, where there are no words of explicit repeal in a later act, it does not repeal by implication a former act, unless the later enactment is so repugnant to the former as that they both cannot exist together. This rule applies in an especial manner where the former enactment is local and the later one is general. Yet if it is plain that the legislature meant to make a new and exclusive rule for the whole state, and for all cases, the .local act must yield to the later general act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">This proposition, in substance and effect, has the sanction of repeated judicial authority. People v. Angle, 109 N. Y. 564, 575, 17 N. E. 413; Anderson v. Anderson, 112 N. Y. 104, 19 N. E. 427; In re Washington, St. A. &amp; P. R. Co., 115 N. Y. 442, 22 N. E. 356; In re New York Institution for Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb, 121 N. Y. 234, 24 N. E. 378; Cromwell v. MacLean, 123 N. Y. 474, 485, <em>25 </em>N. E. 932. The act of 1892 was designed as a consolidation and \u25a0revision of all the statute law relating to the entire state, except the \u2022county -.of New York, and to provide a system comprehensive and complete in relation to all the counties embraced within its pro visions. And, in respect to the subject-matter in question, those and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>the provisions in question of the charter of the city of Buffalo cannot stand together. While those of the later act do not affect any substantial right of the city in respect to the money in question, it does provide a different method of transmission of it from the county officer to the city treasury. It may possibly be attended with more delay than formerly, and the change of method may be unimportant in its reason and purpose. But the view here taken is that the county of Erie is not excepted from the operation of the later statute, in any respect, and that such provision of the city charter is superseded by it. The defendant is therefore entitled to judgment, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">DWIGHT, P. J., and LEWIS, J., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b383-6\">WARD, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AAM\">The fines and penalties specified in this submission belong to the city of Buffalo, whether paid into the city treasury by the keeper of the Erie county penitentiary, in the manner required by the charter of the city, or whether they come to the city through the circumlocution of chapter 686 of the Laws of 1892. The most natural and reasonable way would be as provided by the charter; that being a direct way, and the money is paid over, substantially, as soon as it is received by the keeper. By the other process the keeper must pay over the money to the county treasurer within 90 days after its receipt, keep an account of it, and make an annual report to the supervisors of the county, and then they, by a resolution, shall turn it over to the city. It is claimed by the defendant that chapter 686 became a law after the adoption of the Buffalo charter, and consequently was the latest declaration of the legislative will upon the subject, and is controlling, it being an implied repeal of the provision of the charter as to the manner of the payment of this money by the keeper.' Chapter 686 is a general statute affecting the whole state, and is entitled \u201cAn act in relation to counties, constituting chapter 18 of the general law.\u201d It is what is generally known as the \u201cCounty Law,\u201d and its purpose was to embrace statutes of the state affecting the government of counties, as such, and does not assume to be a revising statute, otherwise. Nor does it assume to repeal any laws .affecting the government of cities, or otherwise, except as set forth in the \u201cSchedule of Laws Repealed,\u201d appended to said county law, and made a part thereof, and in such schedule we do not find the repeal of this provision of the Buffalo charter. We must assume, therefore, that, as this county law specially designates the statutes which it is intended to repeal, the legislature, in enacting it, did not intend to repeal by implication the section of the charter under which the plaintiff claims. Repeals by implication are not favored. And it is well settled .that a special and local statute providing for a particular case or class of cases is not repealed or amended, as to some of its provisions, by a statute general in its terms, provisions, and applications, .unless the intent to repeal or alter is manifest, although the terms of the general act would, but ;for the special law, include the cases provided for by the latter. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>In re Application of Commissioners, etc., in New York City, 50 N. Y. 493; People v. Quigg, 59 N. Y. 83; Buffalo Cemetery Ass\u2019n v. City of Buffalo, 118 N. Y. 61, 22 N. E. 962; James v. Sammis, 132 N. Y. 239, 30 N. E. 502; Aldinger v. Pugh, 57 Hun, 181, 10 N. Y. Supp. 684; Brown v. Duane, 60 Hun, 98, 14 N. Y. Supp. 450; Harrington v. Trustees, 10 Wend. 552; Van Denburgh v. Village of Greenbush, 66 N. Y. 1; Whipple v. Christian, 80 N. Y. 523. In the last two cases it was held that the lien laws affecting special localities and counties were not repealed by a general lien law of the state subsequently passed, in the absence of repealing clauses to that effect. The learned counsel for the defendant cites several cases which mainly relate to the effect of subsequent general statutes upon prior general ones, and where the courts hold that, when the legislature manifests a design to embrace the subject-matter of the former statute in the latter, the former is repealed by implication. These cases do not aid us. Section 385 of the Buffalo charter was therefore in full force at the time that the moneys sought to be recovered from the defendant were received by him, and constitutes the guide of his action. It is true that section 234 of chapter 686 (County Law), requires that the county treasurer shall distribute all moneys belonging to any town or city in such county, received by him, as the board of supervisors shall direct. This can only refer to such moneys as the treasurer is entitled to receive under the county law; and as, by the charter, this money does not go into the hands of the county treasurer at all, the provision of the act of 1892 has no application. There is no such incongruity between the provisions of the city charter and that of the provisions of the general county law as prevents their standing and being enforced together. As to this particular police fund, the charter prevails, and the money must be paid to the'city treasurer according to its provisions. It follows from these views that the plaintiff should have judgment, under the stipulation, for the sum of $5,546.05, but, under the stipulation, without interest or costs. Costs are not to be awarded to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
