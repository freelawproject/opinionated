On appeal from such order the defendant impugns its validity on several grounds. First it is objected that \u201cthe petition does not state facts sufficient to warrant the order,\u201d because, since by subdivision 3, \u00a7 481, of the Code the demand for judgment may be for any sum \u201cto. which the plaintiff supposes himself entitled,\u201d it is not necessary that he name the exact amount of the recovery. In Veiller v. Oppenheim (Sup.) 26 N. Y. Supp. 1051, 1053, Judge O\u2019Brien, with' the concurrence of Van Brunt, P. J., and Follett, J., exploded a little criticism thus: \u201cIn an action at law it will be necessary for the plaintiff to state the amount which he seeks to recover, and, unless such amount can be ascertained from an inspection of the books, plaintiff will not be in a position to know just what sum he is entitled to sue for.\u201d Again, defendant objects that it is not apparent that the plaintiff \u201chas exhausted all means of information at his command.\u201d Nevertheless it is the fact that he explored without result the one source of intelligence open to him, and how futile would have been an application to the defendant is sufficiently evinced by the stubborn resistance to the present motion. Again, it is urged that the order is invalid, because \u201cneither the petition nor the notice of motion specifies the particular books or documents which the plaintiff desires to examine.\u201d But the order designates the ledger and sales book, so that the exorbitant demand in the notice of motion is denied, the generality of the moving papers is reduced to a particular by the order, and nothing more is exacted of the defendant than would have been allowable had plaintiff\u2019s papers been technically precise. Still again, defendant objects that \u201cthe petition is not verified in accordance with the rule of court,\u201d but wherein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>it is defective the brief does not apprise us. Rule 15 merely requires that \u201cthe moving papers be verified by affidavit,\u201d and plaintiff\u2019s petition is authenticated by just such a verification. Finally, the defendant complains \u201cthat the application is not made in good faith, but is a pure and simple fishing excursion.\u201d \u201cBad faith\u201d and \u201cfishing excursion\u201d is the uniform answer to applications for discovery, and, were the answer sufficient, the relief would be unattainable. The petition to which defendant refers us for proof of his imputation suggests to us no suspicion of sinister motive in the application. If the adjudication in Veiller v. Qppenheim, supra, be not conclusive as authority upon this appeal, the opinions of Barrett and O\u2019Brien, JJ., are convincing as argument. Order affirmed, with costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
