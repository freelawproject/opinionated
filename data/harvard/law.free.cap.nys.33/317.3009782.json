F. retained the letter, but as he left the house he handed the papers containing the names of the charitable corporations to testatrix\u2019s attendant, and directed her to keep them safe. She gave them to the testatrix, and afterwards copied them on one paper, and burned the originals. The papers were prepared during the preceding night by the testatrix and her attendant, testatrix then fearing that she would not live until morning. F. deposited certificates of stock in the testatrix\u2019s safe-deposit vault box. On the next day testatrix executed a codicil to her will, by which she bequeathed out of the proceeds of the stock \u00a7100,000, to be divided equally among certain charitable corporations. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence did not show a creation of the trust by a delivery of a list of names of the intended beneficiaries, but was abandoned by the testatrix, and the codicil was executed in its place.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b349-10\">Appeal from special term, New York county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-11\">Action by George Bliss, Henry Parish, and Duncan Smith, as executors of Elizabeth Fogg, against Charles B.

The appellants claim that the title is in the executors of Elizabeth Fogg, and the respondents assert that the title is in Charles B. Fosdick, as trustee. July 2, 1888, Elizabeth Fogg executed her last will and testament, in which George Bliss, Henry Parish, and Duncan Smith were nominated as executors. After making various bequests, she devised and bequeathed the remainder of her estate to Hiram H. Fogg and John A. Phipps. On November 12, 1890, the Gutta-Percha &amp; Rubber Manufacturing Company issued a certificate (No. 31) to Elizabeth Fogg for 1,000 shares of the stock of that corporation. At some time prior to December 19, 1890, Mrs. Fogg\u2019s pastor, the Rev. Mr. Williams, handed to her a piece of paper, on which he had written the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-13\">\u201cI desire to bequeath the one hundred thousand dollars, which is now in the keeping of-, to the Young Women\u2019s Christian Association of New York City.

Fosdick. At this time Mrs. Fogg was confined to her bed by a sickness from which she did not recover. The witness to the transfer (Annie Julia Norton) was the attendant of Blrs. Fogg, her confidential friend, and had the care of her from early in September, 1890, until her death, which occurred January 3, Y891. After receiving the transfer of the above-mentioned certificate, Bir. Fosdick went directly to the Fifth Avenue Safe-Deposit Company, where he had a conversation with -George Blontague, the president of that corporation, in which Mr. B'osdick told Bir. Blontague of the purpose of Blrs. Fogg to give the avails of this certificate to charitable corporations; and thereupon Mr. Blontague wrote on a small piece of paper, \u201cThe Training School for Nurses,\u201d \u201cThe Aged and Infirm Clergy Fund,\u201d as two worthy charitable corporations, and handed the memorandum to Bir. Fosdick, who, later in the day of December 19th, left it with Blrs. Fogg. The night of December 19th and 20th was wholly spent by Mrs. Fogg and Bliss Norton in selecting charitable corporations among which the avails of the aforesaid shares of stock should be divided. After making several memoranda, Bliss Norton wrote the names of the corporations selected, aside from the names of the two corporations written by Mr. Blontague, on a single piece of paper. Upon another piece of paper she wrote the names, \u201cJohn Peterson, Carl, his sister-in-law, Thomas Doran, Sallie Neilson, and a small breastpin.\u201d Bliss Norton entered no sums opposite the names of these persons. December 20, 1890, at about 9 a. m., Bir. Fosdick called on Blrs. Fogg; having with him a writing which he devised, which had been copied by his bookkeeper, and which Mrs. Fogg then signed, of which the following is a copy;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-10\">\u201cNew York, 20th Dec\u2019r, 1890.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-11\">\u201cBir.

Elizabeth Fogg.\"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-13\">This paper has remained in the possession of Mr. Fosdick since its execution. While Bir. Fosdick was in Blrs. Fogg\u2019s room he received from some one (from whom does not appear) the memorandum written by George Montague, the paper on which Bliss Norton had written the names of certain corporations, and the paper on which she had written the names, \u201cJohn Peterson, Carl, his sister-in-law, Thomas Doran, Sallie Neilson, and-a small breastpin.\u201d Blrs. Fogg occupied a room on the second floor of the house. Just as Bir. Fosdick was leaving the residence, he met Bliss Norton, in the reception room, on the first floor, and handed to her the three pieces of paper, and charged her to keep them safe, and thereafter she gave them to Blrs. I^ogg. After Miss Norton received the three papers from Mr. B^osdick, he left the house, and went to the Fifth Avenue Safe-Deposit Company, where he placed the stock certificate .-and the transfer indorsed thereon in Blrs. Fogg\u2019s private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>box, where, after her death, it was found by her executors. No consideration was received by Mrs. Fogg for the transfer, and the shares have not been transferred on the books of the Gutta-Percha &amp; Rubber Manufacturing Company. Later in the day of December 20, 1890, Miss Norton copied the names of the corporations from the two pieces of paper (one written by her the night before, and one written by Mr. Montague) onto the paper on which the Rev. Mr. Williams had written the words above quoted.

She left a large estate, more than sufficient to pay all of the legacies. May 15, 1891, the residuary legatees and devisees executed and delivered to the executors the following instrument:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-14\">\u201cWhereas, Elizabeth Fogg, late of the city of New York, on or about the-20th day of December, 1890, delivered to Charles B.

Fosdick; and whereas, thereafter, and on the 21st day of December, 1890, the said Elizabeth Fogg executed a codicil to her last will, which will and codicil were on the 15th day of April, 1891, proved and admitted to probate-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>before the surrogate of the county of New York, as the last will and testament of the said Elizabeth Fogg, deceased, in and by which codicil the said testatrix, among other things, gave and bequeathed, out of the proceeds of sale of the said one thousand shares of the Gutta-Percha and Rubber Manufacturing Company, one hundred thousand dollars, to be equally divided among certain charitable associations enumerated in said codicil; and whereas, the validity of said charitable bequests, or some of them, may be called in question by reason of the fact that the said codicil was made and executed less than two months before the death of the testatrix; now, therefore, we, Hiram H. Fogg and John A. Phipps, residuary legatees under the last will and testament of the said Elizabeth Fogg, deceased, in consideration of the premises and of our mutual signatures hereto, do hereby consent to the payment by the said executors of each and all of the said bequests to charitable corporations made in and by the said codicil, irrespective of the validity or invalidity of any of said bequests, and authorize the executors of the said last will and testament to pay each and all said bequests; and we hereby waive all our and each of our claim to all and every part of the said one hundred thousand dollars so given and bequeathed by the said codicil of the said testatrix, but upon the understanding that the said Charles B. Fosdick shall relinquish all claim to the said stock so delivered by the said testatrix to him during her lifetime, and execute all such papers as shall be necessary to vest the title to the same fully and completely in the executors of the said last will and testament.

The plaintiffs and Charles B. Fosdick are interested simply in carrying out the wishes of Elizabeth Fogg, and in relieving themselves from liability. There is no evidence&amp;emdash;and, indeed, it is not asserted&amp;emdash;that Exhibit No. 3 was ever delivered to Charles B. Fosdick, or that he ever saw it until after the death of the testatrix, unless he saw it when the codicil was drafted; but at about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>9 a. m., December 20th, he did see and hold in his hands for a few moments the three pieces of paper, the contents of which were afterwards, and on the same day, copied onto Exhibits No. 3 and L. In reaching the conclusion that the list of beneficiaries was delivered to Mr. Fosdick, the learned trial court must have held (1) that the three pieces of \u2022 paper were handed by Mrs. Fogg to him; and (2) with the intent on her part to deliver them to him for the purpose of effecting a gift by means of the transfer of the shares of stock and those papers. The fact that the three papers were subsequently copied and burned in the presence of Mrs. Fogg militates against the theory that she understood that they had been delivered to Mr. Fosdick, and formed part of a completed transaction. Mr. Fosdick testified on this trial, as he did on the first trial, that he did not consider that the list had been delivered to him, but supposed that the codicil would do away with all that had been done between them. The first paper relied on to establish a trust is the transfer of the shares, which is absolute in form. The second paper is the letter of December 20th, signed by Mrs. Fogg, and addressed to Mr. Fosdick. The first paragraph of this letter refers to the transfer made the day before,, which Mr. Fosdick had with him when the letter was signed and delivered. The second paragraph reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">\u201cFrom the proceeds thereof, I desire that you do appropriate the sum of $100,000, in the name of Elizabeth Fogg, in sums of $5,000 each, to various charity organizations, of which a list is hereto annexed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">No list was ever annexed to this letter, and no list naming 20 corporations was ever made by or for Mrs. Fogg. Mr. Fosdick testified that this letter was devised by himself, and copied by his bookkeeper; that he (Fosdick) stopped at Mrs. Fogg\u2019s on his way down town on the morning of December 20th, when the letter was signed. Therefore, he must have been informed December 19th of her purpose to divide $100,000 among 20 charitable corporations. Mrs. Fogg and Miss Norton spent the night of December 19th and 20th in a vain attempt to name 20 charitable corporations which should receive the sum, but abandoned the attempt, and Mrs. Fogg concluded to divide the sum among 10 corporations. In order to uphold the trust declared by the judgment of the special term, the letter of December 20th must be eliminated from the case, as it is entirely inconsistent with the trust adjudged to exist The only evidence left of an intent to establish a trust consists of the transfer of the shares of stock of Exhibit No. 3, and the testimony given by Miss Norton. From the time Mrs. Fogg\u2019s pastor wrote for her that wThich subsequently became the caption of Exhibit No. 3, down to the time when her codicil was executed, the idea of Mrs. Fogg, plainly disclosed by the evidence, was to bequeath the shares or the avails of them to charitable corporations, which she finally did. That which was done by the testatrix during the night of December 19th and 20th, and during the day of the 20th, was preparatory to the execution of the completed codicil; and perhaps she was in hopes that, in case she died before the codicil was executed, her wishes would in some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>way be carried out. The codicil refers expressly to the shares as those transferred to Mr. Fosdick, and it names every person and corporation mentioned on Exhibits No. 3 and L, except St. John\u2019s Guild, which, for some reason, she omitted from the list of her beneficiaries. The interview between Mrs. Fogg and Mr. Fosdick on the morning of December 20th occupied about one half hour, in which time, according to the theory of the respondents, she completed the execution of a trust in favor of the 10 corporations mentioned on Exhibit No. 3, and during the same half hour executed a declaration of trust, dividing the avails of the shares, \u201cin sums of five thousand dollars each, to the various charity organizations of which a list is hereto annexed.\u201d Thus in the same half hour an attempt was made to establish two wholly inconsistent trusts. Trusts are not to be established by such evidence. The evidence, read in the light of the circumstances surrounding the transaction, does not support the conclusion that Mrs. Fogg intended absolutely to vest the title of the shares in Mr. Fosdick, as trustee, for the benefit of St. John\u2019s Guild and the other corporations mentioned in Exhibit No. 3. But assuming that, at the close of the interview between Mrs. Fogg and Mr. Fosdick on the morning of the 20th, she intended to vest him with the title of the shares, for the purpose of giving the proceeds to the. 10 corporations after her death, the judgment cannot be sustained. It is not asserted, and cannot be successfully maintained, that Mrs. Fogg intended this gift to take effect in her lifetime. Miss- Norton testified that, during the night of December 19th and 20th, Mrs. Fogg believed that she was about to die, and expressed the opinion that she would not live until morning. The witness testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">\"During that night she was apprehensive of dying before morning. That is what she said, and so expressed herself to me, although I personally did not think there was any immediate danger of her death. She did, however, express a danger of dying before morning. She was then in bed, and she remained continuously in bed until the time of her death, on the 3d of January, 1891. She had been in bed several days previously. Q. And she died during this same illness? A. Yes. Q. \"Without ever recovering? A. Yes. Q. Attended by both night and day nurses right along? A. Yes. Q. And continuously failing, to the end? A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\u201cSound policy requires that the laws regulating gifts causa mortis should not be extended, and that the range of such gifts should not be enlarged.\u201d Ridden v. Thrall, 125 N. Y. 572, 581, 26 N. E. 627. Such gifts are not favored by the courts. Delmotte v. Taylor, 1 Redf. Sur. 417; Bockwood v. Wiggin, 16 Gray, 402; Michener v. Dale, 23 Pa. St. 59; Hatch v. Atkinson, 56 Me. 326. The presumption is that a gift made during a last sickness is intended to take effect at the donor\u2019s death, even though it be not so declared. Pom. Eq. Jur. \u00a7 1146. If there was a gift, it was made in apprehension of death,\u2014a gift donatio causa mortis. Such a gift can be revoked by the donor in his lifetime. Merchant v. Merchant, 2 Bradf. Sur. 432, 444; Bloomer v. Bloomer, Id. 339, 347; Parker v. Marston, 27 Me. 196; Basket v. Hassell, 107 U. S. 602, 2 Sup. Ct 415; Pom. Eq. Jur. \u00a7 1146; 3 Redf. Wills (3d Ed.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>343; 2 Kent, Comm. 444. A revocation can be effected by a change of purpose, and undoing what has been done. Mrs. Fogg had burned the papers which were shown to Fosdick December 20th, and the copy (Exhibit No. 3) had been altered by writing the word \u201cNo\u201d against the words \u201cSt. John\u2019s Guild,\u201d which, under the circumstances, was as potent evidence of her intent to revoke the gift previously intended, or made to that corporation, as though the word \u201cRevoked\u201d had been written in the place of \u201cNo,\u201d or the exhibit burned. The stock certificate and the transfer indorsed thereon were then locked in her private box in the safe-deposit company, and were as effectually in her possession and under her control as they would have been had they l\u00e1in under her pillow. She declared in her codicil that the assignment of the shares to Mr. Fosdick was intended as a power to transfer them, and Fosdick testified that the codicil was read to him before it was executed, and that he assented to its terms. Under the evidence, we think, assuming that Mrs. Fogg intended on December 20th to make a gift to St. John\u2019s Guild of $10,000, by means of a trust to take effect after her death, that it was effectually revoked on December 21, elS90. It does not seem necessary to discuss the question whether a gift causa mortis may be made subject to a trust. Story, Eq. Jur. (13th Ed.) \u00a7 607. The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellants, to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b356-5\">VAN BRUNT, P.
