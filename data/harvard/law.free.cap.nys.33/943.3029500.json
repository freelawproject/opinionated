We may therefore properly vacate the order without prejudice to either party, and without costs to either party, so far as it is appealed from. The portions of the order of the special term of June 17, 1893, entered June 30, 1893, directing an amendment of the petition and schedules, so far as appealed from, vacated, without prejudice to either party, and without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
