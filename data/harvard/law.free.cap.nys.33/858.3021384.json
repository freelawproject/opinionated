Van Arsdale against George King. In April, 1894, defendant moved to vacate an order made on December 6, 1890, granting leave to sue on a judgment rendered in favor of plaintiff against defendant in November, 1880. The moving papers presented two objections to the order: First, that defendant, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>the preliminary order was made, on November 26, 1890, allowing service by mail of the notice of the application for leave to sue, was within the jurisdiction of the court, and could have been served personally with such notice; and, second, that the order permitted the service of notice to be made on or before the 28th of November, and the application to be made on the 6th of December,\u2014that is, permitted service by mail in less than 16 days. The motion was denied, and defendant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AAA\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b891-5\">Argued before BROWN, P.

But, aside from the delay, the motion was entirely destitute of merit. At most, there was only irregularity in the original motion for leave to sue. The merits are all with the plaintiff, and no injustice has been wrought. The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
