Morgan, deceased, and also for an accounting of the defendant Stephen G. Bogert, as sole surviving trustee of said trust. Said Richard J. Morgan, in and by his said will, gave and bequeathed to his executors one equal third part of his residuary estate in trust for the benefit of his mother, said Ann Augusta Linsiy, during her life, with remainder over to certain other parties. The following is the clause of the will creating such trust: \u201cEighth. The remaining one-third I give, devise, and bequeath to my executors in trust during the lifetime of my mother, now Ann Augusta Linsiy, to receive the interest, dividends, increase, profits, and income of the said one-third, and to pay over the said interest, dividends, increase, profits, and income to my said mother, or to apply the same to her sole and separate use during the period of her natural life; and, after her death, to distribute the said one-third to and among my issue surviving me, equally, per stirpes and not per capita, for their own use, respectively, absolutely and forever.\u201d On the 29th day of April, 1886, under and in compliance with a judgment of this court made in an action brought by said Ann Augusta Linsiy against the other parties in interest, one equal third part of said residuary estate was transferred by the said executors to themselves as trustees of said trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1008-7\">On the 7th day of February, 1887, this court, upon the petition of said Ann Augusta Linsiy, the life tenant, and of the said trustees, and upon due notice to all parties in interest, made an order at the foot of said judgment in the following words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1008-8\">\u201cAt a Special Term of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Held at the County Court House, in the City of New York, on the 7th Day of February, 1887.

Upon the sale by them of any such bond, the whole amount received by them for the principal of said bond or for interest accruing subsequent to the death of Ann Augusta Linsly shall be by them held, invested, and accounted for as a part of the principal of the trust estate for the benefit of the reversioners; and, in addition thereto, such part, if any, of the interest upon such bond, theretofore _by them received and deposited as a reserve or sinking fund as aforesaid, as may be necessary to make the proceeds of such bond equal to the value thereof as stated in the aforesaid report of George Putnam Smith, dated December 15, 1887, to wit, the sum of twelve hundred dollars (\u00a71,200), and except as needed for said last-mentioned purpose, all of such reserved interest in respect to any such bond so sold shall upon such sale be by them paid and delivered to the said Ann Augusta Linsly or her personal representatives as part of the income of such trust estate during the lifetime of the said Ann Augusta Linsly. The amount to be so retained as a reserve or sinking fund as aforesaid shall on account of each of said one hundred and seventeen bonds of Morgan\u2019s Louisiana and Texas Railroad and Steamship Company be two-sevenths of the interest received upon each such bond; the indicated sinking fund on account of such bond so held to be maintained by said trustees from and after the first receipt of interest after the entry of this judgment decree, and for as long as they shall continue to retain such bonds. But nothing herein contained shall be construed as an interference with or a limitation of the right of the said trustees at any time to sell any one or all of said bonds in the exercise of their sound discretion for a reinvestment of the proceeds of such sale or sales in accordance with the practice of this court and the laws of the state of New York. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1011-6\">\u201cIt is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the order made herein at the foot of the judgment, dated the 29th day of April, 1886, as amended May 1, 1886, which said order is dated February 7, 1887, and was filed February 8, 1887, be, and the same hereby is, amended by striking out from the tenth iine on the fourth page of said order the words \u2018sixth paragraph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>of,\u2019 and inserting in lieu thereof the words \u2018tenth finding of the report of John Clinton Gray, referee, dated April 22, 1886, as confirmed by\u2019; and the clerk is hereby directed to correct the said order on file in accordance herewith!\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1012-5\">Under and in pursuance of these orders, the trustees continued to hold the bonds in question as part of the trust estate, and to withhold from the life tenant the prescribed portion of the income therefrom for the sinking fund. This sinking fund now amounts to the sum of $42,969.83. Recently these bonds, with certain other securities belonging to said trust estate, have been sold, realizing altogether the sum of $36,427.68 in excess of the value at which they were taken into the trust. The life tenant now asks that she receive the amount of said sinking fund, and it is not disputed that she is entitled thereto. As all the securities in question have been sold at an advance, there can, of course, be no further need of a sinking fund to protect against loss. The amount was deducted and withheld from the income to which the life tenant was entitled, and should now be paid over to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1012-6\">The life tenant also claims that she is entitled to the profit of $36,427.68, so received on the sale of said securities as \u201cprofits\u201d or \u201cincrease\u201d of the trust estate payable to her by the terms of the will. We have seen by the will she is given \u201cthe interest, dividends, increase, profits, and income\u201d of the fund, and stress is laid by her upon the use of the words \u201cincrease\u201d and \u201cprofits\u201d as supporting her contention. It is clear that she has no right to the sum in question either as \u201cinterest,\u201d \u201cdividends,\u201d or \u201cincome.\u201d In the American and English Encyclopedia of Law the general rule is stated to be that \u201can appreciation in value of the property bequeathed constitutes capital, and goes to the remainder-man.\u201d In Abbott\u2019s New York Digest (volume 10, p. 770) we find the following language upon this subject: \u201cThe current of authority is that as to the relative rights of life tenant and remainder-man the courts will treat anything in the nature of premium o\u00edan appreciation in, value of the capital of a trust fund as capital, and anything that is interest, income, or proceeds, no matter how extraordinary or unusual it may be, as belonging to the life tenant.\u201d See, also, 2 Perry, Trusts, \u00a7\u00a7 544, 545; Scovel v. Roosevelt, 5 Redf. Sur. 121; Gragg v. Riggs, Id. 82; Clarkson v. Clarkson, 18 Barb. 646.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1012-7\">It is conceded, indeed, by the life tenant, that in the absence of the words \u201cincrease\u201d or \u201cprofits\u201d her position would be untenable; and the court of appeals has so held in Re Gerry, 103 N. Y. 445. 9 N. E. 233. In that case the will of G. gave to his executors the sum of $70,000, in trust to invest the same in certain specified securities, to pay the annual interest, in\u2019come, and dividends thereof to I. during her life, and upon her death to divide \u201cthe principal or capital sum aforesaid\u201d among certain remainder-men. With the consent of all parties interested, a portion of the fund was invested in securities other than those named, but all drawing a fixed rate of interest, payable annually, A sale of the securities after the death of the life tenant resulted in a surplus over the amount of the original investment. Upon a settlement of the accounts of the trustees, it was held that the surplus was an accretion of the principal of the fund, and the remainder-men were entitled thereto. It remains, therefore, to consider what meaning or value is to be given to the words \u201cincrease\u201d and \u201cprofits,\u201d .upon which this life tenant relies. It is evident that the two words as used by this testator must be treated as entirely synonymous. No intelligible distinction between them in such a case seems ever to have been made by the courts, and presumably none can be made. It is difficult to conceive of an increase during any given time without a profit within the same period, and equally difficult to conceive of a profit without an increase under like circumstances. To attempt to discriminate would involve a discussion too abstruse and metaphysical for a court of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1012-8\">In regard to the precise force or weight of the words in question as found in this will there have been but comparatively few adjudications. In Re Clark, 62 Hun, 275, 17 N. Y. Supp. 93, a testator had given his wife \u201cthe income of all my other estate, both real and personal,\u201d and also \u201cthe profits of all my other estate, both real and personal.\u201d He also gave to his wife \u201cthe income and profits\u201d of a separate fund. The general term of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>court, in its opinion, makes use of the following language: \u201cThis use of the words \u2018income and profits\u2019 is only due to the lawyer-like fondness for using several words where one is sufficient. If the executors had not sold the real estate, and if the real estate had increased in value during the widow\u2019s life, she would not have been entitled to the increase. So with personal property. This question is carefully discussed and fully settled in lie Gerry. We think that the use of the word \u2018profits\u2019 in these items of the will has no additional meaning to the words construed in that case.\u201d In the case of Gross v. Trust Co., 75 Hun, 533, 27 N. Y. Supp. 495, the court, in considering the meaning of the words \u201crents, income, issues, and profits\u201d in connection with the claim of a life tenant to a large sum received by way of premium upon a sale of securities, said: \u201cThe fund in question represents the increase in value of the securities, and is therefore not profit in the ordinary acceptation of that term. It is an accretion or increase from natural causes. Profit is acquisition of gain above expenditures arising from some transaction or operation. Under this will there was to be no traffic or operations, but only an investment of the fund.\u201d In Hooper v. Rossiter, 1 McOlel. 527, where a life tenant was given \u201cthe interest, dividends, profits, and proceeds\u201d of certain bank stock, and where a claim was made' by the life tenant to stock dividends as representing dividends or profits, we find the following words in the decision of the court: \u201cWhether the testator makes use of the expression \u2018dividends\u2019 or \u2018dividends and profits\u2019 or \u2018dividends, interest, and profits,\u2019 or, as in this case, \u2018interest, dividends, profits, and proceeds,\u2019 I look upon all of them to come to the same thing, and that this is too nice a circumstance to found any distinction on. That disposes of the claim of the plaintiffs as tenants for life.\u201d In the case of Duelos v. Benner the will contains a direction to the executors in the following words: \u201cTo set apart or invest the sum of $30,000, or one-third of the appraised value of my personal estate, as my said wife may elect in writing, and pay over the income, interest, profits, and earnings therefrom to my said wife, half yearly as long as she shall live.\u201d The executors, having invested the sum of $40,000 in United States government bonds, realized a considerable profit thereon, and the life tenant, on the theory that she had elected that $30,000 of the sum so invested sho,uld constitute the trust fund so provided for her benefit, claimed that by the terms ol\u2019 the will she was entitled to the profit made thereon. The opinion of the court at special term was directly in her favor upon this point (5 N. Y. Supp. 733); but, for other reasons, the decision and judgment subsequently rendered were wholly adverse to her claim. On appeal to the general term, the judgment below was affirmed, with a modification in respect to the distribution of the profit in question among certain other parties. This court, in its opinion, discusses at length the meaning of the word \u201cprofits,\u201d holding substantially that as used in the will in question it means nothing more than income. 62 Hun, 428, 17 N. Y. Supp. 168. On further appeal to the court of appeals, that tribunal reversed the judgment of the'general term, and affirmed that of the special term. The reasons for such reversal, however, had no relation to the construction so placed by the general term upon the word \u201cprofits\u201d; and the court expressly refused to consider that point, saying that it was unnecessary under the circumstances. 136 N. Y. 560, 32 N. E. 1002. The decision of the general term in this case, therefore, although reversed upon other grounds, still remains as an expression of the unanimous opinion of the members of that body upon the very point now in dispute, and is entitled to great weight.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1013-6\">In the creation of life estates or trusts in real property, it has always been usual to use the words \u201crents,\u201d \u201cissues,\u201d and \u201cprofits\u201d as synonymous with \u201cincome.\u201d Why should a different rule obtain in relation- to personalty? The principle is well established that in construing a will the intentions of the testator should be ascertained by a consideration of its provisions, and, if possible, carried into effect. In re Gerry, supra. There is certainly nothing in the will in question to indicate that the testator wished the trustees to deal in securities for the benefit of the life tenant. Such an idea probably never even occurred to him. The words \u201cincrease\u201d and \u201cprofits\u201d were doubtless added to \u201cinterest,\u201d \u201cdividends,\u201d and \u201cincome\u201d in the preparation of the instrument through the habit of redundant expres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>sion peculiar to the legal profession, and without intention or thought on the part of lawyer or client of expressing more than is meant by the word \u201cincome.\u201d If the position of the life tenant in this matter be correct, then, whenever the trustees realize an advance in the securities in which the fund is invested, such advance will be immediately payable to her as \u201cprofits\u201d; while, in the event of a decline, the loss will fall upon the estate. By a series of such transactions, the entire fund might be dissipated,\u2014a result which the testator could hardly have contemplated. Moreover, the life tenant is still living, and it is apparent that, even if by the terms of the will she were entitled to the net increase realized on the principal of the fund, it could not accrue to her or her estate until the expiration of her life tenancy, as before that time it would be manifestly impossible to ascertain the amount of such increase or even the existence of any. The present transactions, it is true, show a gain, but the next investments may be unfortunate, and involve a loss. To pay all gains as realized immediately to the life tenant, and to charge all losses to the corpus of the fund, would certainly be a novel process, to say the least. Again, an examination of the orders of the 7th day of February, 1887, and the 23d day of December, 1887, hereinabove mentioned, shows that with respect to the securities specified and included therein, respectively, they are an absolute estoppel and bar to the claim of this life tenant. It appears by the petitions of the life tenant herself upon which the orders were granted that the latter were made for the express purpose of enabling her to obtain a larger income. For that special purpose the trustees were permitted to hold the securities in question, which were not such as are authorized by law for investments of trust funds. To provide against possible loss by depreciation, a sinking fund was established from the income otherwise payable to the life tenant; and it was further provided that, \u201cupon the sale by them [the trustees] of any of said bonds, the whole amount received of the principal of such bonds or for interest accruing subsequent to the death of the said Ann Augusta Linsly shall be by them held invested and accounted for as part of the principal of the trust estate for the benefit of the reversioners.\u201d At the end of each of the orders the following additional words appear: \u201cNothing herein contained shall be construed as an interference with or limitation of the right of the said trustees at any time to sell any one or all of said securities, in the exercise of their sound discretion, for reinvestment of the proceeds of such sale or sales in accordance with the practice of this court and the laws of the state of New York.\u201d Language could hardly be clearer or meaning plainer. The proceeds of any sale or sales of the securities were to be invested and accounted for as part of the principal of the trust estate, as a condition upon which the petitions of the life tenant were granted and the securities permitted to be held for her benefit. She certainly cannot now dispute the validity and binding force of the orders, nor question their obvious meaning.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1014-5\">I am therefore of the opinion that the words \u201cincrease\u201d and \u201cprofits,\u201d as used in this will, mean simply \u201cincome,\u201d and that the life tenant is entitled to no more than the income of this trust estate; also, that, if she were entitled to any proceeds of the trust estate other than income, such proceeds would not be payable until the termination of the life estate; also, that even if, under the will, she were entitled to more than the income in question, the orders so made on the 7th day of February, 1887, and the 23d day of December, 1887, respectively, would be a complete bar to her present claim to the advance realized on the sale of the securities included in said orders, or either of them; also, that the entire advance realized on the sale of securities belonging to said trust estate constitutes an accretion to the principal of said estate, and should be held and invested as a part thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1014-6\">Objection is made to the claim of the plaintiff, Wilford Linsly, as executor, etc., of John H. Linsly, the deceased trustee, to commissions for receiving the principal of this trust estate, upon the ground that, prior to his death, said John H. Linsly had commenced this action for leave to account and resign the trust. It is true that by a voluntary resignation a trustee surrenders his absolute right to commissions upon principal. His claim then rests upon the sound discretion of the court. In re Allen, 29 Hun, 9, affirmed 96 N. Y. 327; In re Hayden, 54 Hun, 204, 7 N. Y. Supp. 313, af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>firmed 125 N. Y. 776, 27 N. E. 409. But this trustee did not, as matter of fact, obtain the leave to resign which he sought, but died during the pendency of the action, which has since been continued by his executor. The trustee died in office, and the commencement of the action by him before his death, therefore, amounts to nothing more than an expression of his wish to resign at that time, and cannot operate to deprive his representative of the commissions earned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1015-5\">Objection is also made to the claim of the plaintiff as executor of the will of the deceased trustee to commissions \u00f3n securities received from the executors and not converted into cash until after the death of the trustee in question. This objection is based upon a decision of the court of appeals in the ease of McAlpine v. Potter, 126 N. Y. 285, 27 N. E. 475, holding that where trustees have not in fact converted into money securities forming part of the capital of the trust estate, nor delivered the same as cash to the beneficiaries, they cannot be allowed to credit themselves with or receive commissions for receiving such part of the principal of the trust estate. After a careful examination, I am unable to distinguish that case from the one now under consideration. In the present action, certain of the securities received from the executors had not been sold by the trustees at the death of Mr. Linsly, nor had any part of the same been paid over to the remainder-men. It is true that, in and by the orders hereinabove cited, a valuation had been placed upon said securities, but such valuation was merely for the purpose of fixing and establishing a proper sinking or indemnity fund, and had no other significance whatsoever. The decision referred to must therefore be deemed controlling in this case, although at variance with the rule, as previously understood in regard to the matter in question.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1015-6\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALX\">We might very well rest our decision in affirming the judgment appealed from upon the exceedingly satisfactory opinion written by the learned referee upon the decision of the question involved before him. It may be well, however, to revert to one or two points in addition to those which have been considered by the referee. If the tenant for life, as matter of right, is entitled, as is claimed by the appellant, to the increase resulting from the rise in price of the securities in which the trust fund was invested, then it would seem to be a right existing in the life tenant, at any time when such premiums existed, to compel a sale of the security in which such trust fund was invested, in order that she might realize such increase. It is apparent that no such right exists in the life tenant. Such a power would enable the life tenant to compel the trustees to speculate in securities, and change investment at her pleasure, and thus deprive the trustees of the ordinary powers which are supposed to be invested in them. It has been well observed by the referee in his opinion that, even if, by the terms of the will, the life tenant was entitled to the increase realized on the principal of the fund, it could not accrue to her or her estate until the expiration of her life tenancy, as before that time it would be manifestly impossible to ascertain the amount of such increase, or even the existence of any. The present transactions may show a gain, but the next investment may be unfortunate, and involve a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>loss. It is manifest that it was not the intention of the testator that all gains, when realized, should belong immediately, to the life tenant, and that all losses should be charged to the corpus of the fund. It is apparent that the testator intended the provisions of the will under consideration for the benefit of a tenant for life, to be enjoyed during such life, and not for the benefit of the personal representatives of a person who has been a tenant, but whose term must be ended by death, before the question of whether there is an increase or not can be determined. We think, therefore, that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
