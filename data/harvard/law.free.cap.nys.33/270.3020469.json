However, the averment of the cause of action is upon information and belief, and does not specifically state the source of the same, \" but does state on information and belief that one Haines, the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, performed personal services as salesman during the year 1893 for defendant, as its request, and at an agreed annual salary of $1,200, of which no part had been paid except $600; but the allegation that Haines thereafter, and before the commencement of this action, assigned to plaintiff said cause of action, and the money \u25a0due to him from defendant for \u201csaid services,\u201d is upon knowledge, and the legal inference is that plaintiff\u2019s source of information and belief as to the cause of action is Haines, speaking by the assignment itself; and, if written, it is a solemn declaration, over his own signature, that he had performed such personal services for such term, at such salary, of which $600 is unpaid, for defendant, at its request; and, if oral, the same declaration must have, been made by him to plaintiff, who avers upon knowledge the assignment \u25a0of the cause of action, and the money due from defendant for said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>services. And so, too, the legal inference is that Haines had personal knowledge of this cause of action for his personal services performed by him as salesman for defendant, because the services of a salesman can only be performed by him in person, and not by him acting through another. Order affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
