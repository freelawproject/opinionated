The court found these averments of the complaint to be true. It is doubtful if the evidence supports the finding that plaintiff sold the materials to Stebbins \u2014 the evidence being strongly to the point that they were sold to \u25a0a company called \u201cThe Electric Construction Company.\u201d But waiving that point, it is clear that there was no sufficient evidence to support the finding that the materials were sold \u201c to be used in the construction of said telephone line,\u201d The only evidence upon the subject is to be found in the testimony of the witness Sime, a salesman in the employ of respondent, and who testified: \u201cI can\u2019t tell where the goods were to be used; I don\u2019t know.\u201d He also testified that the goods were of the kind that are used \u201cfor the construction of a telegraph line\u201d; and upon further question said that they would answer for either a telegraph or telephone line. But he nowhere testified that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>were sold for the purpose of being used in the construction of the particular telephone line against which the lien is sought to be enforced. In order to enforce the lien of a material man against a building or structure, \u201cthe materials must not only have been used in the construction of the building, but they must have been, by the express terms of the contract, furnished for the particular building on which the lien is claimed. <em>(Bottomly </em>v. <em>Rector of Grace Church, </em>2 Cal. <em>92; Houghton </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>5 Cal. 240; <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Richet, </em>56 Cal. 307; 38 Am.
