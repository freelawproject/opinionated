Rep. 145; Browne on Statute of Frauds, sec. 156.) Even if the payment of premiums by John Sullivan constituted a lien upon the policy, still the debt having become barred by limitation, the lien was extinguished. (Civ. Code, sec. 2911.) Neither could it be held as a pledge for the premiums paid, as the statute of limitations extinguished any pledge. (4 Lawson\u2019s Rights, Remedies, and Practice,- p. 3043.) The agreement for payment, having been given as an inducement to the.executor to find the policy and deliver it, was void for lack of consideration, as it was the duty of the executor to find and deliver it up. (5 Lawson\u2019s Rights, Remedies, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Practice, sec. 2250. See also <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Neilson, 2 </em>Cowen, 139; 14 Am. Dec. 431; <em>Ellison </em>v. <em>Jackson W. Co., </em>12 Cal. 542.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b224-5\"><em>Frank J. Sullivan, </em>in <em>pro per., </em>and <em>E. P. Cole, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-6\">There was a valid consideration for the agreement. It is well settled that a debt barred by the statute of limitations, or by operation of law not affecting the right, is a sufficient consideration for a new promise to pay it. <em>(Mills </em>v. <em>Wyman, </em>3 Pick. 208; 5 Lawson\u2019s Rights, Remedies, and Practice, sec. 2249; <em>Feeny </em>v. <em>Daly, </em>8 Cal. 84; <em>Chabot </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>39 Cal. 437; <em>Mull </em>v. <em>Van Trees, </em>50 Cal. 547; 1 Wait\u2019s Actions and Defenses, sec. 17, p. 109; 8 Wait\u2019s Actions and Defenses, sec. 19, pp. 109, 513; <em>Rosenberg </em>v.. <em>Ford, </em>85 Cal. 610.) A moral obligation alone is sufficient. (Civ. Code, secs. 1605, 1606.) The effort of the executor to find the policy was one which he was not legally bound to make. <em>(Trundle </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>17 Mon. B. 396.) The executor had a lien on the policy for the balance due, and he had a right as such executor to retain it as a pledge until the same was paid. (Civ. Code, secs. 2896, 2987.) Even if the remedy for foreclosure of the lieu is barred by the statute of limitations, still, as no payment or tender of payment was made, the statute did not extinguish the debt. (Civ. Code, sec. 2913; Jones on Pledges, sec. 528, p. 443; sec. 570, p. 436; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>30 Barb. 173; Rev. Civ.

Sullivan, executor, an order on said Hew York Life Insurance Company (A. (x.

Eo such fact is recited in the agreement; and there is no other evidence touching the question, except the testimony of the plaintiff, as follows: \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Q,. \u201cWhat was the indebtedness that you found Margaret Sullivan to owe?\u201d A. \u201cI cannot recall now the facts at all; as I take it, Margaret Sullivan was not the party at all. It was Michael Sullivan whose receipts were shown by her son; and I didn\u2019t know .... that Michael Sullivan had paid John Sullivan anything until this young gentleman showed me the receipts which I recognized to be in my father\u2019s handwriting, and we struck a balance; that is, there was a certain amount of indebtedness that I claimed to be due from Michael Sullivan, and I showed him the receipt for money paid by John Sullivan, and then he showed me receipts for money which had been paid by Michael Sullivan to John Sullivan, and the difference between the receipts is what was stated in this memorandum of agreement.....This statement of account was a matter of indebtedness between Michael Sullivan and John Sullivan prior to the death of John Sullivan. The estate of John Sullivan had paid nothing to Mrs. Margaret Sullivan as far as I know. John Sullivan in his lifetime never paid anything for Mrs. Margaret Sullivan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">This seems conclusive that the debt, if any debt there was which the defendant agreed to pay, was a debt of her husband, Michael Sullivan, and not her debt. Nor is there anything in the complaint, findings of fact, or the evidence, to warrant the legal conclusion that the estate of John Sullivan ever had a lien of any kind on the policy of insurance. The plaintiff testified: \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about the circumstances under which John; came into possession of that policy.....It had never been assigned to John Sullivan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">No copy of the policy is contained in the record; but it was admitted by both parties that it \u201ccontained the name of Margaret Sullivan as beneficiary.\u201d Nor does it appear when Michael Sullivan died; but it may fairly be inferred that he died in the latter part of the year 1889.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">If Michael Sullivan was indebted to John Sullivan for money advanced or paid in the lifetime of the latter, the debt was barred by the statute of limitations long before the execution of the agreement upon which this action is founded.; and conceding that this agreement contains a promise.of the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>to pay that debt, the remaining question is, Was there any con- , sideration for the promise ?</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">The plaintiff testified that \u201cthe consideration of this agreement is expressed - in the agreement; the agreement expresses the consideration, and there were no other considerations than those expressed in the agreement\u201d; yet, in ihis brief, he Contends that there was \u201ca moral obligation founded upon an antecedent valuable consideration,\u201d which constituted .a good consideration for the agreement, though no such moral obligation founded upon an antecedent valuable consideration is expressed in the agreement. Nor did the court find, or the evidence tend to prove, any antecedent valuable or good consideration for the agreement. The defendant was under no kind of obligation to pay a debt of her deceased husband for which she had never before been liable, either as principal or surety, even though such debt had not been barred by the statute of limitations (Wharton on Contracts, secs. 494, 512\u2014514; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>7 Conn. 57; 18 Am. Dec. 79); surely not after the debt had been barred <em>(Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>85 Cal. 610); and this is all that need be decided in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The only consideration expressed in the agreement, other than the alleged moral obligation, is plaintiff\u2019s promise to look for, find and surrender the policy. This it was his duty to do, on demand of defendant, without compensation. After the .maturity of the policy by the death of her husband, if not before, the defendant was entitled to the possession of it, unless the plaintiff, in his character of executor, had a lien on it, Whether the finding of the policy among the papers of the estate required \"more or less labor must have depended upon the degree of care or negligence with which the plaintiff had kepi it, for which the defendant was not responsible; but it does not appear why a search of more than ten minutes was necessary to find it. It is well settled that neither a promise to perform a duty, nor the performance of a duty, constitutes a consideration of a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">. I think the judgment and order should be reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Temple, C., and Belcher, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>For the'reasons given in ths foregoing opinion, the judgment and order are reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">McFarland, J., De Haven, J., Fitzgerald, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
