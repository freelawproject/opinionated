Treaty Doc. No. 100-20, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.17(a) (2017).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>In re Kennard Garvin Harbin, </em>No. A035 168 080 (B.I.A. Apr. 24, 2014), <em>aff'g </em>No. A035 168 080 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 31, 2013). On appeal, Harbin argues that the agency erred when it (1) barred Harbin\u2019s applications for cancellation and asylum on the grounds that his conviction under N.Y. Penal Law (\u201cNYPL\u201d) \u00a7 220.31 constituted a drug-trafficking aggravated felony, and when it (2) upheld the I J\u2019s denial of Harbin\u2019s applications for withholding and CAT relief by misconstruing Harbin\u2019s particular social group, ignoring relevant evidence, and violating his right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">We hold that NYPL \u00a7 220.31 defines a single crime and is therefore an \u201cindivisible\u201d statute. Accordingly, the agency should have applied the so-called \u201ccategorical approach,\u201d which looks to the statutory definition of the offense of conviction, rather than the particulars of an individual\u2019s behavior, to determine whether a prior conviction constitutes an aggravated felony. <em>See Mellouli v. Lynch, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 1980, 1986, 192 L.Ed.2d 60 (2015). Now applying the categorical approach, we conclude that Harbin\u2019s conviction under the NYPL \u00a7 220.31 did not constitute a commission of an aggravated felony. Harbin\u2019s \u00a7 220.31 conviction therefore did not bar him from seeking cancellation of removal and asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">We lack jurisdiction to consider the remainder of Harbin\u2019s petition. Accordingly, we GRANT the petition in part; we VACATE the agency\u2019s rulings as to Harbin\u2019s ineligibility for asylum and cancellation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>removal; and we REMAND this matter for proceedings consistent with this opinion. The petition is DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction as to Harbin\u2019s applications for withholding of removal and CAT relief. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Harbin, a 54-year-old native and citizen of Grenada, arrived in the United States in 1978 as a lawful permanent resident. He has accumulated a number of criminal convictions, including a 1991 felony conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree under NYPL \u00a7 220.31. According to Harbin\u2019s certificate of disposition from his \u00a7 220.31 conviction, the controlled substance in question was cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">In January of 2012, Harbin was taken into custody after a conviction for disorderly conduct. Shortly thereafter, he was charged as removable for having been convicted of multiple crimes involving moral turpitude under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> During 2013, in proceedings before an IJ, he applied for cancellation of removal, asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">In his 2013 submissions to the IJ, Harbin claimed to be a member of a particular social group\u2014one made up of mentally-ill criminal deportees to Grenada with no support system in the country. At the merits hearing before the -IJ in 2013, he testified that he suffers from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. He further asserted that he feared returning to Grenada because he could become homeless and imprisoned, he had no family or money there, and he would have no access to required medications. In support of his petition, Harbin submitted documentary evidence about Grenada\u2019s inadequate mental health services and an expert report on his mental illness. Harbin\u2019s brother and a clinical psychologist also testified on his behalf. On October 31, 2013, the IJ issued an oral decision on the record denying relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">First, the IJ ruled that Harbin\u2019s NYPL \u00a7 220.31 conviction of 1991 was an aggravated felony that barred him from receiving cancellation of removal or asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3) (cancellation); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii) (asylum).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">Second, regarding Harbin\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and relief under CAT, the IJ acknowledged that \u201cthe outlook\u201d for Harbin \u201cif he is not able to continue getting mental health services is not one that is filled with a great deal of hope.\u201d Certified Administrative Record (\u201cCAR\u201d) 109. She nevertheless ruled that Harbin failed to submit evidence of \u201cany deliberate intention to harm someone in [his] situation by any group within Grenada.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> CAR 110. On this basis, the IJ de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>nied withholding of removal and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">On April 24, 2014, the BIA dismissed Harbin\u2019s appeal. It agreed that Harbin\u2019s NYPL \u00a7 220.31 conviction of 1991 was an aggravated felony and upheld the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum and cancellation of removal on that ground. It further upheld the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and CAT relief on the ground that Harbin failed to demonstrate that it was more likely than not that he would be persecuted or tortured in Grenada. Harbin now petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Under the circumstances of this case, we should consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Wangchuck v. Dep\u2019t Homeland Sec., </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir. 2006). \u201cWe review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u2018conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 165 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)). For a final order of removal against an alien who is removable for having certain criminal convictions, our jurisdiction is limited to review of constitutional claims or questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (2)(D). \u201cOur consideration of questions of law and the application of law to undisputed facts is <em>de novo.\u201d Vasconcelos v. Lynch, </em>841 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">On appeal to this Court, Harbin makes two main arguments. First, he argues that NYPL \u00a7 220.31 is an indivisible statute defining one crime, and thus requires the application of the so-called categorical approach to determine whether a \u00a7 220.31 conviction is an aggravated felony under the Immigration and Nationality Act (the \u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 <em>et seq. </em>Since New York\u2019s schedule of controlled substances is broader than the federal schedules, Harbin argues that, under the categorical approach, NYPL \u00a7 220.31 is not an aggravated felony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, Harbin contends that he is entitled to a new hearing on his application for withholding of removal and CAT protection because the BIA improperly bifurcated his social group into two categories,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> ignored evidence concerning Grenada\u2019s ability to treat mental illness, and violated his right to due process. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">I. NYPL \u00a7 220.31 Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">A petitioner convicted of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d is ineligible for cancellation of removal, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3), and asylum, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii), (B)(i). Under INA, the list of \u201caggravated felon[ies]\u201d includes a drug-trafficking offense involving a \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d listed on controlled substance schedules of the Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). Harbin argues that his conviction for fifth-degree criminal sale of a controlled substance under NYPL \u00a7 220.31 is not an aggravated felony, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>he therefore remains eligible for cancellation of removal and asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">A. Divisibility of NYPL \u00a7 220.31</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">To determine whether a NYPL \u00a7 220.31 conviction is an aggravated felony, we must first ask whether NYPL \u00a7 220.31 is a divisible or an indivisible statute. A divisible statute is one that lists elements in the alternative, and, in doing so, creates a separate crime associated with each alternative element. <em>Mathis v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 2243, 2249, 195 L.Ed.2d 604 (2016). On the other hand, an indivisible statute creates only a single crime, but it may \u201cspell[ ] out various factual ways,\u201d or \u201cmeans,\u201d \u201cof committing some component of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The jury need not agree on the particular means by which the defendant committed the crime to convict a defendant under such a statute. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Mathis v. United States </em>provided an example of a statute with alternative means of commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">[S]uppose a statute requires use of a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d as an element of a crime and further provides that the use of a \u201cknife, gun, bat, or similar weapon\u201d would all qualify. Because that kind of list merely specifies diverse means of satisfying a single element of a single crime ... a jury need not find (or a defendant admit) any particular item: A jury could convict even if some jurors concluded that the defendant used a knife while others concluded he used a gun, so long as all agreed that the defendant used a \u201cdeadly weapon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-9\"><em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotation marks omitted). In sum, a statute creating alternative elements, and thus separate crimes, is divisible, but a statute providing alternative means of committing a single crime is indivisible.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">If a statute is indivisible, we apply the categorical approach to determine whether it is an aggravated felony. The categorical approach is an element-based analysis, and does not take into account the particular facts underlying a conviction. <em>Moncrieffe, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1684. Instead, we look to \u201cwhether the state statute defining the crime of conviction categorically fits within the generic federal definition of a corresponding aggravated felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). A state offense categorically matches with a generic federal definition of a corresponding aggravated felony \u201conly if a conviction of the state offense necessarily involved facts equating to the generic federal offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks, ellipsis, and alterations omitted). In conducting this analysis, \u201cthe adjudicator must presume that the conviction rested upon nothing more than the least of the acts criminalized\u201d under the state statute. <em>Mellouli, </em>135 S.Ct. at 1986 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">For divisible statutes, we instead apply the modified categorical approach. That approach permits consideration of certain materials that reveal which of a statute\u2019s separate offenses served as the basis for the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>See Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2283-84, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-14\">1. Text of the Statute</p>\n<p id=\"ADC\">To determine whether NYPL \u00a7 220.31 is divisible or indivisible, we begin with the statute\u2019s text. The entirety of NYPL \u00a7 220.31 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-15\">A person is guilty of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree when he knowingly and unlawfully sells a controlled substance. Criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree is a class D felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>The face of the statute thus gives only one set of four elements: the defendant must (1) knowingly and (2) unlawfully (3) sell (4) a controlled substance. The statutory scheme goes on to define a \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">any substance listed in schedule I, II, III, IV or V of section thirty-three hundred six of the public health law other than marihuana, but including concentrated cannabis as defined in paragraph (a) of subdivision four of section thirty-three hundred two of such law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">NYPL \u00a7 220.00(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">NYPL \u00a7 220.31\u2019s text suggests that it creates only a single crime, but provides a number of different factual means by which that crime may be committed. The statute criminalizes sale of a \u201ccontrolled substance.\u201d Although it incorporates state schedules to clarify which substances are \u201ccontrolled,\u201d it provides no indication that the sale of each substance is a distinct offense. Moreover, the text does not suggest that a jury must agree on the particular substance sold. If some jurors believed that a defendant had sold cocaine, and others believed that he had sold heroin, they could still agree that he had sold \u201ca controlled substance,\u201d and issue a guilty verdict. In this way, the statute is similar to the hypothetical statute discussed in <em>Mathis, </em>which allowed a jury to convict \u201ceven if some jurors concluded that the defendant used a knife while others concluded he used a gun, so long as all agreed that the defendant used a \u2018deadly weapon.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>136 S.Ct. at 2249.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">Our reading of the plain text of the statute is consistent with the law\u2019s penalty provisions, which prescribe the same narrow range of penalties for violations of NYPL \u00a7 220.31 no matter which controlled substance a defendant has sold. <em>See </em>NYPL \u00a7 220.31 (\u201cCriminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree is a class D felony.\u201d); NYPL \u00a7 70.70(2)(a)(iii) (providing sentence for class D felonies of one to two and one-half years); (3)(b)(iii) (providing sentence for class D felonies of one and one-half years to four years, where defendant is a second felony drug offender); (4)(b)(iii) (providing sentence of two and one-half years to four and one-half years, where defendant is a second felony drug offender previously convicted of a violent felony). As the Supreme Court observed in <em>Mathis, </em>\u201cif statutory alternatives carry different punishments ... they must be elements.\u201d 136 S.Ct. at 2256. The fact that NYPL \u00a7 220.31 carries the same penalties for each violation is therefore in line with our reading of \u00a7 220.31: that each controlled substance is a mere \u201cmeans\u201d of violating the statute, not a separate alternative element.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>The government argues that NYPL \u00a7 220.31 is a divisible statute because, by incorporating controlled substances by reference to New York\u2019s Public Health Law, \u00a7 220.31 \u201clist[s] potential offense elements in the alternative.\u201d <em>Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2283. For its position, the government relies primarily on <em>Coronado v. Holder, </em>759 F.3d 977, 984-85 (9th Cir. 2014) (finding a California drug statute criminalizing the possession of controlled substances, identified by reference to statutory drug schedules, to be divisible) and <em>United States v. Gomez-Alvarez, </em>781 F.3d 787, 792 (5th Cir. 2015) (finding that a California statute that criminalized \u201c[p]ossession or purchase for sale of designated controlled substances\u201d listed in separate schedules was divisible). Both <em>Coronado </em>and <em>Gomez-Alvarez, </em>however, arose under California law, and are therefore inapposite to our analysis of New York law. As discussed below, New York law supports our conclusion that \u00a7 220.31 is indivisible.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">2. State Court Decisions</p>\n<p id=\"Aq\">The government argues that New York\u2019s state court decisions show \u00a7 220.31 to be divisible, but its cited authorities do not support that conclusion. The government first cites cases stating that, when a defendant is charged with selling controlled substances, prosecutors must describe the particular substances in question so that defendants (1) are on notice of charges, and (2) are not. at risk of being later retried for the same incident. <em>See People v. Kalin, </em>12 N.Y.3d 225, 230-32, 878 N.Y.S.2d 653, 906 N.E.2d 381 (2009); <em>People v. Crisofulli, </em>91 Misc.2d 424, 398 N.Y.S.2d 120, 121 (N.Y. Crim. Ct. 1977). But the values of fair notice and avoidance of double jeopardy often demand that the government specify accusations in ways unrelated to a crime\u2019s elements. For example, when bringing charges for crimes with clear victims, the government often must tell a defendant the identity of an alleged crime\u2019s victim, or at least the time and place where the crime allegedly happened. <em>See People v. Sanchez, </em>84 N.Y.2d 440, 446, 618 N.Y.S.2d 887, 643 N.E.2d 509 (1994) (\u201cAlthough there is no per se rule that requires an indictment to name the victim for each count alleged, the indictment and bill of particulars must provide sufficient alternative information identifying the charged crime to satisfy statutory and constitutional requirements. Here, ... [the] indictment ... not only left victims unnamed but provided no definiteness as to the dates, times, or places of the charged criminal activity.\u201d (citations omitted)). The government may thus be required to say not simply that the defendant committed murder, but (for example) that the defendant murdered John Smith. That does not mean, however, that \u201cmurder of John Smith\u201d has a distinct \u201cJohn Smith\u201d element, or that it is a separate crime from the murder of anyone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The government also cites cases stating that the \u201cprosecutor must put forth \u2018reasonable assurances of the identity\u2019 of the specific controlled substance charged.\u201d Respondent\u2019s Supplemental Br. at 5 (quoting <em>People v. Douglas, </em>24 A.D.3d 794, 807 N.Y.S.2d 393, 394 (2005)). Those cases relate to establishment of the chain of custody for evidentiary purposes. <em>See Douglas, </em>807 N.Y.S.2d at 394 (\u201cThe People failed to adduce testimony providing reasonable assurances of the identity and the unchanged condition of the cocaine the defendant allegedly possessed. Consequently, that evidence was inadmissible.... \u201d (citations omitted)). The chain of custody is not relevant to the elements of the charged crime. A chain would have to be established for the introduction of drug evidence regardless of its purpose in the trial or the underlying crime. To the extent that these cases consider dismissing charges because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>a drug was not properly identified, they merely demonstrate that the government must show the defendant to have sold some substance that appears in the schedules. <em>See People v. Montoya, </em>244 A.D.2d 510, 664 N.Y.S.2d 106, 107 (1997) (\u201cConsequently, the substance was inadmissible, rendering the evidence against the defendant legally insufficient to establish that he sold a controlled substance.\u201d). The cases do not show that each substance creates a separate crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Indeed, it appears that rulings from New York appellate courts favor Harbin\u2019s position. Several cases in the Appellate Division have considered NYPL \u00a7 220.16(1), a statute comparable to NYPL \u00a7 220.31 except that it deals with possession instead of sale\u2014and deals with the possession of narcotics in particular.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The statute reads, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1\">A person is guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree when he knowingly and unlawfully possesses ... a narcotic drug with intent to sell it....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">NYPL \u00a7 220.16(1). Several opinions state that different narcotic drugs do not create separate crimes under this statute, and that jurors need not agree as to the particular narcotic drug in question. In <em>People v. Miller, </em>the First Department flatly wrote that \u201c[defendant should not have been convicted of two possession counts based on his possession of single bag containing both cocaine and heroin.\u201d 15 A.D.3d 265, 789 N.Y.S.2d 423 (2005). And in <em>People v. Martin, </em>the First Department wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">The People concede on appeal that one of the two counts charging the defendant with possession of narcotic drugs must be dismissed. Penal Law \u00a7 220.16(1) does not distinguish between the types of narcotics possessed, but treats all drugs classified as narcotics interchangeably. Thus, there is no basis for multiple counts under this section based on the fact that the narcotics happen to be of different types.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">153 A.D.2d 807, 545 N.Y.S.2d 287, 288 (1989). A conclusion that NYPL \u00a7 220.16(1) \u201ctreats all drugs classified as narcotics interchangeably\u201d suggests that NYPL \u00a7 220.31 would take the same approach to the term \u201ccontrolled substances,\u201d given the similarity of the statutes\u2019 language and structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">8. State Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">The government also contends that New York\u2019s Pattern Jury Instructions show NYPL \u00a7 220.31 to be divisible. An appeal to pattern jury instructions is unwarranted here. The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Mathis </em>strongly suggests that we should consult jury instructions only when we are otherwise uncertain regarding the state law\u2019s meaning, and there is no such uncertainty as to NYPL \u00a7 220.31. <em>See Mathis, </em>136 S.Ct. at 2256 (\u201c[I]f state law <em>fails to provide clear answers, </em>federal judges have another place to look: the record of a prior conviction itself.\u201d (emphasis added)). Even when we do consider jury instructions, we consider them to the extent they appear in the \u201crecord of [the] prior conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, the government has not pointed to jury instructions actually used in Harbin\u2019s case, likely because he pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">Regardless, our review of the pattern jury instructions does not demonstrate that courts treat the sale of each drug under NYPL \u00a7 220.31 as a separate crime. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>The relevant part of the instructions reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\">In order for you to find the defendant, guilty of this crime, the People are required to prove, from all the evidence in the case, beyond a reasonable doubt, both of the following two elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaO\">1. That on or about (date), in the county of (county), the defendant, (defendant\u2019s name), sold <em>(specify)', </em>and 2. That the defendant did so knowingly and unlawfully.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">N.Y. Pattern Jury Instructions 220.81 (emphasis added). Although the instructions include a blank with the word \u201cspecify\u201d in it, allowing a judge to name the substances at issue in the case, the instructions do not say it is impermissible to identify more than one substance. No rule of law or language requires that the term \u201cspecify\u201d cover only one object.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">If a New York state judge may specify more than one drug in the pattern instructions for NYPL \u00a7 220.31, that judge could ask jurors to find whether or not \u201cthe defendant, Smith, sold cocaine or heroin,\u201d and, in doing so, comply with the language of the instructions. And if the judge may allow the jurors a choice between different substances, the statute does not create separate crimes\u2014it creates separate means of committing the same crime. The pattern jury instructions are thus consistent with the plain text of NYPL \u00a7 220.31, which allows conviction based on a defendant\u2019s sale of more than one substance, or when jurors do not agree as to which controlled substance the defendant sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">B. Categorical Approach</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">Because NYPL \u00a7 220.31 is indivisible, we apply the categorical approach to determine whether it is an aggravated felony. As noted previously, \u201cthe [categorical] approach looks to the statutory definition of the offense of conviction, not to the particulars of an [individual\u2019s] behavior.\u201d <em>Mellouli, </em>135 S.Ct. at 1986. \u201cAn alien\u2019s actual conduct is irrelevant to the inquiry, as the adjudicator must \u2018presume that the conviction rested upon nothing more than the least of the acts criminalized\u2019 under the state statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Moncrieffe, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1684-85).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">To be a drug-trafficking aggravated felony under the INA based on \u201cthe categorical approach, a state drug offense must ... \u2018necessarily\u2019 proscribe conduct that is an offense under the CSA.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Mon-crieffe, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1685. In this case, however, N.Y. Pub. Health Law \u00a7 3306, which supplies the drug schedules that permit conviction under NYPL \u00a7 220.31, includes chorionic gonadotropin as a controlled substance. Chorionic gonadotropin is not a controlled substance under the CSA. <em>Compare </em>N.Y. Pub. Health Law \u00a7 3306 <em>with </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-14\">Because NYPL \u00a7 220.31 can punish conduct that is not criminal under the CSA, it is not an aggravated felony. And, since \u00a7 220.31 is not an aggravated felony, Harbin\u2019s conviction under that statute does not bar him from requesting asylum or cancellation of removal. Because the BIA ruled that Harbin was ineligible for both of these forms of relief based on his conviction under \u00a7 220.31, this matter will be remanded to the agency for reconsideration of Harbin\u2019s eligibility for asylum and cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-15\">II. Additional Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b92-16\">Harbin raises three challenges to the agency\u2019s denial of withholding and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>CAT relief. As noted above, for a final order of removal against an alien who .is removable for having certain criminal convictions, we have jurisdiction to review only constitutional claims or questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Harbin argues that the agency improperly bifurcated his particular social group into two categories, and thus failed to consider all of the challenges associated with membership in Harbin\u2019s claimed social group as a whole. Specifically, Harbin suggests that the BIA considered the status of \u201cpersons with mental illness with no support system\u201d separately from the status of \u201cdeportees with mental illness,\u201d and failed to consider holistically the plight of a deportee with mental illnesses who has no support system. Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 30. Harbin also argues that the BIA ignored country conditions evidence establishing Grenada\u2019s inability to treat the mentally ill, and ignored evidence showing prejudice against the mentally ill and deportees in Grenada.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Despite Harbin\u2019s claims to the contrary, these arguments are merely quarrels with the agency\u2019s evaluation of the likelihood of harm arising from his status as a mentally-ill criminal deportee. Since likelihood of future harm is a finding of fact, we lack jurisdiction to consider these arguments. <em>Hui Lin Huang v. Holder, </em>677 F.3d 130, 134-35 (2d Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Finally, Harbin argues that the IJ\u2019s errors amount to a due process violation by depriving him of individualized consideration. However, because Harbin\u2019s due process claim depends on his other arguments, all of which are unreviewable factual challenges, his due process claim is unreviewable as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">We have reviewed the other arguments raised by Harbin and the government, and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated above, the petition for review is GRANTED in part. The agency\u2019s ruling is VACATED as to Harbin\u2019s ineligibility for asylum and cancellation of removal, and this matter is REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this opinion. The petition is DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction as to Harbin\u2019s applications for withholding of removal and CAT relief. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b85-9\">. When a non-citizen is found to be deporta-ble, as Harbin was, he or she may ask the Attorney General for certain forms of discretionary relief from removal. <em>See Moncrieffe v. Holder, </em>569 U.S. 184, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 1682, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013). These grounds include asylum, when the non-citizen has a well-founded fear of persecution in his home country, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158, and cancellation of removal, when, among other things, the non-citizen has been lawfully present in the United States for a number of years, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1229b. <em>See Moncrieffe, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1682. A noncitizen who fears persecution may also seek withholding of removal, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A), and deferral of removal under CAT, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.17(a). <em>See Moncrieffe, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1683 n.1. Withholding and CAT relief \"require the noncitizen to show a greater likelihood of persecution or torture at home than is necessary for asylum, but the Attorney General has no discretion to deny relief to a noncitizen who establishes his eligibility.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b86-8\">. Harbin was initially ordered removed by the IJ on May 23, 2012, and the BIA denied his appeal on September 21, 2012. On November 9, 2012, however, the New York City Criminal Court for Kings County vacated Harbin\u2019s 1984 conviction for unlawful possession of marijuana under NYPL \u00a7 221.05. Harbin accordingly filed a motion to reopen, on the grounds that his marijuana conviction no longer disqualified him from applying for cancellation of removal. The BIA granted the motion on December 12, 2012 and remanded his case to the IJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b86-12\">. The IJ did not bar Withholding or CAT relief on the basis of Harbin\u2019s \u00a7 220.31 conviction. Rather, the IJ found that the \u00a7 220.31 conviction was not a \u201cparticularly serious crime\u201d due to Harbin\u2019s peripheral role and the small quantity of drugs involved. CAR 101, 104. The IJ also found evidence of limited mental services in Grenada as well as societal prejudices against those with mental disabilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b87-8\"><em>. </em>As discussed below, under the categorical approach, an adjudicator must \u201cpresume that the conviction rested upon nothing more than the least of the acts criminalized\u201d under the state statute. <em>Mellouli, </em>135 S.Ct. at 1986 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b87-9\">. The two improperly bifurcated categories alleged by Harbin, as discussed in greater detail below, are \"persons with mental illness with no support system\u201d and \"deportees with mental illness.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 30. Harbin, rather, argues that the IJ should have considered Harbin\u2019s social group as a whole: mentally-ill criminal deportees to Grenada with no support system in the country.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b89-8\">. Other courts have applied the categorical approach in similar, albeit not identical, circumstances. In <em>Borrome v. Attorney General of the United States, </em>the Third Circuit held that a conviction under federal statutes prohibiting the unlicensed distribution of any prescription drug created only a single crime, not a separate crime for each drug. 687 F.3d 150, 157-59 (3d Cir. 2012). The statute in that case referred to a definition of prescription drugs that included substances on a list regulated by the FDA, as well as those a jury would consider unsafe for use without supervision by licensed practitioners. <em>Id. </em>at 157. In <em>Mellouli, </em>the Supreme Court used the categorical approach to analyze a Kansas statute prohibiting the possession of drug paraphernalia to \"store, contain, conceal, inject, ingest, inhale or otherwise introduce a controlled substance into the human body,\u201d and which defined \"controlled substance\u201d by reference to Kansas drug schedules. 135 S.Ct. at 1983-84 (internal quotation marks omitted). Admittedly, <em>Mellouli </em>is not entirely dispositive on this point, as the government there did not argue that the statute was divisible. <em>Id. </em>at 1986 n.4. But the fact that the Court was willing to apply the categorical approach to a similar statute suggests that doing so is not inappropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b91-8\">. Although both parties cite cases interpreting NYPL \u00a7 220.31, those opinions appear incon-elusive and unhelpful for present purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b92-11\">. The CSA must also prescribe felony punishment for the conduct at issue. <em>Moncrieffe, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1685.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
