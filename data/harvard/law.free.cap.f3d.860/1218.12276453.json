Further proceedings are stayed pending receipt of the response to the certified question, and this case is withdrawn from submission until further order of this court. If the California Supreme Court accepts the certified question, the parties will file a joint status report six months after the date of acceptance, and every six months thereafter, advising us of the status of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-21\">I. Administrative Information</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-22\">Julia Meza is deemed the petitioner in this request because she appeals from the district court\u2019s ruling on this issue. The caption of the case is:</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-23\">No. 15-16900</p>\n<p id=\"AM3X\">JULIA C.

DIPIERO</p>\n<p id=\"Ar78\">Defendants-Appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-29\">The names and addresses of counsel are:</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-30\">For Plaintiff-Appellant Julia C. Meza: Owen Randolph Bragg, Horwitz, Horwitz &amp; Associates, 25 East Washington Street, Suite 900, Chicago, IL 60602; Raeon R. Roulston &amp; Fred W. Schwinn, Consumer Law Center, Inc., 12 South First Street, Suite 1014, San Jose, CA 95113-2418.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-31\">For Defendants-Appellees Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC; Hunt &amp; Hen-riques, a general partnership; Michael Scott Hunt; Janalie Ann Henriques; and Anthony J.

Certified Question</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">Pursuant to California Rule of Court 8.548(b)(2), we certify the question presented below. There is no controlling California precedent regarding the certified question, and the answer to the question could determine the outcome of this appeal. Cal. R. Ct. 8.548(a). It is also an issue likely to recur and affect thousands of cases filed in the \u201climited civil division\u201d of the California Superior Courts. The issue has divided the Appellate Divisions of several Superior Courts, and there is no authority from any District Court of Appeal. The question certified is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa4\">Under \u00a7 98(a) of the California Code of Civil Procedure, must the affiant<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> be physically located and personally available for service of process at the address provided in the declaration that is within 150 miles of the place of trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">Our phrasing of this question is n\u00f3t intended to restrict the California Supreme Court\u2019s consideration of the issues, Cal. R. Ct. 8.548(f)(5), and we agree to accept and follow the decision of the California Supreme Court, Cal. R. Ct. 8.548(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">III. Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">Julia Meza had a consumer credit card account with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. She later defaulted on her credit account, and the defaulted debt was sold to Portfolio Recovery Associates (\u201cPRA\u201d). PRA placed the debt with the law firm of Hunt &amp; Henriques (\u201cH &amp; H\u201d) for collection, and the firm, along with PRA (\u201cAppellees\u201d), filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of California, San Mateo County, to collect the defaulted debt from Meza.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-8\">As part of the collection action, Appel- ' lees served Meza with a document titled, \u201cDeclaration of [PRA] in Lieu of Personal Testimony at Trial (CCP \u00a7 98).\u201d The declaration\u2014filed pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 98\u2014described Meza\u2019s unpaid account and was signed by a PRA employee, Colby Eyre, who authenticated the basis for claiming the amounts owed. It also stated that, \u201cPursuant to CCP \u00a7 98 this affiant is available for service of process: c/o Hunt &amp; Henriques, 151 Bernal Road, Suite 8, San Jose, CA 95119 for a reasonable period of time, during the twenty days immediately prior to trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-11\">The parties agree that the above address is not Colby Eyre\u2019s work address. They also agree that Eyre lives more than 150 miles from the relevant county courthouse. However, it is clear that H &amp; H was authorized to accept service of process on Eyre\u2019s behalf, and that H &amp; H\u2019s law offices are within \u00a7 98\u2019s 150-mile requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-12\">Based on these underlying facts, Meza filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in August 2014, alleging that PRA failed to comply with California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 98. In her First Amended Complaint, she purported to represent \u201c(i) all persons residing in California, (ii) who were served by [PRA] with a Declaration in Lieu of Personal Testimony at Trial, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 98, (iii) where the declarant was located more than 150 miles from the courthouse where the collection lawsuit was pending.\u201d She claimed that PRA\u2019s declaration was invalid because Eyre was not personally available for service at the address provided in his declaration. And she argued that PRA\u2019s use of this declaration misrepresented that it would be admissible at trial. She therefore maintained that PRA was in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>(\u201cFDCPA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692 <em>et seq., </em>which, among other things, prohibits debt collectors from using false, deceptive, misleading, or unfair representations to collect any debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">On April 27, 2015, Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment and argued that California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 98 simply requires the affiant to be \u201cavailable for service of process\u201d within 150 miles of the place of trial, not personally available for service at the address provided. The district court agreed, finding that the plain language of \u00a7 98 did not require the affiant\u2019s physical presence, and that the legislative history and purpose of the statute supported that interpretation. The district court therefore held that PRA\u2019s declaration complied with \u00a7 98 and contained no false or misleading statements in violation of the FDCPA. It granted Appellees\u2019 motion and entered judgment in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">Meza timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">IV. Explanation of Certification</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-8\">This appeal turns on whether California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 98 requires the affiant to be physically located and personally available for service of process at the address provided in the declaration. The question is purely one of state law and is dispositive of this appeal\u2014if physical presence is not required, then PRA complied with the state statute and did not make any false or misleading representations in violation of the FDCPA. Cal. R. Ct. 8.548(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-9\">There is no controlling California precedent addressing this question. Cal. R. Ct. 8.548(a)(2). And while the issue has been considered by the Appellate Divisions of various California Superior Courts, those decisions are not binding and have limited persuasive authority. <em>See Suastez v. Plastic Dress-Up Co., </em>31 Cal.3d 774, 183 Cal.Rptr. 846, 647 P.2d 122, 126 n.6 (1982). They have also reached inconsistent outcomes. <em>Compare CACH LLC v. Rodgers, </em>229 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1, 176 Cal.Rptr.3d 843 (2014) (holding that \u00a7 98 requires the affiant to be physically present at the location provided in the declaration), <em>and Target Nat'l Bank v. Rocha, </em>216 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1, 157 Cal.Rptr.3d 156 (2013) (same), <em>with Citibank v. Bardin, </em>No. BV 028877 (Cal. App. Dep\u2019t Super. Ct. Dec. 8, 2011) (unpublished) (holding that there was nothing in the record to demonstrate that the use of a post office box rendered the declaration noncompliant with \u00a7 98).</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-11\">The question certified presents an issue of significant importance to the State of California. <em>See Munson v. Del Taco, Inc., </em>522 F.3d 997, 999-1000 (9th Cir. 2008). Though \u00a7 98 applies only to \u201climited civil cases,\u201d <em>see </em>Cal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 91, an answer from the California Supreme Court will help simplify litigation procedures in these low value cases, which are responsible for the vast majority of civil filings in California. <em>See Preface </em>to Judicial Council of California, 2016 Court Statistics Report, Statewide Caseload Trends (2016); <em>see also id. </em>at 40. It will also provide guidance to California consumers, creditors, and debt collectors and purchasers who litigate thousands of debt collection cases each year. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-12\">V. Relevant Law and Arguments Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-13\">Under California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 98, \u201c[a] party may, in lieu of presenting direct testimony, offer the prepared testimony of relevant witnesses in the form of affidavits or declarations under penalty of perjury.\u201d To be received as evidence, however, a copy of the declaration must be served on the opposing party, \u201ctogether with a current address of the affiant that is within 150 miles of the place of trial, and the affiant is available for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>service of process at that place for a reasonable period of time, during the 20 days immediately prior to trial.\u201d Cal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 98(a):<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The dispute here centers on the meaning of \u201cavailable for service of process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">California rules of statutory interpretation seek to \u201cascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u201d <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Garamendi, </em>32 Cal.4th 1029, 12 Cal.Rptr.3d 343, 88 P.3d 71, 78 (2004) (internal quotation omitted). Under California law, courts \u201clook first to the words of the statute themselves, giving to the language its usual, ordinary import and according significance, if possible, to every word, phrase, and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). California courts also \u201cread every statute with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">If the statute is clear, then there is no need for judicial construction. <em>Hughes v. Bd. of Architectural Examiners, </em>17 Cal.4th 763, 72 Cal.Rptr.2d 624, 952 P.2d 641, 649 (1998). However, if the statute is ambiguous\u2014i.e., capable of two reasonable constructions\u2014then California courts will \u201cconsider evidence of the Legislature\u2019s intent beyond the words of the statute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-6\">Both Meza and PRA contend that the plain language of the statute supports their respective positions. Meza\u2019s argument focuses on the language of \u00a7 98 read in conjunction with other California statutory provisions. She argues that the California Legislature must have contemplated that the affiant be personally available for service of process at the address provided in the declaration because \u00a7 98 operates as an exception to the general rule against hearsay evidence. <em>See </em>Cal. Evid. Code \u00a7 1200. Though \u00a7 98 broadly allows a party to present witness testimony in the form of a declaration, \u00a7 98(a) in turn requires the offering party to provide a current address of the affiant so that the opposing party can seek to require the affiant\u2019s attendance at trial. It therefore preserves the opposing party\u2019s right to cross-examine the affiant, should that party wish to challenge the hearsay evidence. <em>See Rocha, </em>157 Cal.Rptr.3d at 159-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-11\">For this protection to work, Meza claims that the affiant must be physically located at the address provided in the declaration. She cites California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 1985(a) and 1987(a) in support of this argument. Read alongside \u00a7 98, these provisions could suggest that the affiant\u2019s attendance at trial can only be secured through the use of a subpoena, \u00a7 1985(a), and that a subpoena must be delivered to the witness personally, \u00a7 1987(a). Thus, Meza argues that \u00a7 98(a) implicitly requires physical presence, since its protective purpose can only be enforced through the use of a trial subpoena, according to other provisions of the California Code of Civil Procedure. <em>See Rodgers, </em>176 Cal.Rptr.3d at 847-48; <em>Rocha, </em>157 Cal.Rptr.3d at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-12\">PRA argues that \u00a7 98\u2019s language does not require actual physical presence. Had the California Legislature intended physical presence at the address provided in the declaration, it could have easily required the affiant to provide \u201ca current residential or work address,\u201d rather than simply \u201ca current address.\u201d <em>See </em>Cal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 98(a). The Legislature also could have required an address where the affiant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>subject to subpoena prior to trial. But because the Legislature merely demanded an address where the affiant is \u201cavailable for service of process,\u201d <em>id., </em>PRA argues that the court should not add words to an otherwise clear statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">Moreover, PRA argues that such an exercise would contravene the legislative history and purpose of \u00a7 98. <em>See Hughes, </em>72 Cal.Rptr.2d 624, 952 P.2d at 649. California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 90-100, collectively referred to as Economic Litigation for Limited Civil Cases, were enacted to reduce costs in cases involving relatively small dollar values. As originally introduced, \u00a7 98 allowed a party to introduce the affidavit of any witness if \u201c[a] copy, together with the current address of the affiant, has been received by the party against whom it is offered at least 15 days prior to trial, and the affiant is subject to subpena [sic] for the trial.\u201d Assemb. B. 3170, 1981-1982, Reg. Sess. (Cal. 1982) (as introduced, March 10, 1982). It was then amended in the Assembly on April 21, 1982, and enacted into law as part of Senate Bill No. 1820 later that year. The 1982 version allowed parties to prepare affidavits or declarations, in lieu of trial testimony, provided that \u201c[a] copy, together with the current address of the affiant, has been served on the party against whom it is offered at least 30 days prior to the trial, and the affiant is available for service of process at a place designated by the proponent, within 150 miles of the place of trial.\u201d Assemb. B. 3170, 1981-1982, Reg. Sess. (Cal. 1982) (as amended, April 21, 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">In 1983, \u00a7 98(a) underwent one final amendment. It remains in effect today:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alm\">A party may, in lieu of presenting direct testimony, offer the prepared testimony of relevant witnesses in the form of affidavits or declarations ... provided that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAjF5\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-8\">(a) A copy has been served on the party against whom it is offered at least 30 days prior to the trial, together with a current address of the affiant that is within 150 miles of the place of trial, and the affiant is available for service of process at that place for a reasonable period of time, during the 20 days immediately prior to trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1247-9\">Cal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 98(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-10\">PRA argues that these amendments strongly support its position that \u00a7 98(a) does not require physical presence at the address provided. According to California rules of statutory interpretation, \u201c[t]he rejection by the Legislature of a specific provision contained in an act as originally introduced is most persuasive to the conclusion that the act should not be construed to include the omitted provision.\u201d <em>People v. Soto, </em>51 Cal.4th 229, 119 Cal.Rptr.3d 775, 245 P.3d 410, 420 (2011) (quoting <em>Rich v. State Bd. of Optometry, </em>235 Cal.App.2d 591, 45 Cal.Rptr. 512, 522 (1965)). As such, PRA contends that the court should not read \u00a7 98 to require the use of a trial subpoena. Rather, PRA argues that the Legislature clearly contemplated other forms of service of process, forms that do not require the affiant to be personally available to accept service of process.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>Given the seemingly ambiguous language of \u00a7 98, and the inconsistent outcomes reached by California Superior Courts, we believe the California Supreme Court is in the best position to interpret the statute and settle an important question of state law. We therefore respectfully request that the California Supreme Court exercise its discretion to decide the certified question. Absent certification, we will attempt to determine how the California Supreme Court would interpret this statute, though we are not the final expositor of California law. <em>Walker v. City of Lakewood, </em>272 F.3d 1114, 1125 (9th Cir. 2001); <em>Pacheco v. United States, </em>220 F.8d 1126, 1131 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">VI. Accompanying Materials</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">The clerk of this court is hereby directed to file in the California Supreme Court, under official seal of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, copies of all relevant briefs and excerpts of record, and an original and ten copies of this order and request for certification, along with a certification of service on the parties, pursuant to California Rule of Court 8.548(c) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-6\">The Clerk is directed to administratively close this docket, pending further order. This panel retains jurisdiction over further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-7\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1244-9\">. '\u2018Affiant\u201d and \"declarant\u201d are used interchangeably throughout this certification order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1246-7\">. The declaration may also be received as evidence if \"[t]he statement is in the form of all or part of a deposition in the case, and the party against whom it is offered had an opportunity to participate in the deposition.\u201d Cal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 98(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">. Additionally, PRA notes that alternative forms of service of process would better promote \u00a7 98\u2019s purpose. In its view, requiring parties to hire process servers would be much more costly than simply allowing parties to fax or email notices to authorized agents. <em>Cf. Rodgers, </em>176 Cal.Rptr.3d at 847-48 (indicating that, \u2018\u2018in the vast majority of cases, where the matters are uncontested or otherwise unchallenged,\u201d it is \"unwieldy\u201d to \"requir[e] personal service, or hav[e] a local declarant literally available for service within 150 miles\u201d). Meza, however, contends that \u00a7 98\u2019s purpose weighs in her favor, as it limits how far an opponent must trav\u00e9l to serve a subpoena on an affiant whose attendance at trial is required.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
