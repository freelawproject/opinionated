After Petitioner Charles William Centurion committed a drug crime but before Centurion\u2019s crime was adjudicated, Congress passed a statute with immigration consequences for any lawful permanent resident who \u201chas committed\u201d a drug crime. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v). The question is whether the statute can be given effect with respect to Centurion\u2019s crime, even though Centurion committed the crime before the statute\u2019s passage. We conclude that the presumption against retroactive legislation bars such an application because the plain text of the statute attaches legal consequences at the time a lawful permanent resident commits a crime, rather than at the time of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-18\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b95-19\">Petitioner Charles William Centurion is a native and citizen of Peru. On November 4, 1989, he became a lawful permanent resident of the United States. In 1990, Centurion was arrested and charged in the Criminal District Court for Dallas County, Texas with conspiracy to possess cocaine. Centurion posted bail and fled the state. His Texas criminal case remained unresolved for seventeen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-20\">During Centurion\u2019s years as a fugitive, Congress took two legislative actions material to his case. To fully describe the import of these actions on Centurion\u2019s case, it is necessary to explain some general principles of immigration law. First, the Attorney General formerly enjoyed the discretion, under certain circumstances, to waive the deportation of aliens under \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). An alien subject to deportation could apply for such a waiver, which was generally known as \u201c212(c) relief.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (repealed 1996). The first Congressional action material to Centurion\u2019s case was the repeal of INA \u00a7 212(c): in 1996, through the pas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>sage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 104-132, \u00a7 440(d), 110 Stat. 1214, 1276-77, and then IIRIRA, Pub.L. No. 104-208, \u00a7 304(b), 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-597, Congress narrowed and ultimately eliminated \u00a7 212(c) relief and replaced it with cancellation of removal, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The second Congressional action material to Centurion\u2019s case concerned the <em>Fleuti </em>doctrine. Under <em>Rosenberg v. Fleuti, </em>374 U.S. 449, 83 S.Ct. 1804, 10 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1963), a lawful permanent resident of the United States was not subject to exclusion proceedings, the pre-IIRIRA analogue to removal proceedings for an alien seeking entry into the United States, if the lawful permanent resident\u2019s departure from the United States was \u201can innocent, casual, and brief excursion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462, 83 S.Ct. 1804. In other words, lawful permanent residents could come and go from the United States on short trips without formally seeking admission. Through the passage of IIRIRA in 1996, Congress ended the <em>Fleuti </em>doctrine. <em>See Vartelas v. Holder, </em>620 F.3d 108, 116-18 (2d Cir. 2010) <em>(\u201cVar\u00edelas </em>/\u201d), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>566 U.S. 257, 132 S.Ct. 1479, 182 L.Ed.2d 473 (2012).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, \u201clawful permanent residents returning post-IIRIRA ... may be required to seek an admission into the United States, without regard to whether the alien\u2019s departure from the United States might previously have been ranked as brief, casual, and innocent under the <em>Fleu-ti </em>doctrine.\u201d <em>Vartelas v. Holder, </em>566 U.S. 257, 262-63, 132 S.Ct. 1479, 182 L.Ed.2d 473 (2012) <em>(\u201cVar\u00edelas II\u201d) </em>(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). In other words, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), a lawful permanent resident must seek formal admission\u2014even if returning from a brief trip abroad\u2014if he has committed a drug offense or a crime of moral turpitude. In turn, a lawful permanent resident who has been convicted of or who admits committing a drug offense or a crime of moral turpitude is inadmissible. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Because of these two changes\u2014the elimination of \u00a7 212(c) relief and the end of the <em>Fleuti </em>doctrine\u2014Centurion faced a significantly different immigration law landscape when, in 2005, he was arrested in Puerto Rico on an outstanding warrant from his 1990 Texas drug offense. After his release from custody, Centurion went to Texas to resolve his criminal case. On April 10, 2007, he pleaded <em>nolo contendere </em>to conspiracy to possess cocaine in violation of Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7 481.115 and received six months of community supervision. After Centurion complied with the terms of his probation, the proceedings against him in Texas criminal court were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">On September 25, 2007, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) questioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Centurion as he attempted to enter the United States after a brief vacation in the Dominican Republic. During this questioning, Centurion admitted that he was an alien and informed DHS of his 1990 arrest in Texas and his 2005 arrest in Puerto Rico. On January 18, 2008, Centurion was served with a Notice to Appear stating he was subject to removal pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), because he was alien convicted of a controlled substance offense, namely conspiracy to possess cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">On May 19, 2009, an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) pretermitted Centurion\u2019s application for \u00a7 212(c) relief and ordered him removed. Specifically, the IJ relied on <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), and <em>Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., </em>511 U.S. 244, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994), to conclude that \u00a7 212(c) relief was unavailable to Centurion because he pleaded <em>nolo contendere </em>to his drug offense on April 10, 2007, years after IIRIRA came into effect. On June 23, 2011, the BIA dismissed Centurion\u2019s appeal from the IJ\u2019s decision. This Court dismissed Centurion\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision, holding \u201cthat the legal regime in force at the time of an alien\u2019s conviction determines whether an alien is entitled to seek \u00a7 212(c) relief.\u201d <em>Centurion v. Holder, </em>755 F.3d 115, 124 (2d Cir. 2014) <em>(\u201cCenturion F).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">On October 23, 2014, Centurion filed a motion before the BIA to reopen and terminate his removal proceedings and to stay his removal. Centurion argued that the untimeliness of his motion to reopen should be excused because of an intervening change in the law, namely the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Vartelas II, </em>566 U.S. 257, 132 S.Ct. 1479, 182 L.Ed.2d 473 (2012). In <em>Vartelas II, </em>the Court held that, to the extent that IIRIRA eliminated the <em>Fleuti </em>doctrine, this elimination did not apply to a lawful permanent resident who had committed and been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude before IIRIRA\u2019s passage. <em>Id. </em>at 272, 132 S.Ct. 1479. In other words, the Court held that a lawful permanent resident with a pre-IIRIRA conviction could re-enter .the United States after a brief trip abroad without seeking admission. The <em>Vartelas II </em>Court observed that \u201ccourts read laws as prospective in application unless Congress has unambiguously instructed retroactivity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266, 132 S.Ct. 1479. Requiring a lawful permanent resident who had only briefly travelled abroad to seek formal admission to the United States and thereby be deemed inadmissible as a result of a crime fully adjudicated before IIRIRA\u2019s passage would give IIRIRA impermissibly retroactive effect. <em>See id. </em>at 267, 132 S.Ct. 1479. In his motion to reopen, Centurion argued that his criminal conduct, like that of the petitioner in <em>Vartelas II, </em>pre-dated IIRIRA and thus he should not have been forced to formally seek admission to the United States or been placed in removal proceedings after his brief 2007 vacation. In other words, he claimed that he was entitled to avail himself of the <em>Fleuti </em>doctrine, as the petitioner was able to do in <em>Vartelas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">The BIA denied Centurion\u2019s motion to reopen and dismissed his motion to stay as moot. The BIA concluded that the anti-retroactivity holding of <em>Vartelas II </em>did not apply to Centurion\u2019s case because, although he committed his drug offense pri- or to IIRIRA\u2019s passage, the offense was not finally adjudicated until more than a decade after IIRIRA\u2019s passage. In reaching this conclusion, the BIA relied on a footnote in <em>Vartelas II </em>which states that \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) \u201cappears to advert to a lawful permanent resident who has been convicted of an offense under \u00a7 1182(a)(2) (or admits to one).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275 n.ll, 132 S.Ct. 1479. Centurion filed the present pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>tition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The question presented by Centurion\u2019s petition is whether the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Var\u00edelas II </em>that a lawful permanent resident with a conviction predating IIRIRA need not formally seek admission after a brief trip abroad applies when a lawful permanent resident\u2019s criminal conduct occurred prior to IIRIRA\u2019s passage but the offense was not finally adjudicated until after IIRIRA\u2019s passage. Before proceeding to this question, we note the limitations of our jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">First, when reviewing a final order of removal against an alien who is inadmissible because of a drug offense, we have jurisdiction to review only constitutional claims and questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Second, Centurion\u2019s motion to reopen his removal proceedings was untimely because it was filed more than ninety days after the issuance of his final administrative order of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(47)(B), 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). The motion\u2019s untimeliness was not excused by any regulatory exception. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3). In such circumstances, Centurion\u2019s \u201cmotion to reopen could only be considered upon exercise of the [BIAj\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>authority.\u201d <em>Mahmood v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 466, 469 (2d Cir. 2009). We do not have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s \u201centirely discretionary\u201d refusal to reopen a case <em>sua sponte. Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir. 2006) (per curiam). However, we do have jurisdiction to address the narrow question of whether the BIA \u201cmisperceived the legal background and thought, incorrectly, that a reopening would necessarily fail.\u201d <em>Mahmood, </em>570 F.3d at 469. In denying Centurion\u2019s motion to reopen, the BIA set out its understanding that \u201c[f]or <em>Var\u00edelas [II </em>] to apply to an alien\u2019s case, ... not just the offense, but also the plea and conviction must be pre-IIRIRA.\u201d Cert. Admin. Record 4. Under this interpretation of <em>Var\u00edelas II, </em>Centurion\u2019s motion to reopen would necessarily fail. Therefore, we have jurisdiction to review whether the BIA\u2019s understanding of Var\u00edelas <em>II </em>was correct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Because the correct interpretation of <em>Var\u00edelas II </em>is a question of law, we review it <em>de novo. See Chambers v. Office of Chief Counsel, </em>494 F.3d 274, 277 (2d Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">We begin with the presumption against retroactive legislation. \u201cThe principle that the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place has timeless and universal human appeal.\u201d <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, </em>494 U.S. 827, 855, 110 S.Ct. 1570, 108 L.Ed.2d 842 (1990). \u201cElementary considerations <em>of </em>fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly; settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted.\u201d <em>Landgraf, </em>511 U.S. at 265, 114 S.Ct. 1483.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-13\">In <em>Landgraf, </em>the Supreme Court set out a two-step framework for determining when the presumption against retroactive legislation bars application of a statute. <em>See id. </em>at 280, 114 S.Ct. 1483. The first step is to determine whether Congress expressly provided that a statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>should apply retroactively. <em>Id. </em>We need not dwell on this first step because the <em>Var\u00edelas II </em>Court held that \u201cCongress did not expressly prescribe the temporal reach of ... 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13).\u201d 566 U.S. at 267, 132 S.Ct. 1479. Proceeding to the second step of the <em>Landgraf </em>framework, \u201c[t]he essential inquiry ... is \u2018whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273, 132 S.Ct. 1479 (quoting <em>Landgraf, </em>511 U.S. at 270, 114 S.Ct. 1483). To conduct this inquiry, courts engage in a \u201cprocess of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.\u201d <em>Landgraf, </em>511 U.S. at 270, 114 S.Ct. 1483. In this process, \u201cfamiliar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">We do not write on a blank slate because the Supreme Court concluded in <em>Var\u00edelas II </em>that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) does not apply to an alien convicted of a relevant crime before IIRIRA\u2019s enactment. It is clear that \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) \u201cattaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.\u201d <em>Vartelas II, </em>566 U.S. at 273, 132 S.Ct. 1479 (quoting <em>Landgraf, </em>511 U.S. at 270, 114 S.Ct. 1483). The question now at hand is <em>when </em>these new consequences attach. Do they attach when an alien engages in criminal conduct or only once the offense has been adjudicated?</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">To answer this question, we must construe \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v). \u201cStatutory construction begins with the plain text and, if that text is unambiguous, it usually ends there as well.\u201d <em>United States v. Razmilovic, </em>419 F.3d 134, 136 (2d Cir. 2005). Section 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) states that \u201c[a]n alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States shall not be regarded as seeking an admission into the United States for purposes of the immigration laws unless the alien ... has committed an offense identified in section 1182(a)(2) of this title.\u201d We discern no ambiguity in this provision. The plain text of \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) requires a lawful permanent resident to seek formal admission if he \u201chas committed\u201d an offense. <em>Id. </em>The legal consequences of \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) attach at the time of an alien\u2019s criminal conduct. To test and ensure the soundness of our conclusion that a statutory provision is unambiguous, it is prudent to examine those words in the context of the larger statutory structure and related statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Our interpretation of \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) is consistent with our long-standing interpretation of a related statutory provision. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a), the Attorney General may cancel the removal of aliens who satisfy certain conditions, including that they have resided in the United States continuously for seven years. However, such a \u201cperiod of continuous residence ... in the United States shall be deemed to end ... when the alien has committed an offense referred to in section 1182(a)(2) of this title that renders the alien inadmissible to the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(l). This is known as the \u201cstop-time rule.\u201d We have repeatedly held that \u201cthe date of the commission of the offense[,]\u201d not the date of conviction, triggers the stop-time rule. <em>Baraket v. Holder, </em>632 F.3d 56, 60 (2d Cir. 2011) (per curiam); <em>see Martinez v. INS, </em>523 F.3d 365, 369 (2d Cir. 2008); <em>Reid v. Gonzales, </em>478 F.3d 510, 512 (2d Cir. 2007) (per curiam); <em>Tablie v. Gonzales, </em>471 F.3d 60, 62 (2d Cir. 2006). The holdings of these cases rest on the language of \u00a7 1229b(d)(l), specifically the \u201cnatural meaning,\u201d <em>Baraket, </em>632 F.3d at 60, of the phrase \u201cwhen the alien <em>has committed </em>an offense,\u201d 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\u00a7 1229b(d)(l) (emphasis added). The relevant language in \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) and 1229b(d)(l) is identical, and we see no reason to deviate from our past interpretation of it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">We also note that in various statutory-provisions, including \u00a7 1229b, Congress has expressly required an alien to have been convicted of an offense for specific consequences to attach. For example, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3), \u201c[t]he Attorney General may cancel removal in the case- of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the United States if the alien ... has not been <em>convicted </em>of any aggravated felony.\u201d (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C) (\u201cThe Attorney General may cancel removal of, and adjust to the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the United States if the alien ... has not been <em>convicted </em>of an offense under [certain sections] of this title.... \u201d (emphasis added)); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1182(h) (\u201cNo waiver shall be provided under this subsection in the case of an alien who has been <em>convicted </em>of (or who has admitted committing acts that constitute) murder or criminal acts involving torture, or an attempt or conspiracy to commit murder or a criminal act involving torture.\u201d (emphasis added)). These provisions demonstrate that when Congress intends legal consequences to attach only at the time of adjudication of a crime, Congress will use language to specifically communicate that timing.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The government\u2019s arguments against the plain text of \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) fall short. First, the government points out that, although the text of \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) does not specifically mention convictions, the text of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2), to which \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) refers, does. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)\u00ae states in relevant part that \u201cany alien convicted of, or who admits having committed, or who admits committing acts which constitute the essential elements of ... a violation of ... any law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance ... is inadmissible.\u201d Although \u00a7 1182(a) does expressly attach legal consequences to a conviction or admission rather than the commission of a crime, the government\u2019s argument overlooks the role of \u00a7 1182(a) in \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v). Section 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) forces a lawful permanent resident to seek admission when he \u201chas committed an offense <em>identified </em>in section 1182(a)(2) of this title.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) (emphasis added). The sole purpose of \u00a7 1182(a) in \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) is to identify a category of crimes, including drug offenses, the commission of which triggers certain legal consequences. The mention of convictions in \u00a7 1182(a) does not bear directly on \u00a7 1182(a)\u2019s identification of crimes and so sheds little light on the question at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Second, the government argues that we must defer to the BIA\u2019s reading of \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v). It is true that \u201cthe BIA\u2019s interpretations of ambiguous provisions of the INA are owed substantial deference unless \u2018arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mardones v. McElroy, </em>197 F.3d 619, 624 (2d Cir. 1999) (quoting <em>Chevron, U.S.A, Inc. v. Nat. Resources Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)). However, \u201c[i]f the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778. Section 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) is not ambiguous. It states clearly that lawful permanent residents must submit to admission proceedings if they have \u201ccommitted an offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>identified in section 1182(a)(2) of this title.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v). We do not owe the BIA any deference in the interpretation of this unambiguous language.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Third, the government argues that, despite what the plain text of \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) might say, in practice the consequences of \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) will only attach upon an alien\u2019s conviction of a crime. Specifically, the government observes that an official at the border will ordinarily have no way of knowing whether a lawful permanent resident has committed a crime unless he has been convicted of one. As the Supreme Court memorably put it: \u201cOrdinarily, to determine whether there is clear and convincing evidence that an alien has committed a qualifying crime, the immigration officer at the border would check the alien\u2019s records for a conviction. He would not call into session a piepowder court to entertain a plea or conduct a trial.\u201d <em>Vartelas II, </em>566 U.S. at 275, 132 S.Ct. 1479 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We do not doubt the wisdom of this insight into the practical application of \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v). However, regardless of the difficulties inherent in applying a statute as written, we are bound by its text. <em>See United States v. Messina, </em>806 F.3d 55, 67 (2d Cir. 2015) (\u201c[W]e first consider whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case. If it does, that meaning controls without need for further inquiry.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Accordingly, for purposes of the retroactivity analysis in this case, the legal consequences of a lawful permanent resident\u2019s commission of a drug offense attach at the time of commission, even if, in prac-tiee, those consequences may not be enforceable in any meaningful way until after the lawful permanent resident is convicted of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Because \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) attaches legal consequences to the commission of drug offenses and Centurion committed his Texas drug offense in 1990, six years prior to IIRIRA\u2019s passage, \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) \u201c \u2018attache[d] new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vartelas II, </em>566 U.S. at 273, 132 S.Ct. 1479 (quoting <em>Landgraf, </em>511 U.S. at 270, 114 S.Ct. 1483). Therefore, \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) cannot be applied to Centurion without violating the presumption against retroactive legislation. This means that the <em>Fleuti </em>doctrine should apply to Centurion\u2019s five-day vacation to the Dominican Republic in 2007. <em>See id. </em>at 275,132 S.Ct. 1479.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">The government also raises a series of' arguments that past decisions of the Supreme Court and of this Court require us to deny Centurion\u2019s petition. With respect to the Supreme Court, the government claims that we are bound by <em>Vartelas II </em>to deny Centurion\u2019s petition. The government understands <em>Vartelas II </em>to hold that the <em>Fleuti </em>doctrine does not apply if a lawful permanent resident merely committed but was not convicted of a relevant crime prior to IIRIRA\u2019s enactment. <em>Vartelas II </em>contains no such holding. As we explained in <em>Centurion I, \u201cVartelas [II </em>] did not turn on a distinction between the date of the offense and the date of conviction: the Supreme Court had no occasion to consider the issue in that case because both events, offense and conviction, took place pre-IIR-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>IRA.\u201d 755 F.3d at 123. The petitioner in <em>Var\u00edelas II </em>had been convicted of conspiracy to make a counterfeit security in 1994, two years prior to IIRIRA\u2019s passage. <em>Vartelas II, </em>566 U.S. at 260, 132 S.Ct. 1479. Therefore, to the extent the <em>Var\u00edelas II </em>Court discussed in passing in a footnote whether the date of commission or conviction of a crime triggered its retroactivity analysis, we think this discussion was meant to alert us to some of the interpretive and practical challenges posed by \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), but not to definitively resolve them.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The government also claims that our own past decisions foreclose Centurion\u2019s present petition. However, the decisions on which the government relies, <em>Centurion I </em>and <em>Domond v. INS, </em>244 F.3d 81 (2d Cir. 2001), concerned AEDPA and IIRIRA\u2019s limitation and elimination of \u00a7 212(c) relief, not IIRIRA\u2019s elimination of the <em>Fleuti </em>doctrine. Crucially, in the \u00a7 212(c) context, \u201c[i]t [was] the conviction, not the underlying criminal act, that triggered] the disqualification from \u00a7 212(c) relief.\u201d <em>Domond, </em>244 F.3d at 85-86 (quoting <em>St. Cyr v. INS, </em>229 F.3d 406, 418 (2d Cir. 2000)) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the present context, the underlying criminal act triggers the necessity of applying for readmission into the United States. As such, <em>Centurion I </em>and <em>Domond </em>do not control the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">To fully explain the limited relevance of <em>Centurion I </em>and <em>Domond </em>to our present decision, it is necessary to chart the trajectory of judicial decisions following the passage of AEDPA and IIRIRA. AEDPA barred aliens who had committed certain crimes from receiving relief under \u00a7 212(c), and IIRIRA then repealed \u00a7 212(c) altogether. <em>See </em>AEDPA, Pub. L. No. 104-132, \u00a7 440(d), 110 Stat. 1214, 1277; IIRIRA, Pub. L. No. 104-208, \u00a7 304(b), 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-597. In <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), the Supreme Court held that AEDPA and IIRIRA\u2019s limitation and elimination of \u00a7 212(c) relief did not apply to aliens convicted of relevant crimes before the passage of AEDPA and IIRI-RA. <em>Id. </em>at 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271. In other words, such persons could still make use of \u00a7 212(c). In <em>Domond, </em>this Court clarified that AEDPA\u2019s limitations on \u00a7 212(c) relief did apply if an alien only committed the relevant offense before AEDPA\u2019s passage, but was convicted of the offense after AEDPA\u2019s passage. 244 F.3d at 85-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Because <em>Domond </em>barred Centurion from seeking \u00a7 212(c) relief, Centurion argued on his prior appeal that <em>Domond </em>did not survive the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Var\u00edelas II. </em>In <em>Centurion I, </em>this Court held that <em>Domond </em>survived <em>Var\u00edelas II </em>because <em>Var\u00edelas II </em>did not address whether the date of commission or the date of conviction of a crime was the key date for retroactivity purposes. <em>Centurion I, </em>755 F.3d at 123. <em>Centurion I </em>does not directly control the outcome of this case because <em>Centurion I </em>concerned the retroactivity of the elimination of \u00a7 212(c) relief, not the retroactivity of \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v). In addition, the reasoning of <em>Centurion I </em>is not applicable here because <em>Centurion I </em>did not decide the retroactivity issue as a matter of first impression. <em>Centurion I </em>focused on whether <em>Var\u00edelas II </em>had <em>sub silentio </em>overruled a binding Second Circuit precedent, <em>Domond, </em>rather than on the underlying question of the crucial date for a retro-activity analysis. There is no controlling precedent analogous to <em>Domond </em>that resolves the retroactivity issue with respect to \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), as opposed to the repeal of \u00a7 212(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Although <em>Centurion I </em>is of only minimal relevance to our present decision, the reasoning of <em>Domond </em>is applicable. However, Domond\u2019s insights play out differently in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>the \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) context than in the \u00a7 212(c) context. Specifically, our holding in <em>Domond </em>that the date of conviction was the key date for retroactivity purposes in the \u00a7 212(c) context rested on three key points. Each cuts the other way in the present context. First and most importantly, in <em>Domond, </em>we observed that \u201c[i]t is the conviction, not the underlying criminal act, that triggers the disqualification from \u00a7 212(c) relief.\u201d 244 F.3d at 85-86 (quoting <em>St. Cyr, </em>229 F.3d at 418) (internal quotation marks omitted). By contrast, in the present case, the plain language of \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) attaches consequences when a lawful permanent resident \u201chas committed an offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Second, in <em>Domond, </em>we stated that \u201cwaivers available from [\u00a7 ] 212(c) hearings were purely discretionary. Therefore, loss of the [\u00a7 ] 212(c) hearings, while clearly a hardship, does not impose a new legal consequence on [petitioner\u2019s] pre-AEDPA conduct.\u201d 244 F.3d at 86. Unlike the loss of purely discretionary \u00a7 212(c)' relief, \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) imposes definite new legal consequences, not attenuated hardships, on lawful permanent residents. Without \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) a lawful permanent resident who has committed certain crimes would \u201cnot be regarded as seeking an admission into the United States for purposes of the immigration laws\u201d upon reentry, but under \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) the same lawful permanent resident is regarded as seeking admission to the United States (and is deemed inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Third, in <em>Domond, </em>we concluded that any reliance interests were minimal: \u201c \u2018[i]t would border on the absurd to argue\u2019 that [petitioner] would have decided not to commit a crime if he had known that he not only could be imprisoned, but also could face deportation without the availability of a discretionary waiver of deportation.\u201d 244 F.3d at 86 (first alteration in original) (quoting <em>St. Cyr, </em>229 F.3d at 418). We reiterated this view in our opinion in <em>Vartelas I, </em>620 F.3d at 120 (quoting <em>St. Cyr, </em>229 F.3d at 418) (citing <em>Domond, </em>244 F.3d at 86). However, in its opinion in <em>Var\u00edelas II, </em>the Supreme Court specifically overturned our assessment of the likelihood of an alien\u2019s reliance on immigration law when choosing to commit a crime. <em>See </em>566 U.S. at 272-75, 132 S.Ct. 1479. The <em>Var\u00edelas II </em>Court stated that the <em>Var\u00edelas II </em>petitioner \u201clikely relied on [pre-IIRI-RA] immigration law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273,132 S.Ct. 1479. Moreover, the Court explained that reliance interests were not \u201cessential to the application of the retroactivity principle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275, 132 S.Ct. 1479. To the extent that reliance interests are relevant, Centurion is similarly situated to the petitioner in <em>Var\u00edelas II: </em>he might have been deterred from committing his crime had he known his conduct would bar him from leaving the United States for a brief trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Because each of the three bases of the <em>Domond </em>decision weigh in Centurion\u2019s favor in the present context, we reach the opposite conclusion from <em>Domond: </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) does not apply retroactively as of the date of commission of a drug offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we GRANT the petition for review, VACATE the BIA\u2019s January 27, 2015 order, and REMAND the case to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-5\">. As will be discussed in greater detail below, the Supreme Court overruled <em>Var\u00edelas I </em>in part. Contrary to our decision in <em>Var\u00edelas I, </em>the Supreme Court held that IIRIRA could not be applied retroactively to deprive Varte-las of the <em>Fleuti </em>doctrine. <em>Vartelas v. Holder, </em>566 U.S. 257, 275-76, 132 S.Ct. 1479, 182 L.Ed.2d 473 (2012) <em>(\u201cVar\u00edelas II\u201d). </em>The Court left untouched the portion of our decision in which we deferred to the BIA and held that IIRIRA overruled the <em>Fleuti </em>doctrine. Indeed, it explicitly \"assume[d], but [did] not decide, that IIRIRA\u2019s amendments to \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(A) abrogated <em>Fleuti.\u201d Vartelas II, </em>566 U.S. at 262 n.2, 132 S.Ct. 1479. Thus, we adhere to the portion of our decision in <em>Var\u00edelas I </em>that remains good law, as we would in any event, since the BIA's determination that IIRIRA overruled <em>Fleuti </em>was reasonable. <em>See In re Collado-Munoz, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1061, 1065 (BIA 1998). Moreover, since both <em>Var\u00edelas </em>decisions were issued, we have recognized in dicta that \"IIRIRA superseded <em>Fleuti.\u201d Nu\u00f1ez Pe\u00f1a v.
