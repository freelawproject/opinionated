Concluding that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, we vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Plaintiff Melvin O\u2019Carroll (O\u2019Carroll) held a valid flight ticket issued by Chaparral Airlines (Chaparral) for passage between Portland, Maine and Alexandria, Louisiana. The entire trip was to have taken several hours, and was comprised of three flight segments: Portland to Boston, Boston to Dallas (DFW) and DFW to Alexandria. Early in his journey, O\u2019Carroll met a cousin, Robert Rollins (Rollins), and the two traveled together consuming a number of beers en route. Shortly after O\u2019Carroll and Rollins boarded the Chaparral flight at DFW for the final leg of their journey, a commotion arose on the aircraft. Testimony at trial indicated that O\u2019Carroll and Rollins asked a flight attendant for liquor immediately after boarding and were loud, boisterous and intoxicated. At one point, Rollins advised the pilot that he (Rollins) would \u201chelp him fly the plane.\u201d During the ensuing chain of events, Chaparral discovered an irregularity with O\u2019Carroll\u2019s ticket. A flight attendant asked O\u2019Carroll to deplane and check with the gate agent regarding the ticket mix-up; O\u2019Carroll, however, uttering obscenities, refused to move. Ultimately, after being summoned by the Chaparral Captain, the police arrived and removed O\u2019Carroll and Rollins from the aircraft. The two were thereafter charged with disorderly conduct and jailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">O\u2019Carroll brought the instant action in United States District Court asserting various state law claims because of what O\u2019Carroll alleged to be his wrongful exclusion from the Chaparral flight. Jurisdiction of the district court was based entirely on diversity of citizenship. After a trial before a jury, a verdict was returned which awarded O\u2019Carroll $260,273.23 in damages. The Magistrate denied Chaparral\u2019s subsequent Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict and Chaparral\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss. Thereafter, the Magistrate entered judgment on the jury\u2019s verdict and Chaparral timely perfected this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">Chaparral argues that the state law claims which formed the basis of O\u2019Carroll\u2019s action are preempted by federal law. We agree. There are three instances where federal law will be found to preempt state law. First, Congress may expressly preempt state law. <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, </em>463 U.S. 85, 95, 103 S.Ct. 2890, 2899, 77 L.Ed.2d 490, 500 (1983). Second, congressional intent to preempt may be inferred, generally from the pervasiveness of the federal regulatory scheme. <em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 U.S. 218, 230, 67 S.Ct. 1146, 1152, 91 L.Ed. 1447, 1459 (1947). Third, when state law conflicts with federal law or interferes with the achievement of congressional objectives, preemption occurs even though state law may not be displaced in its entirety. <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, </em>373 U.S. 132, 142-43, 83 S.Ct. 1210, 1217, 10 L.Ed.2d 248, 257 (1963); <em>Hines v. Davidowitz, </em>312 U.S. 52, 67-68, 61 S.Ct. 399, 404, 85 L.Ed. 581, 587 (1941). The existence of any of these circumstances is sufficient to establish preemption. <em>See Michigan Canners &amp; Freezers Ass\u2019n v. Agricultural Marketing &amp; Bargaining Board, </em>467 U.S. 461, 469, 104 S.Ct. 2518, 2523, 81 L.Ed.2d 399, 406 (1984) (summarizing three types of preemption).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">There can be no question that the Federal Aviation Act applies to the regulation of air travel. Section 1511 vests an air carrier with broad discretion with respect to whom will be granted or denied passage. Section 1511 reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-13\">Subject to reasonable rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation, any such carrier may also refuse transportation of a passenger or property when, in the opinion of the carrier, such transportation would or might be mimical to safety of flight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-14\">49 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1511(a). The discretion conferred by the above section, while decidedly expansive, is not unfettered. Section 1374 provides that all air carriers must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-15\">provide safe and adequate service, equipment, and facilities ... [and] establish, observe, and enforce just and reasonable ... rules, regulations and practices relat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>ing to [air travel].... No carrier or foreign air carrier shall make, give, or cause any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person ... or subject any particular person ... to any unjust discrimination or any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOu\">49 U.S.C.App. \u00a7\u00a7 1374(a)(1) &amp; 1374(b). Further, an implied cause of action against an air carrier under section 1374 for abuse of the discretion accorded it by virtue of section 1511 has been recognized. <em>See Diefenthal v. C.A.B., </em>681 F.2d 1039, 1050 (5th Cir.1982); <em>see also Mason v. Belieu, </em>543 F.2d 215 (D.C.Cir.1987) <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 852, 97 S.Ct. 144, 50 L.Ed.2d 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">While the pervasive breadth of the Act as discerned from the language quoted above would tend to indicate congressional preemptive intent, there is no need to rely upon inference alone as section 1305, which is entitled \u201cFederal Preemption,\u201d expressly preempts state law and reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">[N]o State ... shall enact or enforce any law, rule, regulation, standard, or other provision having the force and effect of law relating to rates, routes, or services of any air carrier having authority under subchapter IV of this chapter to provide air transportation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">49 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1305(a)(1). In view of this explicit manifestation of congressional intent, we conclude that O\u2019Carroll\u2019s common law claims are preempted by section 1305 and thus the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the instant action. <em>See also Cippollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., </em>593 F.Supp. 1146 (D.C.N.J.1984), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>789 F.2d 181. Consequently, we need not reach any other issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Because O\u2019Carroll, in his complaint, alleged only state law based claims, and because we have determined that Congress intended through section 1305 to preempt state law based claims, we conclude that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the instant suit. The judgment of the district court is therefore vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">VACATED.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">On petition for rehearing, appellant Melvin O\u2019Carroll contends that 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1506 preserves his state law based negligence claims. Section 1506 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-13\">Nothing contained in this chapter shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute, but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-14\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1506. In making this contention, however, O\u2019Carroll overlooks the fact that section 1305, entitled \u201cFederal Preemption\u201d was enacted by Congress well after section 1506. Therefore, we conclude that section 1305 is a clear indication of congressional intent to preempt and is controlling. The petition for rehearing is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
