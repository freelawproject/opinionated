They seized \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine and marijuana in a back bedroom where two men were hiding in a closet, and another was \u201cat the end of the bed.\u201d None of the three had any personal effects in the room. The defendant was not in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">In another bedroom, furnished only with a futon bed, police seized sixteen small plastic bags of marijuana in one large bag, eight larger individually wrapped bags of marijuana in another large bag, \u201cGlad plastic bags\u201d and small bags printed with an \u201capple.\u201d No one was present in the room. The police also found a Massachusetts identification card with the defendant\u2019s name and picture, and an envelope addressed to him at a different address which had been postmarked on October 27, 2003. The defendant\u2019s address on the identification card was 49 Bullard Street, the same address as appeared on the envelope. No other personal effects of the defendant, or any personal effects of the three individuals observed in the rear bedroom were found in the vacant bedroom. The defendant was charged only for the marijuana found in the room where his identification was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>The motion for a required finding of not </em>guilty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant argues that his motion for a required finding of not guilty should have been allowed because the evidence failed to link him with the marijuana found in the vacant bedroom. He argues that the evidence, at most, showed his presence in the apartment sometime prior to the date of the search, but because he previously had moved out of the apartment, was not the target of surveillance or the subject of the search warrant, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>was not present at the time of the search, the evidence was insufficient to show that he exercised any control of the apartment or its contents. He also argues that the discovery of his identification card and a piece of mail in the vacant bedroom, with no indication where they were found or if or how they were proximately related to the marijuana, was insufficient to establish constructive possession of the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">We review the question of sufficiency of the evidence under the familiar <em>Latimore </em>standard, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-678 (1979), viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. To convict a defendant on a theory of constructive possession, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had knowledge of the contraband, coupled with the ability and intention to exercise dominion and control over it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, </em>405 Mass. 401, 409 (1989). In general, intent to exercise control \u201cis not easily susceptible of proof and is a close question.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sadberry, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 934, 936 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Our typical constructive possession cases tend to concern situations where the defendant is present and we turn to other incriminating evidence to determine whether there is sufficient evidence of constructive possession. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Figueroa, 74 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 784, 786 (2009). Here, the defendant was not present and the only indicia on the Commonwealth\u2019s case that he may have been present was an identification card in his name and an envelope addressed to him at a different address.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The identification card and the envelope did not, in and of themselves, show beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had knowledge of the presence of the marijuana and did not prove, even considering any reasonable inferences, that the defendant had the intent and ability to exercise dominion and control over the marijuana. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frongillo (No. 1), </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 677, 682-683 (2006) (evidence was insufficient to show that defendant intended to exercise dominion and control over guns and ammunition found in bedroom closet of fianc\u00e9e\u2019s apartment where defendant was in vicinity of apartment but not present at time of search and no evidence connected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>defendant to guns and ammunition other than unidentified men\u2019s clothing), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schmieder, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 300, 303 (2003) (documentary evidence that defendant rented dwelling is relevant to constructive possession). There was no evidence that the defendant \u201crented, occupied, spent a great deal of time at or exercised control over the apartment or its contents.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caterino, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 685, 689 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">No cases have been brought to our attention, and we are not aware of any, where we have concluded that there was sufficient evidence of constructive possession despite the defendant\u2019s absence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duffy, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 655, 660 (1976); <em>Commonwealth v. Booker, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 435, 438 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delarosa, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 623, 628 (2000) (all cases in which court specifically notes defendant\u2019s absence at time police discovered contraband and concludes that there was insufficient evidence of constructive possession). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePina, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 842, 854 (2009) (sufficient evidence of constructive possession where defendant walked toward building in which contraband found, with set of keys that unlocked building\u2019s main door, apartment front door, and door to bedroom where drugs were found). Accordingly, we conclude that the motion for required finding should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">\n<em>Judgments shall enter for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-14\"> The defendant was convicted by a Boston Municipal Court jury in September, 2007, of (1) possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, G.

Respectfully I dissent from the reasoning and result advanced by my colleagues. For the following reasons, I conclude (1) that the evidence supported the jury\u2019s verdict of guilt of constructive possession of marijuana with intent to distribute; and (2) that the admission of the drug analysis certification of marijuana constituted harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">1. <em>Proof of constructive possession, </em>a. <em>Standards. </em>In review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>of the denial of a motion for a directed finding of not guilty, the appellate court examines the entire evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and without regard to contrary evidence presented by the defendant in order to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979). Several corollaries expand upon that standard. \u201cCircumstantial evidence is competent to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merola, </em>405 Mass. 529, 533 (1989), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nadworny, </em>396 Mass. 342, 354 (1985), cert. denied, 477 U.S. 904 (1986). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rojas, </em>388 Mass. 626, 629 (1983). The resulting inferences \u201cneed only be reasonable and possible; [they] need not be necessary or inescapable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beckett, </em>373 Mass. 329, 341 (1977). In the aggregate, the evidence need not compel a finding of guilt; it need only permit that finding beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>440 Mass. 396, 401 (2003). The prosecution does not need to \u201cexclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence, provided [that] the record as a whole supports a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merola, supra </em>at 533, quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Systems Architects, Inc., </em>757 F.2d 373, 377 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 847 (1985). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoico, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 559, 563 (1998). Determination of credibility belongs to the jury, especially if (as here) the defendant testified. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Festa, </em>369 Mass. 419, 424-425 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">To prove the specific offense of constructive possession of contraband, the Commonwealth must establish (1) the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the location of the material, and (2) his \u201cability and intention to exercise dominion and control\u201d over it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, </em>405 Mass. 401, 409 (1989), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 498 (1984). As the majority point out, the nature of constructive possession typically requires proof by circumstantial evidence. <em>Ante </em>at 704. Mere presence in proximity to the contraband is not sufficient. Presence plus other incriminating circumstances can satisfy the standard of proof. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, supra </em>at 409-410, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albano, </em>373 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>132, 134 (1977). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 222, 226 (1993). \u201cWhen contraband is found in a dwelling shared by a defendant and one or more other persons, a finder of fact may properly infer that the defendant is in possession of the contraband (not necessarily exclusive possession) from evidence that the contraband was found in proximity to personal effects of the defendant in areas of the dwelling, such as a bedroom or closet, to which other evidence indicates the defendant has a particular relationship.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rarick, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 912, 912 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The record indicates that the defendant moved orally under Mass.R.Crim.P. 25(a), 378 Mass. 896 (1979), for a required finding of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. It does not show whether he renewed that motion at the close of all the evidence under Mass.R.Crim.P. 25(b)(1), 378 Mass. 896 (1979). I will assume that he did so and measure the evidence at each point. If the evidence were insufficient to permit any rational trier of fact to find the essential elements of constructive possession at the first point, he would be entitled to the directed finding. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>370 Mass. 147, 150 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, supra </em>at 676. Typically we assess the evidence at the second point to determine whether the Commonwealth\u2019s proof deteriorated after the presentation of its case-in-chief. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheline, </em>391 Mass. 279, 283 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>401 Mass. 338, 343 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">b. <em>The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. </em>The prosecution introduced the following evidence connecting the defendant to the storage of the marijuana. The bedroom holding the twenty-four bags of marijuana was almost barren. It contained none of the accessories of normal habitation (clothes, toiletries, chairs, lamps, radio, television, reading material, papers). Its contents were a futon bed, the contraband and packaging, and two personal effects of the defendant. It was functioning solely as a drug distribution chamber. Any visitor to the room would have known of that use.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The only personal effects in the room and the only personal connection to the room belonged to the defendant. One was his identification card and the other a letter addressed to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>subsequent address in an envelope postmarked on October 27, 2003. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s particular connection to the room where the [marijuana] was discovered may be inferred from the fact that his identification. . . card was found there.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 167, 168-169 (2000). \u201c[A]n inference of possession may be drawn from the close proximity between [the defendant\u2019s] personal belongings and the drugs.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Antonio, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 937, 938 (1998). The exclusivity of the defendant\u2019s connection to the bedroom strengthened proof of his possession of its contents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The condition of the room supported the inference that the defendant had not accidentally left the identification card and letter nor overlooked them in the clutter of a typically inhabited room. Aside from the futon and the marijuana, they were the only items in the room. The plausible inference was that the defendant had knowingly left them because he was returning to the room on a continuous basis. In particular, he would need his identification card, a credential of daily use comparable to that of a driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">In addition, one of the police officers executing the search warrant described the quantities of cocaine and marijuana seized from the other bedroom. That testimony substantiated a scenario of drug dealing of which a visitor or occupant would reasonably have been aware. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 396, 399 (1998), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">In the aggregate, this circumstantial evidence placed the contraband in proximity to the defendant\u2019s personal effects, connected him to the wider scene of drug activity in the apartment, and linked him to the marijuana in the bedroom by a \u201cparticular relationship.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rarick, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. at 912. As the trial judge ruled, the defendant was not entitled to a directed finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">c. <em>The defendant\u2019s evidence. </em>Rather than cause deterioration, the defendant\u2019s evidence magnified the case against him. He revealed a familiarity with the apartment. He had recently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>completed a substantial occupancy. He testified that he had resided there for about two years with his aunt. As the result of her recent death, he had moved out as of the end of September, 2003. He therefore knew of the vacancy of the unit and of its availability for drug running, and could easily have retained keys for access. The jury could reasonably infer his awareness of the substantial scale of apparent dealing (three perpetrators and two rooms of inventory) springing up during the short and disputable duration (as discussed below) since his departure as a full-time resident. He provided evidence that his presence in the apartment was ongoing. In his words, the identification card was an item \u201cwhich I would need to use anywhere I would go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Adu\">Finally, the defendant testified and became trapped in a falsehood about his presence in the room storing the marijuana. His direct testimony was that he had permanently left the apartment by the end of September, 2003, six weeks before the warranted search and seizure of November 15. By cross-examination the prosecutor pressed him about the presence of the letter found in the room, addressed to him at his subsequent residence, and postmarked on October 27, or about four weeks after his alleged departure.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\"><em>Q. </em>\u201cThank you, sir. Mr. Humphries, there\u2019s one more thing though I want to ask you, just one more thing I want to ask you: You see, the thing that I have trouble understanding \u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">Prosecutor: \u201cMay I approach, judge?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">The court: \u201cAll right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\"><em>Q. </em>\u201c\u2014 is you say that you left the stuff behind, right?

If you were already out, why was that left behind? Do you see what I\u2019m saying? Because if you were living there after you lived at 15 Wentworth [the site of the apartment]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-11\">A. <em>\u201cAha\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">(Emphasis supplied). As recounted in the margin, this line of questioning continued with no improvement in the defendant\u2019s responses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury observed the entire course of questioning and were entitled to weigh both the defendant\u2019s inadequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>answers and his demeanor as evidence of mendacity. They could justifiably view his attempted concealment of his presence in the marijuana room as evidence of consciousness of guilt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>442 Mass. 554, 565-566 &amp; n.9 (2004), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Auclair, </em>444 Mass. 348, 360-361 (2005) (lying may constitute evidence of consciousness of guilt).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Finally, the doctrine of constructive possession does not command the presence of the defendant simultaneously with the discovery and seizure of drugs by the police. That circumstance may strengthen the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, but it does not constitute a requirement for conviction. Constructive possession functions as a realistic alternative to actual possession. Physical separation of the defendant from the contraband is a premise of the doctrine. We cannot feasibly require a drug dealer to be at the scene of a search at the moment at which the police execute a warrant. Evidence specifically linking the defendant to the storage site of the drugs can be sufficient for constructive possession. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePina, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 842, 854 (2009) (police arrest the defendant outside a dwelling; his keys to the apartment and bedroom containing cocaine connect him to the contraband and permit a finding of constructive possession and trafficking).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">In sum, the defendant\u2019s lengthy familiarity with and access to the apartment, the presence of his personal effects in the room, the apparent exclusivity of his connection to the room, his infer-able continuing presence there, and his self-defeating testimony and demeanor provided the jury with ample evidence for a finding of constructive possession.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">2. <em>Proof of intent to distribute. </em>The circumstantial evidence abundantly supported a finding of intent to distribute. Typical indicia are the quantities of the contraband, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number><em>Pratt, </em>407 Mass. 647, 652-653 (1990); its packaging, <em>id. </em>at 653; and the absence of implements or paraphernalia of personal consumption; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Labitue, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 913, 914 (2000). The -twenty-four bags, comprised of sixteen smaller and eight larger units, the unfilled additional plastic bags, and the absence of any signs of habitation or use, identified the bedroom as a site in a chain of distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">3. <em>Admission of the certificates of drug analysis. </em>The trial occurred in September of 2007. At that time the certificates identifying the nature of the marijuana were admissible under the rule of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Verde, </em>444 Mass. 279, 282-285 (2005). The Supreme Court\u2019s decision of <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>129 S. Ct. 2527, 2532 (2009), subsequently overruled <em>Verde </em>and rendered the certificates as tainted evidence in violation of the right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Trial defense counsel objected to the admission of the first two of eight certificates upon authority of <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 59, 68-69 (2004). Under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>456 Mass. 350, 355-360 (2010), the admission of all eight certificates are treated as preserved error without any requirement of timely objection by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Therefore under the doctrine of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23-24 (1967), we ask whether the admission of the certificates was beyond a reasonable doubt merely harmless error. Or does the record show \u201ca reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction\u201d? <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Fahy </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>375 U.S. 85, 86-87 (1963). We examine the following as useful, but not exclusive or exhaustive, factors: (1) the weight or quantum of proper evidence of guilt; (2) the importance of the tainted evidence to the prosecution\u2019s case; (3) the character of the tainted evidence as merely cumulative of the valid evidence or as independently probative; (4) the relationship between the improper evidence and the premise of the defense; (5) the frequency of reference to that evidence (presumably in both testimony and argument); and (6) the identity of the party introducing the evidence (typically the Commonwealth in certification cases). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dagraca, </em>447 Mass. 546, 553 (2006). <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. Tyree, 455 Mass. 676, 700-702 (2010). Com<em>monwealth </em>v. Vasquez, <em>supra </em>at 360-361 n. 12. An additional factor is the use or effect of curative instructions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahdi, </em>388 Mass. 679, 697 (1983). Under these criteria, I conclude that the Commonwealth has carried its burden to show that the admission of the certificates did not infect the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Independent proof of the nature of the contraband as marijuana was powerful. The Commonwealth\u2019s main witness was the Boston police detective in charge of the warranted search of the apartment. His training included instruction at \u201cnarcotics investigation schools\u201d and the \u201cFBI\u2019s undercover school.\u201d He had served in the department\u2019s drug control unit for eight of his eleven years of experience. He had participated in 2,000 to 2,500 cases (at an approximate rate of 300 per year) of drug investigation. From that experience he knew marijuana to be a green, leafy vegetable material with a strong characteristic odor. Those features make marijuana a far more identifiable item than the powdery or solidified forms typical of cocaine and heroin. Independently of the certificates, he identified the bags of material from the bedroom as marijuana and the unused plastic bags as packaging.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Further, the certificates of marijuana analysis had no relationship to the premise of the defense. The theme of the defense in both opening and closing statements was that the defendant lacked connection to, and possession of, the contraband. In both statements, defense counsel conceded the composition of the marijuana.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It was not a contested issue. Even so, the percipient and uncontested testimony of the experienced drug officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>fulfilled the Commonwealth\u2019s obligation to prove that element of the charged offense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commonwealth supplemented the drug officer\u2019s identification of the twenty-four bags of marijuana with two certificates. In his closing the prosecutor made no reference to them. The judge made no reference to them in his instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">In sum, (1) proper evidence of guilt was potent; (2) the importance of the uncontested tainted evidence to the prosecution\u2019s case was slight; (3) the character of that evidence was cumulative of the valid evidence; (4) the relationship of the improper evidence to the premise of the defense (lack of possession) was nonexistent; and (5) the frequency of reference to the certificates was minimal. The only material issue for the jury was the question of constructive possession. The admission of the certificates was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. I would therefore affirm the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-9\"> See Holmes, The Common Law, 168-174 (1981) (Howe ed., Little Brown 1963) (the common law of possession reduced to two elements: physical control or the capacity for physical control over an object; and the intent to exclude others from such control).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b752-13\"> <em>Q. </em>\u201c\u2014 you know, how could that have been left behind when you were at 15 Wentworth when you had moved there after 15 Went-worth?\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-14\">A. \u201cIt was part of the materials that I had was in my bags that I probably when I took my mail and everything some of my stuff over there, that was probably waiting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-15\"><em>Q. </em>\u201cWait, I thought that you had moved out before October 1st?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-16\">A. \u201cNo \u2014 exactly.

The ensuing sections 2 and 3 respond to the arguments of insufficient proof of intent to distribute and the claimed harm from the admission of the certificates of marijuana analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">The defendant\u2019s final contention was that the admission of evidence of the presence of cocaine and marijuana in the second bedroom unfairly caused him prejudice. For several reasons, the admission was proper. Its probative value outweighed any prejudicial impact. The contraband in the second room illustrated the scale of operation in the apartment and the defendant\u2019s likely knowledge of that operation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. at 399-400. Further, the trial judge emphatically instructed the jury, \u201cI want to stress to you, [the defendant] is not charged with the cocaine possession or the marijuana from the first bedroom where the three individuals were allegedly located.\u201d Finally, the evidence served as the basis for the main hypothesis of his defense: that the marijuana imputed to him belonged to the persons in the other bedroom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b756-7\"> In opening remarks, defense counsel stated to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-8\">\u201c[Y]ou will hear the police officer say, \u2018We found marijuana. We found marijuana.\u2019 Great, we know they found marijuana, we believe them. We don\u2019t disbelieve the police on this. They found marijuana but it is not Mr. Humphries1-\u2019'1.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">The closing remarks were consistent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-10\">\u201cWhat has the government really proved? There were drugs, absolutely, absolutely there were drugs. You will be able to touch them, feel them, smell them [as exhibits].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">Acknowledgment by defense counsel of the nature of the contraband in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>course of their opening and closing statements may not constitute formal stipulations within the contemplation of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>456 Mass. 378, 383 (2010), but they exert a powerful impact upon the trial. Under the usual factors for assessment of harmlessness, they effectively concede the disconnection of the certificate from the defense and consequently the minimal importance of that evidence to the prosecution\u2019s case. In addition, appellate tolerance of such arguments depreciates the labor and integrity of the trial process. If defense counsel concedes the composition of the substance in an opening or closing statement, or both, he deadens the issue for the deliberation of the jury and misdirects the attention of the judge (and possibly the attention of the prosecutor) to other evidence and issues. The defendant effectively eliminates the issue from the deliberation of the jury, and then renounces the acknowledgment on appeal. While the expanding concept of judicial estoppel has not yet extended from civil to criminal litigation, see <em>New Hampshire </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>532 U.S. 742, 749-751 (2001); <em>Otis </em>v. <em>Arbella Mut. Ins. Co., </em>443 Mass. 634, 639-642 (2005), its underlying values warrant some consideration in all litigation. Easy forgiveness of misdirecting arguments wastes the efforts of the trial judge and jury, and undermines the intellectual integrity of the fact-finding process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b757-7\"> As to the school zone violation, it was undisputed that the apartment was located 712 feet from the grounds of Dorchester High School.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
