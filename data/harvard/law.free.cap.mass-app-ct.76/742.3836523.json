We vacate the judgment dismissing the petition for guardianship and remand the matter to the Juvenile Court for a prompt trial on the petition. We dismiss the appeal from the order of the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">1. <em>Background</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Phelan was bom in the State of Georgia in December of 1997; no father was listed on his birth certificate. Before Phelan\u2019s birth, the aunt, who then apparently resided in Georgia, was granted custody of five of Phelan\u2019s older siblings by a Georgia court. In 2003, a Georgia court found Phelan and his sister, May, to be \u201cdeprived\u201d and ordered that temporary custody of the children be removed from their biological mother and placed with the aunt (who had moved to Massachusetts) \u201cunder the protective supervision\u201d of the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families (department). After a finding in 2004 that the two children continued to be \u201cdeprived,\u201d the Georgia court ordered that \u201clong term relative placement of the children is granted to the . . . aunt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>On November 2, 2005, the department filed a care and protection petition against the aunt on behalf of Phelan and four of his siblings alleging physical abuse (corporal punishment) of the children by the aunt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A judge of the Juvenile Court awarded emergency temporary custody of the children to the department on that date, and Phelan was placed in a foster home. On November 7, 2005, the aunt waived her right to a seventy-two hour hearing, and the judge awarded temporary custody of the children to the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">On September 15, 2006, the aunt, represented by counsel, stipulated to a finding of unfitness, and the children were found in need of care and protection. At the time the aunt stipulated to unfitness, the department\u2019s goal was reunification of the children with the aunt. However, by late October, 2006, the department had changed its goal with respect to Phelan and May to adoption.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">In May, 2007, the aunt filed a motion to stay the care and protection proceedings pending the resolution of certain jurisdictional issues. After a hearing, the Juvenile Court judge rejected the aunt\u2019s jurisdictional challenges and determined further that the aunt had never been conferred with guardianship status with respect to Phelan and had no other standing to participate in the care and protection proceedings. The aunt did not appeal the judge\u2019s order dated September 5, 2007.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">On September 14, 2007, the aunt filed the instant petition for appointment of guardian of minor child pursuant to G. L. c. 201, in which she sought to be appointed guardian of Phelan, with custody. A hearing on the merits of the petition was scheduled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>for January 25, 2008. In the meantime, a hearing was scheduled on that same date on the department\u2019s permanency plan (dated November 15, 2007) in the care and protection case, in which the department sought to place Phelan for adoption. Although lacking party status in the care and protection proceeding, in both proceedings the aunt filed objections to the department\u2019s permanency plan and submitted an alternative permanency plan in which she requested that Phelan be reunited with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">On January 23, 2008, the aunt filed a motion to intervene in the care and protection action with respect to Phelan and May. She also filed a motion requesting the judge to consolidate and order a joint hearing on the merits in the care and protection and guardianship matters (and to grant her full party status in the care and protection proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">On January 25, 2008, the aunt\u2019s motions to intervene and to consolidate were denied (although the denials appear only on the docket in the care and protection proceeding), the petition for guardianship was referred to mediation,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, after a hearing, the judge approved the department\u2019s permanent plan of adoption for Phelan and determined that the department had made reasonable efforts to implement that plan. The aunt did not attempt to appeal from the orders denying her motions to intervene and to consolidate.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">The biological mother executed an adoption surrender with respect to Phelan on March 14, 2008, and on October 9, 2008, the judge terminated the parental rights of any unknown or unnamed father. A guardian ad litem for Phelan was also appointed in the guardianship proceeding and filed an \u201cupdated report.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">2. <em>The motion to dismiss. </em>On December 15, 2008, the department and the child filed a joint motion to dismiss the guardianship petition (unsupported by affidavit), which was heard on December 16, the day trial on the petition was to commence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the time of the hearing on the motion, it was undisputed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>three of the four siblings (including May) who were removed with Phelan from the aunt\u2019s custody through the care and protection proceeding had been returned to the aunt\u2019s care and custody.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It was the department\u2019s position at the hearing, as well as that of then counsel for Phelan, that notwithstanding the reunification of Phelan\u2019s siblings with the aunt, Phelan had been in his preadoptive foster home since 2005 and, as evidenced, in part, by the guardian ad litem\u2019s updated report (which was before the judge), had psychologically bonded with his preadoptive family and had been thriving in that home, had consistently expressed his view that he did not wish to return to the care and custody of the aunt, and had suffered emotional scars from his time with the aunt that would render his return to the aunt traumatic. Continuing, counsel noted that the guardian ad litem had recommended that Phelan remain in his preadoptive home and that adoption be completed as soon as possible, and that the current plan for adoption had been approved by the judge in the care and protection proceeding.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In counsels\u2019 view, even if they were to \u201cstipulate to anything [the aunt\u2019s counsel] were to present to the court,\u201d there simply could be no basis for the judge to conclude that it was necessary, convenient, and in Phelan\u2019s best interests to be placed in the permanent guardianship of the aunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The aunt, in response, stated through counsel that the department and the child\u2019s attorney were, in effect, attempting to turn their motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment and that there were contested issues for trial in the case. More specifically, counsel asserted that the aunt had \u201cevidence to put [i]n\u201d that would show that things had changed since September, 2006: she had engaged a therapist and participated in a program for African-American families to help her address and change the disciplinary system she had grown up with, she had renounced and refrained from the use of physical punishment with the children, and she had participated in other programs and would call witnesses to show how she had changed and how she now addressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>family and disciplinary issues, and that she, as a registered nurse and one who had participated in such programs, could assist Phelan with any issues of trauma resulting from his reunification with her and his siblings. Counsel for the aunt also represented that the siblings in her care were having difficulty visiting Phelan in his placement home<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and were \u201canxious to come in and tell the court why they wanted [Phelan] to come home and live with them at their [aunt\u2019s] house.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Counsel requested that the trial go forward so that the judge could hear the evidence \u201cthat so far [she had] only heard in reviews and in oral recitation by counsel or in written reports from [the department] or from the guardian ad litem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">At the close of the hearing on the motion to dismiss, the judge allowed orally the motion, stating that even assuming everything the aunt\u2019s counsel stated were true \u201cin terms of [the aunt] and about the siblings wanting visitation and the like,\u201d none of it was \u201cfocused on the best interests\u201d of Phelan. Rather, the judge pointed to the two care and protection actions that had been brought against the aunt which implicated Phelan and the aunt\u2019s stipulation of unfitness and the commitment of Phelan to the custody of the department. The judge noted, in addition, that she had made \u201cseveral findings\u201d based on a social worker\u2019s report that included the recommendation of Phelan\u2019s therapist that adoption was in the best interests of Phelan. Even assuming, the judge stated, that she struck all the grounds for the guardian ad litem\u2019s recommendation to which the aunt had objected, she still was left with the \u201cinescapable recommendation by the GAL, back in March of \u201807 [in the care and protection case] as well as today . . . that it is in the best interest of this child to be adopted.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The judge also made reference to statements by an expert retained by the aunt that apparently appear in the March, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>2007, guardian ad litem report that Phelan\u2019s \u201cbehavioral dis-regulation\u201d was characteristic of a child with posttraumatic stress symptoms and that Phelan\u2019s environment at the aunt\u2019s home could best be described as a \u201ctoxic environment\u201d for the child. While acknowledging that the environment in the aunt\u2019s house had changed, the judge stated: \u201c[B]ut we still have the memories of the traumatic behavior experienced in that home . . . [a]nd this is a child who needs to be stable and secure and have some predictability to his future.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">3. <em>The guardianship statute. </em>We comment initially on aspects of the guardianship statute that, to some extent, inform our analysis in the present appeals. General Laws c. 201, \u00a7 1, as in effect at the time of the proceedings in the Juvenile Court, provides, in part: \u201cThe district or juvenile court may, when it appears necessary or convenient, appoint guardians of minors if the person who is the subject of the petition is a minor and there is a proceeding before such district or juvenile court.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See Cross, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>Fleischner, &amp; Elder, Guardianship and Conservatorship in Massachusetts \u00a7 9.04 (2000) (noting that the Juvenile Courts have interpreted this jurisdiction \u201cas empowering that court to accept separate petitions for guardianship of a minor so long as an action regarding the subject child is already before that court\u201d). Commonly, the action \u201cbefore . . . [the] juvenile court\u201d will be one involving the welfare of a child under G. L. c. 119. Karp, Child Welfare Practice in Massachusetts \u00a7 19.4 (Mass. Cont. Legal Educ. 2006 &amp; Supp. 2009). See Juvenile Court Standing Order 2-07 (noting that the Juvenile Court Department has jurisdiction over three major case types involving the welfare of children and matters ancillary to these three case types including guardianship petitions). A guardianship action may arise, for example, when a relative who is not a party to a care and protection proceeding files a petition seeking placement with her of a child. See Child Welfare Practice in Massachusetts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 19.4. Although each case must be decided on its own peculiar facts, where competing plans for the placement of a child are presented to the judge through care and protection and guardianship proceedings (and particularly where, as here, the department\u2019s permanency plan goal was to place the child for adoption), the matters generally should be heard together.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Adoption of Leland, 65 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 580, 583 (2006) (guardianship petition consolidated with care and protection petition); <em>Adoption of Yvette (No. 1), </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 327, 333-334 (2008) (judge ordered that termination case and guardianship case be heard concurrently, but not consolidated, with counsel for the aunt having \u201cfull access to the proceedings and the evidence\u201d in the termination case although the aunt was not made a party thereto); Child Welfare Practice in Massachusetts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 19.4.1 (\u201cAlthough a guardianship petition filed in the Juvenile Court typically is heard together with a pending care and protection . . . case, it is a separate court action and will have its own docket number\u201d). Cf. Mass.R.Civ.P. 42(a), as amended, 423 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Mass. 1402 (1996) (allowing for consolidation when actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court). See and compare <em>Care &amp; Protection of Thomasina, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 563, 564 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">4. <em>The propriety of the dismissal of the guardianship petition. </em>The aunt argues that it was error for the judge to grant summary judgment in favor of the department and Phelan and to dismiss her guardianship petition because material facts were in dispute as to what placement was in the best interests of Phelan. The department and, to a lesser extent, appellate counsel for Phelan raise preliminary hurdles to our consideration of the aunt\u2019s contentions, arguing that the judge properly dismissed the guardianship petition as the aunt, who had numerous opportunities to participate in the care and protection proceedings (and thereby accomplish her objectives of putting herself forth as a permanent placement for Phelan) and \u201cneglected the opportunity\u201d to seek a review and redetermination of the care and protection judgment, appeal the judge\u2019s decision to terminate her participation in the care and protection proceedings, and appeal either the judge\u2019s denial of her request to consolidate the care and protection and guardianship matters or the denial of her motion to intervene. Having forgone or waived these opportunities, the department argues, the aunt \u201ccould not, through the filing of a guardianship petition, subsequently attack the trial court\u2019s judgment in the care and protection matter, based substantially upon evidence presented while she was a party to that proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">It is noteworthy that the arguments proffered by the department and counsel for Phelan were not raised in any meaningful way in the joint motion to dismiss or at the hearing on the motion. While \u201c[a] party may defend a judgment on any ground based on the record so long as raising the argument is not unfair to its opponent,\u201d <em>Perseus of N.E., MA, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>429 Mass. 163, 168 (1999), and cases cited, the particular arguments raised by the department and Phelan have the flavor of affirmative defenses, which, under rules of civil and domestic relations procedure (see discussion, <em>infra), </em>are generally waived if not set forth affirmatively. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 8(c), 365 Mass. 749 (1974); Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 8(c) (listing, for example, the affirmative defenses of waiver, estoppel, and res judicata). See also <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas, </em>428 Mass. 555, 575 n.16 (1998). Though we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>think it is questionable whether the department and counsel for Phelan properly may defend the dismissal of the guardianship petition on the arguments made, we nonetheless address these preliminary contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Contrary to the apparent assertions of the department and counsel for Phelan, we perceive nothing in the circumstances of this case that would cause us to conclude that the aunt was required either (1) to litigate exclusively in the context of the care and protection proceeding the issue of whether a guardianship placement with her was in Phelan\u2019s best interests or (2) to forgo proceeding on her guardianship petition in favor of appealing immediately all of the judge\u2019s decisions removing or excluding her from the care and protection action.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> No authority has been called to our attention that would require such a result.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> That the aunt is not a proper party in the care and protection case would not preclude her from seeking placement of Phelan through a guardianship petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">We fail to discern merit in the department\u2019s further argument that the aunt\u2019s guardianship petition was an improper collateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>attack on the \u201cunappealed\u201d decision that adoption is in Phelan\u2019s best interests. This argument seems to be based on the premise that the aunt had the opportunity to litigate fully, and appeal from, the judge\u2019s decision that it was in Phelan\u2019s best interests to be adopted rather than be placed with her. More to the point, to the extent the department may assert that the aunt had sufficient opportunity to litigate the issue whether Phelan should be placed with her through the permanency plan process contemplated by G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 29B,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> it is certainly true that the aunt engaged in that process, with some success, as late as December, 2006 (see note 4, <em>supra). </em>However, by the time permanency plan hearings were held in January, 2008 (when the judge approved the department\u2019s permanent plan for adoption for Phelan), and December, 2008, the aunt was no longer a party in the care and protection case, her party status having been terminated on September 5, 2007, and she could not appeal under the permanency plan statute. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 29B (\u201cA child, parent, guardian or the department may appeal to the appeals court from the determination or order of the trial court\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Turning to the aunt\u2019s claim that the judge erred in dismissing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>her guardianship petition, the aunt and the department disagree whether summary judgment principles provide the appropriate standard under which the judge\u2019s decision should be reviewed. The aunt, stating that it is not clear what procedural rules should be applied to a \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d a guardianship case brought in the Juvenile Court, argues that we should look by analogy to the Rules of Civil Procedure, and particularly Mass.R.Civ.P. 56, as amended, 436 Mass. 1404 (2002) (due to the judge\u2019s consideration of matters outside the pleadings, see <em>Reliance Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 550, 555 [2008]), as the \u201ccogent standard.\u201d See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Richard, </em>456 Mass. 1002, 1002 n.3 (2010), quoting from <em>Care &amp; Protection of Zelda, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 869, 871 (1989) (\u201cAlthough the rules of civil procedure are not applicable to proceedings in the Juvenile Court, Mass.R.Civ.P. 24 . . . \u2018may well be accepted as a cogent standard\u2019 \u201d). See also <em>Adoption of Reid, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 338, 341 (1995); <em>Adoption of Yvette (No. 1), </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. at 335 n.9. Cf. Rule 27B of the Probate Court Rules and Reporter\u2019s Notes (2010) (summary judgment under Mass.R.Civ.P. 56 available in at least certain probate proceedings).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>counters, asserting that the judge did not dispose of the guardianship petition by means of summary judgment, but rather on the history of the aunt\u2019s involvement with the judge, the evidence presented during the course of the care and protection proceedings to which the aunt was a party and had the opportunity to refute, and the ultimate determination that Phelan\u2019s adoption was in his best interests. We conclude that under either approach the judge erred in dismissing the petition for guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The department, while acknowledging that the aunt was excluded from the care and protection case in September, 2007, asserts that she was still a party to that case in March, 2007, when the guardian ad litem filed her original report. The department\u2019s argument is grounded, in considerable part, on its view that in dismissing the guardianship petition, the judge properly considered papers in the care and protection proceeding such as the March, 2007, report, insofar as the aunt was at the time \u201ca party [in the care and protection case] with a compelling incentive to litigate.\u201d Cf. <em>Adoption of Darla, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 519, 520-521 (2002). Even if we accept the doubtful proposition that it was proper for the judge to consider on a motion to dismiss the aunt\u2019s activities in a different case, it appears that the aunt never in fact had the opportunity to litigate with respect to the March, 2007, report. Indeed, there is no indication on the docket of the care and protection case of a contested evidentiary hearing where the March, 2007, report was offered into evidence (and the guardian ad litem made available for or subject to cross-examination), see <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>369 Mass. 598, 603 (1976); <em>Adoption of a Minor, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 468, 469 n.1 (1986), or where the aunt had the opportunity to rebut the material and opinions con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>tained in the report.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See <em>Guardianship of Pollard, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 318, 323-324 (2002). See generally <em>Care &amp; Protection of Zita, </em>455 Mass. 272 (2009). Compare and contrast <em>J.F. </em>v. <em>J.F., </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 782, 790 n.12 (2008) (where both parties relied on statements of individuals reporting to the guardian ad litem, and the mother had accepted as \u201ctrue\u201d the numerous \u201cfacts\u201d stated in her brief for purposes of summary judgment). That the judge indicated (somewhat obliquely) at the December 16, 2008, hearing on the motion to dismiss that she would, for purposes of the motion, \u201cstrike all of the grounds for the GAL\u2019s recommendation, which [were] objected to by the aunt,\u201d does not re-mediate the judge\u2019s reliance on the recommendation of the guardian ad litem (and, apparently, other statements in the guardian ad litem\u2019s report, including those of the expert retained by the aunt) in the circumstances presented.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">To similar effect, even were we to assume, as the aunt asserts, that summary judgment principles, as reflected in the Rules of Civil Procedure, are applicable in the present case,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the order dismissing the guardianship petition cannot stand. \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving parties are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Petrell </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>453 Mass. 377, 381 (2009). The moving parties \u201cmust \u2018affirmatively demonstrate] that there is no genuine issue of material fact on every relevant issue, even if [they] would have no burden on an issue if the case were to go to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Department of Rev. </em>v. <em>Mason M., </em>439 Mass. 665, 674 (2003), quoting from <em>Pederson </em>v. Time, Inc., 404 Mass. 14, 17 (1989). <em>J.F. </em>v. J.F., 72 Mass. App. Ct. at 789. \u201cAll evidentiary inferences are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing the motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 789-790. \u201cIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, a court does not resolve issues of material fact, assess credibility, or weigh evidence.\u201d <em>Kernan </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 378, 382 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">At the outset, the judge\u2019s reliance on the guardian ad litem\u2019s reports (including the statements of the expert retained by the aunt apparently appearing in the 2007 report) suffers from the infirmities we have previously discussed. The judge also seems to have assessed implicitly the credibility of the guardian ad litem.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Those points aside, the parties appear to proceed on the appeal, as did the judge below, on the premise that the ultimate question presented by the aunt\u2019s guardianship petition is what placement serves the best interests of the child. Cf. <em>Adoption of Irene, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 613, 617 (2002) (best interests of child the \u201cdriving factor\u201d in choosing between alternative plans for adoption); <em>Care &amp; Protection of Amalie, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 813, 820 n.8 (2007). We have indicated, in other contexts, that the determination of a child\u2019s best interests will most often involve the resolution of disputed issues of material fact or the weighing of evidence, considerations that would render inappropriate summary judgment. See e.g., <em>J.F. </em>v. <em>J.F., </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. at 791-792; <em>Adoption of Irene, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. at 617 (\u201c[wjhere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>the objective is a child\u2019s best interests, factual determinations are necessarily involved\u201d). Here, notwithstanding the judge\u2019s statement in her oral findings that the aunt\u2019s proffered evidence did not focus on Phelan\u2019s best interests (a point on which we disagree), the judge\u2019s findings, viewed in their entirety, suggest that the judge impermissibly weighed the \u201cevidence\u201d put before her and resolved factual disputes, including whether the aunt or Phelan\u2019s current caretaker would be better able to provide for the child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">An evidentiary hearing is required in the instant matter so that all appropriate circumstances (including, for example, the changes the aunt has undergone with respect to her child rearing capabilities and disciplinary practices; the current environment in the aunt\u2019s home; the impact upon Phelan, if any, of his separation from his siblings, now in the custody of the aunt; and the expressed wishes of the child) can be further explored, and weighed, in determining whether guardianship by the aunt would serve the best interests of the child. See <em>R.S. </em>v. <em>M.P., </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 798, 805-806 (2008). Simply put, this is not a case where summary judgment is appropriate, let alone compelled.

While we are cognizant of the importance of permanency in a child\u2019s life, on all that we have said in this case we trust that the department will not seek to effectuate the adoption of Phelan during the pendency of the proceedings on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">6. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment dismissing the petition for guardianship is vacated and the matter is remanded to the Juvenile Court for a prompt trial on the petition. We deny the aunt\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>request that the matter be assigned to a different judge of the Juvenile Court. The appeal from the order of the single justice is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b785-13\"> On appeal, the aunt and the Department of Children and Families (department) refer to and discuss, as they did below, the care and protection action (and certain earlier proceedings involving Phelan in the courts of the State of Georgia). We shall do the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b786-8\"> The department filed an earlier care and protection petition against the aunt in August, 2004, alleging that an older sibling of Phelan had been physically abused in Phelan\u2019s presence. The petition was dismissed as to Phelan some six weeks later.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b786-9\"> After a permanency hearing in December, 2006, the Juvenile Court judge issued an order pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 29B, indicating that it was the department\u2019s plan to place Phelan for adoption and that she, the judge, did not approve such a plan absent trial. The judge also determined, based on the testimony of the aunt, that the department had not made reasonable efforts toward reunification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b786-10\"> In her memorandum and order of decision, the judge also detailed her reasons for denying the aunt the right to participate in the proceedings either as a de facto parent or as a long-term placement for Phelan. The aunt acknowledges in her brief that the judge\u2019s order of September 5 terminated her \u201cparty status\u201d in the care and protection proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b787-9\"> It is not clear on the record before us why the guardianship petition was referred to mediation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b787-11\"> The same guardian ad litem was appointed for Phelan in the care and protection proceeding. She prepared her original report in March, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b787-12\"> The aunt, through counsel (not her present appellate counsel), declined the judge\u2019s invitation to provide her with additional time to make \u201ca meaningful response\u201d to the motion and agreed to argue the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b788-6\"> The papers in the record appendix indicate that the other sibling who was removed from the home had attained the age of eighteen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b788-7\"> Counsel for the department also represented at the hearing that a maternal uncle who resided out of state had come forward seeking placement of Phelan with him. At the time of the hearing, a home study was being conducted with respect to the uncle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b789-6\"> Counsel for Phelan represented that there had been problems with visits but that these problems were the result of the adults being unable to come to agreement. Counsel also represented that Phelan was \u201csurprisingly ambivalent\u201d about visiting with his siblings and that he currently did not want to see either the aunt or his siblings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b789-7\"> Counsel for the aunt also made an oral motion to strike portions of the guardian ad litem\u2019s updated report and suggested that the report was deficient in that it did not indicate any conversations between the guardian ad litem and the aunt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b789-8\"> The guardian ad litem stated in her November, 2008, report that \u201c[i]t is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>the continued recommendation of this GAL that [Phelan] who is thriving in the preadoptive home [of a named individual] remain with the [preadoptive family] and have the adoption completed as soon as possible.\u201d The judge noted in her oral findings the recommendation of the guardian ad litem that Phelan \u201cremain in his pre-adoptive home.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b790-7\"> By letter dated March 18, 2010 (purportedly pursuant to Mass.R.A.P. 16 [1], as amended, 386 Mass. 1247 [1982]), counsel for the aunt represented to this court that she had received confirmation from Phelan\u2019s appellate attorney that the child\u2019s preadoptive placement has been disrupted. The department and counsel for the child have moved to strike the \u201crule 16 (1)\u201d letter as it goes beyond the scope of that rule (which pertains to the citation of supplemental authorities) and, the department states, contains posttrial and postjudgment information that was not before the court. See generally <em>Adoption of Inez, </em>428 Mass. 717, 722 (1999); <em>Adoption of Willow, </em>433 Mass. 636, 644 n.8 (2001); <em>Adoption of Cesar, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 708, 716 n.11 (2006).

L. c. 201, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b791-5\"> This would seem especially appropriate where the person seeking guardianship was excluded from the care and protection proceeding on what might be viewed as technical grounds. More generally, when considering the exclusion of a person from a care and protection proceeding, it is prudent to factor into the analysis the potential impact of such exclusion, if erroneous, upon the finality of the proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b793-7\"> Neither the department nor counsel for Phelan addresses the possibility that the order denying the aunt\u2019s motion to consolidate the guardianship and care and protection proceedings may be interlocutory in nature, see <em>B.M.C. Durfee Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>299 Mass. 276, 279 (1938) (a premies case); cf. 8 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice par. 42.12 (3d ed. 2010), and not subject to review in this court pursuant to G.

L. c. <em>211, </em>\u00a7 3 (general superintendence power of the Supreme Judicial Court). Furthermore, although the department claims that the aunt had a right to appeal from the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d denying her motion to intervene, it fails to discuss whether the aunt\u2019s motion, made by analogy to Mass.R.Civ.P. 24, 365 Mass. 769 (1974), and Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 24, was one seeking permissive intervention or intervention as matter of right with respect to Phelan. See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Rae, </em>454 Mass. 1019, 1019-1020 (2009), and cases cited (indicating that a denial of a claim of intervention as of right is immediately appealable, as is denial of permissive intervention when raised concurrently); <em>Care &amp; Protection of Richard, </em>456 Mass. 1002, 1002 (2010). See also <em>Care &amp; Protection of Zelda, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 869, 871 (1989). Finally, it is not clear whether hearings were held on the motions and, if held, what transpired thereat.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b793-8\"> We also find unpersuasive the department\u2019s suggestion that the aunt\u2019s guardianship petition, which essentially sought a determination that Phelan\u2019s placement with her was in his best interests, was an improper collateral attack on the judge\u2019s unappealed decision to terminate the aunt\u2019s standing as a party in the care and protection proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b794-6\"> General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 29B, first par., as amended through St. 1999, c. 3, \u00a7 12, provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-7\">\u201cExcept as provided herein, within 12 months of the original commitment, grant of custody or transfer of responsibility of a child to the department by a court of competent jurisdiction, and not less frequently than every 12 months thereafter while the child remains in the care of the department, the committing court shall conduct a permanency hearing ... to determine and periodically review thereafter the permanency plan for the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">The first paragraph was subsequently amended by St. 2008, c. 176, \u00a7 86, effective July 8, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b794-9\"> We also reject the department\u2019s suggestion that the aunt was barred from an evidentiary hearing on her guardianship petition because she could have raised the issue of her changed circumstances through a \u201creview and redetermination\u201d petition pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, as in effect prior to St. 2008, c. 176, \u00a7 84, at any time prior to her removal from the care and protection case in September, 2007. However, as the aunt correctly notes, the statute limits the class of persons entitled to file such a petition to \u201cthe department, parents, person having legal custody of, counsel for a child, the probation officer, guardian or guardian ad litem.\u201d Here, the aunt was not a person having legal custody of Phelan after legal custody of him was transferred to the department in September, 2006. Neither was the aunt, as determined by the judge, the \u201cguardian\u201d of Phelan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b795-5\"> The Rules of Civil Procedure apply expressly to the Juvenile Court in proceedings seeking equitable relief (e.g., a civil action brought in the Juvenile Court seeking specific performance of a postadoption contract).

Under the Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure in effect at the time of the hearing on the motion to dismiss the guardianship petition, summary judgment was applicable only in actions for modification and actions to modify and enforce a foreign judgment.

If a hearing is necessary to resolve disputed issues of material fact, a grant of summary judgment is inappropriate.
