See G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 63.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bickford maintains that the suspension rested on an impermissible ground and that he had not been given sufficient notice that his record-keeping practices would be at issue during the administrative hearing that led to the suspension order. After careful review of the record, we find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\"><em>Background. </em>Substantial evidence in the record, see G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 1(6), 14(7)(e), supports the hearing officer\u2019s findings that Bickford was the MCCPD\u2019s armorer and, as such, was responsible for identifying, retrieving, inspecting, and storing all weapons assigned to MCCPD officers and for maintaining an accurate log of the weapons\u2019 location.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Events leading to Bickford\u2019s suspension began in 2006 when he returned to work from a three-month disability leave to discover that an MCCPD pistol and three to five magazine clips were missing from his locker. Bickford\u2019s report of the disappearance to the MCCPD chief triggered a State police investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Although the investigation did not uncover the missing firearm, it did reveal a host of other problems with Bickford\u2019s performance as armorer. Specifically, the investigation showed that in the year 2000, he participated in taking a personal firearm from MCCPD Sergeant Ann Holland\u2019s desk drawer to \u201csecure it\u201d without telling her he had done so. In violation of protocol, he did not report the incident to the MCCPD chief and instead kept the weapon for an extended period because, according to his testimony at the administrative hearing, he \u201cforgot about it.\u201d The investigation further revealed that due to Bickford\u2019s substandard record-keeping, at least one additional MCCPD firearm was missing. In fact, at one point, Bickford lost his firearms log <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>book and did not find it for at least three years, a period during which he completely stopped keeping a firearms log of any kind.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bickford initially responded to all questions posed to him during the investigation but later, after consulting with his attorney, declined to submit to a polygraph examination and to further interviews without the presence of his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">On July 19, 2006, the commander of the State police certification unit sent the MCCPD chief a letter suspending Bickford\u2019s SSPO warrant pending the outcome of certain criminal complaints and completion of the ongoing investigation into Bickford\u2019s suitability to serve as an SSPO. The letter said that Bickford had \u201cnot been cooperative in the investigation,\u201d noted the missing weapons, and also noted the incident with Sergeant Holland\u2019s firearm. In August, 2006, Bickford appealed the suspension and sought a hearing pursuant to G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 43.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The hearing was held, and thereafter, a hearing officer issued a comprehensive report in which he found, among other things, that two firearms last seen in Bickford\u2019s custody were missing and could not be found. That finding accompanied other findings regarding Bickford\u2019s deficient performance, two of which were that Bickford had \u201crefused to cooperate with a criminal investigation and knowingly disregarded his law enforcement responsibilities and duties\u201d and that he had \u201cgrossly neglected his duties and responsibilities as the armorer of the [MCCPD] by failing to accurately maintain Firearms Log records, fail[ing] to accurately record the issuance and retrieval of Department weapons, and failing] to safely secure weapons.\u201d For those reasons, the examiner recommended that Bickford\u2019s suspension be affirmed. After the State police colonel accepted the recommendation and suspended Bickford\u2019s warrant, MCCPD put him on indefinite leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>In December, 2006, Bickford petitioned for judicial review under G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 43,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A Superior Court judge ultimately denied Bickford\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and entered judgment for the colonel. The judge rejected Bickford\u2019s contention that he had no notice that negligent record-keeping would be at issue in the hearing. He further found that although it was an error of law to base the warrant suspension on Bickford\u2019s decision to decline a polygraph examination, the record contained substantial evidence of independent deficiencies that were sufficient to support the suspension decision. Specifically, the judge cited Bickford\u2019s failure to comply with record-keeping and inventory duties, Sergeant Holland\u2019s testimony about the incident involving her weapon, and other witnesses\u2019 testimony about additional firearms that went missing on Bickford\u2019s watch.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>On this appeal, Bickford claims that the Superior Court judge erred in failing to remand the matter for a new hearing after determining that the State police hearing officer committed an error of law by listing his failure to cooperate as one of the grounds for his suspension. Second, Bickford claims the judge erred in concluding that he received sufficient notice of the nature of the charges to be addressed at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Dealing first with claimed error of law, we begin by observing that \u201c[t]he scope of review of [an agency] decision, both in the Superior Court and in [an appellate] court, is defined by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14.\u201d <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>390 Mass. 157, 161 (1983). Section 14(7) authorizes a reviewing court to \u201caffirm the decision of the agency, or remand the matter for further proceedings before the agency; or . . . set aside or modify the decision ... if it determines that the substantial rights of any party may have been prejudiced because the agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>decision is,\u201d among other things, \u201c[b]ased upon an error of law.\u201d Here, as the Superior Court judge found, the State police hearing officer did make an error of law by citing failure to cooperate with the investigation as a ground for the decision to suspend Bickford\u2019s warrant. See <em>Carney </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>403 Mass. 604, 608-610 (1988) (\u201cpublic employees cannot be discharged simply because they invoke their privilege under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution not to incriminate themselves in refusing to respond to questions propounded by their employers\u201d; \u201cart. 12 of the [Massachusetts] Declaration of Rights requires transactional immunity to supplant the privilege against self-incrimination, even in the context of public employment\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Bickford claims that the error of law vitiates the administrative proceeding and requires a remand for a new, error-free administrative proceeding. We do not agree. As \u201c[t]he appealing party [, Bickford] has the burden of showing that his \u2018substantial rights . . . may have been prejudiced\u2019 by the agency\u2019s error.\u201d <em>Catlin </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Architects, </em>414 Mass. 1, 6 (1992). The administrative findings regarding Bickford\u2019s role in the disappearance of Sergeant Holland\u2019s weapon and his grossly deficient approach to record-keeping, an approach that led to the disappearance of two police firearms, have substantial evidentiary support in the record and, by themselves, provide compelling reasons for suspension of his warrant. We have no doubt that his warrant would have been suspended even if he had cooperated in the investigation or if his lack of cooperation had not been counted against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">That being the case, the impermissible ground did not invali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>date the suspension order. When an agency decision rests on both a legitimate and an illegitimate basis, a court can nevertheless uphold the decision if it is clear that, after excising the illegitimate basis, the agency would have made the same decision. See <em>United Food Corp. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>375 Mass. 238, 245 (1978). See also <em>Kurzon </em>v. <em>United States Postal Serv., </em>539 F.2d 788, 796-797 (1st Cir. 1976); <em>Salt River Project Agric. Improvement &amp; Power Dist. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>762 F.2d 1053, 1060 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (\u201cWhen an agency relies on a number of findings, one or more of which are erroneous, we must reverse and remand only when there is a significant chance that but for the errors the agency might have reached a different result. When it is clear that based on the valid findings the agency would have reached the same ultimate result, we do not improperly invade the administrative province by affirming\u201d); <em>Casino Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Transp. Safety Bd., </em>439 F.3d 715, 717-718 (D.C. Cir. 2006), quoting from <em>Mail Order Assn. of America </em>v. <em>United States Postal Serv., 2 </em>F.3d 408, 434 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (\u201cWe have consistently held that \u2018when an agency relies on multiple grounds for its decision, some of which are invalid, we may nonetheless sustain the decision as long as one is valid and \u2018the agency would clearly have acted on that ground even if the other were unavailable\u2019 \u201d). We think that principle is applicable here and obviates the need for a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Bickford\u2019s claim that he was given insufficient notice that his record-keeping practices would be at issue in the hearing fares no better. It is certainly true that \u201c[d]ue process requires that, in any proceeding to be accorded finality, notice must be given [in a manner] that is reasonably calculated to apprise an interested party of the proceeding and to afford him an opportunity to present his case.\u201d <em>LaPointe </em>v. <em>License Bd. of Worcester, </em>389 Mass. 454, 458 (1983). Here, as the Superior Court judge pointed out, the September 26, 2006, letter notifying Bickford of the hearing he had requested stated that \u201can Administrative Hearing will be conducted on the matter of the suspension of the [SSPO] warrant of Mr. David Bickford,\u201d and enclosed \u201cdocuments deemed relevant to the matter of the warrant of Mr. David Bickford being suspended.\u201d One of those documents was an investigative report dated May 25, 2006, that discussed Bickford\u2019s record-keeping practices in extensive detail. We agree with the judge that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>\u201cclear and expansive\u201d language in the notice of hearing gave Bickford ample notice that \u201call incidents of his conduct pertaining to his suitability to act as a police officer were . . . fairly on the table\u201d and that the specific discussion of his record-keeping practices in the materials enclosed with the notice highlighted the significance of record-keeping. In sum, Bickford had sufficient notice that his record-keeping practices would figure in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\"> In material part, G.

[may] appoint employees of such college ... as special state police officers. Such special state police officers shall serve for three years, subject to removal by the colonel, and they shall have the same power to make arrests as regular police officers for any criminal offense committed in or upon lands or structures owned, used or occupied by such college . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b253-6\"> The MCCPD policy and procedure manual states, \u201cThe officer in charge of firearms shall inspect each departmental firearm on a yearly basis.

Section 14(7) authorizes a reviewing court to affirm the decision, remand for further proceedings, or modify the decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\"> The hearing officer\u2019s report actually described Bickford\u2019s lack of cooperation with two investigations. One was the investigation into the disappearance of the two weapons for which he had some responsibility, and the other was the investigation into taking Sergeant Holland\u2019s weapon. The colonel maintains that Bickford\u2019s failure to cooperate in the investigation regarding Sergeant Holland\u2019s weapon is a proper basis for suspension of his warrant, particularly because Bickford himself had that weapon. To be sure, Bickford\u2019s activities in connection with the Holland investigation were a proper basis for action and were specifically noted in the hearing officer\u2019s report. But those activities were not the focus of the officer\u2019s ultimate conclusion regarding Bickford\u2019s \u201crefus[al] to cooperate with a criminal investigation.\u201d The record is clear that the refusal occurred in the context of Bickford\u2019s own conduct and the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of weapons for which he was responsible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
