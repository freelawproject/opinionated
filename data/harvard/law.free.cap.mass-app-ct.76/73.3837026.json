L. c. 93A damages against Norwegian Cruise Line, Ltd. (Norwegian), a judge entered judgment for Norwegian dismissing the Casavants\u2019 complaint on the grounds of a forum selection clause set forth in the \u201cContract of Passage.\u201d This court reversed in <em>Casavant </em>v. <em>Norwegian Cruise Line, Ltd., </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 785 (2005) <em>(Casavant I), </em>holding that the forum selection clause was unenforceable because the Casavants had not accepted the terms of the contract of passage. The case was remanded for trial on whether the Casavants were entitled to a full refund as well as for determination of their c. 93A claim. After trial on remand, a different judge found that Norwegian had not committed an unfair or deceptive act or practice within the meaning of c. 93A. He further found that even if there had been an unfair or deceptive act, the Casavants had not suffered any loss as a result of such act. The judge accordingly entered judgment for Norwegian on the c. 93A claim, and ordered Norwegian to tender a full refund to the Casavants for the purchase price of their tickets, plus statutory interest and costs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Casavants appeal from the c. 93A judgment against them. Because we conclude that the Casavants have, as matter of law, demonstrated a c. 93A violation and that this violation caused them a loss, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Background.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In October, 2000, the Casavants booked a round-trip ocean cruise between Boston and Bermuda. The booking took place at a travel agency operating within the discount department store, BJ\u2019s. The departure was scheduled for September 16, 2001 (five days after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City). The price for the tickets was $2,017.50. At the time of booking, the Casavants paid a deposit of $628. Subsequently, they tendered the remaining balance such that the tickets and fees were fully paid by July 18, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">When they booked the cruise, the Casavants received a \u201cPassenger Invoice and Confirmation,\u201d which stated, in a section entitled \u201cCancellation Fees,\u201d that a fifty percent forfeiture would be imposed for cancellation fifteen to twenty-nine days prior to departure, and a one hundred percent forfeiture would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>imposed for cancellation from zero to fourteen days prior to departure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Casavants also received documents entitled \u201cTravel Information and Service Agreement\u201d detailing refund policies that were completely separate from anything discussed by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">On or about August 27, 2001, Norwegian sent \u201cPassenger Ticket Contracts\u201d to the Casavants, who received them in early September, 2001. The passenger ticket contracts included the tickets and a contract of passage containing twenty-eight numbered paragraphs. Paragraph two provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">\u201c[Norwegian] shall not be liable to make any refund to passenger in respect of lost tickets or in respect of tickets wholly or partly not used by a passenger.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Another paragraph sought to limit Norwegian\u2019s liability for injury or loss due to \u201cterrorist[] actions or threats [or] hijacking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">At all relevant times, Norwegian had an additional refund and cancellation policy in force that was not included in any of the initial materials the Casavants received when purchasing their tickets at BJ\u2019s, nor was it contained in the twenty-eight paragraphs of fine print in the contract of passage. That policy appears to have been first disclosed in Norwegian\u2019s response to the Casavants\u2019 G. L. c. 93A demand letter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In Norwegian\u2019s response letter, dated September 26, 2002, Norwegian\u2019s attorney referred to a policy that provides \u201cpassengers with a 100% refund if they have an objection to a provision in the Passenger Ticket Contract.\u201d This policy was reiterated in the affidavit of Jane E. Kilgour, manager of the passenger and crew claims department for Norwegian, dated October 29, 2002 (Kilgour affidavit), and filed by Norwegian in support of its motion to dismiss the Casavants\u2019 initial complaint.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Paragraph ten of the Kilgour affidavit provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">\u201cAt all times relevant, it was, and remains, the policy of [Norwegian] to refund in full the fare paid by a passenger, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>without penalty, if that passenger wishes to cancel a cruise because of an objection to a provision contained in the Contract of Passage before the cruise in question begins.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">After the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the Casavants cancelled their cruise. Prior to the scheduled departure date of the cruise, they made three separate requests for a refund of their ticket prices. Norwegian declined to issue a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The issue before us is whether the nondisclosure of the complete terms of the refund policy, as articulated by Norwegian\u2019s response to the Casavants\u2019 G. L. c. 93A demand letter and the Kilgour affidavit, constituted an unfair or deceptive act or practice within the meaning of c. 93A, and, if so, whether that nondisclosure caused the Casavants any loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Section 9 of G. L. c. 93A provides a private cause of action for individual consumers who suffer an injury as a result of unfair or deceptive acts or practices. See <em>Hershenow </em>v. <em>Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. of Boston, Inc., </em>445 Mass. 790, 796 (2006) (Hershenow). The purpose of c. 93A is to provide \u201cproper disclosure of information and a more equitable balance in the relationship of consumers to persons conducting business activities.\u201d <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, 776 (1980) <em>(Purity Supreme), </em>quoting from <em>Lowell Gas. Co. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>377 Mass. 37, 51 (1979). A successful claim under this section thus requires, at a minimum, a showing of (1) a deceptive act or practice on the part of the seller; (2) an injury or loss suffered by the consumer; and (3) a causal connection between the seller\u2019s deceptive act or practice and the consumer\u2019s injury. See G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9. See also <em>Hershenow, supra </em>at 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">1. <em>Unfair or deceptive act or practice. </em>Although G. L. c. 93A does not define what acts and practices are unfair or deceptive, \u00a7 2(c) of c. 93A specifically authorizes the Attorney General to promulgate regulations making these determinations. See <em>Purity Supreme, supra </em>at 775. The relevant Attorney General\u2019s regulations prohibited Norwegian from accepting any payment until after disclosure to the Casavants of \u201cthe complete terms of any cancellation or refund policy of [Norwegian] that may apply to the consumer\u2019s purchase of travel services.\u201d 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.04(2)(e) (1996). In this case, the unambiguous refund policy referred to in Norwegian\u2019s response to the Casavants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>c. 93A demand letter, as well as in the Kilgour affidavit, was not disclosed until the fall of 2002, more than one year after the scheduled date of the cruise, and more than two years after Norwegian accepted initial payment from the Casavants. That is, contrary to the Attorney General\u2019s regulations, Norwegian did not disclose its true refund policy until approximately two years after accepting payment from the Casavants.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The trial judge found that Norwegian\u2019s refund policy described above did not apply because \u201c[t]he Casavants had no objection to the terms of the Passenger Ticket Contract; they simply did not feel comfortable taking a cruise at that time,\u201d and that Norwegian \u201cdid not commit an unfair or deceptive act by not refunding the ticket price to the Casavants under this policy.\u201d This reasoning is incorrect. The proper inquiry is whether Norwegian violated the Attorney General\u2019s regulations, which required Norwegian to furnish its refund policy to the Casavants prior to accepting payment. As discussed above, Norwegian failed to do so, and thus its conduct violated the Attorney General\u2019s regulations which, in turn, constituted an unfair or deceptive practice within the meaning of c. 93A. See 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.01(1) (1996) (\u201c[violation of any provision of 940 CMR 15.00 shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice under [G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2(o)]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">2. <em>Causation. </em>\u201cTo warrant an award of damages under G. L. c. 93A, there must be a \u2018casual connection between the seller\u2019s deception and the buyer\u2019s loss.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hershenow, supra </em>at 797, quoting from <em>Kohl </em>v. <em>Silver Lake Motors, Inc., </em>369 Mass. 795, 801 (1976). Causation is established if the deception \u201ccould reasonably be found to have caused a person to act differently from the way he [or she] otherwise would have acted.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Hershenow, supra </em>at 801, quoting from <em>Purity Supreme, supra </em>at <em>111.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Causation can also be established by determining whether the nondisclosure was of a material fact. In the context of c. 93A claims based on nondisclosure, \u201c[m]ateriality . . . is in a sense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>a proxy for causation.\u201d Gilleran, The Law of Chapter 93A \u00a7 4.16, at 185-186 (2d ed. 2007) (noting that this view is supported by the court\u2019s definition of deception in <em>Lowell Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>377 Mass. at 51). See <em>Sheehy </em>v. <em>Lipton Indus., Inc., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 188, 195 (1987). To determine if the nondisclosure was of a material fact, we ask whether the plaintiff likely would have acted differently but for the nondisclosure. See <em>Brewster Wallcovering Co. </em>v. <em>Blue Mountain Wallcoverings, Inc., </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 582, 607 n.57 (2007) (\u201c[fjailure to disclose a material fact that causes a party to act differently with respect to a transaction than it otherwise would have has been held sufficient to support a finding of c. 93A liability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">In this case, instead of deciding whether the Casavants would have behaved differently if Norwegian had timely disclosed its true refund policy, the trial judge simply concluded, incorrectly, that there was an absence of causation because \u201cthere was never an objection by the Casavants to [the] cancellation policies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">While a remand is often necessary when a judge applies the improper legal standard, we conclude that in the circumstances presented here, a remand on this issue is neither practical nor necessary. The Casavants\u2019 three separate requests for a refund, which were made prior to the departure date of the cmise, demonstrate that they would have objected to a provision in the contract of passage in order to obtain a full refund pursuant to Norwegian\u2019s undisclosed refund policy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To find otherwise would be clearly erroneous. See <em>Casavant I, supra </em>at 798 (Norwegian\u2019s argument that the Casavants failed to object to the contract of passage was \u201cunavailing and, indeed, borders on the ephemeral \u2014 the Casavants\u2019 repeated requests to reschedule the cruise and their reasons set forth in [an earlier letter to Norwegian] were sufficient objection\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>3. <em>Damages. </em>In order for an individual plaintiff to recover under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, he or she need not demonstrate loss of money or property. <em>Hershenow, supra </em>at 797-800. Severe emotional distress, or invasion of a legally protected interest, can constitute an \u201cinjury\u201d under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9. <em>Id. </em>at 798-800. In this case, Norwegian did not agree to refund the ticket price until at least four years after the departure date of the cruise. During this time, the Casavants endured litigation that required them to expend considerable time, money, and effort. The case is remanded for a determination of the Casavants\u2019 c. 93A damages, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, and costs. See G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\"><em>Appellate fees and costs. </em>The Casavants have requested, and are entitled to, their reasonable appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs. See <em>Twin Fires Inv., LLC </em>v. <em>Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co., </em>445 Mass. 411, 433 (2005). The Casavants may seek such fees and costs under the procedures established in <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>441 Mass. 9, 10-11 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>As matters of law, Norwegian committed an unfair or deceptive act in violation of G. L. c. 93A, the Casavants suffered actual losses, and Norwegian\u2019s acts caused those losses. The judgment on the Casavants\u2019 c. 93A claim is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings. The remainder of the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b116-7\"> In the joint pretrial memorandum filed by the parties in June, 2006, Norwegian offered a full refund of the price of the tickets to the Casavants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b116-8\"> We incorporate by reference the comprehensive narrative of facts in <em>Casavant I, supra </em>at 785-788.
