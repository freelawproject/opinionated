Becker Custom Building Ltd. (Becker), engaged a subcontractor, Great Green Barrier Co. (Great Green), to perform waterproofing work at a home renovation construction project in Newburyport. An explosion at the job site resulted in the death of Timothy B. Wentworth and grave injuries to Ezekiel Wentworth, both employees of Great Green.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-15\">Great Green did not carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance, as required by law, and evidently, Becker had taken no steps to confirm that it did. Pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 18, Becker\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation insurer was required to respond,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and it eventually resolved the workers\u2019 compensation claims arising from Timothy\u2019s death and Ezekiel\u2019s injuries by means of lump sum settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Subsequently, the plaintiff, Cheryl D. Wentworth, as legal representative of both Timothy and Ezekiel, commenced the instant common-law and statutory wrongful death lawsuit against Becker, alleging that the explosion was caused by Becker\u2019s independent negligence, gross negligence, and/or wilful, wanton, or reckless conduct. Becker filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiff\u2019s claims failed as matter of law because she had accepted workers\u2019 compensation benefits from Becker\u2019s insurance carrier, thereby effectuating a \u201crelease\u201d of her claims against the general contractor by operation of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 23.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accepting Becker\u2019s position, a judge of the Superior Court granted summary judgment to the general contractor, and the plaintiff filed this appeal. We reverse, concluding that a general contractor that pays workers\u2019 compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>benefits to an uninsured subcontractor\u2019s employee, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 18, is not thereby released under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 23, from its independent common-law and/or wrongful death liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>Significant to the issue presented is the 1971 amendment to the workers\u2019 compensation act, abolishing the so-called \u201ccommon employment\u201d doctrine, which barred employees of a subcontractor from suing the general contractor for personal injuries sustained on the job. See <em>White </em>v. <em>George A. Fuller Co., </em>226 Mass. 1, 3-5 (1917); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>M.W. Leahy Co., </em>300 Mass. 565, 568-569 (1938); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Marr Equipment Corp., </em>355 Mass. 724 (1969). Under that doctrine, the insurance of the general contractor was said to \u201cthrow[] its shadow over the whole work\u201d such that \u201ca cause of action for negligence causing a compensable personal injury cannot grow.\u201d <em>Clark </em>v. <em>M.W. Leahy Co., supra </em>at 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Criticism of the common employment doctrine ultimately led to the 1971 amendment, which added the following language to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">\u201cNothing in this section, or in section eighteen or twenty-four shall be construed to bar an action at law for damages for personal injuries or wrongful death by an employee against any person other than the insured person employing such employee and liable for payment of the compensation provided by this chapter for the employee\u2019s personal injury or wrongful death and said insured person\u2019s employees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">St. 1971, c. 941. As a result of this amendment, general contractors lost their immunity from third-party suits brought by injured employees of subcontractors. See Nason, Koziol, &amp; Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 27.6, at 352 (3d ed. 2003) (\u201cBy the terms of the [1971] amendment, a personal injury is barred only where the insured person is \u2018employing such employee . . .\u2019 that is, he has a contract of service, express or implied, with such person\u201d). Immunity depends upon two factors: \u201c(1) the employer must be an insured person hable for the payment of compensation, <em>and (2) the employer must be the direct employer of the </em>employee\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Edward J. Lamothe Co., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 231, 232 (1985). See <em>Numberg </em>v. <em>GTE Transp., Inc., </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 904, 904 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Becker acknowledges, as it must, that it was not the direct employer in this situation, and that it is not entitled to immunity under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 24. Becker nevertheless argues that it has an alternative defense under \u00a7 23, based upon the payment by its insurer of the workers\u2019 compensation claims brought by the plaintiff on behalf of Timothy and Ezekiel. Becker contends that the acceptance of these payments releases it from any other potential liability, because the 1971 amendment abolishing the common employment doctrine did not specifically mention \u00a7 23, thereby leaving it operative in cases where a general contractor pays compensation pursuant to \u00a7 18. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The application of \u00a7 23, no less than \u00a7 24, turns on whether the Wentworths were \u201cemployees\u201d of Becker. Under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(4), an \u201cemployee\u201d is a person \u201cin the service of another under any contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written.\u201d Under that definition, Timothy and Ezekiel were employees only of Great Green.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The case of <em>Kniskern </em>v. <em>Melkonian, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 461 (2007), upon which Becker relies, is distinguishable. In <em>Kniskern, </em>we held that the acceptance of a lump sum workers\u2019 compensation settlement by the plaintiff from the company that hired him released that company from liability at common law, even though there was a dispute whether the plaintiff was an employee or an independent contractor of that company. We concluded that the receipt of a lump sum settlement pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 48, had the effect of establishing that the plaintiff was an employee, because otherwise he would not have been entitled to the lump sum payment under the workers\u2019 compensation scheme. That being the case, his acceptance of the settlement was a release of his common-law claims against his direct employer. <em>Id. </em>at 465-466. Here, on the other hand, Timothy and Ezekiel were not the direct employees of Becker, and their receipt of compensation was indicative only of Becker\u2019s contingent responsibility to pay compensation to the injured employees of its uninsured subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Also important to our analysis is that the contemporaneous understanding of the 1971 amendment abolishing the common employment doctrine supports the view that it was intended to permit an injured employee of an uninsured subcontractor to sue a general contractor for common-law damages in addition to receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits under \u00a7 18:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>\u201cChapter 941 of the Acts of 1971 eliminates the effect of the common employment doctrine by restricting the employer immunity to the immediate employer of the injured employee, thereby abolishing even the limited immunity established by <em>White </em>[v. <em>George A. Fuller Co., </em>226 Mass. 1 (1917)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">\u201cUnder the amendment, if an insured person is to acquire an immunity against a suit for personal injury or wrongful death, two conditions established by the amendment must be met: first, the insured person must employ the injured or deceased employee, and second, the insured person must be liable for the payment of compensation for the injury or death of the employee. If the conditions are met, the employer has his immunity. <em>The effect of the amendment is that the insured contractor, whose insurance carrier must pay compensation under the provisions of Section 18 for the injury or death of an employee of an uninsured subcontractor, is now liable as a third party for damages in excess of compensation if his negligence or that of his employees caused the </em>injury\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, Ann. Surv. Mass. L. \u00a7 4.1, at 52 (1971). See <em>Searcy </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 134, 138-139 (1985) (\u201cContemporary comment . . . shows that the statute was taken by text and periodical writers as broadly abolishing the so-called \u2018common employment\u2019 doctrine and permitting third-party actions by, or in behalf of, an injured employee against all but his immediate insured employer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Furthermore, Becker\u2019s view of \u00a7 23 is inconsistent with the objectives of \u00a7 18. \u201c[T]he oft-declared purpose of \u00a7 18 . . .is \u2018to prevent ... [an insured entity, such as a general contractor,] from escaping the obligation of the compensation act by letting out a part of [its] work to irresponsible subcontractors or independent contractors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tindall </em>v. <em>Denholm &amp; McKay Co., 347 </em>Mass. 100, 105 (1964), quoting from <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>318 Mass. 373, 375 (1945). If Becker\u2019s position were accepted, there would be little incentive for general contractors to make sure that their subcontractors obtain workers\u2019 compensation insurance because, even though the general contractor\u2019s insurer would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>be required to pay the uninsured subcontractor\u2019s compensation obligation, the contractor would obtain the benefit of being released from the significantly greater damages that it likely would face in a common-law action.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Finally, we believe that our interpretation of the statutory scheme is fair and reasonable to all concerned. It creates no risk of double recovery by an injured worker of both workers\u2019 compensation and common-law damages. As in any third-party case brought pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, any proceeds obtained in the suit against the general contractor will be allocated between the compensation-paying insurer and the employee, so that the insurer is reimbursed for the compensation paid and the excess goes to the employee. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15. In addition, the general contractor\u2019s insurer also has the option of attempting to obtain reimbursement from the uninsured subcontractor for the compensation paid.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While we recognize that there may well be cases where such recovery is elusive because of the subcontractor\u2019s financial condition, the lesson to be drawn is that general contractors must be scrupulous in demanding proof of workers\u2019 compensation insurance from any subcontractors they engage.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, the allowance of Becker\u2019s motion for summary judgment was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b549-18\"> Timothy was the owner and operator of Great Green; Ezekiel is his son.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\"> General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 18, provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">\u201cIf an insured . . . contractor enters into a contract with a subcontractor to do all or any part of the work comprised in such contract with the insured, and the insurer would, if such work were executed by employees immediately employed by the insured, be liable to pay compensation under this chapter to those employees, the insurer shall pay to such employees any compensation which would be payable to them under this chapter if the independent or sub-contractors were insured persons.
