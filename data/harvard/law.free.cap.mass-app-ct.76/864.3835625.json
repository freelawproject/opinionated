L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He raises four evidentiary claims: (1) testimony describing the process by which the informant was authorized to serve as such and participate in controlled drug buys (controlled buys) constituted improper vouching; (2) testimony indicating the informant had purchased cocaine from the defendant before the dates of the indicted offenses constituted impermissible prior bad act evidence; (3) testimony indicating law enforcement personnel were assigned to a gang task force was improper as it was irrelevant and prejudicial; and (4) the admission of drug analysis certificates (certificates) violated the defendant\u2019s rights under the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Additionally, the defendant claims he received ineffective assistance of counsel in the failure of trial counsel to object to these evidentiary matters (with the exception of the prior bad act testimony), and that cumulative error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the facts as the jury could have found them, reserving certain details for discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">Four people testified for the Commonwealth: Trooper Fred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>Geiger of the Massachusetts State police; Officer Robert Lockett of the Chicopee police department<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; Special Agent Christopher Dillon of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); and Charles Smith, an informant who participated in two controlled buys from the defendant. Geiger first met Smith in February, 2006.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Smith told Geiger that he had information about drug dealing and expressed his willingness to make controlled buys. He named several drug dealers, including the defendant, and while Smith worked with law enforcement on several cases, the defendant was one of the persons they first targeted.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">On February 16, 2006, at the FBI office in the presence of Geiger, Smith called the defendant to arrange a purchase of cocaine for the next day. On February 17, Smith again met the officers at the FBI office; Smith called the defendant and established a meeting at 55 Dearborn Street in Springfield. Geiger searched Smith\u2019s person and car, including those areas where a one-quarter ounce bag of cocaine (such as that later marked as an exhibit) could be secreted, to ensure that Smith was not in possession of money, weapons, or narcotics. Smith was outfitted with a covert audio and video recorder, which provided a live audio feed for Smith\u2019s safety. The agents activated the equipment and provided Smith with $275 in buy money.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Smith and Geiger drove to Dearborn Street separately, with Geiger following Smith.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Geiger was aware that Smith\u2019s car had been having problems, and several times during the drive, Smith stopped the car and checked under the hood. Geiger testified that he could not see what Smith did while he was under the hood.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">When Smith arrived at Dearborn Street, he called the defendant and was told to pull into the driveway, which is where the two met. During the minute or two that the defendant and Smith were together, Geiger could see the defendant in person. The video showed the defendant reach into his pocket and then, later, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>hold currency in his hand. However, the video did not show the exchange of drugs for money that Smith described in his testimony. Smith drove directly back to the FBI office with Geiger following. Geiger had maintained visual contact with Smith the entire time the video equipment was taping. Smith explained what had transpired and gave the substance he purchased from the defendant to Geiger. Geiger again searched Smith and his car and found nothing of consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Geiger and Smith next met on February 28, 2006, to set up the second controlled buy. They followed the same procedures as the first occasion, with the exception that this time Smith was directed to purchase a certain amount of cocaine and given a digital scale. Smith was told to inform the defendant that he wanted to weigh the dmgs because he had been \u201cshorted\u201d the first time. Geiger again followed Smith and kept him under surveillance to the prearranged location, Smokin\u2019 Deals, a store in Springfield. Geiger was also in contact with Smith by cellular telephone. Geiger saw Smith arrive at the location and saw the defendant and Smith together in a car for less than a minute. Geiger continued to observe Smith as he drove back to the FBI office. Once back at the office, the same debriefing and search procedures as before were followed. Again, the search of Smith and his car turned up nothing of consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">After each controlled buy, Geiger field tested the substances obtained from the defendant, then sent them to a lab for analysis. Both the field tests and laboratory analyses indicated the substances were cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\"><em>Discussion. Vouching. </em>The defendant claims that testimony on the process used to obtain approval to use Smith as an informant and controlled buyer constituted impermissible vouching. As the defendant did not object to this testimony, \u201cwe review to determine whether the statements were improper and, if so, whether they created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kebreau, </em>454 Mass. 287, 304 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">In particular, the defendant\u2019s claim is based on the testimony of Trooper Geiger and Special Agent Dillon describing the process necessary for Smith to become a government informant and participate in controlled buys. Geiger testified that he introduced Smith to \u201cone of the controlling FBI agents,\u201d submit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>ted information about Smith\u2019s criminal history to the FBI, consulted with the United States Attorney\u2019s office, and tested Smith\u2019s veracity. Geiger indicated that as Smith \u201cpass[ed] a certain standard,\u201d, he was given a code name and authorized to make controlled buys. Dillon testified that the process used to decide whether to enlist an individual as an informant involved an \u201cextensive background\u201d check and the corroboration of information provided by that individual to determine \u201cif it holds any water.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">The Supreme Judicial Court has recognized that prosecutors must not explicitly or implicitly vouch for the truthfulness of a witness\u2019s testimony. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. 257, 265 (1989). Furthermore, \u201c[b]ecause police witnesses may also introduce . . . prejudice by vouching for cooperating witnesses ... the proscription against vouching . . . should extend to them as well.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chaleumphong, </em>434 Mass. 70, 74 (2001). Here, neither Geiger nor Dillon vouched for the truthfulness of Smith, since they never \u201cexpresse[d] a personal belief in the credibility of [Smith] . . . , [nor indicated] that [they] ha[d] knowledge independent of the evidence before the jury verifying [Smith\u2019s] credibility.\u201d <em>Ciampa, supra </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">The defendant has not identified any testimony, by either Geiger or Dillon, that specifically vouched for Smith\u2019s testimony describing the two controlled buys. Further, while details regarding the approval process were subject to exclusion upon relevance grounds, see Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 403 (2010), considered in context, the challenged testimony clearly demonstrated that the officers engaged in this verification only to determine whether the names and information Smith provided were fictitious. The unmistakable tenor of Geiger and Dillon\u2019s testimony about this \u201cverification\u201d was that Smith would not have been permitted to participate in controlled buys, handling drugs and money, without it.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Furthermore, admitting hearsay evidence of Smith\u2019s past relationship with the police does not make the Geiger and Dillon testimony improper. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaVelle, </em>414 Mass. 146, 155-156 (1993) (rejecting claim judge erred by admitting hearsay evidence bolstering informant\u2019s credibility, as hearsay statements in detective\u2019s testimony on informant\u2019s initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>contacts with police, knowledge of drug trafficking activity, motives for aiding police, participation in undercover operation, and statements concerning defendant were admissible as relevant to state of police knowledge that led them to use informant and pursue defendant as possible drug trafficker). \u201cWhile the testimony of [Geiger and Dillon] as to statements made by [Smith] is clearly hearsay, \u2018[t]he hearsay rule forbids only the testimonial use of reported statements. It does not preclude the use of such statements for other valid purposes such as . . . the state of police knowledge which impelled the approach to the defendant.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>361 Mass. 644, 659 (1972). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244, 269-270 (1982) (prosecutor entitled to present full picture of events surrounding the incident). After reviewing [Geiger\u2019s and Dillon\u2019s] testimony, we affirm the trial judge\u2019s determination that, to the extent the testimony included hearsay statements, the information was relevant to the state of police knowledge which led them to use [Smith] as an informant and to seek out [the defendant] as a possible drug trafficker.\u201d <em>LaVelle, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\"><em>Prior bad act testimony. </em>The defendant contends that the judge impermissibly allowed Smith to testify that before he became an informant he had purchased drugs from the defendant. The judge gave a limiting instruction contemporaneous with this testimony and included the same instruction in his final jury instructions. As the defendant preserved this claim with a contemporaneous objection, we review the judge\u2019s action for prejudicial error, which involves a two-part analysis: \u201c(1) was there error; and (2) if so, was that error prejudicial. An error is not prejudicial if it \u2018did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect\u2019; however, if we cannot find \u2018with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error,\u2019 then it is prejudicial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>445 Mass. 589, 591 (2005), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">\u201cIt is well settled that the prosecution may not introduce evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior or subsequent bad acts for the purpose of demonstrating bad character or propensity to commit the crime[s] charged.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>418 Mass. 788, 793 (1994). Such evidence, however, \u201cis admissible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>other relevant probative purposes.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cordle, </em>404 Mass. 733, 744 (1989), <em>S.C., </em>412 Mass. 172 (1992), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallison, </em>383 Mass. 659, 672 (1981). A range of permissible relevant purposes have been recognized in our law, including \u201cto show a common scheme or course of conduct, a pattern of operation, absence of accident or mistake, intent, or motive.\u201d <em>Barrett, supra </em>at 794. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ashman, </em>430 Mass. 736, 741 (2000) (prior bad act evidence admissible to show defendant\u2019s state of mind, intent, and relationship with victim). See also Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 404(b). The evidence is not admitted to directly prove an element of the crime charged \u201cbut merely as circumstantial evidence tending to establish, by inference, one factor relevant to the determination of guilt, e.g., the inference that motive leads to intent, or common scheme leads to the absence of mistake.\u201d <em>Barrett, supra </em>at 795. The judge must also find that the probative value of the evidence in question outweighs the risk of undue prejudice to the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 225 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">We think the judge appropriately considered whether the relevance of this evidence, to establish the nature of the relationship between Smith and the defendant, outweighed the possible prejudice to the defendant. Moreover, the amount of evidence of the prior episodes was minor in comparison with that of the incidents at issue and did not \u201cdivertQ the attention of the jury from the [crimes] immediately before it,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Triplett, </em>398 Mass. 561, 563 (1986), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>132 Mass. 16, 20 (1882), or overwhelm the evidence of the incident at issue in this case. Lastly, the judge gave an appropriate and complete hmiting instruction to the jury contemporaneously with the testimony and also as part of his final instructions. In both instructions, the judge informed the jury that the evidence of prior drug transactions was not to be used by them as any indication of guilt on the instant charges, and it was only to be considered on the issue of Smith\u2019s familiarity or knowledge of Sullivan.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\"><em>Gang unit assignments. </em>The defendant complains that refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>enees to an unrelated gang investigation were error.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree. The defendant failed to object; thus, \u201cwe review to determine whether the statements were improper and, if so, whether they created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Kebreau, </em>454 Mass. at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Here, the evidence did not associate the defendant with a gang, nor did the prosecutor, in witness examination or in closing argument, suggest or intimate such an association. It was clear that the police targeted the defendant as a result of the information from Smith about his prior dealings with the defendant. Thus, \u201cthe jury could not have reasonably inferred . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>that the defendant was a gang member,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>441 Mass. 390, 399 (2004), because the references to gang-related assignments were isolated, fleeting, and completely unrelated to the theory and evidence against the defendant. Compare <em>id. </em>at 399-400 (no substantial risk of miscarriage of justice where, although there was evidence that an officer served on the gang unit, \u201cthere was no other evidence introduced at trial that indicated the defendant or any of the other men in the group were members of a gang, and no reference to gang membership was made by the prosecutor in closing argument\u201d). As these references had a negligible effect, if any, upon the verdicts, they created no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\"><em>Drug certificates. </em>The admission of the two drug certificates without the opportunity for cross-examination of the chemical analyst was error. <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>129 S. Ct. 2527, 2532 (2009). Notwithstanding the absence of an objection, the Supreme Judicial Court has held that the defendant is entitled to the standard of review for preserved constitutional errors.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>456 Mass. 350, 352 (2010). In making our determination whether the instant error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, \u201cwe ask whether \u2018on the totality of the record before us, weighing the properly admitted and the improperly admitted evidence together, we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the tainted evidence did not have an effect on the [fact finder] and did not contribute to the [fact finder\u2019s findings].\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 360, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tyree, </em>455 Mass. 676, 701 (2010). We conclude that the Commonwealth has satisfied its burden of proving that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vardinski, </em>438 Mass. 444, 452 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">\u201cProof that a substance is a particular drug need not be made by chemical analysis and may be made by circumstantial evidence,\u201d including the testimony of properly qualified police and drug-user witnesses. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>399 Mass. 465, 467 (1987). Smith and Geiger both testified, without objection, that the substances purchased from the defendant appeared to be cocaine. We recognize that \u201cit would be a rare case in which [witness statements] that a particular substance looked like a controlled substance would alone be sufficient to support a conviction.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Here, however, the evidence of the nature of the substance, independent of the certificates, was \u201c \u2018overwhelming,\u2019 in the sense that it [was] \u2018so powerful as to \u201cnullify any effect\u201d \u2019 that the improperly admitted evidence \u2018might have had\u2019 on the fact finder or the findings.\u201d <em>Vasquez, supra </em>at 362, quoting from <em>Tyree, supra </em>at 704 n.44. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>456 Mass. 578, 591 (2010), quoting from <em>Tyree, supra </em>at 701 (\u201cunder harmless error review, it is not enough for the Commonwealth to show that the evidence apart from the certificate was \u2018 \u201csufficient\u201d to convict the defendant\u2019 or that the certificate was \u2018 \u201cconsistent\u201d with the admissible evidence\u2019 \u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fluellen, </em>456 Mass. 517, 526 (2010) (under harmless error review, \u201c[w]e look beyond evidentiary sufficiency and consider the actual impact of the tainted evidence on the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">First, Smith (who testified without objection that the substances appeared to be cocaine) admitted that he had been a cocaine addict and that he had used cocaine for about three years. Smith\u2019s identification of the substances therefore rested on a long history of cocaine use. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Villatoro, ante </em>645, 652-654 (2010) (judge entitled to infer that witness, who testified to long history of marijuana use, was able to identify marijuana and competent to testify on subject). \u201c[A] witness need not have used the substance on the occasion in question in order to testify as to its nature. It is enough that the witness have familiarity based on prior use or sale. . . . \u2018[Identification based on past use coupled with present observation of the substance at hand will suffice to establish the illicit nature of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>suspected substance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cantres, </em>405 Mass. 238, 246-247 (1989), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>737 F.2d 971, 978-979 (11th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1164 (1985), and 470 U.S. 1027 (1985). Additionally, Geiger, who also testified without objection that the substances appeared to be cocaine,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was trained and experienced in narcotics identification. He testified that he had been a State trooper for seven years; that he had been extensively trained in narcotics familiarization at local, State, and DEA police academies; that he had taken advance training courses and received in-service training; and that he had made in excess of 1,000 drug arrests.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>454 Mass. 808, 831 (2009) (officer, who had thirteen years\u2019 experience conducting drug searches with narcotics detection canine, testified substance appeared to be cocaine; error harmless). Contrast <em>Vasquez, </em>456 Mass. at 364 (absence of evidence officers had specialized training or experience; error not harmless); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>456 Mass. 378, 381-382 (2010) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Finally, and most significantly, Geiger testified on redirect and recross-examination that after each controlled buy, he performed a field test on the substance purchased from the defendant. Geiger testified that he had been trained, tested, and certified to conduct field tests, and he described in detail the field test materials and procedures. He also testified, without objection, that the substances tested positive for cocaine. Compare <em>Connolly, supra </em>(officer with twenty-five years\u2019 experience in narcotics investigations testified he field tested substances purchased during controlled buys and each tested positive for cocaine; officer with seventeen years\u2019 experience in narcotics investigations testified he field tested substance found in minivan and it tested positive for cocaine; error harmless); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 235, 243 (2009) (detective testified some of the substances were field tested and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>found to be cocaine; error harmless). Contrast <em>Vasquez, supra </em>(no evidence of field tests; error not harmless); <em>Fluellen, </em>456 Mass. at 527 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">In addition to the above evidence that the substances were cocaine, we note that the theory of the defense, as indicated in counsel\u2019s opening and closing arguments and actuated through the cross-examination of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, was that Smith \u201cset up\u201d the defendant. Defense counsel carefully and exhaustively questioned each officer, seeking to show that Smith was not searched completely in advance of each controlled buy and that his actions leading to and during the controlled buys were not under constant observation by surveillance officers. Defense counsel pointed out each occasion that Smith was out of the view of surveillance officers and of the video camera secreted on Smith. Counsel also pointed out that the video never showed the defendant handing anything to Smith, implying that Smith could have had possession of the cocaine all along. As the defense theory rested on the premise that the substances were cocaine, it supports a finding of harmless error. See <em>Rodriguez, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. at 243 (defense theory premised on substance to be that stated in certificates supports finding of harmless error); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Greco, ante </em>296, 299-300 (2010) (defendant\u2019s failure to contest nature of substance noted but not given much weight because, at time of trial, admission of certificates without opportunity to cross-examine analyst did not violate defendant\u2019s constitutional rights). Contrast <em>Charles, </em>456 Mass. at 383 (although defendant did not contest nature of substances, defense theory cannot relieve Commonwealth of its burden of proving nature of substances).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">We are satisfied, given the overwhelming evidence of the nature of the substances, independent of the certificates, that the instant error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\"><em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel. As the defendant\u2019s contentions regarding the process by which Smith was approved as an informant, the prior bad act testimony, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>officers\u2019s testimony regarding their gang task force affiliations did not constitute error, they cannot form the basis of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Regarding the error resulting from the admission of the certificates, as the defendant has received the benefit of an analysis as if that error was preserved by an objection by counsel, there is no basis on which to conclude counsel\u2019s assistance as ineffective on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-12\"> following trial, under the bifurcated procedure required by G.
