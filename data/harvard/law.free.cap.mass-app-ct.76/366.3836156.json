L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A; and committing the offense within a school zone, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J. The defendant asserts error in the denial of his motion to suppress evidence central to his convictions. Specifically, the defendant contends that the arresting officers (i) conducted an unlawful seizure in violation of his rights under art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, and (ii) subjected him to custodial interrogation in violation of his Miranda rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\"><em>Background. </em>The facts are uncontested except <em>in two </em>incidental respects; in both of these the judge credited the defendant\u2019s recollection. At approximately 10:30 p.m. on February 5, 2006, Boston police Officers Duran Edwards and Richard Sleamon<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were patrolling in an unmarked cruiser when they observed the defendant standing in front of a building bearing a \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign. The officers approached, identified themselves, and, while seated in their vehicle, asked the defendant the purpose for his presence; he replied that his mother lived in the building. The officers requested documentary identification<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and ran a warrant check on the defendant, which produced no results. If the officers received documentation, they returned it to the defendant at that point. During this exchange, the officers observed that the defendant was breathing heavily, stuttering, and \u201ccouldn\u2019t get his words out right.\u201d Officer Edwards then proceeded to ask the defendant if he had \u201canything on [him] I need to know about?\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to which the defendant responded, \u201cYeah, I got a bag of weed on me.\u201d It is undisputed that the defendant\u2019s identification had been returned to him before this exchange took place. After the return of the identification, and then, after the defendant\u2019s admission that he was committing a crime at that moment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>proceeded to place his hand in his pocket. The defendant was ordered by the officers to keep his hands in sight while they then asked him if he previously had been arrested, and also proceeded to question him in a general fashion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">At this point, the officers emerged from their cruiser.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant, who now was avoiding eye contact, \u201clooking down at the ground,\u201d made several attempts to put his hands into his pockets. After instructing the defendant to remove his hands, Officer Edwards conducted a patfrisk of the defendant\u2019s waist area. During the course of the frisk, several plastic vials containing \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine fell from the defendant\u2019s pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\"><em>Seizure of the defendant. </em>The motion judge correctly ruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>that the officers did not seize the defendant when they first approached him and asked his identity in a \u201creasonable tone.\u201d An officer\u2019s conversational approach to an individual, absent a show of authority, does not rise to the level of a seizure under art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>429 Mass. 403, 406 (1999); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, </em>449 Mass. 367, 370 (2007). The officers did not restrict the defendant\u2019s freedom of movement, nor did they question the defendant in a hostile manner. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the officers\u2019 location \u2014 whether inside the cruiser or on the sidewalk \u2014 does not alter our conclusion. See <em>DePeiza, supra </em>at 369-370 (no seizure where officers left their vehicle and positioned themselves on either side of the defendant during questioning); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 780, 782 (2005) (no seizure \u201cby simply alighting from the police cruiser and approaching\u201d defendant). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grandison, </em>433 Mass. 135, 138-139 (2001) (encounter became stop when officer not only emerged from cruiser but also commanded defendant to stop).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Even if the officers\u2019 request for identification is characterized as more than a casual street encounter and therefore required justification, such justification was present here. As noted, <em>supra, </em>the officers\u2019 request for identification served to test the defendant\u2019s explanation for his presence in front of a \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Assuming the defendant provided documentation in addition to his oral statements, the officers\u2019 continued retention of the identification after its use for a lawful purpose \u201cimplicitly command[ed] the defendant to remain on the scene.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyles, </em>453 Mass. 811, 815 (2009).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, while we agree with the motion judge that the defendant was seized at a later point in time when Officer Edwards conducted a patfrisk of his person, <em>Lyles </em>instructs that he also may have been seized during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>earlier time period while his documentation was retained by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">As stated, <em>supra, </em>and assuming the defendant provided the officers with identification in written form, it was returned to him after the warrant check was completed. Our cases dealing with investigatory stops recognize that there is some ambiguity inherent in many encounters between citizens and police officers. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>449 Mass. 308, 311 (2007) (\u201cThe nature of an encounter between a citizen and a law enforcement official is necessarily fact specific and requires careful examination of the attending circumstances\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fletcher, 52 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 166, 172 (2001) (\u201c[sjtreet encounters between citizens and police officers are incredibly rich in diversity . . . [which] yields the abundance of \u2018highly fact-based questions\u2019 \u201d [citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">However, where the retention of documents serves as an inferred command to remain on the scene during a warrant check, their return may be viewed as a positive act that removes the command. Simply put, any implicit command dependent on the retention of documents is no longer operative once the documents are returned. Consistent with this logical inference, the defendant testified at the motion hearing that he considered himself free to leave at the point that his identification was returned to him.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s concession is also consistent with that part of the analysis in <em>Lyles </em>that relies on the commonsense conclusion that an individual does not feel free to leave for the very reason that he does not feel free to demand the return of identification from a police officer who has acquired it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyles, supra </em>at 816. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that any initial seizure had terminated when, thereafter in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>possession of his identification, the defendant volunteered that he was carrying marijuana in response to the general inquiry whether he had anything the officers \u201cneed[ed] to know about.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Moreover, even if we assume that the defendant had not been free to depart after the warrant check produced negative results, the police were justified in continuing their investigation under these circumstances, at least to the minimal extent they did so here. The defendant\u2019s odd and evasive behavior provided ample support for the single additional question that led to the admission that the defendant had illegal drugs on his person. Thus, even if the return of the identification is not characterized as a termination of the seizure that began when it was taken, there was reasonable suspicion to prompt the question asked by the police. See note 13, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">We next address the contention that Officer Edwards illegally seized the defendant because he exited his vehicle before, not after, the defendant admitted to possessing marijuana. The motion judge\u2019s finding to the contrary is supported by the evidence. In reviewing a motion to suppress, we adhere to the motion judge\u2019s findings of fact absent clear error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>429 Mass. at 405. \u201cWe independently determine whether the judge correctly applied constitutional principles to the facts as found.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah </em>I., 450 Mass. 818, 821 (2008). \u201cThe clear error standard is a very limited form of review. . . . Where there has been conflicting testimony as to a particular event or series of events, a judge\u2019s resolution of such conflicting testimony invariably will be accepted.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yesilciman, </em>406 Mass. 736, 743 (1990), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spagnolo, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 516, 517-518 (1984).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Moreover the distinction is of no legal import in the circumstances of this case. A person is \u201cseized\u201d by a police officer \u201cif, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rock, </em>429 Mass. 609, 611 (1999), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, </em>422 Mass. 782, 786 (1996). The fact that an officer leaves his cruiser during an encounter is but one factor in considering whether the requisite show of authority has occurred. See <em>DePeiza, </em>449 Mass. at 370; <em>Pagan, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. at 782. The record contains no indicia of additional police conduct that could be interpreted as improper by any standard, much less coercion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The officers asked a single question \u2014 \u201cYou got anything on you I need to know about?\u201d \u2014 which was not excessive<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or improper, especially in light of the defendant\u2019s abnormal behavior preceding the question. Although the dissent characterizes the police as \u201cimpermissibly\u201d using the opportunity of the warrant check to question the defendant at greater length, the general questioning of the defendant in fact did not occur during the warrant check, but, rather, followed his admission that he was in possession of an illegal substance. See note 5, <em>supra. </em>We agree with the motion judge that if the officers left their cruiser before the defendant\u2019s admission, this act did not constitute new grounds to conclude that the defendant was seized at the time he uttered the incriminating statement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thinh Van Cao, </em>419 Mass. 383, 385, 387-388, cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1146 (1995) (no seizure where, absent an order to comply or indication that defendant could not terminate the encounter, officer approached him on foot and asked questions concerning his identity).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>After the defendant\u2019s admission, and after some general questioning and several commands by the officers to keep his hands in sight, the defendant was pat frisked. Having determined that a seizure occurred at the time of the patfrisk, we must evaluate whether the officers\u2019 conduct was reasonable under the circumstances. We do not disagree with the motion judge\u2019s conclusion that the officers harbored a reasonable suspicion that the defendant had committed a crime, and may have been armed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> An officer has the right to \u201cmake a threshold inquiry where suspicious conduct gives the officer reason to suspect that a person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>430 Mass. 725, 729 (2000), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 405 (1974). Furthermore, \u201c[a] protective frisk of a defendant is justified where an officer reasonably believes the defendant is armed and dangerous.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 41, 44 (2002). In assessing the reasonableness of an officers\u2019s belief, we look to the specific inferences drawn from the facts in light of the officer\u2019s experience. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah </em>I., 450 Mass. at 823. Here, as noted, <em>supra, </em>in addition to breathing with difficulty, stuttering, and repeatedly attempting to put his hands in his pockets, the defendant was also avoiding eye contact. \u201cStrange, furtive, or suspicious behavior or movements can infuse otherwise innocent activity with an incriminating aspect.\u201d <em>Pagan, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. at 782-783. The officers were not \u201crequired to accept the risk of [any] ambiguity\u201d under these circumstances. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>454 Mass. 159, 164 (2009) (officers legitimately in presence of group because one individual was trespassing, had the right to conduct patfrisk where defendant disregarded specific instruction to take his hands out of his pockets).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Coupled with the fact that Officer Edwards had made several recent narcotics and firearms-related arrests in the area, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>this demeanor provided reasonable suspicion for the limited pat-frisk of the defendant. <em>DePeiza, </em>449 Mass. at 371-372.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Perhaps more to the point, however, and equally dispositive in this appeal, is the fact that the officers had probable cause to arrest this defendant after he told them he was in possession of illegal drugs. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>413 Mass. 598, 602 (1992), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>410 Mass. 737, 742 (1991) (search incident to arrest may precede formal arrest \u201cas long as probable cause [to arrest] existed independent of the results of the search\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\"><em>Miranda warnings. </em>We next address the defendant\u2019s claim that the officers subjected him to custodial interrogation absent Miranda warnings when they exited their vehicle to continue questioning. Before addressing the merits of the claim, we must determine whether the defendant waived the issue. Rule 13(a)(2) of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that a motion to suppress set forth the grounds \u201cwith particularity.\u201d Furthermore, the rule requires that an affidavit be attached \u201cdetailing all facts relied upon in support of the motion.\u201d A party\u2019s failure to raise a potential claim at his suppression hearing waives any appeal on that issue. See Mass.R.Crim.P. 13(a)(2), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1516 (2004) (\u201cGrounds not stated which reasonably could have been known at the time a motion is filed shall be deemed to have been waived . . .\u201d). The defendant\u2019s motion to suppress focused entirely on the alleged unlawful seizure, and claimed only that his statements should be suppressed as the fruits of that seizure. Moreover, the affidavit contained no facts whatsoever with respect to any such statements. Consequently, the defendant\u2019s claim is waived and not properly before us.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 505, 506-507 (1983) (Miranda issue waived where defendant\u2019s motion to suppress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>focused entirely on illegal search and no objection raised to statements at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-6\"> Although the parties spell Officer Sleamon\u2019s name as detailed in the text, it appears as \u201cSlamin\u201d in the criminal complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\"> The defendant testified that he provided identification.

The judge found that the officer \u201casked the question whether [the defendant] had any guns or drugs on him.\u201d The judge\u2019s use of \u201cguns and drugs\u201d rather than \u201canything\u201d is not supported by the evidence; the difference in wording does not affect our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b409-9\"> At the time of the offense, it was still a crime in Massachusetts to possess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>even a small amount of marijuana.

The motion judge\u2019s findings on this point, though imprecise, adopted the defendant\u2019s version.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b411-6\"> In this context we must disagree with the suggestion in the dissent that the police were not justified in making serious inquiry of the defendant because the initial encounter involved \u201conly\u201d a \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign, representing as that does in many instances a final line of defense for elderly or vulnerable residents of deteriorating neighborhoods to criminal activity on their doorsteps.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\"> We note that the judge did not have the benefit of <em>Lyles, </em>which was decided after the trial in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b412-7\"> Defendant: \u201c[T]hey just hopped out of the car and asked me . . . do I have any weapons or drugs.

In any event, a determination whether a reasonable person is free to leave is a legal conclusion applied to (here, undisputed) facts, and not a factual finding. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rock, </em>429 Mass. 609, 611-612 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b413-9\"> We have noted as well that the finding that the officers were still in their vehicle is based on the defendant\u2019s own testimony, which the motion judge was entitled to credit. See note 5, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b414-5\"> To the contrary, as discussed, <em>supra, </em>the defendant\u2019s own version of events was that his identification, which he knew by then that the police considered to be exculpatory, had been returned to him before they exited the cruiser, and that he considered himself free to leave.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b414-6\"> General questioning unrelated to the reason for a police encounter does not \u201cconvert the encounter into something other than a lawful seizure, so long as those inquiries do not measurably extend the duration of the stop.\u201d <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>129 S.

One question, undeniably the fewest number one can ask, cannot rationally be argued to qualify as violative of this principle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b414-7\"> The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>389 Mass. 233 (1983), is unavailing.

Thereafter, further interaction with the defendants required an articulable justification on the part of the officer. <em>Id. </em>at 243-244.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b415-5\"> Officer Edwards testified as well that the defendant\u2019s mannerisms \u2014 those he observed during his initial questioning about the defendant\u2019s presence in front of a \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign \u2014 \u201care consistent with someone who may be in possession of a weapon.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b415-6\"> This case does not involve a routine traffic stop and the questioning of an individual who was not the driver, and hence not suspected of any traffic violation, as was considered in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>424 Mass. 153, 158-159 (1997). Furthermore, even assuming the defendant was still seized by the police despite the return of his identification and despite his own perception to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>the contrary, his behavior described, <em>supra, </em>satisfies the need for \u201creasonable suspicion grounded in specific articulable facts ... to question him further.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 158.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b416-8\"> Even were we to reach the issue, there is no colorable claim on this record that the defendant was being subjected to custodial interrogation at the time he made his inculpatory statement. See <em>DePeiza, supra </em>at 376 (officer\u2019s querying whether defendant was carrying a gun after announcing he wanted to conduct a patfnsk not deemed custodial interrogation where officers\u2019 tone was conversational and conduct not aggressive).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b417-6\">Wolohojian, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMEz\">(dissenting). The defendant was questioned by police only because he was standing in front of a house posted with a \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign. Although the officers had no reason to think that the defendant was in fact trespassing,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> they were entitled to inquire as to why he was there. Neither his mannerism nor his response gave them any reason to think he was trespassing; indeed, the defendant willingly and openly offered a reasonable explanation for his presence (that his mother lived in the building), and one the officers had no reason to doubt. The officers were, as the motion judge found, satisfied that the defendant was not trespassing.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">I dissent because the encounter should have ended then. Once the original purpose of the questioning was satisfied and no other appeared, the police were not entitled to conduct a fishing expedition simply to see what, if anything, they might turn up. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>389 Mass. 233, 244 (1983) (police inquiry made in context of routine traffic stop must end on production of valid documents); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>424 Mass. 153, 158 (1997) (same).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The problem is exacerbated because the excessive questioning took place in conjunction with an unlawful seizure. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyles, </em>453 Mass. 811, 817 (2009). The defendant was not free to go once the police took his identification, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>see <em>id. </em>at 815-816, and the police impermissibly used that opportunity not only to run a warrant check but also to question the defendant, both aimlessly and intrusively. The last question in this conversation (\u201cYou got anything on you I need to know about?\u201d) happened to occur after the police returned the defendant\u2019s identification. It is overly formalistic to conclude as a matter of law, as the majority does, that a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s circumstances would have believed he was \u201cfree to turn his back on his interrogator and walk away,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass. 541, 544 (1991), simply because his identification had been returned to him in the middle of an ongoing over-reaching police interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">To the extent that the majority is resting its analysis and conclusion on whether, in the circumstances of this case, a reasonable person would have believed himself free to leave, it is engaged in impermissible fact finding. On appeal from an order on a motion to suppress, we may supplement the motion judge\u2019s findings of fact <em>only </em>\u201cif the evidence is uncontroverted and undisputed and where the judge explicitly or implicitly credited the witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah I., </em>448 Mass. 334, 337 (2007). Here, the motion judge made no findings concerning several of the facts relied on by the majority, nor are those facts undisputed. For example, the officer testified that he exited his cruiser before asking the defendant whether he had anything on him; the defendant testified that the officers exited after they received his response. Similarly, the defendant testified that the officers asked him whether he had anything on him immediately after returning his identification, and then immediately left their cruiser when he replied that he had \u201cweed.\u201d The officer, by contrast, testified to a continuing \u201cgeneral conversation\u201d (which included asking the defendant whether he ever had been arrested), and further observations of what he characterized as suspicious behavior, before he exited his vehicle. By way of further example, the defendant denied any suspicious behavior or demeanor, including denying avoiding making eye contact, or being nervous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, fairly read, the transcript reflects that the defendant did not testify that he believed he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>was free to go; instead, his full testimony was that he thought he should have been free to leave once the police determined he had no outstanding warrants, but that the police further detained him. Thus, to the extent that the majority\u2019s analysis or conclusion rests on any of these factual findings, it strays beyond the proper bounds of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-9\"> The police had not received any reports of trespassing, or any other suspicious activity in the area that evening. The police did not know the defendant, and there is no suggestion that they had any reason to think he did not live at the address or was not otherwise legitimately present. The officer admitted that he stopped the defendant only because he was standing near a \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b417-10\"> The <em>Torres </em>and <em>King </em>cases involve police questioning in the context of vehicular stops. There is no reason, however, not to apply their analyses to this case. Indeed, in the related context of searches, it long has been held that vehicles carry with them a diminished expectation of privacy. See, e.g., <em>South Dakota </em>v. <em>Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 368 (1976); <em>Wyoming </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>526 U.S. 295, 304 (1999). It would make no sense, therefore, to hold here (as the majority does) that the defendant is entitled to more protection from police questioning when in his car than on the street.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b418-6\"> Such behavior alone in any event would not justify the search. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 528, 533 (2009), quoting from <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 181, 184 (1999) (\u201cThe trooper\u2019s testimony that the defendant and his fellow passenger had \u2018nervous looks\u2019 or appeared to be \u2018tense\u2019 are \u2018general descriptions [that] fall short of the \u2018specific and articulable facts\u2019 which are required to demonstrate reasonableness\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
