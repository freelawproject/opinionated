Nordberg, is certified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>by the Department of Education (DOE or department) as a school business administrator. The Education Reform Act of 1993 (the Act) provides that school districts may hire only \u201ccertified\u201d school business administrators. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 38G, as amended through St. 1993, c. 495, \u00a7 26. The DOE commissioner, however, may grant one-year waivers of the certification requirement if a school district has established, \u201cin the opinion of the commissioner,\u201d that compliance would be a \u201cgreat hardship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Nordberg\u2019s detailed amended complaint, filed against the DOE, the DOE commissioner in his individual capacity (commissioner), and the Commonwealth, alleged numerous specific instances in which he applied for particular positions that later went to uncertified applicants after a department waiver.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which was allowed. The motion judge ruled that the Commonwealth and the DOE were immune from suit, because claims asserted against both were based on a discretionary function, and, as such, were barred by the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act. See G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(6). The judge also ruled that the commissioner, as a public employee acting within the scope of his employment, was immune from personal liability pursuant to G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nordberg has appealed from the judgment dismissing his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">1. <em>Discretionary function exception. </em>On appeal, the government defendants maintain that the commissioner has complete discretion under the Act to determine whether compliance with the certification requirements would \u201cconstitute a great hardship.\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 38G.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They also argue that the Act and the regulations leave it entirely to the commissioner\u2019s discretion to determine whether a school district has demonstrated \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>good-faith effort to hire licensed or certified personnel, and has been unable to find them.\u201d 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 7.14(13) (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Nordberg avers, however, that the waiver process is automatic. According to his complaint, all that a school district needs to do to obtain a waiver is to submit a request, electronically, that certifies as to \u201chardship,\u201d and that all such requests are granted, again electronically, with no evaluation or review being conducted by the commissioner or by anyone else in the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The question, then, is whether such a process amounts to the exercise of discretion. We conclude that it does not. The Legislature has determined that the public is best served if school districts hire only school business administrators who have satisfied the requirements to become \u201ccertified.\u201d A school district may obtain a one-year waiver only if, \u201cin the <em>opinion </em>of the commissioner\u201d (emphasis added), compliance would be a \u201cgreat hardship.\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 38G.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The defendants contend that they are entitled to discretionary immunity. Although such immunity is broad, it is not so broad as to include nondiscretionary functions. Here, accepting as true the allegations in Nordberg\u2019s well-pleaded complaint<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for purposes of this rule 12(b)(6) motion, see <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, </em>372 Mass. 96 (1977), the commissioner \u2014 contrary to the mandate of the Legislature \u2014 divested himself of the discretion he was statutorily required to exercise in order to form an <em>opinion </em>as to whether to grant or deny a waiver. Discretion was neither exercised nor abused; it was extracted entirely from the process and set aside. In these circumstances, discretionary immunity does not apply because, at bottom, no discretion was involved. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gaubert, </em>499 U.S. 315, 325 (1991) (\u201c[a] discretionary act is one that involves choice or judgment\u201d). If, as Nordberg avers, all waiver requests were automatically granted electronically, we fail to see how such actions \u201cinvolved the kind of policy judgment that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332. The discretion that ought to be involved in deciding waivers entails \u201cweighing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>alternatives and making choices with respect to public policy and planning,\u201d as opposed to conduct that consists of \u201cthe carrying out of previously established policies or plans.\u201d <em>Harry Stoller &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>412 Mass. 139, 142 (1992), quoting from <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>373 Mass. 208, 218 (1977).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">2. <em>Constitutional claims. </em>Nordberg\u2019s complaint also alleged due process and equal protection violations. The motion judge did not rule on these claims. Nordberg alleged that, in some instances, the licensing statute was circumvented in order that friends or benefactors of the appointing authorities could be rewarded. If the Act was systematically undermined for this purpose, such actions would represent an abuse of power that would \u201cshock[] the conscience,\u201d see <em>Rochin </em>v. <em>California, </em>342 U.S. 165, 172 (1952), and would be actionable. Compare <em>Coyne </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>972 F.2d 440 (1st Cir. 1992). Cf. <em>Kennie </em>v. <em>Natural Resource Dept. of Dennis, </em>451 Mass. 754, 761-762 &amp; nn.14 &amp; 15 (2008).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>It was error to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, based on the state of the pleadings in this action. Accepting the plaintiff\u2019s allegations as true, as is required by rule 12(b)(6), his complaint fairly states a claim upon which relief may be granted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As to the constitutional claims, the matter must be remanded for con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>sideration by the motion judge in the first instance. Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\"> The plaintiffs amended complaint identifies some twenty-nine applications that he had submitted to various local and regional school districts for a school business administrator position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b259-9\"> For all that appears, the department\u2019s motion was under the provisions of Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b259-10\"> The pertinent language of \u00a7 38G provides: \u201c[A] superintendent may upon request be exempt by the commissioner for any one school year from the requirement ... to employ certified personnel when compliance therewith would in the opinion of the commissioner constitute a great hardship in securing teachers for that school district.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\"> The motion judge rejected one ground of the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, concluding the plaintiffs amended complaint was \u201csufficient\u201d within the meaning of Mass.R.Civ.P. 8, 365 Mass. 749 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b261-7\"> We note in passing that if an administrator could permissibly delegate his authority to exercise discretion to a computer such a scenario would call for, upon review, a showing that the computer was capable of exercising the discretion with which it was vested, either rightly or wrongly; i.e., had the capacity or ability to make \u201cchoices,\u201d which is the essence of discretion. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gaubert, </em>499 U.S. at 325.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b261-8\"> These allegations are also pertinent to consideration of Nordberg\u2019s complaint against Driscoll in his individual capacity. Cf. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Chief Justice for Admn. &amp; Mgmt. of the Trial Ct., </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 174, 180 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b261-9\"> The defendants\u2019 claim that the DOE and the commissioner had no recognizable duty or power with respect to the internal hiring decisions of the school districts misses the mark.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b261-10\"> Review of this entire process gets \u201ccuriouser and curiouser\u201d and brings to mind Lewis Carroll\u2019s Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland, ch. 2, first par. (1865), in that, pursuant to the Act, the department requires prospective applicants to pursue a challenging regimen in order to attain certification, while it routinely waives that requirement for persons without certification. It is well to remember that \u201ca good democratic government must be protected from within, as well as watched from without.\u201d <em>Lovell </em>v. <em>Superintendent, N. Cent. Correctional Inst., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 35, 41 (1988) (Brown, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
