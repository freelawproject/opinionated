The partnership was formed in 1979 by Raymond E. Shea, Sr. (Shea Sr.), who was the sole general partner until October, 1994, when he assigned his entire interest in the partnership (thirty percent) to his son, Raymond E. Shea, Jr. (Shea Jr.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In December, 2002, after conducting an audit, the commissioner issued a notice of failure to file partnership tax returns for the tax years beginning in 1979 and ending in 2001. That notice was followed in March, 2003, by a notice of intent to assess penalties and interest in the amount of $503,645 for the failure to file returns. CWDA objected to the penalties on the ground that it had relied on advice from its tax advisor, Joseph A. Simoncini, Sr.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who allegedly advised CWDA that it did not need to file partnership returns if the partnership had no income. CWDA subsequently filed partnership returns and requests for abatement, which were denied, and ultimately petitioned the board seeking relief. After hearing, the board affirmed the commissioner\u2019s ruling, concluding that CWDA had not sustained its burden of proving an entitlement to an abatement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\"><em>Discussion. A </em>decision by the board will not be modified or reversed if it \u201cis based on both substantial evidence and a correct application of the law.\u201d <em>Boston Professional Hockey Assn. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>443 Mass. 276, 285 (2005). The board concluded that CWDA did not exercise the ordinary business care and prudence necessary to establish that its failure to file tax returns was due to \u201cgood and sufficient cause.\u201d G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 34. CWDA contends that the board erred and claims that its failure to file partnership returns as required by G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 7,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> should be excused because it relied on the erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>advice of a competent tax professional. We disagree. We have no difficulty concluding that the board\u2019s findings are based on substantial evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The board heard testimony from Shea Jr. and Simoncini,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> who was Shea Sr.\u2019s business and personal tax advisor for forty years and prepared personal tax returns for Shea Jr. As the board noted, Shea Jr. testified that, as the general partner of CWDA, he relied upon Simoncini\u2019s advice that there was no need to file partnership returns.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Simoncini, however, stated both that he had no \u201crecords or documents regarding this limited partnership in my possession or control\u201d and that he \u201cnever advised either [Shea Sr. or Shea Jr.] on the specific issue of whether or not this partnership was required to file partnership tax returns.\u201d The board credited Simoncini\u2019s statements, finding that \u201cSimoncini was not aware that [CWDA] was a limited partnership, nor was he presented with any documentation regarding [CWDA\u2019s] finances. Mr. Simoncini did not bill Shea Jr. or CWDA for his advice, and neither Shea Jr. nor Mr. Simoncini documented their conversations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">We now consider whether the board correctly applied the law. In order to prevail on its request for an abatement, CWDA was required to establish \u201cgood and sufficient cause\u201d for its failure to file partnership returns. G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 34. The board noted that the term \u201cgood and sufficient cause\u201d is not defined in G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 34, and found no authority from our appellate courts defining the term in the context of that statute. Thus, the board looked to an analogous penalty provision set forth in G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 <em>33(f), </em>inserted by St. 1980, c. 27, \u00a7 4, which governs penalties for failure to file other tax returns. Section <em>33(f) </em>provides for the abatement of penalties where there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u201creasonable cause\u201d for the failure to file. Because, as the board explained, \u201cboth standards were intended to focus on whether the taxpayer\u2019s conduct was reasonable,\u201d it applied a \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard in determining whether CWDA was entitled to an abatement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cAlthough the proper interpretation of a statute is for a court to determine, we recognize the board\u2019s expertise in the administration of tax statutes and give weight to the board\u2019s interpretations.\u201d <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>455 Mass. 334, 337 (2009), citing <em>Bell Atl. Mobile of Mass. Corp., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>451 Mass. 280, 283 (2008). We \u201cwill affirm [the board\u2019s] statutory interpretation if that interpretation is reasonable.\u201d <em>AA Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>454 Mass. 114, 119 (2009). We conclude that treating the term \u201cgood and sufficient cause\u201d as the equivalent of \u201creasonable cause\u201d is a reasonable interpretation of the statute, and, therefore, we adopt it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Reasonable cause is established where, \u201c[a]t a minimum, the taxpayer . . . show[s] that he exercised the degree of care that an ordinary taxpayer in his position would have exercised.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>Wells Yachts South, Inc., </em>406 Mass. 661, 665 (1990). See <em>Geoffrey, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>453 Mass. 17, 25-26 (2009). Reasonable cause may be found wtieiia taxpayer has relied on substantive tax advice given by a 'competent professional. See, e.g., <em>Syms Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>436 Mass. 505, 515 (2002). However, as the United States Supreme Court has observed, rebanee on a tax professional \u201ccannot function as \u00e1 substitute for compliance with an unambiguous statute.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Boyle, </em>469 U.S. 241, 251 (1985). Moreover, a taxpayer is still required to exercise \u201cordinary business care and prudence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253 (Brennan, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Here, the board properly concluded that Shea Jr.\u2019s \u201cextremely sporadic and infrequent consultations with Mr. Simoncini\u201d did not provide CWDA with good and sufficient cause for its failure to file partnership tax returns. The evidence also supports the board\u2019s conclusion that because CWDA did not furnish Simoncini with the appropriate facts or documentation necessary to offer accurate advice, it failed to exercise ordinary business care and prudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">As Shea Jr. acknowledges, there were only three informal conversations between the Sheas and Simoncini (over an approximately twenty-year period) about CWDA\u2019s tax obligations. Neither Shea Sr. nor Shea Jr. provided Simoncini with a copy of the partnership agreement, property deeds, or any financial records. In fact, Simoncini was never informed that CWDA was a limited partnership. This conduct does not reflect ordinary business care and prudence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Consequently, CWDA did not meet its burden of proving that it was entitled to an abatement. See <em>M &amp; T Charters, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>404 Mass. 137, 140 (1989) (taxpayer who claims right to abatement carries burden of proof).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Finally, we decline to address CWDA\u2019s argument that the commissioner may not collect failure to file penalties beyond the last seven tax years at issue. See Technical Information Release 03-17 (August 28, 2003), 5 Official MassTax Guide 161, 162 (West 2009). This argument was not raised below, nor was it addressed in CWDA\u2019s appellate brief. Instead, one week prior to oral argument, CWDA sought to raise this issue in motions to expand the appellate record and to file a supplemental brief. The argument, therefore, is waived. See <em>Bruno </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Wrentham, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 527, 531-532 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\n<em>Decision of the Appellate Tax Board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-13\"> The penalties were assessed under G.

L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13. See <em>Syms Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>436 Mass. 505, 511 (2002). Accordingly, \u201c[o]ur review of the board\u2019s factual findings is limited to whether, as a matter of law, the evidence is sufficient to support them.\u201d <em>Sherwin-Williams Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>438 Mass. 71, 80 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b355-12\"> The board also heard testimony from Peter Kortkamp, the commissioner\u2019s sole witness, and received in evidence various exhibits, including two affidavits prepared by Simoncini.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b355-13\"> Both Shea Jr. and Simoncini agree that the Sheas sought advice only three times: once in the late 1970\u2019s, in 1995, and again in 1997 or 1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b356-6\"> Neither party objected to the board\u2019s application of a \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard. To the extent that CWDA contends that the board erred because it determined that \u201creasonable cause\u201d is an objective rather than a subjective standard, its argument is misplaced. See <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>Wells Yachts South, Inc., </em>406 Mass. 661, 665 (1990) (\u201cIn providing for the abatement of penalties when a taxpayer\u2019s tardiness was due to \u2018reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect,\u2019 \u00a7 <em>33(f) </em>sets an objective standard\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\"> By St. 1980, c. 27, \u00a7 4, the Legislature rewrote G.

App. Tax Bd. Rep. 73 (1993), on which CWDA relies, is distinguishable. In that case, the board abated failure to file penalties where the taxpayer established reasonable reliance upon the erroneous advice of a tax professional after providing that professional with all relevant financial information. <em>Id. </em>at 78. By contrast, the Sheas failed to provide Simoncini with the information necessary to enable him to provide sound advice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
