Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>of the erroneous admission of some portions of Jane\u2019s hospital records, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\"><em>Background..</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Jane, bom in 1985, was the Commonwealth\u2019s principal witness. She testified that the defendant, her father, sexually abused her, beginning between the ages of ten and twelve, while the family lived in Georgia. The family moved to Massachusetts in 1998 or 1999 and, except for a two-year period, the abuse continued. The Commonwealth\u2019s additional witnesses included Jane\u2019s former boy friend, Robert Fuller (agreed by the parties, pretrial, as the first complaint witness); Shannon Crosby, Jane\u2019s friend; two Wareham police officers; a social worker from the Department of Children and Families (DCF); and a treating social worker. Medical records from two hospitals, Tobey and St. Luke\u2019s, were admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">On November 17, 2002, Jane was taken to the two hospitals under circumstances described in the evidence as a suicide attempt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She remained at the Tobey Hospital for about four hours, and was transferred to St. Luke\u2019s Hospital for psychiatric care, where she remained for five days. Jane\u2019s combined records from both hospitals consisted of more than eighty pages, and contained allegations Jane made to police officers and hospital staff that her father had repeatedly sexually abused her. The records include approximately twenty allegations of sexual abuse and conclusory statements of rape and incest, including the following: \u201c[Jane] has been raped by her father since age [twelve],\u201d \u201c[i]ncest with father, long-term,\u201d and \u201cshe has been sexually abused by father since [approximately] age [twelve].\u201d Additionally, the statement, \u201c[fjather admitted to this,\u201d appears in at least two separate places in the medical records.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>The case was, as is often typical, a contest of credibility between the defendant and Jane. There was no physical evidence of the alleged abuse. The jury were permitted to propose written questions to witnesses during the trial,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and many detailed questions were placed to witnesses by the judge during, or at the immediate conclusion of, a witness\u2019s testimony. During jury deliberations, the jury submitted a question that revealed that they had focused their attention on a portion of the hospital records relating an admission by the defendant (the defendant denied having made any such admission). The jury reported deadlock after fifteen hours of deliberation, and were given the <em>Tuey-Rodriquez </em>charge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Eventually the defendant was acquitted of rape, and convicted on the charge of incest.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Admission of hospital records. </em>Prior to trial, the parties argued the admissibility of the hospital records. The defendant requested admission of two brief portions of the records that he argued was evidence of a state of mind corroborative of other statements Jane allegedly made recanting her allegations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He argued for the exclusion of the remaining portions of the records because the medical records statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79, \u201cdoes not get the Commonwealth around the requirements of [the first complaint doctrine as articulated in] <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King[, </em>445 Mass. 217 (2005), cert, denied, 456 U.S. 1216 (2006)].\u201d The Commonwealth argued for the admission of both sets of records, in toto, relying on the medical records exception to the hearsay rule. The judge, who suggested that she agreed with the Commonwealth\u2019s position, reserved decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">On the second day of trial, prior to the resumption of Jane\u2019s direct testimony, the judge heard further arguments as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>hospital records. The Commonwealth again argued for their admissibility on the basis of the medical records statute, as records of medical treatment, and further contended that the first complaint doctrine did not apply. The defendant\u2019s attorney continued to argue for exclusion on the basis of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King </em>and \u201cthe balance of the rules of evidence.\u201d The judge ruled the records admissible, concluding that the first complaint doctrine did not preclude admission because the records were admissible on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Before resuming direct examination of the defendant on the third day of trial, defense counsel requested reconsideration of that ruling and specifically requested excision of \u201cthe revelations of complaint that are listed in those records.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The request was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">The hospital records were not emphasized at trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, a treating social worker testified to her examination of the medical records, and the judge, responding to a question from the jury, explained that all of the medical records would be sent to them. The judge instructed the jury to refer to the records during deliberations. Additionally, both attorneys referred to the medical records in closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Moreover, during their deliberations, the jury asked to be told the identity of the hospital employee who made the notations appearing on a particular hospital intake form. Examination of the record reveals that these notations referred to Jane\u2019s claim of sexual abuse, including the statement that \u201c[fjather admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>to this. Police called &amp; fa[ther] placed under arrest.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Defense counsel acknowledged that he had overlooked this statement during his review of the hospital records and requested a curative instruction stating that the defendant \u201cdid not admit to these allegations.\u201d The judge refused to give this instruction on the basis that whether the father admitted to the allegations was a jury question. Instead, the judge instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-5\">\u201cWhat I can say to you, though, is that this information that\u2019s written on here is information that came from [Jane], including this phrase, \u201cfather admitted to this.\u201d That is information that came from [Jane], You probably understood that anyway. But just to make sure that you knew that the hospital didn\u2019t go out and do its own independent investigation before whoever it was wrote this wrote it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Defense counsel noted his dissatisfaction with the adequacy of the curative instruction, and moved for a mistrial based on the prejudicial impact of the hospital records. The judge denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the wholesale admission of Jane\u2019s medical records contained multiple complaint testimony in violation of the first complaint doctrine. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">2. <em>Hospital records and the first complaint doctrine. </em>We begin our analysis by determining \u201cwhether the challenged testimony, viewed in the context in which it was offered, strayed beyond the permissible boundaries of the [first complaint] doctrine.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, </em>453 Mass. 214, 222 (2009). In this case, the records were not admissible as first complaint evidence. As discussed above, by pretrial agreement, Robert Fuller was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>the designated first complaint witness. The hospital records, which contain additional complaints by Jane of abuse by her father, written statements of hospital personnel reiterating the complaints, and conclusory statements of rape and incest, were inadmissible as first complaint evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Our next task is to determine \u201cwhether evidence which was inadmissible as first complaint was nevertheless independently admissible in the judge\u2019s discretion on the basis of some other evidentiary principle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224. However, the mere \u201cexistence of a potential alternative evidentiary basis for the admission of repetitive extrajudicial complaint evidence does not guarantee its admissibility.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monteiro, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 489, 494 (2009). Instead, if \u201cafter careful balancing of the testimony\u2019s probative and prejudicial value, testimony is found by the judge to be relevant and admissible for reasons <em>that are independent of the first complaint doctrine, </em>in the context of a particular case, it is within the judge\u2019s discretion to admit the testimony\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Arana, supra </em>at 229. \u201cThe evidence . . . must serve a separate function, and must be of sufficient importance to a fair understanding of the Commonwealth\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Monteiro, supra </em>at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The judge in this case evaluated the hospital records on various grounds. Pretrial she indicated that the records were likely admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule because they were made for purposes of diagnosis and treatment, concluding that the first complaint doctrine was a different exception to the hearsay rule. Later, in overruling the defendant\u2019s objection to the records during direct examination of Jane, the judge ruled that the records were admissible as statements made during treatment and thus were not barred by the first complaint doctrine. These rulings are incorrect as matters of law<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> because, as discussed above, the judge must first determine whether the testimony serves a purpose other than corroborating Jane\u2019s testimony and then weigh its probative and prejudicial value. <em>Arana, supra </em>at 229. The judge did not conduct such an inquiry in this case and, even more troubling, there does not appear to be a separate purpose for introducing the further evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>complaint contained in the medical records.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The medical records statute, which is merely a separate evidentiary principle, does not, on its own, constitute a separate purpose for admitting further complaint testimony. See <em>Monteiro, supra </em>at 495. Furthermore, even if there were a separate purpose for admitting the further evidence of complaint contained in the medical records, it would be an abuse of discretion to admit them in toto, containing the statements that they do, without any redaction or competent instruction to the jury. The error is preserved, and thus we review under the familiar principles of the prejudicial error standard. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">On this record, \u201c[w]e cannot say that the judge\u2019s error in admitting the improper [evidence] was not prejudicial.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>The records contain overwhelming repetitions by various members of the hospital staff of the allegations of abuse.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In addition, the \u201ccentral determination before the jury was the credibility of [Jane].\u201d <em>Arana, supra </em>at 228. Again, as in <em>Arana, </em>the jury did not believe Jane\u2019s entire story because the defendant was acquitted on the charge of rape. \u201cIn a case such as this one, which turned on credibility, there is a particularly high probability of prejudice from the admission of duplicative complaint evidence.\u201d <em>Monteiro, supra </em>at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The erroneous admission of the medical records, including the statement that \u201c[fjather admits to this and was placed under arrest,\u201d was powerfully inculpatory. The jury\u2019s question regarding this particular notation reflects that they were focused on it. Other questions from the jury during deliberations, questions posed by the jury to witnesses during trial, and the jury\u2019s deadlock after fifteen hours of deliberation persuade us that the jury were being extremely careful and that the case was very close. The statements contained in the hospital records, including both the multiple complaints by Jane and the father\u2019s alleged admission, should not have been before the jury, and served impermissibly to corroborate Jane\u2019s testimony in a case in which credibility was the central issue. We cannot fairly conclude \u201cthat the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect\u201d and thus the conviction must be reversed. <em>Flebotte, supra </em>at 353, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">3. <em>Other issues. </em>We briefly comment on other issues that may arise in the event of a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">a. <em>Voir dire. </em>The defendant argues that the voir dire on first complaint was insufficient. In the event of a retrial, the judge and the attorneys will have the benefit of <em>Arana, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuckich, </em>450 Mass. 449 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">b. <em>Testimony of Shannon Crosby. </em>Crosby, a friend of Jane, was permitted to testify that she went to the police to make disclosures in which Jane\u2019s complaint was embedded. The judge noted the testimony as \u201cappropriate to set the context for why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>[Jane] did what she did, why it goes, I think, to her credibility.\u201d In the event of retrial, the parties and the judge will have the benefit of <em>Arana, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\"><em>c. Exclusion of evidence of alleged prior allegations by Jane. </em>The defendant sought to admit evidence of, and cross-examine Jane about, a previous allegation of abuse against the defendant that Jane had allegedly made and recanted while the family was living in Georgia. The judge excluded the evidence, finding that the defendant\u2019s offer of proof was insufficient because there was no independent basis that it was a false allegation. There was no error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 487, 490-491 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 823, 831 (2007). The narrow exceptions in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>376 Mass. 90 (1978), do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">d. <em>Jane\u2019s journal. </em>The defendant sought to admit an entry from Jane\u2019s journal, asserting that it constituted evidence that Jane intended to lie. The defendant\u2019s argument is so remote that the judge\u2019s refusal to admit the testimony could not have been an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The admission of the medical records in toto violated the first complaint doctrine and was error requiring reversal of the judgment of conviction of incest. The jury verdict is set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b886-15\"> A pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b887-7\"> The dissent narrates a version of the facts that \u201cthe jury were entitled to find . . . .\u201d In the majority opinion, we recite the facts in order to form the predicate for our review of potential prejudice flowing from improperly admitted evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b887-8\"> The evidence is conflicting as to what, if any, medications were ingested by Jane.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b887-9\"> In total there are over twenty instances of complaint in the hospital records.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monteiro, </em>75 Mass.

I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">We disagree with the dissent\u2019s position that the defendant\u2019s desire to have recantation evidence admitted precludes his objection to other inadmissible portions of the hospital records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b889-8\"> At this time defense counsel also objected to the admission of the hospital records on the grounds of relevance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b889-9\"> The dissent suggests that the defendant intended to use the allegations appearing in the hospital records to support his challenge to Jane\u2019s credibility based on recantation. However, the defendant\u2019s opening statement reflects that he intended to rely, and did principally rely, on the testimony of Jane\u2019s mother and grandmother to establish that Jane recanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">In his opening, defense counsel\u2019s only reference to the medical records was that the jury \u201cwill have other information in the medical records that [they] will be able to look at,\u201d and then described Jane\u2019s statement discussed in note 7, <em>supra. </em>This fleeting comment went to Jane\u2019s state of mind and made no reference to the objectionable portions of the records. Moreover, the jury had before them other evidence that the father had been placed under arrest on the basis of accusations by Jane, thereby furnishing context for Jane\u2019s recantations to her mother and grandmother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b890-9\"> The father\u2019s alleged admission, phrased in slightly different terms, appeared in two separate notations contained in the hospital records:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-10\">\u201c[Patient] disclosed being sexually assaulted by father since age of [twelve years]. Father admits to this and was placed under arrest. [Patient] reporting she is now concerned her mother is going to be mad because she has disclosed.

Police called [&amp; father] placed under arrest [DCF] also called to interview [patient] her mother &amp; her siblings.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b891-7\"> We note that, at the time of trial in this case, the parties and the judge did not have the benefit of cases exploring the first complaint doctrine, such as <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuckich, </em>450 Mass. 449 (2008), and <em>Arana, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b892-6\"> In <em>Arana, supra </em>at 227, further evidence of complaint was admissible in order to rebut the defendant\u2019s allegation that the complainant fabricated the accusations to provide a basis for a civil lawsuit. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kebreau, </em>454 Mass. 287, 299 (2009), such evidence was admissible because the defense exploited discrepancies in the testimony of one of the victims and had \u201copened the door on cross-examination\u201d; thus, \u201cthe Commonwealth was entitled to attempt to rehabilitate the witness.\u201d Here, the medical records were introduced prior to any cross-examination of Jane.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dargon (No. 1), </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 330, 336, further appellate review granted, 455 Mass. 1101 (2009), multiple complaint evidence was admissible because the defense strategy was a \u201ccataloging of the numerous individuals the victim encountered, suggesting in essence that if the victim had been telling the truth, she would have told more of those\u201d people. The defense strategy in <em>Dargon </em>manipulated the first complaint doctrine (because only the first person whom the victim told of the abuse could testify as to the allegation) and thus the Commonwealth was \u201cpermitted, within reason, to admit evidence of the victim\u2019s prior consistent statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337. That is not the situation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Additionally, the portion of the hospital records that was admitted in <em>Dargon </em>over the defendant\u2019s objection consisted only of the victim\u2019s detailed description of the sexual assault. <em>Dargon, supra </em>at 333. However, the records admitted in this case do much more. In addition to reiterating allegations of sexual abuse, they contain statements of hospital personnel repeating the allegations, conclusory statements of rape, and a diagnosis of incest. Furthermore, it appears that the records in <em>Dargon </em>were at least partially redacted. <em>Id. </em>at 333.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b892-9\"> No mention was made by either party or the judge of the prohibition in the medical records statute that \u201cnothing therein shall be admissible as evidence which has reference to the question of liability.\u201d G.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMonte, </em>427 Mass. 233, 242 (1998) (notations on hospital intake form stating that complainant had been \u201cassaulted\u201d should have been redacted); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>448 Mass. 122, 137 (2006) (\u201cstatements bearing on the question of liability\u201d and \u201cultimate conclusions\u201d should be redacted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b893-9\"> We are particularly troubled by the portions of the hospital records that state a diagnosis of \u201c[ijncest with father, long-term,\u201d the statement that Jane \u201chas been raped by her father since age [twelve],\u201d and the statement that \u201cfather admits to this and was placed under arrest.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b894-10\"> The defendant also argued that the judge should not have permitted the prosecutor to ask Jane, her mother, or her maternal grandmother about their failure to contact Jane following her accusations.

If the defendant had been entitled to a perfect trial, I would comfortably side with the majority. But he was not. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lodge, </em>431 Mass. 461, 476 (2000). Mistakes were made at this trial, which in my estimation does not separate it from many others, if any at all. While I agree with the majority\u2019s finding of error in the admission of the unredacted hospital records, I part company with them on the issue of prejudice. Although our difference is a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>degree, my view is that the defendant received a fair trial. Because I do not believe a new trial is required, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The facts of this case are as sad as they are ugly. The majority\u2019s truncated recitation of the events surrounding the hospital records fails to provide a sufficient picture of what occurred at trial. A full picture is necessary to determine if, and to what extent, the defendant was prejudiced by the admission of the unredacted hospital records.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">a. <em>The Commonwealth\u2019s case. </em>The jury were entitled to find the following facts in support of the defendant\u2019s incest conviction. The victim, Jane,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is the defendant\u2019s biological daughter. She was bom in 1985. When she was young, her family lived in Georgia while the defendant was in the Navy. While living in Georgia, when Jane was between ten and twelve years old, the defendant began sexually abusing her. He told Jane that he needed to \u201ccorrect\u201d her because he was afraid that she was becoming a lesbian and their family did not believe that was right. The abuse began with sexual touching and oral intercourse, and then continued to vaginal intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">When Jane was thirteen or fourteen, the defendant retired from the Navy and moved his family to Wareham, where he continued his sexual abuse of Jane. The abuse occurred once or twice a week, usually vaginal intercourse but sometimes oral penetration as well. Although Jane\u2019s mother was often home during these episodes, she suffered from severe depression and slept a lot. Her mother would occasionally visit Jane\u2019s maternal grandmother in Connecticut, sometimes with Jane\u2019s younger sister. As Jane got older, she often stayed home with the defendant during these trips because she worked. On four or five occasions, the defendant brought Jane to a hotel in Middleboro, where he would perpetrate his incestuous conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">When Jane was fourteen, she began dating Robert Fuller, another high school student. They dated for two years. A few months into their relationship, Jane told Fuller about her father\u2019s sexual abuse, but asked him not to tell anyone. During her relationship with Fuller, Jane asked the defendant to stop sexually abusing her because Fuller wanted to marry her. The defendant agreed, but he also stopped talking to her. When Jane was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>about sixteen or seventeen, she stopped dating Fuller. Upon this occurring, the defendant reinitiated his sexual abuse of Jane. He told Jane that he did not want to stop because he cared for her, that it would hurt him to stop, and that he believed that there was nothing wrong with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Jane worked at a nearby nursing home where she met Dustin Harris, an African-American man, who was eight years her senior. Jane began dating Harris without her parents\u2019 knowledge because she thought they would not approve of an interracial relationship. On November 14, 2002, while Jane was at Harris\u2019s home, the defendant arrived. He was not happy. Jane went home with the defendant. When they got home, the defendant took out a gun that he had been carrying, removed the bullets, and put the gun away. He told Jane that he was unhappy with her and that he would tell her mother about Harris. Jane, wanting to convince the defendant not to tell her mother and to make him happy, had sexual intercourse with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">On November 17, 2002, Jane and the defendant went for a walk on the beach near their home. The defendant was very disappointed in Jane. He did not like that she was dating Harris and he wanted her to stop. He also told her that he did not want to stop having a sexual relationship with her. Jane felt trapped, scared, and did not know what to do. In an attempt to kill herself, Jane went home and took a full bottle of pain pills and one-half of the defendant\u2019s heart medication. She sent a computer instant message to her friend, Shannon Crosby, in which she described her overdose. Jane went to Crosby\u2019s house, where she met Crosby and another friend, Ashley. Ashley\u2019s mother eventually brought Jane home, telling Jane\u2019s parents about the overdose. A few weeks before the November 17 suicide attempt, Jane had told Crosby that \u201csomething . . . was going on with her father.\u201d Crosby reported Jane\u2019s disclosure to the police on November 17. Crosby\u2019s report was not made at anyone\u2019s direction, but because she was worried about Jane.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">Jane\u2019s parents took her to Tobey Hospital in Wareham on November 17. At the hospital, Jane was given medication that made her vomit. She was then brought to St. Luke\u2019s Hospital in New Bedford. On or after November 17, 2002, Jane disclosed the defendant\u2019s sexual abuse to various hospital staff members. Her hospital records contained handwritten notes (many of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>which were barely legible) of her disclosures, including that the defendant had raped Jane for many years and that there had been long-term incest. The records also showed that Jane told hospital personnel that she had been \u201cdoing bad things,\u201d \u201clying to [her] parents,\u201d and that she was sorry for what she had done. Also at the hospital, after her mother and grandmother tried to convince her that the entire event had been a dream and attempted to get her to agree that she had lied, Jane recanted the allegations because they were being \u201cpretty pushy\u201d and she just wanted them to leave her alone. However, according to her mother and grandmother, Jane said she had lied because the defendant had forbidden her to date Harris. After her hospital stay, Jane had no contact with her mother and grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">The police did not seize any clothing or bedding from Jane\u2019s parents\u2019 home because Jane had told them that she had washed everything because she felt dirty. The defendant denied any sexual relationship or conduct with Jane when he was interviewed by a Department of Children and Families (DCF) social worker. He told the DCF social worker that he believed that Jane had made the allegations because she was upset that he found out that Jane was dating an older man of a different race.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">b. <em>The defense. </em>As set out in the defendant\u2019s opening statement, the defense was built around the assertion that Jane, an angry teenager, had manufactured her sexual assault claim at the hospital in revenge for the defendant forbidding her to date Harris (both of which occurred the same day), and that she recanted this allegation at the hospital. In support of this theory, the defense called a police officer who responded to the defendant\u2019s house on the day of the suicide attempt. According to the officer, Jane told him that she took an entire bottle of pain relieving pills and four nitroglycerin tablets because she felt that she had let her mother down and figured that they would be better off without her.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Jane\u2019s mother and grandmother testified that Jane said her allegations against the defendant were lies because of the argument she had with the defendant about Harris. Jane\u2019s mother admitted that she had complete financial dependence on the defendant and had no real employment skills of her own. The defendant testified that he counted the pills in his nitroglycerin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>bottle and none was missing. He denied all the allegations of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>The hospital records. </em>The statute establishing the medical records exception to the hearsay rule, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79, \u201cis not to be interpreted as rendering admissible all the contents of hospital records.\u201d <em>Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, 316 </em>Mass. 524, 528 (1978). Rather, \u00a7 79 makes admissible only those portions of records relating to \u201ctreatment and medical history.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>448 Mass. 122, 136 (2006), quoting from G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79. Conversely, medical records that include statements on the question of liability (or culpability) must be redacted. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 803(6)(B) (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Here, it was error for the judge, over the defendant\u2019s objection, to admit the hospital records without redacting handwritten phrases such as, patient \u201chas been raped by her father since age [twelve],\u201d patient \u201cdiscloses being sexually assaulted by father,\u201d \u201cfather admits to this and was placed under arrest,\u201d \u201cincest with father, long term,\u201d and patient was \u201csexually abused by father.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dwyer, supra </em>at 137. The error may also be viewed as a violation of the first complaint doctrine outlined in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. 217, 241-248 (2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1216 (2006). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuckich, </em>450 Mass. 449, 457 (2008). However, in either case, because the error was not structural, we must review for prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">Because this was a nonconstitutional error, the judgment may stand if we are \u201csure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Kotteakos </em>v. <em>United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 764 (1946). Put another way,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-8\">\u201cif [we] cannot say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error, it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected .... [The question is] whether the error itself had substantial influence. If so, or if one is left in grave doubt, the conviction cannot stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 765. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 352-353 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>445-446 (1983). Based on my review of the entire record, after pondering all that happened at the trial, and without removing the fact of the improper admission of the unredacted hospital records from the whole proceeding, I can say with fair assurance that the jury were not substantially swayed by the error, which at best, had a slight effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">I base my view on several factors. First, the defense was built on the premise that the victim concocted the allegations in revenge for the defendant prohibiting her from dating Harris, who was African-American and eight years her senior. From the outset of the case, beginning with his motion in limine to admit certain of the victim\u2019s statements contained in the hospital records,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and as set out in his opening statement, the defendant planned to use the hospital records to show the victim had recanted the allegations. The defendant specifically sought the admission of a hospital record that was understood to be a recantation, and he told the jury that they would have medical records as further evidence of the victim\u2019s recantation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Concluding with this same theme, in his closing argument, the defendant made specific reference to statements in the hospital records,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to explain why she made the allegations against the defendant. The portions of the records that should have been redacted were the actual allegations made in the hospital that the defendant argued had been recanted by the victim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Without them, it would have been difficult for the jury to understand that the recantations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>referenced the same allegations of rape and incest as those at trial. Instead, he would have had to establish the recantation by relying solely on the testimony of the victim\u2019s mother and grandmother, both of whom the jury could have understood to be biased in favor of the defendant because they had pressured the victim into recanting and because the defendant was the sole means of support for the victim\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Second, I have no concern that the jury thought the improper notations were part of a hospital investigation or a report from the police because the judge specifically told the jury that these were comments made by the victim and no more, and specifically noted they were not the result of an investigation. This directive came in relation to the jury question inquiring as to who had authored the intake form, and the notation of the defendant\u2019s claimed admission. To this notation, the judge told the jury that this information came only from the victim, not from the defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, the victim had testified that the defendant admitted to what he was doing, and that he did not want to stop. The curative instruction effectively removed from the jury\u2019s consideration any understanding that the defendant had admitted his crimes to hospital personnel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>440 Mass. 741, 751 (2004) (\u201cwe presume the jury follow the judge\u2019s instructions\u2019\u2019). Relatedly, the jury were never instructed that they could use the hospital records as evidence to assist them in evaluating the victim\u2019s credibility, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number><em>King, supra </em>at 248, because it was not admitted as corroborative complaint evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Third, the defendant was charged with raping his own child. This is, to say the least, a startling allegation. The evidence at trial revealed the defendant to the jury as one who behaved more like a jealous boy friend than a father. His attempted excuses to the victim for his incestuous conduct, first that he was concerned about her sexual orientation and later that he was concerned that she was dating a man of another race, could only have made the evidence of his crime all that more compelling to the jury. As a result, I cannot conclude that the jury would have been further startled, impressed, or influenced, let alone \u201csubstantially swayed\u201d by the content of the barely legible notations in the hospital records, which even the majority agrees were not emphasized at trial. In fact, these notations were precisely the same allegations that formed the basis of the indictments in this case, which were read to the entire venire when the defendant was set at the bar to be tried, and again after the jury were seated and sworn. This is precisely the reason the judge provided when she denied the motion for a mistrial. It is also significant that hospital records did not include information outside the scope of these charges. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>448 Mass. at 136 (defendant prejudiced by unredacted hospital record that contained statements concerning the victim\u2019s sister, which implied that she, too, might have been abused by the defendant). Rather, the unredacted remarks in the hospital records were entirely cumulative of the indictments, and the very reason why the defendant was on trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Braley, </em>449 Mass. 316, 326 (2007) (the improper admission of cumulative evidence does not constitute prejudicial error).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Fourth, the judge\u2019s charge on the incest indictment was favorable to the defendant. Even though the defendant\u2019s incest was alleged to have occurred between October 22, 2001, and November 14, 2002, the judge instmcted the jury under the old incest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>statute, which restricted the crime to natural sexual intercourse with another in a prohibited line of consanguinity. However, that statute was only applicable to pre-May 1, 2002, allegations. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>431 Mass. 417, 422-424 (2000) (limiting incest to penile-vaginal penetration; other sexual activity excluded by incest statute). The current statute, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 17, as amended by St. 2002, c. 13, would have covered a great deal more of the defendant\u2019s acts<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that occurred between May 1, 2002, and November 14, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Finally, the jury did acquit the defendant of rape, which is some indication that the unredacted records had but a slight effect.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sosnowski, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 367, 372 (1997) (\u201cdifficult to find that the admission of the evidence caused prejudice\u201d where defendant was acquitted on two of three indictments). In fact, the many references to \u201crape\u201d in the records did not serve to corroborate the victim\u2019s credibility impermissibly, or at all because the jury acquitted the defendant of rape. The majority\u2019s view permits the defendant to use the first complaint rule as a shield when he did not achieve complete success. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, </em>453 Mass. 214, 228-229 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Based on these reasons, when viewed against the backdrop of the entire trial, which includes the improper admission of the unredacted hospital records, I am without grave doubt and can say with fair assurance that the jury were not substantially swayed by the error. To the extent there was any resulting effect on the jury occasioned by the hospital records, it was slight. See <em>Kotteakos </em>v. <em>United States, </em>328 U.S. at 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">b. <em>Shannon Crosby. </em>The defendant also claims that Shannon Crosby\u2019s testimony violated the first complaint rule. In light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kebreau, </em>454 Mass. 287 (2009), both decided after the trial in this case, I disagree.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Prior to trial, the Commonwealth moved in limine that it be permitted to elicit through Crosby, without detail, that a few weeks before the victim\u2019s suicide attempt, the victim told Crosby what had happened and that after the suicide attempt, Crosby went to the police. The purpose of this testimony would be to show that it was Crosby, and not the victim, who initiated the police investigation. The defendant objected and claimed that this was impermissible under the first complaint rule. The judge deferred ruling on the matter until Crosby testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">At trial, Crosby testified, over the defendant\u2019s objection, that she was worried about the victim, and that a few weeks before her suicide attempt, the victim told her that \u201csomething . . . was going on with her father.\u201d On the same day as the victim\u2019s suicide attempt, Crosby went to the police, not at anyone\u2019s direction, but because she was worried about the victim. Thus, as promised, this testimony showed that it was Crosby and not the victim who initiated the police investigation. There were also no details or specification as to what the \u201csomething\u201d was that was occurring between the victim and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, supra </em>at 224-225, the Commonwealth brought a motion in limine to permit a police officer and the victim\u2019s mother to describe the victim\u2019s demeanor at the police station on the day after the assaults. The Commonwealth maintained that this evidence demonstrated that the victim was reluctant and scared when she reported the assault, which was necessary to bolster the victim\u2019s credibility in the face of the defendant\u2019s accusation that her story was fabricated. The defendant objected to this evidence, and claimed that this was inadmissible additional complaint evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 224. The Supreme Judicial Court disagreed, and held that \u201cthe circumstances, and timing, of police involvement in the case was relevant and admissible, not as first complaint, but as an integral piece of the Commonwealth\u2019s response to the defendant\u2019s theory that the complainants and their parents were motivated to pursue these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>charges to support their lawsuit, and the police were complicit in this effort.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Here, as stated above, the defense was built around the assertion that the victim was angry and had manufactured her sexual abuse claims at the hospital in revenge for the defendant forbidding her to date Harris (which occurred the same day), and that she recanted this allegation at the hospital. Crosby\u2019s testimony that it was she, and not the victim, who went to the police was necessary to bolster the victim\u2019s credibility in the face of the defendant\u2019s accusation that her story was fabricated. In any event, given how vague Crosby\u2019s testimony was, there is no reason to conclude that the jury would have understood that the \u201csomething\u201d that occurred was additional complaint evidence any more than it was further evidence of the discord between the victim and the defendant due to the victim\u2019s relationship with Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Finally, even if Crosby\u2019s testimony could be construed as additional complaint evidence, it would have been admissible. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kebreau, supra </em>at 288-289, the court held that the first complaint doctrine \u201cpermits testimony from two first complaint witnesses in circumstances similar to those here, where each witness testifies to disclosures made years apart concerning different periods of time and escalating levels of abuse, which constitute different and more serious criminal acts committed over a lengthy period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">Here, Fuller testified to the victim\u2019s report of the defendant\u2019s assaults from when she was ten or twelve years old, and which continued until she was fourteen. During the two-year period that the victim dated Fuller, the defendant stopped his incest with the victim. At age sixteen or seventeen, the victim stopped dating Fuller, and the defendant reinitiated his abuse. Crosby\u2019s would-be complaint testimony related to the second period of abuse. Although there were escalating levels of abuse during the years in question, Crosby\u2019s testimony did not reveal any details to assess whether the assaults from the two periods differed. Nonetheless, the disclosures were made years apart, there was no evidence that there was any overlap in the reports, and there was no \u201cpiling on,\u201d the primary vice in sexual assault prosecutions that led to the creation of the first complaint rule. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 235, 245. At bottom, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>Crosby\u2019s testimony is viewed through an <em>Arana, supra, </em>or <em>Kebreau, supra, </em>lens, there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b895-9\"> A pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b899-6\"> When the defendant discussed the motion in limine with the judge, he argued that the victim\u2019s statements at the hospital, along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m very sorry for what I\u2019ve done.

Also contrary to the majority opinion, I do not suggest that \u201cthe defendant intended to use the allegations appearing in the hospital records to support his challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>to [the victim]\u2019s credibility based on recantation.\u201d See <em>ante </em>at note 9. Rather, as I note from the very beginning of this dissent, I agree with the majority\u2019s finding of error. Instead, my view is that the defendant was not prejudiced by the unredacted remarks in the records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b900-10\"> The majority\u2019s belief that the jury\u2019s question regarding the intake form indicates that the jury \u201cfocused\u201d their attention on this record entry is purely speculative. See <em>ante </em>at 851. We cannot fairly say the jury \u201cfocused\u201d on this topic, any more than we can say they were not focused on the three other questions they asked (on topics such as the victim\u2019s diary, the purpose of a medication, and the whereabouts of a police report), or on any question at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b900-11\"> Beyond mentioning the fact of the curative instruction, the majority opinion does not discuss (or deny) its mitigating effect. The majority opinion does correctly note that the judge told <em>counsel </em>that she would not instruct the jury that the defendant did not admit the allegations because the judge believed that was a jury question. Importantly, the majority opinion does not make it clear that the judge did not instruct <em>the jury </em>that whether the defendant admitted the allegations was an issue of fact for them to resolve.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b901-7\"> It is also my view that the unredacted records did not have any effect whatsoever on the inconceivable if not fatuous defense theory that the nearly emancipated seventeen year old victim would attempt suicide and falsely accuse her father of raping her because he did not approve of whom she wished to date. My view is further supported by the fact, as set forth in part 2. b., <em>infra, </em>that it was Shannon Crosby, not the victim, who brought the circumstances of this case to the attention of the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b902-8\"> In addition to punishing sexual intercourse with another within a prohibited line of consanguinity, the current version of G.
