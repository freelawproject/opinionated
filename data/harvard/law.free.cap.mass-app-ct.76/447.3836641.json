The decision held that the plaintiffs, Anawan Insurance Agency, Inc. (Anawan) and Stephen Michaels, one of its officers and directors, violated \u00a7 2 of G. L. c. 176D and \u00a7 177 of G. L. c. 175 by having paid compensation to one Kuntthy Prum at a time that Prum was not duly licensed as an insurance agent. The hearing officer ordered the plaintiffs to pay fines of $27,800 for 278 violations of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 2, that took place between November 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001, and $2,200 for twenty-two violations that occurred between August 1, 2000 and October 31, 2000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">The plaintiffs argue that the division\u2019s claims are barred by the statute of limitations, that the plaintiffs were not in violation of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, because the statute requires scienter and, that in any event, the fines should have been assessed under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, rather than under G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 7. We vacate the judgment, and order that a new judgment enter remanding the case to the commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">1. <em>Background. </em>The following facts found by the hearing officer and set forth in the exhibits are undisputed. On September 24, 1999, and again on October 1, 1999, the division received an anonymous letter stating that Anawan, as well as two other insurance agencies, had opened second locations contrary to a moratorium imposed by the Commonwealth. Anawan\u2019s second office was stated to be at 76 Shirley Avenue, Revere. An investigation by the division ensued, primarily by one Loney F. Bond. At some point Bond learned that Prum was doing business at 76 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Shirley Avenue and although he had been licensed as a Massachusetts insurance broker on May 27, 1994 for a three-year period, he had not renewed his license.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">On June 1, 2004, Bond wrote a letter to the plaintiffs stating that the division had received a complaint against Anawan \u201cregarding placement of insurance policies through various carriers\u201d and seeking, among other things, various documents relating to the appointment of past and present producers<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or brokers. The letter specifically asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">\u201cHave you ever employed Kuntthy Prum, if so state the dates of employment and provide the . . . information for this producer/broker? Determine the carrier(s) that he/ she placed business with type and number of policies written.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">On June 23, 2004, Michaels responded and notified the division of Anawan\u2019s prior insurance transactions with Prum, including a listing of all the commissions paid to him. Prior to the receipt of Michaels\u2019s June letter, the division did not know that Anawan had engaged in insurance business transactions with Prum.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">On October 25, 2004, after receiving Michaels\u2019s response, the division issued an order to show cause alleging that the plaintiffs had violated \u00a7 177 of G. L. c. 175 and \u00a7 2 of G. L. c. 176D. A hearing pursuant to c. 176D, \u00a7 6, was held at which numerous exhibits were filed, but only one witness, Bond, testified. Thereafter, the hearing officer issued compendious findings accompanied by orders which were affirmed by the commissioner and by a Superior Court judge after the plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking review pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Statute of limitations. </em>The plaintiffs argue that this case is governed by the two-year statute of limitations, G. L. 260, \u00a7 5, set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That statute, however, states that it does not apply to \u201cany action set forth in section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>5A.\u201d Section 5A, also set forth in relevant part in the margin,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> concerns actions arising on account of violations of laws \u201cintended for the protection of consumers.\u201d We agree with the hearing officer that G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, set forth in relevant part below,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> prohibiting payments to persons not duly licensed as brokers, is a statute intended to protect consumers, see <em>Deluty </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 88, 92 (1979), and that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A, is the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">While arguing that \u00a7 5A does not apply, the plaintiffs claim that even if it is the appropriate statute of limitations, the cause of action accrued when the division received the anonymous letters in 1999; the claim for fines is, therefore, barred as too late. The hearing officer found, however, that the division proved that it did not know of the transactions between Anawan and Prum until June 23, 2004 and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">\u201cthe earliest date upon which any argument <em>possibly </em>can be made that the Division \u2018should have known\u2019 of the improper insurance business transactions between Anawan and Prum was not until sometime long after October 25, 2000. Under either set of facts, the Division has proved that fines for the pre-November 2000 proved violations are not barred by the statute of limitations set out in \u00a7 5A.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>We do not agree with the decision of the hearing officer that the \u00a7 5A statute of limitations was tolled. The discovery rule does not apply; the pre-November 2000 violations are barred. See <em>Unexcelled Chem. Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>345 U.S. 59, 65 (1953) (\u201cbreach of duty, not its discovery, that normally is controlling\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In <em>3M Corp. </em>v. <em>Browner, </em>17 F.3d 1453, 1460 (D.C. Cir. 1994), the court rejected a claim by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that its claim for penalties \u201c \u2018first accrued\u2019 when it discovered 3M\u2019s violations, not beforehand when the company committed those violations.\u201d The applicable statute of limitations in that case was 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2462 which, in relevant part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by Act of Congress, an action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture, pecuniary or otherwise, shall not be entertained unless commenced within five years from the date when the claim first accrued . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-7\"><em>3M Corp. </em>v. <em>Browner, supra </em>at 1455.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">The court noted that the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d is based on the idea that plaintiffs cannot have a tenable claim for damages unless and until they have been harmed. For this reason damage claims involving hidden injuries or illnesses are not considered as accruing until the harm becomes apparent. The rule promoted by EPA, however, was different; it was a \u201cdiscovery of violation\u201d rule having nothing to do with latent injuries and to which the rationale of the discovery of injury mle had no application. <em>Id. </em>at 1460.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">We agree with the following reasoning of the court in <em>3M Corp. </em>v. <em>Browner, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">\u201cThe statute of limitations on which EPA would engraft its rule is aimed exclusively at restricting the time within which actions may be brought to recover fines, penalties and forfeitures. Fines, penalties and forfeitures, whether civil or criminal, may be considered a form of punishment. ... In an action for a civil penalty, the government\u2019s burden is to prove the violation; injuries or damages resulting from the violation are not part of the cause of action; the suit may be maintained regardless of damage. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Immediately upon the violation, EPA may institute the proceeding to have the penalty imposed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Here, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, as then in effect, see note 6, <em>supra, </em>provided that \u201c[wjhoever violates any provision of this section shall be punished by a fine of not less than twenty nor more than two hundred dollars.\u201d As in the statute imposing penalties in the <em>3M </em>case, liability under \u00a7 177 attached at the time of the violation, and hence \u201cone would expect this to be the time when the claim for the penalty . . . \u2018accrued.\u2019 \u201d <em>3M Corp. </em>v. <em>Browner, supra </em>at 1461. Also like the statute of limitations in the <em>3M </em>case, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A, is a general statute applicable in all civil penalty cases, and nothing in the language suggests that \u201cthe running of the limitations period tum[s] on the degree of difficulty an agency experiences in detecting violations.\u201d <em>3M Corp. </em>v. <em>Browner, supra. </em>We follow the rationale of that case<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and conclude that no fines may be imposed for the period prior to October 25, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">b. <em>Claim that violation must be made \u201cknowingly.\u201d </em>In 2002, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, was amended by St. 2002, c. 184, \u00a7 109, so that the last sentence thereof reads: \u201cWhoever knowingly violates any provision of this section shall be punished by a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $500.\u201d Thus, in addition to increasing the fine, the word \u201cknowingly\u201d was inserted by the Legislature. The plaintiffs claim the amendment was a clarification of the previous version of the statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Generally, and especially where the language of the applicable statute is clear and unambiguous, see <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>397 Mass. 416, 420 (1986), there is a presumption that a subsequent amendment indicates a legislative intention that the meaning of the statute changes. See <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Gloucester, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 158, 161 (1977); <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy. </em>v. <em>Falmouth, 74 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 444, 448 (2009). See also 1A Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 22.1, at 245-246 (7th ed. 2009). There is nothing here which rebuts that presumption \u2014 there is no legislative history, appellate decision concerning this statute, or other evidence that supports the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 claim. As indicated earlier, the requirement of a license is to protect the public. See <em>Deluty </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. at 90-91. Even in criminal statutes, scienter is not required for public welfare provisions. See discussion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 358, 363-365 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The addition of the word \u201cknowingly\u201d is not a clarification or a mere fine tuning of the earlier provision, but is a significant change that affects substantive rights. Compare <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Beacon Hill Architectural Commn., </em>421 Mass. 570, 581 (1996). It was thus proper for the division to apply the statute in effect at the time of the plaintiffs\u2019 actions and to follow the general rule that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">\u201call legislation commonly looks to the future, not to the past, and has no retroactive effect unless such effect manifestly is required by unequivocal terms. It is only statutes regulating practice, procedure and evidence, in short, those relating to remedies and not affecting substantive rights, that commonly are treated as operating retroactively, and as applying to pending actions or causes of action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-7\"><em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Norwell, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 393, 396 (1977), quoting from <em>Hanscom </em>v. <em>Malden &amp; Melrose Gas Light Co., </em>220 Mass. 1, 3 (1914). See 1A Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 22.36, at 406-414.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">c. <em>Damages. </em>The hearing officer found the plaintiffs to be in violation both of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, see note 6, <em>supra, </em>and G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 2, inserted by St. 1972, c. 543, \u00a7 1, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">\u201cNo person shall engage in this commonwealth in any trade practice which is defined in this chapter as, <em>or determined pursuant to section six of this chapter to be, an unfair method </em>of competition or an unfair or deceptive act or practice in the business of insurance\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">Both statutes provide penalties. As indicated earlier, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 177, as in force at the time of the plaintiffs\u2019 violations, provided that \u201c[wjhoever violates any provision of this section shall be punished by a fine of not less than twenty nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>more than two hundred dollars.\u201d Section 7 of G. L. c. 176D, inserted by St. 1972, c. 543, \u00a7 1, provides that the commissioner may issue certain orders, and in addition, \u201cwhoever commits such an act or practice shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars for each and every act or practice.\u201d Thus, the penalty under c. 176D, \u00a7 7, is far more onerous than the one under c. 175, \u00a7 177; not only is the amount of the fine much higher, but it can apply separately to each act, a matter not clear under c. 175, \u00a7 177. Although \u00a7 12 of c. 176D, inserted by St. 1972, c. 543, \u00a7 1, provides that the powers vested in the commissioner by the chapter \u201cshall be additional to any other powers to enforce any penalties, fines or forfeitures authorized by law with respect to the methods, acts, and practices hereby declared to be unfair or deceptive,\u201d we consider that the commissioner should have applied the penalties applicable to c. 175, \u00a7 177. The only violations of c. 176, \u00a7 2, found by the hearing officer were those of c. 175, \u00a7 177. Section 7 of c. 176D is a statute of general application to all unfair practices in the insurance industry. Section 177 of c. 175, on the other hand, applies specifically to transactions with unlicensed brokers (now termed \u201cproducers\u201d). \u201cIt is a self-contained statute, prescribing specific remedies for its violation.\u201d <em>Reiter Oldsmobile, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>378 Mass. 707, 711 (1979) (discussing G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2[a], and c. 93B, \u00a7 3[a]). Although c. 175, \u00a7 177, was originally enacted prior to c. 176D, \u00a7 7, it was amended in 2002, after c. 176D, \u00a7 7, and the Legislature still provided much lower penalties than in c. 176D, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">\u201cThe two statutes may overlap in their coverage, but in the case of a conflict, the provisions of the specific statute must govern. See <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>New England LNG Co., </em>364 Mass. 109, 118-119 (1973), and cases cited. To hold otherwise would be to overlook [the limitations in \u00a7 177.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-6\"><em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>John G. Grant &amp; Sons, </em>403 Mass. 151, 156 (1988) (where one penalty provision was no more specific than the other).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>We vacate the judgment, and order that a new judgment enter in the Superior Court remanding the matter to the commissioner to impose fines under G.
