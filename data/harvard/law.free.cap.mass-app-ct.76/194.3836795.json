On appeal, he argues that his rape conviction must be reversed because the trial judge prevented him from impeaching the victim with evidence that her prior convictions for prostitution provided a motive to fabricate the claim of rape.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>1. <em>Background. </em>The victim, Jane Doe, is a functionally illiterate client of the Department of Mental Retardation with an intelligence quota of 61 and an alcohol addiction. She drank up to a pint of vodka a day. At the time of trial in January, 2007, Doe was forty-five years old. A few days prior to trial, the defendant moved in limine to admit in evidence three of Doe\u2019s prior convictions for prostitution: (i) a 2001 case that was continued without a finding, (ii) a 1996 conviction wherein Doe received a ninety-day sentence that was stayed and eventually terminated, and (3) a 1989 conviction for which Doe served ninety days in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The judge denied the motion insofar as it sought to introduce the convictions pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, to impeach Doe\u2019s credibility, and the defendant does not challenge that ruling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to commencement of the trial, the defendant renewed his effort to introduce the convictions, this time arguing that he had a right to confrontation and that the convictions were admissible to demonstrate Doe\u2019s motive to fabricate the claim of rape. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Joyce, 382 Mass. 222, 231 n.8 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Houston, </em>430 Mass. 616, 617-618 (2000) (rape complainant\u2019s convictions involving sexual conduct admissible if relevant to motive to lie); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>443 Mass. 714, 715, 721 (2005) (rape complainant\u2019s convictions for sex-related conduct admissible where relevant to bias or motive to fabricate). The judge denied the motion. He concluded that the defendant\u2019s proffer appeared to be \u201cdecidedly different\u201d from the facts in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, supra, </em>and was insufficient to establish that Doe\u2019s convictions were relevant to a claimed motive to fabricate the accusation of rape in order to avoid prosecution for prostitution. The judge expressed a willingness to reconsider should the evidence prove otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The defendant renewed his request during the testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Dawn Moquin, one of four individuals who heard a woman\u2019s voice yelling, \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d as they stood outside their place of employment during a smoking break on the morning of June 8, 2005.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moquin testified that the first time she and the others heard the woman\u2019s voice, they weren\u2019t sure where it was coming from. When they again heard \u201cthe same exact thing, the same voice, the same, \u2018No, no, no,\u2019 \u201d Moquin walked toward a line of trees from which the voice appeared to come. As she approached, she yelled out and asked what was going on, and the same voice said, \u201cHe\u2019s raping me.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moquin told one of her companions to call 911, and continued to the line of trees where, across a fence, she saw a man and woman with their pants down around their ankles. The woman was on her stomach pushing up from the ground yelling, \u201cNo, no, no, get off me,\u201d and the man was on top of her. The man pulled up his pants, grabbed a nearby duffle bag, put something in it, threw something aside, and began walking away.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The judge considered whether, at that juncture, the evidence supported the defendant\u2019s request to introduce Doe\u2019s prior convictions as evidence of her motive to fabricate the claim of rape against the defendant because she feared prosecution for prostitution. The judge again measured the evidence in support of the request against the proof found to be sufficient in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, supra, </em>and again denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The next morning, the defendant testified. He recounted that he met the victim, whom he knew, at the bus terminal where he was picking up cans. She asked if he could give her some liquor. He gave her a small dollar bottle of vodka. He met up with her again a short time later, and she asked for beer. They went to the liquor store and he bought a forty-ounce beer for each of them. She followed him to a clearing behind some bushes where they both opened their beers. He then pulled out a pint of vodka. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>She asked him for a drink and he gave the pint to her; she drank some, but she didn\u2019t return it. He then asked her, \u201cCan we have sex,\u201d and she answered, \u201cYes, of course.\u201d She pulled her pants down and got down \u201con her back\u201d and they had \u201cface to face\u201d consensual sex. After they finished, she put her underwear and clothes back on. When he got up to leave, he asked her where his bottle of vodka was and she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He saw it in her pants and put his hand in her pants to take it out. At that point, she screamed, \u201cThat\u2019s not mine?\u201d and he said, \u201cNo.\u201d They were both sitting clothed on the ground when someone peeked through the trees. He asked Doe what happened and she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Somebody has called the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">After all the evidence concluded, including the defendant\u2019s testimony, the judge issued a written memorandum that memorialized his reasons for ruling that the defendant had not established a basis in the evidence for introducing the victim\u2019s prior prostitution convictions to demonstrate a motive to fabricate the claim of rape. The judge weighed the relevance and the probative value of the evidence pointing toward the victim\u2019s having fabricated her claim of rape to avoid prosecution against the potential misuse of the evidence that the victim had previously engaged in, and been convicted of, prostitution. The judge also compared the proof supporting the admission of such evidence in this case against the proof found sufficient in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, supra. </em>He concluded that the defendant\u2019s theory was \u201cconsiderably weaker\u201d than that advanced in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, supra, </em>and failed to support the defendant\u2019s attempt to impeach Doe by using her past prostitution convictions as evidence of motive to fabricate the claim of rape. The judge did not abuse his discretion or commit other error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201cThe rape-shield statute is principally designed to prevent defense counsel from eliciting evidence of the victim\u2019s promiscuity as part of a general credibility attack.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>412 Mass. 516, 523 (1992). See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 412 (2008-2009 ed.). \u201cThe statute precludes admission of evidence of a victim\u2019s \u2018reputation\u2019 with respect to \u2018sexual conduct,\u2019 as well as \u2018[ejvidence of specific instances of a victim\u2019s sexual conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>443 Mass. at 721, quoting from G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B. Two statutory exceptions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>that prohibition allow \u201cevidence of the victim\u2019s [past] sexual conduct with the defendant or evidence of recent conduct of the victim alleged to be the cause of any physical feature, characteristic, or condition of the victim.\u201d G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The defendant\u2019s request to admit evidence of Doe\u2019s prior convictions to demonstrate her motive to fabricate the claim against him does not arise under the statutory exceptions, but under a judicially recognized exception. We have previously recognized that in addition to the exceptions set forth in the rape-shield statute, a defendant may introduce evidence of the complaining witness\u2019s sexual conduct where that conduct is relevant to the complainant\u2019s bias or motive to lie. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. at 226-227 (interpreting rape-shield statute as permitting evidence of specific instances of complainant\u2019s sexual conduct when that evidence is relevant to show bias or motive to fabricate).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, even when evidence of the complainant\u2019s sexual conduct is relevant to show the complainant\u2019s bias or motive to fabricate, the judge should exercise discretion with respect to the introduction of such evidence, bearing in mind \u201cthe important policies underlying the rape-shield statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>443 Mass. at 721. The judge must determine whether the weight and relevance of the proffered evidence of bias or motive to lie is sufficient to outweigh its prejudicial effect to the victim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>427 Mass. 642, 647-648 (1998).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See also Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 403. This determination is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pearce, supra </em>at 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Here, the judge did not abuse his discretion at any juncture. The judge recognized that even if marginally relevant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>defendant\u2019s theory of fabrication, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clayton, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 198, 201 (2001), the weight and relevance of the evidence was not sufficient to outweigh its prejudicial effect to Doe and the danger that \u201cthe jury [might] misuse [that evidence] by minimizing what happened to a prostitute who was also ... a user of drugs and alcohol and the danger of subjecting [her] to \u2018needless humiliation.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>443 Mass. 714, 728 (2005).\u201d Neither the defendant\u2019s initial proffer, the subsequent testimony of Moquin, nor the testimony of the defendant himself provided evidence of Doe\u2019s bias or motive to lie that was sufficiently relevant or substantial to outweigh its prejudicial effect. Consequently, the defendant was not entitled to confront or cross-examine Doe regarding her prior prostitution convictions as providing a motive to fabricate her claim of rape. See generally Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 611(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The defendant\u2019s theory was not that the sex with Doe was solicited for payment, but that she freely engaged in consensual sex upon his request. Prior to asking Doe to engage in sex, the defendant bought Doe liquor and freely shared his own liquor with her. Doe\u2019s testimony and that of Moquin were consistent in recounting that the defendant and Doe were alone, shielded by bushes, and not readily visible when Doe first cried out, \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d and was overheard by Moquin and the others. Only after Doe repeated her cries did Moquin approach, peer through the bushes, and observe Doe lying on her stomach, pushing up from the ground, and yelling, \u201cno, no, no, get off me,\u201d as she was being assaulted by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Likewise, the defendant\u2019s own testimony belied the claim that Doe was fabricating a claim of rape to avoid prosecution. According to the defendant, he and Doe had completed consensual intercourse and were seated fully-clothed on the ground when they first began to argue over Doe\u2019s unwillingness to return the pint of vodka. Only at that time did Doe and the defendant become aware that someone was peeking though the bushes. Here, unlike in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. at 230, the proffered evidence had \u201cno rational tendency\u201d to prove that the intercourse was consensual or that Doe was motivated falsely to accuse the defendant of rape by a desire to avoid further prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-14\"> The defendant does not appeal his marijuana conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b237-7\"> The judge concluded that since the convictions were misdemeanors more than five years old, they did not satisfy the statutory predicate. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, first par. Accordingly, the judge did not need to exercise his discretion regarding use of the convictions for impeachment of credibility. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>443 Mass. 714, 715, 719-720 (2005) (in sexual assault case, judge has discretion to allow impeachment of complainant by prior convictions of sexual offenses pursuant to c. 233, \u00a7 21, but in exercising that discretion purposes of rape-shield statute should be considered). See also Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 609 (2008-2009 ed.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b238-7\"> Prior to Moquin\u2019s testimony, Doe testified to the details of the rape. In cross-examination, she acknowledged that she had previously used cocaine, but that at the time of the incident alcohol was her drug of choice, and that she drank a lot of vodka.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b238-8\"> The defendant does not challenge the judge\u2019s admission of this testimony as a first complaint or the limiting instruction given. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. 217, 218-219 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b238-9\"> Moquin continued to observe the man until he was arrested shortly thereafter by a New Bedford police officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b240-7\"> By interpreting the rape-shield statute to permit introduction of specific instances of the complainant\u2019s sexual conduct where relevant to bias or motive to fabricate, <em>Joyce </em>rendered unnecessary the determination whether the right to confrontation set forth in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights requires such inquiry. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. at 226 n.5</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b240-8\"> Even when a defendant invokes a constitutional right to confrontation, the right to confrontation is not absolute and may give way to other important interests. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>399 Mass. 385, 393 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 349, 352 (1998) (although defendant entitled to reasonable cross-examination of witnesses against him, scope of cross-examination rests largely in sound discretion of the trial judge).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
