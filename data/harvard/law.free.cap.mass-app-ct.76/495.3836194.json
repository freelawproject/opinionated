At trial, the plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the defendant was negligent and that, as a result, the plaintiff suffered injuries to her neck and back and was required to undergo neck surgery in October of 2002. The defendant disputed the plaintiff\u2019s claim of injury and that the neck surgery was causally related to the May 21 automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>On July 12, 2006, after the complaint had been filed, the plaintiff was examined by Dr. Gordon F. Lupien, an orthopedic surgeon, at the request of the defendant. After the examination, the doctor submitted a report to the defendant. The report favored the defendant\u2019s position, stating that \u201c[t]here is no indication that [the plaintiff] sustained any anatomical derangement or structural lesion of her musculoskeletal system as a consequence of the subject accident.\u201d At trial, the doctor did not testify and the defendant offered the report. The plaintiff objected to the introduction of the report, claiming that because it was prepared for the purpose of litigation, the report was not admissible pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79G. The judge overruled the objection. In answers to special questions, the jury found the defendant negligent; however, the jury also found that the defendant\u2019s negligence was not causally related to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79G, allows in evidence only those reports that carry a presumption of reliability, arising from the reports having been generated in the ordinary course of the work of a physician, but not a report made in the course of litigation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The statute at issue, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79G, as amended through St. 1988, c. 130, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">\u201cIn any proceeding commenced in any court, . . . reports, including hospital medical records, relating to medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>. . . [or] hospital services, ... or any report of any examination of said injured person, . . . shall be admissible as evidence of ... the diagnosis of said physician . . . , the prognosis of such physician . . . , the opinion of such physician . . . as to proximate cause of the condition so diagnosed, the opinion of such physician . . . as to disability or incapacity, if any, proximately resulting from the condition so diagnosed . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Prior to its 1988 amendment, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79G, authorized admission in evidence only of bills for medical services which were evidence of \u201cthe necessary, fair and reasonable charge for such services.\u201d G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79G, as amended through St. 1987, c. 540. Thus, \u201c[p]rior to its amendment in 1988, \u00a7 79G applied to proof of medical and hospital bills but not to reports, and constituted a straightforward statutory exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Ortiz </em>v. <em>Stein, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 643, 645 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The 1988 amendment considerably expanded \u00a7 79G both as to the records covered and the purposes for which such records may be admitted in evidence. See <em>Gompers </em>v. <em>Finnell, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 91, 93-94 (1993) (describing broadening of statute); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schutte, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 796, 798 (2001) (same). It allows in evidence \u201creports\u201d that are not limited to hospital records, including \u201cany report\u201d of \u201cany examination\u201d by a physician, contingent on the satisfaction of specific statutory prerequisites. See <em>id. </em>at 799-800 &amp; n.2. Further, the statute explicitly states that such reports are admissible \u201cas to proximate cause of the condition so diagnosed.\u201d Therefore, \u00a7 79G allows \u201cthe opinion of an examining physician as to the proximate cause of the injuries that he or she observed ... to be placed in evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Maersk Container Serv. Co., </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 254, 255 (2000). See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 803(6)(C)(ii), at 259-260, 273-275 (2010). It is not disputed that Lupien\u2019s report was made in preparation for trial. The plaintiff, nevertheless, argues that because Lupien\u2019s report was prepared for use in litigation, it lacks the indicia of reliability required for exception to the hearsay rule and admission under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Exceptions to the rule against hearsay have long been recognized only where \u201ccircumstantial guarantees of trustworthi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>ness\u201d justify departure from the general rule. 2 McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 253, at 166 (6th ed. 2006), quoting from 5 Wig-more, Evidence \u00a7 1422 (Chadbourn rev. ed. 1974). Hospital records are included as an exception to the rule, under an expansion of the business records exception, as \u201cthe safeguards of trustworthiness of records of the modem hospital are at least as substantial as the guarantees of reliability of records of business establishments generally.\u201d 2 McCormick, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 293, at 319-320. <em>See Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>376 Mass. 524, 527-528 (1978); Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 803(6)(B). Because these records are deemed at least as reliable as live testimony, they are admissible as exceptions to the rale against hearsay to avoid needless delay and inconvenience. See 2 McCormick, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 253, at 166; 5 Wigmore, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 1522, at 442-443. See also <em>Bouchie, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Reports prepared for use in litigation are considered to be without the circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness required for admissibility. This is because, \u201cwhere the only function that the report serves is to assist in litigation or its preparation, many of the normal checks upon the accuracy of business records are not operative.\u201d 2 McCormick, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 288, at 311 n.31. Put another way, if a report is prepared strictly for litigation purposes, a clear motivation exists that could incline the preparer toward misrepresentation, error, or overstatement. See generally 4 Mueller &amp; Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence \u00a7 8.83, at 754-755 (3d ed. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Here, notwithstanding those concerns, the admissibility of Dr. Lupien\u2019s report is dependent upon the language of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79G. Absent that statute, Dr. Lupien\u2019s report ordinarily would be excluded as hearsay. However, \u201c[t]he Legislature doubtless has the power to prescribe the rules of evidence and the methods of proof to be employed in trials in court .... It may change the rules of common law or those provided by existing statutes, and may make competent that which had been previously inadmissible.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradway, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 280, 284-285 (2004), quoting from <em>Meunier\u2019s Case, </em>319 Mass. 421, 425 (1946). See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 802, at 255-256. See also <em>McHoul, petitioner, </em>445 Mass. 143, 147 (2005). The Legislature therefore has the authority, within constitutional limits, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>make admissible documents prepared for use in litigation (such as Dr. Lupien\u2019s report) despite the traditional concerns about their reliability and trustworthiness. See generally Young, Pol-lets, &amp; Poreda, Evidence \u00a7 102.5 (2d ed. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Further, it is clear from the express language of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79G, that the Legislature exercised this authority when it amended the statute in 1988. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>446 Mass. 583, 590 (2006) (where statute is clear, it is interpreted as written). The statute explicitly states that \u201c[i]n any proceeding commenced in any court, . . . <em>any </em>report of <em>any </em>examination of said injured person . . . shall be admissible as evidence of . . . the opinion of such physician . . . as to proximate cause of the condition . . . diagnosed.\u201d The statute does not expressly disqualify a report because it was prepared for litigation. See <em>Schutte, 52 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 799 (noting statute does not disqualify report \u201cmerely because it was prepared in anticipation of litigation,\u201d where report was by offering party\u2019s treating physician). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>437 Mass. 286, 294 (2002) (court \u201cwill not add words to a statute that the Legislature did not put there\u201d). In addition, such a construction would be inconsistent with the statute as a whole, see <em>Kargman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>389 Mass. 784, 788 (1983) (\u201cstatutes should be interpreted as a whole to constitute a consistent and harmonious provision\u201d), as the reports admissible under the statute \u201cpertain to issues commonly involved in personal injury claims and litigation.\u201d <em>Schutte, supra </em>at 800 (noting reports admissible under statute may include opinion of physician as to proximate cause of condition diagnosed and disability or incapacity proximately resulting from condition diagnosed).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">For the above reasons, we hold that the judge did not commit error in admitting in evidence Dr. Lupien\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-8\"> The plaintiff makes no claim that the statute\u2019s provisions regarding notice, see <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Lewis/Boyle, Inc., </em>408 Mass. 269, 274 (1990) (party seeking to offer report at trial must satisfy statute\u2019s notice requirements), and attestation, see <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Maersk Container Serv. Co., </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 254, 256 (2000) (statute requires that physician\u2019s attestation accompany report when offered at trial), were not satisfied. In addition, although the plaintiff characterizes Lupien\u2019s examination as \u201csuperficial,\u201d she does not dispute that Lupien examined her. See <em>Ortiz </em>v. <em>Stein, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 643, 645-646 (1991) (statute does not apply to report of physician who did not examine or treat injured person).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s brief refers to Lupien as \u201ca <em>retired </em>orthopaedic surgeon\u201d emphasis supplied, and Lupien\u2019s report states he is \u201ca board certified orthopaedic surgeon licensed to practice in Massachusetts.\u201d The plaintiff does not argue that Lupien did not qualify as a physician under the statute. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79G (\u201cThe word[] \u2018physician\u2019 . . . <em>shall not include any person who is not licensed to practice </em>as such under the laws of the jurisdiction within which such services were rendered\u201d [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
