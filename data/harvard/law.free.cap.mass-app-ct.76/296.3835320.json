Greco, was convicted of distribution of a class E controlled substance, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32D(\u00ab), and distribution within a school zone, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, he claims that (1) the certificates of drug analysis were improperly admitted; (2) the judge improperly took judicial notice that Seroquel is the brand name for the generic drug quetiapine; (3) the jury instructions were flawed; (4) the judge should have given a humane practice instruction; and (5) the defendant was improperly sentenced as a subsequent offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\"><em>Background. </em>On September 13, 2006, at 2:56 p.m., in front of a Walgreens pharmacy, two Cambridge police detectives observed the defendant remove pills from a large prescription bottle and hand some of them to another individual, who then gave some money to the defendant. The detectives approached the two men and ordered the individual to whom the pills had been given to release his clenched fist. He refused, a physical struggle ensued, and the detectives recovered four yellow pills from his right hand. The defendant stated that \u201c[h]e gave me ten bucks for the pills.\u201d A search of the defendant revealed a ten-dollar bill and a one-dollar bill as well as two prescription pill bottles, one of which was labeled with the defendant\u2019s name and the drug name Seroquel<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; the bottle was admitted in evidence. It contained eighty-five pills which were also introduced into evidence. Detective Boyle testified that the pills were \u201cyellow tablets\u201d which \u201chave a stamp on them that says \u2018Seroquel 100.\u2019 \u201d These facts are uncontested.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">In describing the four pills that had been recovered from the individual\u2019s clenched fist, Detective Boyle testified that they \u201care four yellow tablets . . . [and] have the words Seroquel 100 mg stamped on them\u201d; they appeared to be identical to the pills in the bottle. At trial, one certificate of analysis was admitted to identify the pills from the bottle, and a second certificate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>pertained to the four pills. Both certificates stated that the pills were \u201cQUETIAPINE.\u201d The judge allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion in limine to take judicial notice, based upon the Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference, that the brand name Seroquel is the same as the generic drug quetiapine.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>The drug certificates. </em>The defendant argues that the drug certificates were erroneously admitted because their admission violated his rights under the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and also because they failed to satisfy statutory admissibility requirements. The introduction of the drug certificates was error. See <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, 129 S. </em>Ct. 2527 (2009). Although the Commonwealth questions whether the defendant adequately preserved his confrontation claim, we need not resolve the issue of the appropriate standard of review<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because we conclude that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendes, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 390, 397 (2009), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u201cThe essential question is whether the error had, or might have had, an effect on the jury and whether the error contributed to or might have contributed to the verdicts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bacigalupo, </em>455 Mass. 485, 495 (2009), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perrot, </em>407 Mass. 539, 549 (1990). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tyree, </em>455 Mass. 676, 700-704 (2010). Some of the factors to consider include: \u201c(1) the relationship between the evidence and the premise of the defense; (2) who introduced the issue at trial; (3) the weight or quantum of evidence of guilt; (4) the frequency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>of the reference; and (5) the availability or effect of curative instructions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isabelle, </em>444 Mass. 416, 419 (2005), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahdi, </em>388 Mass. 679, 696-697 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">We begin the analysis with the third and, for this case, the most important factor identified in <em>Isabelle </em>and Mahdi: the other evidence of guilt. \u201cProof that a substance is a particular drug need not be made by chemical analysis[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] and may be made by circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>399 Mass. 465, 467 (1987). In this case, there is overwhelming circumstantial evidence that the pills were quetiapine, a class E controlled substance. First, as discussed <em>infra, </em>the judge properly took judicial notice that the brand name Seroquel is the equivalent of the generic drug quetiapine. Second, most of the pills were discovered in a prescription bottle bearing the defendant\u2019s name and the name \u201cWalgreens\u201d; the detectives had observed the transaction in front of a Walgreens store. Third, the pills in the bottle and the four pills recovered from the other individual are identical; each pill is individually stamped with the word \u201cSeroquel,\u201d and each matches the pill bottle label, Seroquel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The defendant\u2019s statement to the detectives that the other individual \u201cgave [him] ten bucks for the pills\u201d is further evidence of guilt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 235, 242 (2009) (admitting to drug dealing is significant circumstantial evidence). All of these inculpatory factors weigh heavily in favor of a finding of harmless error. See <em>id. </em>at 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The first factor set forth in <em>Isabelle </em>is the consideration of the premise of the defense. The defendant did not contest the composition of the pills but instead focused almost exclusively on challenging the school zone violation. See <em>ibid, </em>(trial defense that the drugs were only for personal use \u201csupports a finding of harmless error\u201d). However, we do not give this factor much weight because, at the time of trial, Massachusetts law, specifically <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Verde, </em>444 Mass. 279, 283 (2005), provided that admission of the certificates without an opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>to cross-examine the examiner did not violate a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tyree, supra </em>at 704; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hollister, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 729, 732 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">We next consider the frequency of the references to the improperly admitted certificates, factor four in <em>Isabelle. </em>The Commonwealth offered them during its case-in-chief, and Detective Boyle read them into the record. However, neither party subsequently referred to them during the presentation of evidence, and the Commonwealth did not refer to them during closing. In his closing, defense counsel merely asked the jury to inspect them \u201cvery closely.\u201d Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ware, ante </em>53, 57-58 (2009) (prosecutor relied on certificate in closing argument). The jury instructions did not mention the certificates at all. We are confident that the sparse \u201creferences to different drug certificates are neutralized by the overwhelming evidence of . . . distribution [of a class E controlled substance] in this case.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, supra </em>at 244.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">In these circumstances,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it is fair to conclude that there is no \u201creasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>411 Mass. 249, 260 (1991).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">2. <em>Judicial notice. </em>The Commonwealth was required to prove that the pills labeled Seroquel had the same composition as the generic substance quetiapine, a class E controlled substance. Prior to trial, the Commonwealth filed a motion in limine asking the judge to take judicial notice of this fact based upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference (PDR). The judge allowed this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u201cMatters are judicially noticed only when they are indisputably true.\u201d <em>Nantucket </em>v. <em>Beinecke, </em>379 Mass. 345, 352 (1979). Matters of common knowledge may be judicially noticed. <em>Ibid. </em>Additionally, facts which are \u201ca subject of generalized knowledge readily ascertainable from authoritative sources [are] . . . appropriate for judicial notice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>408 Mass. 48, 50 n.2 (1990). In this case, the judge did not err in taking judicial notice of the single and indisputable fact that, based upon the PDR, Seroquel is the brand name for the generic drug quetiapine.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While this is not a matter of common knowledge, it is readily ascertainable from the PDR and is comparable to a judge taking judicial notice that codeine is a derivative of opium, which was approved in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">This case differs from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 164, 170 (2003), where a \u201cpill book\u201d purchased from a CVS pharmacy was not considered an appropriate subject for judicial notice because, unlike a pill book, the PDR is a recognized authority.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additionally, this is not a case where a judge improperly took judicial notice of the symptoms or effects of taking a drug. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hartman, </em>404 Mass. 306, 313 n.9 (1989) (judicial notice not appropriate for \u201c[t]he symptoms of insulin shock\u201d). Instead, the judge simply took judicial notice that Seroquel is the brand name for the generic drug quetiapine. This was an appropriate exercise of judicial notice.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">3. <em>Jury instructions. </em>The defendant claims the judge\u2019s instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>tions with respect to the distribution charge do not define the elements of knowingly and intentionally. Defense counsel did not object to the instructions and thus the error, if any, is reviewed under the familiar principles of the substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice standard. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Freeman, 352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967). Because the defendant\u2019s knowledge and intent were not live issues at trial, the omission did not create such a risk. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Van Winkle, </em>443 Mass. 230, 241 (2005); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 227, 234-235 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">4. <em>Humane practice instruction. </em>The defendant next claims that the judge should have granted his request for an instruction on the doctrine of humane practice.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In this case, where the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statement was not a live issue at trial,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the judge did not have a \u201cduty to ask the jury to pass on voluntariness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alicea, </em>376 Mass. 506, 523 (1978). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>425 Mass. 685, 691 (1997) (jury were not compelled to consider the issue of voluntariness because it \u201cwas not a live issue at trial; there was no evidence before the jury that could have supported the conclusion that the confessions were not voluntary\u201d). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">5. <em>Subsequent offender. </em>The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the judge erred in sentencing him as a subsequent offender without adhering to the two-step procedure mandated by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11 A. The total sentence imposed on the defendant was two years for the school zone offense and one day for the distribution offense on and after the school zone sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">We are hampered in our consideration of this claim by a docket and proceedings that do not match up. There is no ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>tion that the jury were instructed and entered a guilty verdict on the offense of distribution of a class E substance. The judge instructed on this offense, and there is appropriately no mention in his instructions of a subsequent offense. Similarly, the verdict of guilty was for the crime of distribution of a class E substance, without any reference to a subsequent offense. After the jury trial, there were no proceedings of any kind on the subsequent offense portion of the distribution count of the complaint. Nonetheless, the docket indicates that the defendant was found guilty of distribution of a class E substance as a subsequent offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The Commonwealth does not dispute that the defendant was entitled to a jury or jury-waived trial on the subsequent offender portion of the distribution count of the complaint. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11A. Instead, the Commonwealth contends that the defendant was sentenced under only the distribution portion of the count. There was an unrecorded sidebar conference immediately prior to sentencing, and the Commonwealth implies that the decision not to try or to sentence the defendant under the subsequent offender portion of the complaint was discussed at that conference. If that was indeed what happened, the docket, nonetheless, unfortunately indicates that the conviction for distribution was for a subsequent offense. As there were no proceedings of any type on any subsequent offense, it was error not to delete any reference to a subsequent offense from the record. Therefore, the portion of the judgment that states that the defendant was found guilty of a subsequent offense of distribution of a class E controlled substance must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Insofar as the judgment on count one reflects that the defendant is guilty of distribution of a class E substance as a subsequent offender, that portion of the judgment is vacated. The docket is to be corrected to reflect that the verdict of guilty was for distribution of a class E substance. Otherwise, the judgments, for distribution of a class E substance and for distribution within a school zone, are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-8\"> The defendant pleaded guilty to conspiracy; that conviction was placed on file with the defendant\u2019s consent and is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b339-9\"> The label, which bears the Walgreens\u2019s name and logo, contains the statements \u201cDAVID P GRECO\u201d and \u201cSEROQUEL 100 MG TABLETS.\u201d The side label states \u201cROUND YELLOW TABLET Side 1: SEROQUEL 100.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\"> Prior to trial, it appears that the defendant filed a memorandum of law arguing that the certificates did not comply with the admissibility requirements of G. L. c. 111, \u00a7\u00a7 12-13, and further, that their admission would violate the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights. While the record does not indicate that an accompanying motion was filed, argued, or ruled upon, it does appear that this memorandum was filed on March 7, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">During trial and over objection, the judge admitted the two drug certificates in evidence. Although the defendant objected to the admission of the certificates, the grounds of the objection are not disclosed in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Determining the proper standard of review in this case is further complicated because trial occurred in March, 2007, and the question whether the \u201cclairvoyance exception\u201d applies is currently under review. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>454 Mass. 808, 830-831 (2009) (leaving open the issue for future consideration); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 446, 462 (2009) (reporting the issue to the Supreme Judicial Court).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\"> The certificates did not state that any chemical analysis of the pills had been undertaken. See note 7, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b341-9\"> Not only did Detective Boyle testify to these observations, but the jury also had the opportunity to examine both sets of pills and the pill bottle, all of which were admitted in evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b342-8\"> As far as the second factor is concerned, it is true that the Commonwealth offered the certificates at trial. However, \u201cit did so in a legal landscape where that was permissible [and t]hus, we consider it . . . unrealistic and unfair to place much weight on [that] fact.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hollister, supra </em>at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Similarly, the last factor concerning the availability of curative instructions does not have much application in this case. At the time of trial, the admission of the certificates was not error, and defense counsel should not be expected to request, nor should the trial judge be expected to deliver, a \u201ccurative\u201d instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Madera, ante </em>154, 157 n.6 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b342-10\"> It is noteworthy that the certificates in this case merely identified the pills as quetiapine. The certificates indicated that the tablets had been identified \u201cby appearance and labeling.\u201d There is no mention of chemical analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b342-11\"> In light of our conclusion that the erroneous admission of the drug certificates was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we need not address the defendant\u2019s assertion that the certificates failed to meet the statutory admissibility requirements set forth in G. L. c. 111, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b343-8\"> See Mass. G.

Supp. 1297, 1300 (D. Or. 1985). See <em>Kollmorgen </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Med. Examrs., </em>416 N.W.2d 485, 488 (Minn. Ct. App. 1987) (the PDR \u201cis generally recognized as authoritative\u201d); <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Roche Labs., </em>671 N.E.2d 252, 256 n.1 (Ohio 1996) (\u201c[t]he PDR is considered an authoritative source for information\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b343-10\"> We do not suggest that the PDR may be judicially noticed for other purposes.

However, closing arguments are not evidence, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, 399 </em>Mass. 514, 517 (1987), and there was no evidence whatsoever that the defendant\u2019s statement was involuntary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
