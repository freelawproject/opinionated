L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23 (Act), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>comes to us on appeal after the remand in <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Canton </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>451 Mass. 158 (2008) <em>(Canton I). Canton I </em>determined that because the town of Canton (town) was below the ten percent minimum established by G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20, when the town\u2019s zoning board of appeals (board) filed its decision denying the comprehensive permit application at issue here, the Housing Appeals Committee (HAC) had authority to consider the appeal of the permit applicant, Canton Property Holding, LLC (CPH), notwithstanding the fact that, while the matter was on appeal at HAC, the board approved construction of additional affordable units that would increase the town\u2019s affordable housing stock to more than twelve percent. <em>Id. </em>at 160-161. In doing so, the court reversed the decision of the Superior Court, and deferred to HAC\u2019s choice of the relevant date for determining the percent of affordable housing units in the town. <em>Id. </em>at 161-162. See 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.04(l)(a) (2004). The case was remanded for consideration of the grounds on which the board had denied the c. 40B permit. On remand, another judge of the Superior Court reviewed HAC\u2019s finding that the impact of the proposed development on traffic \u201cdid not constitute a local safety concern outweighing the need for affordable housing.\u201d The judge ruled that the finding was supported by substantial evidence, and upheld HAC\u2019s decision vacating the board\u2019s denial of the permit and ordering that the permit issue. The board appeals, arguing that (1) requiring the town to allocate 12.6 percent of its housing stock to affordable housing, as compared to the ten percent minimum required by G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20, is an \u201cunreasonable overage\u201d; and (2) the decision that traffic impacts did not warrant denial of the permit was not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">We discuss the facts of the case and the statutory and regulatory context as pertinent to this appeal. For further background, see <em>Taylor v. Housing Appeals Comm., </em>451 Mass. 149 (2008); <em>Canton I, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>\u201cUnreasonable overage.\u201d </em>The permit application at issue is for construction of 227 units of housing on Randolph Street in the town (Canton Project), most of which would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>be rental units. All of the proposed units would qualify for inclusion in the town\u2019s inventory of low and moderate income housing. At the time of the board\u2019s decision denying the permit, the percentage of low or moderate income housing in the town was 7.87 percent. Subsequently, while CPH\u2019s appeal from the board\u2019s permit denial was pending at HAC, the board entered into a settlement with another developer, agreeing to issue comprehensive permits for 180 units of low and moderate income housing (the Pequit projects). This agreement increased the number of low and moderate income housing units in the town to approximately 12.6 percent of all units. HAC found that \u201c12 percent is not unreasonable,\u201d observing that \u201cat least under the facts presented here, assuming that 180 Pequit units would be included in the housing inventory, that number would include both market rate and affordable units in the project.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Arguing that 12.6 percent is an \u201cunreasonable overage\u201d as compared with the ten percent minimum set forth in G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20, the board characterizes HAC\u2019s finding as unreasonable on its face, and an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The board\u2019s \u201cunreasonable overage\u201d argument is not supported by the Act or by case authority. Attainment of the ten percent minimum at the time prescribed by the regulations will deprive HAC of jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a local board\u2019s denial of a comprehensive permit application. See <em>Canton I, supra </em>at 159 n.2, 161. However, attainment of the ten percent will not necessarily demonstrate that a locality\u2019s need for affordable housing has been satisfied. See <em>Boothroyd </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Amherst, </em>449 Mass. 333, 341 (2007) (\u201cA municipality\u2019s attainment of its minimum affordable housing obligations in many cases does not eliminate the need for affordable housing within its borders\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Where, as here, the town has taken no actions that would deprive HAC of authority to hear an appeal, the regulatory scheme governing HAC review of comprehensive permit denials is as follows. The board bears the burden of proving, first, that there is a valid local concern which supports the permit denial, and, second, that such concern outweighs the regional housing need. 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.06(6). Where, as here, the town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>has not achieved the ten percent minimum by the prescribed date, see 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.04(l)(a), there shall be a rebut-table presumption that there is a \u201csubstantial regional housing need which outweighs local concerns.\u201d 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.07(e), citing <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 367 (1973) <em>(Hanover). </em>Where the town attempts to rebut the presumption, 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.07(2) prescribes the factors to be considered in balancing the housing need (that is, the proportion of low income residents in the town or region) against the local concerns.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather than setting forth evidence concerning the low income population in the region, the board, both in its argument to HAC and to this court, continues to conflate attainment of the ten percent minimum with satisfaction of the need for affordable housing. As HAC noted in its decision, the board\u2019s argument \u201cis misplaced. How close the town is to the 10 percent minimum is not the issue.\u201d See <em>Boothroyd, </em>449 Mass. at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Nor is <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Greenfield </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 553 (1983) (Greenfield), cited by the board, to the contrary. <em>Greenfield </em>held that \u201cG. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20, authorizes HAC to issue a permit for a project where the completion of the contemplated units will cause the ten percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>requirement to be exceeded by a reasonable number.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562. In response to the town\u2019s argument in <em>Greenfield </em>that such a policy \u201cwould allow HAC to compel a municipality which is but a few units short of meeting its minimum housing obligation to issue a permit for development of hundreds of units,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 562 n.13, the court observed that towns below the ten percent minimum are not compelled to issue comprehensive permits in every case. Rather, the court noted, citing G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20, \u201cIn such case[s] the statute imposes a general test of reasonableness predicated on the regional need for low and moderate income housing; the number of low income people in the affected municipality; health and safety considerations; and the promotion of compatible site and building design and preservation of open spaces.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.07 (note 4, <em>supra). </em>The court further observed, \u201cWe think the statute provides an adequate decisional framework for dealing with the problem of proposed developments which could cause a community to overshoot substantially the ten percent benchmark for low and moderate income housing.\u201d <em>Greenfield, supra. </em>Thus, the <em>Greenfield </em>court found adequate the decisional framework we have described above,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which, for proposals in the posture of the present matter, places the burden on the board to overcome a rebuttable presumption that the local or regional housing need outweighs the local concerns underlying the denial of a comprehensive permit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We turn then to the projected traffic impact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>of the project, which was the board\u2019s substantive reason for denying the comprehensive permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">2. <em>Substantial evidence. </em>The board argues that HAC\u2019s ruling should be overturned because its determinations as to the projected traffic impacts of the Canton Project were not supported by substantial evidence. The board points to expert testimony which it claims shows that a decrease in the level of service at the intersection of Route 138 and Randolph Street, some two miles west of the entrance to the Canton Project, would result in a greater accident rate and have an impact on safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">HAC found that the evidence submitted by the board regarding increases in traffic delay as a result of the proposed project showed \u201cthat the Board has focused more on the issue of convenience,\u201d and concluded that \u201c [convenience is not a local safety issue or other local concern that outweighs the need for affordable housing.\u201d Thus, HAC concluded that the board failed to meet its burden to show that the traffic congestion caused by the proposed development would pose a sufficiently high safety concern to outweigh the regional need for affordable housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Because we are examining conclusions of law upon the same record as the Superior Court judge, our review of the judge\u2019s decision proceeds de novo. Compare <em>Professional Fire Fighters of Mass. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 66, 73 (2008). The scope of judicial review of a HAC decision is determined by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. See G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22. See also <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>385 Mass. 651, 657 (1982). In reviewing HAC\u2019s decision, we \u201cmust examine the committee\u2019s decisions upon consideration of the entire record\u201d and determine whether there was \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d that is, \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support\u201d HAC\u2019s decision. <em>Hanover, </em>363 Mass. at 376 (internal quotations omitted). The board, as the appealing party, has the \u201cheavy\u201d burden of showing that the agency decision of the HAC is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>DSCI Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecomm. &amp; Energy, </em>449 Mass. 597, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>603 (2007). We are required to \u201cgive due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it\u201d by statute. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). The reviewing court \u201cmay not displace an administrative [agency\u2019s] choice between two fairly conflicting views, even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.\u201d <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley, supra. </em>Moreover, where, as here, a decision rests in part on an agency\u2019s assessment of witnesses, we give \u201cparticular deference to credibility determinations and inferences drawn from the facts.\u201d <em>Collamore </em>v. <em>Office of Campaign &amp; Political Fin., </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 315, 322 (2006). See <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>405 Mass. 103, 111, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 977 (1989). In reviewing HAC\u2019s decision to vacate a permit denial, we must apply the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard in light of the heavy burden borne by a local board that denies a comprehensive permit application; that burden requires proof of a specific health or safety concern of sufficient gravity to outweigh the regional housing need. <em>Hanover, </em>363 Mass. at 367, 376. An agency decision will be upheld \u201cunless it is based on an error of law, unsupported by substantial evidence, unwarranted by facts found on the record as submitted, arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d <em>DSCI Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecomm. &amp; Energy, </em>449 Mass. at 603, quoting from <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Tech. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>425 Mass. 856, 867-868 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">After a four-day hearing in which it heard witnesses and considered exhibits, HAC found that the board\u2019s evidence of traffic congestion proved merely an inconvenience. Relying on its own precedents, HAC concluded that \u201cin traffic cases, questions of inconvenience are not enough; there must be significant public safety concerns,\u201d and thus found the board\u2019s traffic concerns insufficient to outweigh the regional need for affordable housing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.07(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>HAC could permissibly find that the evidence regarding increased traffic and longer traffic queues at the intersection constituted evidence of inconvenience, but not of any significant safety concern. It was permissible for HAC to take into account the distance of the intersection from the development (two miles) and how the intersection will be affected by traffic from other areas of town and those traveling through town. HAC expressed serious doubts as to the credibility of the board\u2019s expert\u2019s projections and remarked generally that the reality of the traffic at the intersection resulting from the project cannot be predicted with any certainty. HAC was entitled to discount so much of the board\u2019s evidence of safety concerns as relied primarily on these projections. Moreover, based on its expertise in deciding similar cases, HAC was entitled to find that even if there is increased congestion, that condition here would not rise to the level of a significant local safety concern.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment of the Superior Court upholding the HAC decision granting CPH a comprehensive permit is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b510-7\"> On remand, the board no longer pursued its earlier argument that the permit should be denied because of storm water concerns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\"> According to the town\u2019s \u201cHousing Action Plan\u201d in the record appendix, sixty-one of the 180 Pequit units would be dedicated to the c. 40B program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b512-6\"> Title 760 Code Mass.

In cases where the ten percent minimum discussed in <em>Canton I </em>has not been satisfied, the HAC regulations provide additional means for assessing the concentration of affordable housing in a municipality. For example, as to the total land area occupied by affordable housing, see G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20; 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.04(2), (3). As to the total number of affordable housing units, see, e.g., 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.07(l)(d) (irrebuttable presumption that denial of application is consistent with local needs if, during the twelve months prior to the date of the comprehensive permit application, town has added affordable units equal to or greater than two percent of town\u2019s total housing units). See also, e.g., 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.07(l)(g)(l) (in municipality with 7,500 or more total housing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>units, where comprehensive permit is sought for construction of more than 300 units, or units equaling two percent of all housing units in the town, whichever is greater, decision denying permit application shall be deemed consistent with local needs).
