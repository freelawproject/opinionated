L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(2)(a), of leaving the scene of an accident after causing property damage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At trial, in opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty, the Commonwealth proceeded successfully on the theory that a conviction under that statute does not require proof that the accident in question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>caused property damage. On appeal, the Commonwealth presses the same claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree, and reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\"><em>Facts. </em>Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), the jury could have found the following facts. On September 11, 2006, Patrick Duggan was driving his car on Park Avenue West in Weymouth when he saw that a vehicle in front of him had crashed into a telephone pole. Duggan saw a man (whom he later identified as the defendant) walking away from the crashed vehicle. The defendant admitted that he had been operating the vehicle at the time of the accident. Duggan noticed that the defendant\u2019s vehicle came to rest in contact with a telephone pole and was halfway over the sidewalk. He also noticed that the vehicle\u2019s hood was dented in about three or four inches. The defendant advised Duggan that he was in pain and wanted to go home. Duggan advised the defendant to remain at the scene or be transported to a hospital. However, the defendant refused to stay at the scene, and asked Duggan to drive him to the defendant\u2019s apartment. Duggan complied with the defendant\u2019s request, leaving the vehicle unattended and on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Duggan helped the defendant into his apartment and met the defendant\u2019s wife. The defendant\u2019s wife asked Duggan to drive a female relative of the defendant back to the accident scene, and Duggan did so. When Duggan and the woman arrived back at the accident scene, emergency vehicles from the Weymouth police and fire departments were there. Weymouth police Officer Scott Ficarra drove the woman back to the defendant\u2019s apartment and there encountered the defendant, who again admitted that he was operating the vehicle when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cTo support a conviction on the charge of knowingly leaving the scene of an accident involving property damage, the Commonwealth must present legally sufficient evidence for a reasonable fact finder to conclude the defendant operated the motor vehicle at the time of the accident resulting in property damage.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Platt, 440 Mass. 396, 401 (2003). More precisely, \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) the defendant operated a motor vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>(2) on a public way (3) and collided with or caused injury in some other way to another vehicle or to property; (4) the defendant knew that he had collided with or caused injury in some other way to that other vehicle or property; and (5) after such collision or injury, the defendant did not stop and make known his name, address, and the registration number of his motor vehicle. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(2)(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The Commonwealth points to the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d appearing in the third element recited above, arguing that it need only prove that a collision occurred and that if a collision occurred, there need be no proof that the collision caused any damage to another vehicle or property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>The argument is at odds with both the language and the purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">\u201cBefore the enactment of the statute in substantially[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] its present form by St. 1916, c. 290, there was no specific reference to collision cases. St. 1913, c.-123, provided a penalty for an operator of an automobile \u2018who knowingly goes away without stopping and making himself known after causing injury to any person or property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McMenimon, </em>295 Mass. 467, 469 (1936). \u201cApparently one purpose of the change in the statute was to enlarge its scope so as to include the case of a collision even if the operator did not know that injury to any person or property was caused thereby.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McMenimon, </em>the court rejected the argument that the statute requires proof that the defendant who knew that his automobile had collided with the person or property of another also knew that the collision had caused injury. \u201cNaturally interpreted ... the provisions in regard to \u2018knowingly colliding with\u2019 and \u2018[knowingly] causing injury to,\u2019 being stated disjunctively, describe alternative grounds for a conviction and not two elements of a crime both of which must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>proved to support a conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469. Rejecting the possibility that the alternatives might instead be \u201cknowingly \u2018causing injury\u2019 by \u2018colliding\u2019 and knowingly \u2018causing injury\u2019 \u2018otherwise,\u2019 \u201d the court explained that \u201cif this meaning had been intended it would have been unnecessary to refer specifically to injury caused by collision as distinguished from injury caused otherwise.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Under McMenimon, it is unnecessary in a case involving collision to'prove that the defendant knew that the collision caused injury, so long as there is proof that the defendant knew of the collision. That is not to say, however, that it is unnecessary to establish that injury occurred (whether known or unknown to the defendant); it is plain from the quoted language that the court understood the statute to refer specifically to injury caused by collision, and not collision that did not cause any injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Moreover, we note that the Commonwealth\u2019s proffered construction would render the word \u201cotherwise\u201d superfluous, contrary to a fundamental principle of statutory construction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millican, </em>449 Mass. 298, 300 (2007) (\u201cNone of the words of a statute is to be regarded as superfluous\u201d), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard and Nantucket S.S. Authy., </em>352 Mass. 617, 618 (1967). By its position in the sentence, the word \u201cotherwise\u201d is designed to delineate two classes of injuries: those caused by collision, and those caused \u201cotherwise.\u201d If the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d were designed to separate entirely the terms \u201ccolliding with\u201d and \u201ccausing injury,\u201d the word \u201cotherwise\u201d would be unnecessary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Finally, we note that the broader purpose of the statute was the subject of commentary on the earlier version of it, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horsfall, </em>213 Mass. 232, 236-237 (1913): \u201cIts obvious purpose is to enable those in any way injured by the operation of an automobile upon a public way to obtain forthwith accurate information as to the person in charge of the automobile. It should be interpreted in such way as to effectuate this end. . . . While the statute does not state in terms to whom this information shall be given, its plain implication is that it must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>be furnished to those whose person or property has been injured, if reasonably possible, and if not to some one in their interest or to some public officer or other person at or near the place and time of injury.\u201d The objective of the statute to furnish needed information to persons whose property is damaged by an automobile is not implicated in circumstances where no damage occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">It is of course conceivable that in some cases, the nature of the collision might alone suffice to support a rational inference that damage inevitably resulted, as perhaps where the object struck by the vehicle is relatively fragile or malleable in comparison to the vehicle, or where the evidence of the collision itself reveals that it occurred at a high rate of speed. But some objects are relatively impervious to damage from low speed vehicular impact (a granite rock face comes to mind), and we need not speculate on inferences that may be supported in cases other than the one before us. In any event, we believe it imposes very little burden on the Commonwealth in most cases to present evidence that a collision has caused damage to property of another. In the present case, the Commonwealth has conceded that there was no proof of damage to the telephone pole struck by the defendant\u2019s car, or to any other property of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">In sum, based on the language of the statute, its purpose, and its construction in <em>McMenimon, </em>we reach the unremarkable conclusion that, to support a conviction for leaving the scene of an accident causing property damage, the Commonwealth must prove that the accident caused property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-14\"> The defendant was also convicted of negligent operation of a motor vehicle under G.
