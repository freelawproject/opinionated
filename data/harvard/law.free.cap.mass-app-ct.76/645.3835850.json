We address the defendant\u2019s numerous claims seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the facts as found by the motion judge, supplemented by uncontested testimony from the suppression hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While on patrol, Officers Ranee Cooley and James Tarentino of the Boston police department observed the defendant behind the wheel of a stationary vehicle obstructing traffic on Harvard Street. Officer Cooley activated his cruiser lights and pulled behind the stopped vehicle. As he was speaking with the defendant, Officer Cooley noticed a \u201creally strong smell of unbumt marijuana\u201d emanating from the open driver\u2019s side window. Officer Cooley recognized the smell from his Drug Enforcement Administration task force training as well as numerous marijuana-related arrests and seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Officer Cooley issued an exit order to the defendant. As the defendant emerged from the vehicle, Officer Cooley observed the comer of a plastic sandwich bag protruding from the defendant\u2019s waistband. He immediately pat frisked the defendant, recovering the bag which appeared to contain marijuana. Officer Cooley placed the defendant under arrest and, with Officer Tarentino\u2019s assistance, conducted a search of the defendant\u2019s vehicle. The search revealed two additional bags of marijuana located in a gym bag within the trunk of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\"><em>Discussion. Motion to suppress. </em>\u201cWhen reviewing the denial of a suppression motion, \u2018we accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error, but conduct an independent review of the judge\u2019s ultimate findings and conclusions of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gomes, </em>453 Mass. 506, 508-509 (2009), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>449 Mass. 476, 480 (2007). \u201c[Ojur duty is to make an independent determination of the correctness of the judge\u2019s application of constitutional principles to the facts as found.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>422 Mass. 367, 369 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Having observed the defendant commit a traffic violation, Officer Cooley possessed sufficient justification for a motor vehicle stop. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, </em>420 Mass. 205, 207 (1995). As stated, subsequent to the lawful stop, Officer Cooley detected an odor of unbumt marijuana emanating from the vehicle, which supplied probable cause to believe there were drugs in the car. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garden, </em>451 Mass. 43, 47-48 (2008) (officer\u2019s detection of odor of burnt marijuana emerging from a motor vehicle provided probable cause to search the vehicle).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">At that point, Officer Cooley\u2019s exit order and patfrisk of the defendant\u2019s person were justified as a search incident to a lawful arrest. \u201c[Pjrobable cause exists where, at the moment of arrest, the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>police are enough to warrant a prudent person in believing that the individual arrested has committed or was committing an offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>420 Mass. 542, 550 (1995), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santaliz, </em>413 Mass. 238, 241 (1992), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Storey, </em>378 Mass. 312, 321 (1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 955 (1980). The patfrisk revealed marijuana on the defendant\u2019s person, justifying in turn a comprehensive search of the vehicle, including the trunk, pursuant to the automobile exception to the warrant requirement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Motta, </em>424 Mass. 117, 123-124 (1997). Thus, the marijuana discovered in the defendant\u2019s trunk was lawfully seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\"><em>Officer Cooley\u2019s testimony. </em>We next consider the defendant\u2019s claim that his convictions must be vacated where inconsistencies between Officer Cooley\u2019s testimony at trial and at the suppression hearing lead to the inescapable conclusion that the jury relied on perjured testimony. Because the defendant raises this argument for the first time on appeal, we review for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Perjury is a serious charge, and alleged peijury by a police officer implicates an essential facet of our criminal justice system. The defendant points to two reported decisions that implicated Officer Cooley in charges of perjury which, the defendant alleges, in conjunction with the inconsistencies in Officer Cooley\u2019s trial testimony here, placed a duty on the prosecutor to disavow his testimony. See Mass.R.Prof.C. 3.4(b), 426 Mass. 1389 (1998) (\u201cA lawyer shall not . . . counsel or assist a witness to testify falsely\u201d); Mass.R.Prof.C. 3.8(a), as amended, 428 Mass. 1305 (1999) (\u201cThe prosecutor in a criminal case shall refrain from prosecuting a charge that the prosecutor knows is not supported by probable cause\u201d). The defendant\u2019s examples placed no such duty on the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>609 F. Supp. 2d 113, 122 (D. Mass. 2009), a Federal district judge explicitly found, more than two years after the trial in this case, that Cooley had committed perjury at a suppression hearing. While we recognize that the Commonwealth\u2019s duty to present honest testimony properly supporting charges is paramount, we do not impose a duty on prosecutors based upon events that have not yet transpired. More directly pertinent is <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garden, </em>451 Mass. at 43. While the <em>Garden </em>decision was published well after the trial in this case,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the hearing on the motion to suppress in <em>Garden, </em>at which part of Cooley\u2019s testimony was not credited, was held eight months before he took the stand in this case. However, the motion judge\u2019s decision in <em>Garden </em>contains but a single reference to the fact that he did not credit all of Cooley\u2019s testimony<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; relevant especially to this case is the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s recognition that \u201cno such disclaimer appears to modify the finding concerning Officer Cooley\u2019s detection of the odor of marijuana.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49. While we are unpersuaded by the defendant\u2019s claim that these two cases placed a special duty on the prosecutor, we take seriously the charge that blatant inconsistencies are an indication of perjury and misconduct here, warranting reversal. We turn therefore to the evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s vigorous protestations, a thorough review of the record leads us to conclude that the inconsistencies are not substantial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The thrust of Officer Cooley\u2019s testimony \u2014 regarding the motor vehicle stop, the smell of marijuana, and his subsequent discovery of narcotics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>\u2014 was consistent. Moreover, the defendant could have cross-examined the witness on the basis of his allegedly inconsistent testimony, especially since a number of the inconsistencies were contained within the trial testimony itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The defendant\u2019s contentions regarding the Commonwealth\u2019s ethical obligations based on the testimony at the motion hearing and trial are likewise unavailing. A witness\u2019s alteration of testimony between the suppression hearing and the trial \u201cdoes not by itself establish that the Commonwealth knew, or reasonably should have known,\u201d that the testimony was false. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hap Lay, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 27, 31-32 (2005). Viewed from a realistic or practical perspective no less than a legal one, the testimony in question does not relate to material evidence and does not suggest perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\"><em>Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. </em>The defendant next takes issue with the trial judge\u2019s refusal to reconsider the denial of trial counsel\u2019s motion, made on the trial date, to withdraw, which he contends was an abuse of discretion. A trial judge has broad discretionary power over requests for last-minute shifts in representation which threaten to delay proceedings. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>424 Mass. 338, 341 (1997). Furthermore, judges are permitted to reconsider rulings on pretrial motions only upon a showing that substantial justice requires a rehearing. See Mass. R.Crim.P. 13(a)(5), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1516 (2004). Here, the defendant\u2019s motion was previously denied on two occasions by two different judges. There was no indication that the defendant\u2019s current counsel was unwilling or unable to effectively represent his interests.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>442 Mass. 826, 840 (2004) (no abuse of discretion in denying motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>to substitute counsel two weeks prior to trial where current counsel was willing to present the defendant\u2019s trial strategy). In light of these considerations, we conclude that the trial judge acted within his discretion in refusing to reconsider the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\"><em>Second and subsequent offense. A </em>requisite element of conviction under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 <em>32C(b), </em>is proof beyond a reasonable doubt of one or more prior convictions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Savageau, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 518, 520 (1997). At the defendant\u2019s second trial the Commonwealth called Officer Adam Mazzole, who testified to arresting the defendant for possession with intent to distribute on August 2, 1997, and through whom a certified criminal docket was presented.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Though the docket is unclear as to the exact date of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction, we conclude that the Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence from which the jury could find that the defendant had previously been convicted of violating drug laws. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olivo, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 368, 370-372 (2003) (testimony of officer who participated in the defendant\u2019s prior arrest and certified conviction was sufficient to show second and subsequent drug offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\"><em>Right to confrontation: </em>Melendez-Diaz <em>issue. </em>This case was tried, appealed, and briefed before the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari in the case of <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>129 S. Ct. 2527 (2009). In his reply brief, however, the defendant raised the confrontation issue for the first time, asserting that the drug certificates introduced by the Commonwealth violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution in the absence of the analyst who performed the tests evidenced by the certificates. There is no question that such a violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">In the absence of any objection below, we normally apply the substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice test to the objectionable evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, 67 </em>Mass. App. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>636, 641 (2006), <em>S.C., </em>450 Mass. 302 (2007). The defendant maintains that he is entitled to the more stringent standard of review despite his lack of objection because, notwithstanding the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36 (2004), <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Verde, </em>444 Mass. 279 (2005), was still the law of the Commonwealth at the time of trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because we conclude that the error was harmless under either standard, we affirm the convictions on this basis as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The defendant not only admitted that the substance in question was marijuana, he testified at length on the subject, asserting the distinction between different grades of \u201cweed,\u201d explaining why he also had smoking implements and baggies on his person, and detailing his experience and long history of marijuana use.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cProof that a substance is a particular drug need not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>made by chemical analysis and may be made by circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>399 Mass. 465, 467 (1987) (citations omitted). The judge was entitled to infer that the defendant was fully able to identify genuine marijuana when he purchased the drugs in question on the same day he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>arrested, and fully competent to testify on the subject. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cantres, </em>405 Mass. 238, 245-246 (1989) (\u201c[T]he judge\u2019s allowance of the testimony implies a prior determination by him that the witness\u2019s experience qualified him to characterize the subject of those transactions as [drugs]\u201d). Additionally, the arresting officer recounted that he had received Drug Enforcement Administration task force training and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms drug recognition training; he testified further that he also recognized the odor of marijuana when he approached the defendant based on his own experience, including hundreds of marijuana arrests. Again, the judge could implicitly accept his testimony as based on expertise gained through training and experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">On this record, and with reference to the factors enumerated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>453 Mass. 266, 274 (2009), we conclude that the introduction of the certificates was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The premise of the defense was that the defendant was a consumer, not a distributor. The weight of unobjectionable evidence supporting the Commonwealth\u2019s case was overwhelming. The certificates were not mentioned other than when they were introduced and once in the prosecutor\u2019s closing. <em>Ibid. </em>Here, under the test clearly enunciated in <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967), there is no \u201creasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b688-11\"> The defendant was convicted of (1) possession with intent to distribute marijuana (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C[a]), (2) as a second and subsequent offense (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 <em>32C[bJ), </em>(3) within 1,000 feet of a school (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b688-12\">We reserve discussion of the facts presented at trial for consideration in connection with the defendant\u2019s trial-related claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b689-8\"> The defendant rightly contends that the odor of marijuana is sufficient only when detected by an officer with experience and training in narcotics detection. However, as in <em>Garden, supra </em>at 49, the judge included the fact that Cooley \u201crecognized the smell from training and many arrests with marijuana seizures\u201d in his written findings denying the defendant\u2019s motion. The judge implicitly credited Officer Cooley\u2019s testimony on the subject and believed that he was qualified to recognize the odor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b690-7\"> The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Garden </em>in arguing that searching the trunk exceeded the permissible scope of the automobile search is misplaced. <em>Garden </em>is distinguishable because the search there rested on probable cause supplied by the officer\u2019s detection of an odor of burnt marijuana emanating from the vehicle. The search in this case was conducted after Officer Cooley discovered contraband on the defendant\u2019s person. The discovery of contraband justified a search of the entire vehicle, including the trunk.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b691-6\"> The trial below was held on October 31, 2006. The <em>Garden </em>decision was released in April, 2008. The lengthy delay between trial and appellate review is explained, but far from justified, by the two-year period required for the transcripts to be completed and filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b691-7\"> The judge in <em>Garden </em>did not credit Officer\u2019s Cooley testimony that he saw the muzzle of a gun when searching the back seat of an automobile.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b691-8\"> We recount the main examples alleged by the defendant:</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">At the suppression hearing, Cooley testified that he pat frisked the defendant before the arrest. At trial, Cooley testified at one point that the patfrisk followed the arrest. He also testified almost at the same time that during the patfrisk he pulled a plastic bag out of the defendant\u2019s pocket before arresting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">At the suppression hearing, Cooley testified that when he observed the defendant obstructing traffic, he waited for the intervening cars to go around the defendant\u2019s vehicle and then pulled behind the defendant, activating his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>lights but not his horn. At trial he testified that he activated both lights and horn and pulled into the oncoming lane in order to pull alongside the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">At the suppression hearing, Officer Cooley made no mention of any alleged \u201cfidgeting\u201d by the defendant. At trial he stated that the defendant\u2019s \u201cfidgeting . . . threw a flag up in my head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">At the suppression hearing, Cooley stated that the defendant\u2019s window was \u201cwide open\u201d when he approached and detected the odor of marijuana. At trial, he testified consistently with his statement at the suppression hearing, but then also stated that the defendant \u201cput the window down while I was speaking to him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b692-10\"> The judge stated: \u201cI also will appoint Mr. Moss to serve as your standby counsel and I\u2019ve described the role that he may play as standby counsel. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>also means that since he was your attorney, if at any point in time during the course of the trial you decide that this decision to represent yourself is one which is a bad idea or at least an idea that you don\u2019t wish to continue with, I will permit you during the course of the trial to allow Mr. Moss to again represent you. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b693-13\"> The docket verified Officer Mazzole\u2019s testimony, listing the date of arrest as August 2, 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b694-6\"> After briefing and oral argument before us, the Supreme Judicial Court decided <em>Commonwealth </em>v.
