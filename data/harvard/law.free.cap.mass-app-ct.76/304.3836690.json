L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a), and carrying a loaded firearm, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 lO(n),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the defendant appeals, claiming that the admission of a ballistics certificate violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, citing <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36 (2004), and <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>129 S. Ct. 2527 (2009). He also contends that his motion to suppress the gun was improperly denied and that his motion for a new trial alleging several claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel was improperly denied. We agree that the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights were violated and reverse his convictions. Because the defendant may be retried, we also address the denial of the motion to suppress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\"><em>Factual background. </em>The defendant, who was driving a car with three passengers, was stopped by a State trooper for a traffic violation at approximately 10:00 p.m. on May 4, 2006, in Lowell. Following the stop of the car, a gun was discovered in the area under the driver\u2019s seat, and the defendant was taken in custody. The trooper discovered three live bullets in the gun as he was clearing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">After a hearing, the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the gun was denied in October, 2006, and a jury trial was held in January, 2007.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A notice of appeal was timely filed by the defendant, but he moved for a new trial in April, 2008. The defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied by the trial judge in June, 2008. The defendant timely appealed from the denial of his new trial motion, and following the entry of his appeal in this court, the two appeals were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>The ballistics certificate. </em>We begin by examining how the challenge to the ballistics certificate was advanced by the defendant. At trial, the defendant did not object to the introduction in evidence of the ballistics certificate. This issue was raised in his memorandum in support of his motion for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>new trial. The defendant argued that trial counsel was ineffective in not objecting to the admission in evidence of the ballistics certificate and asserted that his right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution as construed in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36 (2004), had been violated. Noting that <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts </em>was then pending in the Supreme Court, he argued that such an objection would have preserved the <em>Crawford </em>issue in this case. In his November, 2008, brief on direct appeal, the defendant acknowledged that this court, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 587, 588 (2008), relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Verde, </em>444 Mass. 279, 283 (2005), held that a ballistics certificate was a \u201c \u2018record of a primary fact made by a public officer in the performance of [an] official duty\u2019 that did not violate the defendant\u2019s rights under the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Recognizing that <em>Verde </em>was controlling precedent, the defendant stated that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object should not constitute a waiver of his constitutional claim and would have been futile in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Prior to oral argument the defendant submitted a supplemental memorandum addressing the effect of <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>arguing that a ballistics certificate, just as a drug analysis certificate, violates a defendant\u2019s right of confrontation if introduced without the testimony of the ballistics expert, or an opportunity to cross-examine the expert, and urging that our review be conducted under the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard. The Commonwealth did not submit a supplemental memorandum but argued in its brief that the introduction of the ballistics certificate in this case did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. It is unnecessary to decide which standard of review is to be applied in this case because we conclude that there was reversible error under either standard. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendes, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 390, 396-397 (2009).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>The firearms crimes charged in this case require the Commonwealth to prove that the gun is a firearm, defined in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, as appearing in St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 8; that is, it is \u201ca pistol, revolver or other weapon of any description, loaded or unloaded, from which a shot or bullet can be discharged and of which the length of the barrel ... is less than 16 inches.\u201d The Commonwealth is required to \u201cpresent <em>some </em>competent evidence from which the jury reasonably can draw inferences that the weapon will fire.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 2 (1997). General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 121 A, as appearing in St. 1987, c. 300, provides that a \u201ccertificate by a ballistics expert . . . shall be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of his findings as to whether or not the item furnished is a firearm [emphasis added].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The evidence submitted by the Commonwealth in this case begins and ends with the testimony of the trooper who seized the gun and found that it was loaded. Relying on the ballistics certificate, he stated that the gun had been test fired and was functioning properly. The certificate described the gun as a \u201c.22LR caliber Llama Spa[]nish semi automatic pistol . . . [w]ith magazine and four (4) .22LR caliber live [cartridges].\u201d The certificate stated that the barrel length was three and eleven-sixteenths inches, that the gun had been test fired using two of the submitted cartridges, and that there were no malfunctions. Other than his observation that the gun was loaded when he seized it, the trooper offered no other observations or any opinions or evidence whether the gun was a working firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The admission of the gun in evidence does not eliminate the problems raised by the erroneous admission of the certificate. While the jury could determine the barrel length by inspection, \u201cthe mechanisms of guns are not so universally familiar that jurors, simply by looking at one, can tell whether it works.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nieves, supra </em>at 3. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chery, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 909, 910-911 (2009). While a jury could infer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>without expert testimony that a loaded gun is capable of firing a bullet, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fancy, </em>349 Mass. 196, 204 (1965), there is no indication that they were given any appropriate instructions in this case, and in any event, we think such a finding alone would not be conclusive. Moreover, there was no independent evidence that the gun had been recently fired. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendes, supra </em>at 391-392 (police heard shots and soon found gun, which smelled of gunpowder as if recently fired and contained both live bullets and spent shell casings).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, the prosecutor specifically relied on the certificate in closing argument and stated that \u201cthe certification says it does fire.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ware, ante </em>53, 58 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Finally, there is no merit in the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that it is significant that the defendant never argued that the gun and ammunition did not meet the statutory definitions. \u201cWe recognize that a defendant cannot relieve the Commonwealth of its burden of proving every element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt by failing to contest an essential element of that crime at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gabbidon, </em>398 Mass. 1, 5 (1986). Also, while the defendant asserted that he had no knowledge that the gun was in the car, \u201ca defendant\u2019s theory of his case cannot reheve the Commonwealth of its burden of proving every element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cowans, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 811, 821 (2001), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>398 Mass. 264, 269 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">It readily appears that the Commonwealth sought to prove its case through a near-total reliance on the certificate. The Supreme Court determined that it is error for the \u201cprosecution to prove its case via <em>ex parte </em>out-of-court affidavits.\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, supra </em>at 2542. We conclude that the error constituted a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice because it is \u201cplausible . . . that the [jury\u2019s] result might have been otherwise but for the error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 13 (1999), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 21 (1986). Because it is apparent that \u201cthere is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>have contributed to the conviction,\u201d <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23 (1967), quoting from <em>Fahy </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>375 U.S. 85, 86-87 (1963), we also conclude that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant\u2019s convictions must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">2. <em>The motion to suppress. </em>The defendant\u2019s argument that his motion to suppress the gun was improperly denied rests on his assertion that the judge\u2019s finding that his movements were \u201cfurtive\u201d is clearly erroneous because, he asserts, the movements described by the police officer \u201cwere not \u2018furtive\u2019 as defined by court decisions.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Because the automobile that the defendant was driving did not immediately stop when the trooper signaled for the vehicle to stop, the trooper, who was alone, sought backup. When the automobile did subsequently stop, the trooper approached the driver\u2019s side. He saw four occupants in the vehicle. He noticed that the defendant was \u201cmaking movement side to side and slightly forward\u201d and was \u201cfumbling with an object in his lap [and] manipulating that object between his legs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Upon the arrival of two additional troopers, the first trooper ordered the occupants to put their hands on their heads. They did not comply with the first order, but they did comply after a second order. The trooper then ordered the defendant to leave the automobile. The trooper pat frisked the defendant and found a cellular telephone. The trooper told one of the other troopers of the defendant\u2019s movements, and that trooper, observing the driver\u2019s door open, checked the area around the driver\u2019s seat and found a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The defendant quarrels only with the judge\u2019s determination that his gestures were furtive, asserting that these movements were mere \u201cfidgeting.\u201d \u201cThe phrase \u2018furtive gesture\u2019 appears in many decisions where the issue is whether a patfrisk or a search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>of a vehicle is justified. The gestures are interpreted by the police (and by the courts) as demonstrating the hiding of contraband or as threatening the officers\u2019 safety.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holley, 52 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 659, 664-665 (2001). Our cases often indicate that such movements were attempts to hide drugs or guns in compartments or under the seats of an automobile. Guns so hidden could be retrieved and could threaten the safety of an officer or others. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 311, 315 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Heughan, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 102, 104-105 (1996). \u201c[A]n officer [is required] to have reasonable suspicion of danger to himself or others before ordering a driver from a lawfully stopped vehicle.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 362, 365 (2006), and cases cited. The judge found the trooper\u2019s suspicion in this case was reasonable. We conclude that the motion judge\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous and that he correctly denied the motion to suppress the gun.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.
