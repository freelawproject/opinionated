We agree on the first of these grounds and remand to the department for adjudicatory proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>On October 18, 1995, the department listed, i.e., approved, Aid-Ox as a septic system additive and restorative under Title 5 of the State environmental code, 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 15.000 et seq.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In so doing, the department determined that Aid-Ox (1) will not harm septic system components (including the biomat<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>), or adversely affect (2) system function or (3) the environment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When Aid-Ox entered the market with the department\u2019s approval, the department had been informed that its active ingredient was sodium percarbonate (also known as sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate), and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>its intended use included restoring septic systems. Aid-Ox has been available in the Commonwealth, without change in chemical composition, since 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">On August 17, 2006, the department advised Hercules that it had concerns that the sodium percarbonate in Aid-Ox may harm septic system components (specifically the biomat) and adversely affect system function and the environment, which put the listing of Aid-Ox as an allowed additive at odds with 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.027 (2006).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The department requested that Hercules respond. Hercules did so, providing the department with, among other things, letters from two proffered experts, both of whom suggested that Aid-Ox, which they indicated is used as a \u201crestorative\u201d for \u201cfailing\u201d systems, was completely harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">In light of Hercules\u2019s response, the department seemingly abandoned its concerns with Aid-Ox\u2019s safety and instead, without notice to Hercules, shifted its focus to the use of Aid-Ox as a \u201crestorative\u201d for \u201cfailing\u201d systems. According to departmental regulations, chemical additives ordinarily may not be used in place of the \u201cupgrade[]\u201d that is the mandated response to a \u201cfailing\u201d system<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; in the usual case, the only available cure for a failing system is to physically replace the inadequate components with functioning ones. See 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 15.002, 15.303, 15.404, 15.405 (2006).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In light of this, the department advised Hercules on October 13, 2006, that it would remove Aid-Ox from the list of approved additives under 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.027,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and it invited Hercules instead to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>seek approval for the product under the department\u2019s \u201cInnovative/ Alternative System program.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">In response, Hercules apparently sought approval of Aid-Ox under this alternative designation, but on January 2, 2007, the department rejected the application, once again raising concerns that Aid-Ox \u201cmay harm the soil absorption system biomat and/or soil structure.\u201d The department invited Hercules to \u201cpursue approval for the controlled testing of the product under the [department\u2019s] innovative and alternative system program to evaluate the product^]s potential for further consideration.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Instead, Hercules claimed adjudicatory hearings on both decisions. A department hearing officer determined that Hercules was not entitled to an adjudicatory hearing as to either decision, and that the challenge to the initial delisting determination was untimely. The department adopted the hearing officer\u2019s decision without discussion. On judicial review, acting on cross motions for judgment on the pleadings, a Superior Court judge dismissed Hercules\u2019s complaint without elaboration. Hercules appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Although we decide the appeal on the narrow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>basis that animated the hearing officer\u2019s decision, we first note Hercules\u2019s understandable protest that the department\u2019s regulatory actions were arbitrary and capricious in creating a \u201cmoving target\u201d against which Hercules had to defend. \u201cA decision is arbitrary and capricious when it lacks any rational explanation that reasonable persons might support.\u201d <em>Cambridge </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 300, 303 (1997). Arbitrary and capricious action is that which is taken \u201cwithout consideration and in disregard of facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>Long </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Safety, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 61, 65 (1988). In the eleven years between the department\u2019s decision to list and then to delist Aid-Ox, the product never changed. Instead, what appeared to Hercules to have changed was the department\u2019s own subjective realization as to how Aid-Ox was being used. (But see note 9, <em>supra, </em>regarding certain regulatory changes not discussed by the parties.) No evidence has been introduced to support the department\u2019s originally expressed concern that Aid-Ox is harmful.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> By changing its reasoning for delisting Aid-Ox without warning or thorough explanation, and later returning to the abandoned rationale as a basis for its decision denying \u201calternative system\u201d designation, the department courts scrutiny under the arbitrary and capricious standard. An agency should strive to act on bases that are uniform and predictable. See <em>Fafard </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Reading, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 565, 568 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">We turn now to the grounds for our decision on appeal. Relying on G. L. c. 21A, \u00a7 13, and 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.422 (2006), the hearing officer concluded that Hercules was not entitled to a departmental adjudicatory hearing because neither of the decisions fell into appealable categories. However, we agree with Hercules that in the circumstances the department\u2019s combined actions were the equivalent of the revocation of a license under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 13, which defines license as including \u201cany license, permit, certificate, registration, charter, authority or similar form of permission required by law.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>inserted by St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1. The department\u2019s regulations effectively state that no septic system additive may be recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>mended for use or used in the Commonwealth without permission from the department. 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.027.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 13, the revocation of a license entitles the license holder to an adjudicatory hearing in conformity with G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 11, and 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Nor are we detained long by the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that Hercules\u2019s challenge to the initial delisting determination was untimely. At oral argument, the department took the sensible position that because the department\u2019s two decisions were consolidated before the hearing officer, and Hercules\u2019s claim for a hearing on the second decision was timely, the entire matter was timely. We agree. Additionally, we note that neither of the letters informing Hercules of the department\u2019s decisions properly notified Hercules of its right to claim an adjudicatory hearing or the time frame for doing so. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 10(1); 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(6)(c) (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the Superior Court judgment and direct the entry of a new judgment vacating the department\u2019s decisions to remove Aid-Ox from the list of allowed septic system additives and to deny Hercules\u2019s application to allow the use of Aid-Ox as a conditioner/restorative. The matter shall be remanded to the department for an adjudicatory hearing on these decisions, consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-15\"> Hercules styled its complaint as a challenge under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, but the department states that it would have been more properly treated as being pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. The judge\u2019s decision on the matter sheds no light on this issue. We agree with the department that the distinction here is immaterial as both statutes permit review of agency action to determine if that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>action was legally erroneous, arbitrary and capricious, or unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b682-7\"> The department\u2019s approval letter stated, \u201cThe Department hereby <em>allows </em>the use of [Aid-Ox] as a soil absorption[] system conditioner/restorative subject to . . . conditions\u201d not relevant here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b682-8\"> Also called the biological mat, this septic system component is \u201c[a] layer composed of microorganisms and organic material located below a soil absorption system which forms on the infiltrative surface of soil and which provides biological treatment of septic tank effluent.\u201d 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.002 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b682-9\"> See 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.027 (1995) (prohibiting septic system additives without prior written determination by department that the three criteria in paragraph [3] are met; and requiring department to maintain and publish list of allowed additives); 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.028 (1995) (entitled \u201c[s]oil [ajbsorption [s]ystem [Restoration\u201d; prohibiting \u201cany physical, chemical or biological treatment process to restore or condition a soil absorption system without the prior written determination of the Department that the proposed treatment process has met the [same three] criteria set forth in 310 [Code Mass.

Regs. \u00a7 15.002 (2006). See 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.002 (1995). Neither the terms \u201crestoration,\u201d \u201crestore,\u201d \u201ccondition,\u201d nor their variants have been defined in this section or, so far as we can discern, elsewhere in the regulations. The department seems to use these latter terms specifically in connection with \u201cfailing\u201d septic systems. See note 6 and accompanying text, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b683-7\"> There appears to be no difference between the applicable 1995 and 2006 versions of this regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b683-9\"> Although the regulations do not specifically define a \u201cfailing\u201d system, they define a <em>\u201c[flailed </em>[s]ubsurface [sjewage [disposal [sjystem or <em>[flailed </em>system\u201d as \u201c[a] system which <em>fails </em>to protect public health and safety or the environment as set forth at 310 [Code Mass.

The department appears to use the terms \u201cfailing,\u201d \u201cfailed,\u201d and \u201cfails\u201d without distinction. See, e.g., 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.303 (2006) (\u201cIf one or more of the following conditions exist... the system is <em>failing </em>to protect public health and safety and the environment and shall be upgraded . . .\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b683-10\"> These regulations appear to have undergone no relevant changes from their applicable 1995 counterparts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b683-11\"> Contrary to Hercules\u2019s argument, the department\u2019s legal authority to remove a substance from the list of allowed additives or restoratives is fairly implied from the governing statutory and regulatory provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\"> See 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.028 (2006) (effective April 21, 2006), under which the department shall maintain and publish a list of allowed \u201cphysical, chemical or biological treatment process[es]\u201d to \u201crestore or condition . . . soil absorption system[s]\u201d; unlike under the 1995 version of this regulation that applied to Aid-Ox\u2019s original approval, such listing under the 2006 (and still current) version requires approval of the treatment process by the department \u201cfor use as an alternative system pursuant to 310 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7] 15.280 through 15.288 [(2006)].\u201d Contrast 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.028 (1995), which, as indicated in note 4, <em>supra, </em>required only the meeting of the three \u00a7 15.027(3) criteria for the listing of a restorative or conditioner. It would seem that under the current regulations, a restorative/conditioner (a term not explicitly defined, see note 4, <em>supra) </em>is in a specialized subcategory of additives subject to an additional layer of department approval. In their briefs and at oral argument, neither the department nor Hercules brought this regulatory change to our attention. We assume the parties will consider the point on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b684-8\"> This invitation is puzzling, given that Hercules\u2019s application came in response to a similar recommendation in the October 13, 2006, decision. It may be that the application did not make clear that Hercules was in fact seeking approval for Aid-Ox as an alternative system, although in places the parties\u2019 briefs seem to agree that it did. Elsewhere in its brief, however, the department asserts that its January 2, 2007, letter \u201cessentially denied Hercules\u2019s request to continue marketing Aid-Ox as an additive/restorative while the required testing of the \u2018alternative system\u2019 under [\u00a7\u00a7 15.280 through 15.288] w[as] ongoing.\u201d We need not reconcile these matters to decide the narrow issues in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b685-6\"> Because both parties will have the opportunity to develop the evidentiary record on remand, we decline Hercules\u2019s premature invitation to invalidate the department\u2019s decisions for lack of substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b686-8\"> We are unpersuaded by the department\u2019s claim that Hercules can still market Aid-Ox to end-users even though it would be illegal for system inspectors, soil evaluators, installers, or haulers of septage to use or recommend the use of the product. See 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.027(1). The department\u2019s regulation also prohibits \u201cany person\u201d from using a septic system additive without the department\u2019s written determination that the additive meets the criteria set forth in 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.027(3). See 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.027(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">Additionally, we note that 310 Code Mass.

At the same time, we note that Hercules was not given the opportunity to address this restriction, or to establish what might be permissible use of Aid-Ox as an additive short of qualifying as a conditioner/ restorative.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
