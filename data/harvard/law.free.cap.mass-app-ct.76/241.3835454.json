We hold there was no error in the admission of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-15\">The prior incident occurred on August 23, 2007, and the defendant was arraigned for that offense on September 10, 2007. His brother, Theodore Barboza, the victim of the alleged August 23 assault, was in court that day. The present case arises out of events that occurred on September 10, 2007, after the defendant\u2019s arraignment, and as a result of which he was charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>with four new offenses: malicious destruction of property over $250, threat to commit a crime, intimidation of a witness, and violation of an abuse prevention order that Theodore obtained against the defendant after the August 23 incident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was convicted of violating the abuse prevention order and acquitted of the other three offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The jury could have found the following facts. On returning home from court on September 10, 2007, the defendant stopped his vehicle a few feet from and directly in front of Theodore\u2019s truck, which Theodore had pulled over to the curb to allow the defendant to pass. Emerging from his car, the defendant shouted obscenities at Theodore, and hurled a rock at Theodore\u2019s vehicle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion in limine to preclude testimony surrounding the August incident. At trial, he objected to evidence from Theodore who testified that on August 23, 2007, the defendant had broken Theodore\u2019s arm with a baseball bat. Theodore was hospitalized and after leaving the hospital filed a criminal complaint as well as obtaining the abuse prevention order. After his arraignment, but prior to the present trial, the defendant was acquitted of the charge of assault by means of a dangerous weapon, which had been initiated by Theodore arising from the August 23, 2007 incident. The defendant elicited the fact of acquittal on cross-examination of Theodore at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>In his appeal, the defendant argues that it was prejudicial error to allow Theodore\u2019s testimony concerning the baseball bat incident because he was acquitted of that charge. He also claims the alleged act was not sufficiently probative to be admitted. We disagree. \u201cWhile the Commonwealth is prohibited from introducing evidence of a defendant\u2019s criminal or wrongful behavior to show a tendency of bad character or propensity to commit the crime charged, such evidence is admissible for other relevant probative purposes.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leonardi, </em>413 Mass. 757, 763 (1992). The previous assault indicated the hostil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>ity between the brothers. It supported the prosecution\u2019s theory that the defendant was motivated to commit the September crimes by anger at his brother for instigating the charges relating to the baseball bat incident on which the defendant had just been arraigned.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The general rule is that such evidence is admissible to show hostility and motive, see Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 404(b) (2008-2009), and the admission of such evidence will be upheld absent clear error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>450 Mass. 25, 36-37 (2007), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">That the defendant was acquitted of the assault by means of a dangerous weapon is not a bar to the admission of evidence of the incident. In the prior case the Commonwealth had to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. To introduce evidence of the earlier assault in the present case, the prosecution did not have to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the assault, but only needed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that a jury could reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor. <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>United States, </em>493 U.S. 342, 348-349 (1990).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>432 Mass. 124, 126-127 (2000). While there appears to be no Massachusetts case directly on point, but cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>432 Mass. 353, 358-359 (2000),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court in <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>and most of the State cases we have found elsewhere, set forth in the margin, allow the introduction of relevant evidence of prior charged incidents even though the defendant has been acquitted of those offenses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>We consider the <em>Dowling </em>decision persuasive and it accords with our general rule that where, in the judge\u2019s discretion, the probative value of relevant evidence outweighs its prejudice, it is admissible. The prejudicial impact of such evidence is minimized by informing the jury that the defendant was found not guilty of the charge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>432 Mass. at 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The defendant also complains that the judge gave no limiting instruction. \u201cContrary to the defendant\u2019s claim advanced here for the first time, the law does not require a judge to give limiting jury instructions regarding the purpose for which evidence is offered unless so requested by the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leonardi, </em>413 Mass. at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-8\"> The order required the defendant to stay 100 yards away from Theodore and to have no contact with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">The defendant on an unspecified date also obtained an abuse prevention order against Theodore.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-10\"> The events occurred on the street where the defendant lived. Theodore testified that he was on that street because he was avoiding traffic on the usual route to his own house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b285-6\"> The fact that Theodore brought charges against the defendant would, in any event, be admissible to show the defendant\u2019s anger and motive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\"> In <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>the Supreme Court held that because of the different standard of proof, the introduction of such evidence did not violate the collateral estoppel component of the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution. The Court also held that it did not violate the Federal Constitution\u2019s due process clause. <em>Id. </em>at 352-354.
