L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. He was convicted following a bench trial in the District Court, and argues on appeal that (a) the evidence was insufficient; (b) he received inadequate notice of the Commonwealth\u2019s theory of the case; and (c) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>confiscation of a megaphone by police violated various State and Federal constitutional protections. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\"><em>Background.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The defendant is the director of a proselytizing group that visits Salem each Halloween to preach to the crowds. Late in the afternoon, the defendant and his group stationed themselves in the Townhouse Square section of Salem.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The area was extremely congested (most people stood \u201celbow-to-elbow\u201d) and contained a dry fountain with an exterior wall comprised of three steps. Some group members took turns preaching with a megaphone from atop the fountain wall, while other members moved among the crowd gathered at its base. This was a visit that the defendant and his group made annually to Salem. They were well aware of the Halloween event and the crowd and conditions during the evening of Halloween.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The defendant\u2019s interactions with the crowd generated many complaints to police. He blocked the path of some people and encroached upon the personal space of others with his megaphone. Some people were frightened by him. The defendant waved a Bible \u201cwithin inches\u201d of people\u2019s faces. Some people became upset and backed away, while others walked around him. Other times, the defendant prompted complaints by using his megaphone within a foot of the faces of people passing by. His voice \u201ctower[ed] over most,\u201d notwithstanding that it was an extremely loud night. On three or four occasions between 7:30 and 8:30 p.m., the defendant accosted people by approaching them and yelling, at times within inches of their faces, and he created more of a disturbance than any other person in the area. A police officer relayed complaints he had received about the defendant to his supervisor, who also had received complaints regarding the defendant\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Meanwhile, as the night progressed, more people entered Salem and the earlier family atmosphere began to disappear. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>The crowd became more hostile with the addition of intoxicated individuals. It became a younger crowd with a \u201clot of college students.\u201d At around 8:00 p.m., the supervising police officer approached the defendant and one of his colleagues. The latter, standing atop the fountain wall, was preaching with a megaphone while the defendant stood nearby. The supervising officer ordered that the defendant\u2019s colleague cease use of the megaphone.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The colleague complied, and the officer left the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">At approximately 8:20 p.m., the defendant resumed use of the megaphone, at which point the police officers promptly reiterated the order and warned that confiscation of the megaphone or arrest might result if the defendant refused to cooperate. The defendant temporarily complied with the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Around 8:35 p.m., the defendant, contrary to the police orders, persisted in using the megaphone. The supervising police officer approached the defendant once more, reiterated the earlier orders, and after issuing another warning, attempted to confiscate the megaphone. The defendant held tightly to the megaphone and verbally protested the confiscation. Two officers assisted the supervisor, and pushing and shoving between the defendant and the officers resulted. Then, the defendant \u201cwent limp,\u201d which caused him to fall into the fountain, bringing the officers to the ground with him. Immediately thereafter, the officers stood up and arrested the defendant. The crowd was noisy and raucous, and the area was congested and became dangerous. The defendant, by refusing police orders and resisting the confiscation of the megaphone, drew a hostile crowd that was out of control. The police were concerned for their own safety as well as the safety of the crowd.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>Ordinarily, in assessing whether the evidence adduced at trial is sufficient to meet the government\u2019s threshold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>burden of proof, all evidence presented to the fact-finder is considered. Moreover, the evidence is, according to the familiar formulation, \u201cviewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979). Here, however, there are strong indications in the record that the fact finder \u2014 in this case the trial judge \u2014 expressly discredited at least some of the government\u2019s proof; viz., evidence that the defendant had engaged in violent or tumultuous conduct <em>apart </em>from his refusal to obey a police order to stop using the megaphone. Consistent with these findings, the judge apparently premised the defendant\u2019s conviction solely on his defiance of the order to stop using the megaphone and the direct consequences of his refusal to do so.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In these circumstances, our inquiry is limited to the question whether those actions, in context, amounted to disorderly conduct as contemplated by G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 53, proscribes, inter alia, engaging in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\u201ctumultuous behavior.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feigenbaum, </em>404 Mass. 471, 474 (1989). While susceptible to multiple meanings, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, </em>432 Mass. 721, 727-728 (2000), \u201ctumultuous behavior,\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 53, includes the refusal to obey a police order. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinai, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 544, 548-549 (1999). There, the defendant, angry at being forced to pay a parking fee, refused a police order to leave the area; pounded the steering wheel of his car and shouted obscenities; attracted a large crowd of onlookers; forced traffic to be rerouted; and resisted attempts by police to take him into custody. This behavior, the court concluded, amounted to \u201ctumultuous conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The facts of the present case require a consistent result. The evidence supports the inference that the defendant, by refusing the police order to stop using the megaphone, created the same sort of threat to public safety occasioned by the defendant\u2019s conduct in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinai, supra. </em>Indeed, if anything, the danger was far greater here in view of the very large crowds involved, the likely widespread public intoxication, the history of criminal conduct on Halloween in Salem, and the intensity of the physical altercation between the defendant and police.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Bolstering our conclusion that the defendant\u2019s conduct amounted to tumultuous behavior is the fact that there was evidence that the defendant, by disobeying the order to stop using the megaphone, had engendered hostility toward police and disrespect for their authority among the crowd. Precisely the same factors were cited in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>369 Mass. 443, 446-448 (1976), in concluding that the defendant had engaged in tumultuous behavior. Likewise, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 920, 921 (1980), we relied upon the fact that the defendant\u2019s conduct \u201cattracted approximately 50 people, some of them laughing or yelling abuse at the police,\u201d in concluding that the defendant properly had been convicted of being a disorderly person under \u00a7 53. The defendant\u2019s actions here, like those of the defendants in <em>Richards </em>and <em>Carson, </em>exposed both the police and the public to danger by reducing the ability of police to maintain order. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mulero, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 963, 965 (1995) (defendant engaged in tumultuous behavior when he flailed his hands \u201cin an agitated and belligerent manner while berating [the officer] with loud profanities\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Finally, while the defendant argues otherwise, we conclude that the police had ample authority to order the defendant to stop using the megaphone once they determined that such conduct posed a public safety risk. Within the scope of their community caretaker function, and under the general power of arrest conferred on police by G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 98,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> police have authority to take reasonable protective measures whenever public safety is threatened by acts that are dangerous, even if not expressly unlawful. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 217, 219 &amp; n.2 (1990) (emergency or \u201ccommunity caretaker\u201d exception authorizes police to make otherwise unlawful entries or searches in certain emergencies \u201cto protect or preserve life or avoid serious injury\u201d). As the judge specifically found, the police exercised that power with admirable restraint on the night of the defendant\u2019s arrest. Several government witnesses testified that the defendant\u2019s use of the megaphone cultivated both fear and anger in the very large crowd, which implicated legitimate safety concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claims, we find nothing in the record to support the inference that the decision to curtail the defendant\u2019s use of the megaphone was in any way connected with the content of his speech. See <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Rock Against Racism, </em>491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989). Indeed, as the defendant concedes, similar Emits were imposed on at least one other nearby group. It is also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>significant to note that the police order by no means prevented the defendant from disseminating his message; rather, it was directed only at the manner of the defendant\u2019s delivery. See <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Community for Creative Non-Violence, </em>468 U.S. 288, 293 (1984) (manner restrictions in public spaces permissible provided they are content neutral, serve a significant government interest, and leave open alternative channels of communication). Moreover, the restriction was imposed in direct response to the changing conditions during the evening. See <em>Freedman </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>380 U.S. 51, 58-59 (1965) (describing procedural safeguards required to justify any prior restraint on potentially protected speech). Both of these factors militate in favor of finding the police action lawful as a measured and appropriate response to a bona fide public safety threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s failure to obey the police command to stop using the megaphone, in the particular context of Halloween night in Salem, ultimately created the kind of \u201chazardous or physically offensive condition affecting the public,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Molligi, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 108, 111 (2007), cognizable by \u00a7 53. While his underlying conduct, particularly dissemination of his religious message, may have enjoyed First Amendment protection, that protection did not entitle him to disregard police commands reasonably calculated at ensuring public safety amid potentially dangerous circumstances. Moreover, the police-imposed limits were content neutral, and no more restrictive than necessary to protect the public. The defendant\u2019s conviction, therefore, transgressed no constitutional limits, and was otherwise proper in all respects. The defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-8\"> We recite the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979), for purposes of evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence. To the extent that our recitation is inappropriate for evaluating other arguments, we so specify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b77-9\"> As many as 100,000 people were present in Salem on that Halloween night. Of those, as many as 20,000 were present in the immediate area surrounding Townhouse Square, which is the center of the Halloween activity and the principal pedestrian route for the crowds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b78-8\"> In the interests of public safety, police supervisors instructed officers that all megaphone use should be stopped at 8:00 p.m. on Halloween. The order was only a small measure the police undertook to ensure public safety during what is Salem\u2019s most notorious night. The parties have argued extensively in their briefs and at oral argument about the Salem sound ordinance, which prohibits the use of megaphones after 10:00 p.m. The ordinance is irrelevant here. The supervising police officers had made a decision, in the interests of public safety and order, to curtail behavior they reasonably believed to threaten the safety of the public.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b78-9\"> Approximately 200 police officers were on duty that night assigned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>maintain order and assure public safety. In an earlier year, on Halloween evening in Salem, there were two shootings, several stabbings, and sixty arrests, with many more individuals taken into protective custody. Each year, intoxication among the crowd was a major issue, and increased as the evening progressed. In 2007, the Salem police force was augmented by police officers from surrounding communities as well as some members of the sheriff\u2019s department and mounted officers from the Boston police department. There were approximately six officers specifically assigned to monitor the Townhouse Square area.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b79-10\"> The judge\u2019s findings may well have reflected his legitimate concern that, to the extent that the record left open the possibility that the defendant\u2019s conviction was premised, even in part, on conduct shielded by the First Amendment (e.g., the defendant\u2019s missionary appeals and preaching), it might have been susceptible to reversal on appeal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>369 Mass. 443, 446-448 (1976). The judge indicated that the defendant\u2019s conviction rested solely on the evidence of his refusal to obey the police command to stop using the megaphone, and the consequences therefrom, and that the defendant had not been convicted on the basis of any protected conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b79-11\"> The defendant alleges that this conduct \u2014 continuing to use the megaphone after being requested to stop by police \u25a0\u2014 is not encompassed by the bill of particulars. However, the bill of particulars put the defendant on notice that it was the loud disturbance created by his \u201cyelling [and] screaming,\u201d together with the resulting \u201cpublic . . . alarm\u201d that was the basis of the disorderly conduct charge. While the megaphone is not mentioned specifically, the focus in the bill of particulars nonetheless was on the high noise level associated with the defendant\u2019s activities and the effects of same. The bill of particulars also incorporated by reference documents that the Commonwealth had previously provided to defense counsel, including a police report that contained a description of the defendant\u2019s megaphone use.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b81-6\"> General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 98, as amended by St. 1967, c. 368, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">\u201cThe chief and other police officers of all cities and towns . . . may disperse any assembly of three or more persons, and may enter any building to suppress a riot or breach of peace therein.
