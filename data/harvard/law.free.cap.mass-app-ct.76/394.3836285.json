Smith and James Donaldson, submitted documentation to the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife\u2019s Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program (program) delaying the plaintiff\u2019s efforts to complete its development project, the plaintiff filed suit alleging trespass.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A judge of the Superior Court denied the defendants\u2019 special motion to dismiss under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, the \u201canti-SLAPP\u201d statute, on the ground that the suit was not based solely upon protected petitioning activity. We now consider the defendants\u2019 interlocutory appeal from that ruling, and conclude that the trial judge did not err. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>Background. </em>The plaintiff, Brice Estates, Inc. (Brice Estates), is a real estate developer seeking to establish a large residential subdivision in Rutland. In 2003, the Rutland Conservation Commission (commission) issued an order of conditions pursuant to G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act (act), denying Brice Estates an authorization to alter wetlands on the property. Among the reasons for the denial was Brice Estates\u2019s refusal to provide a wildlife habitat evaluation as requested by the commission in accordance with the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In 2004, Donaldson, an abutter, grew suspicious when he noted that the flagged boundary separating the parties\u2019 properties lay in part on aquatic vegetation. Retaining the services of Smith, a naturalist, Donaldson sought to confirm the wetlands boundary. While so doing, the defendants entered onto Brice\u2019s land \u2014 <em>claiming </em>they did not observe any \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs or barriers \u2014 and observed a female four-toed salamander, a rare species protected under the Massachusetts Endangered Species Act (MESA). The defendants photographed and recorded the observation, and submitted a rare animal observation form (observation form) to the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">As a result of this submission, Brice Estates conducted a wildlife habitat evaluation of the property, seeking to map the habitat of the four-toed salamander. The evaluation resulted in the designation of a portion of Brice Estates\u2019s land as a \u201c [priority [hjabitat,\u201d subjecting the land to additional regulations under MESA. The designation required Brice Estates to redesign its subdivision layout, subjecting the project to substantial delays and costs. Upon learning of the defendants\u2019 actions, Brice Estates filed a trespass action in Superior Court seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\"><em>Denial of the special motion to dismiss. </em>We review an appeal from a denial of a special motion to dismiss under the antiSLAPP statute to determine whether there was an abuse of discretion or an error of law. <em>Moriarty </em>v. <em>Mayor of Holyoke, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 442, 445 (2008). When considering a G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, motion, the moving party bears the initial burden to demonstrate, through the pleadings and affidavits, that the claims sought to be dismissed are \u201cbased on [the party\u2019s] \u2018petitioning activities alone and have no substantial basis other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>than or in addition to the petitioning activities.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wenger </em>v. <em>Aceto, </em>451 Mass. 1, 5 (2008), quoting from <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156, 167-168 (1998). If the moving party fails to make such a showing, the special motion must be denied. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The defendants\u2019 submission of the observation form clearly comprised protected petitioning activity. See <em>Plante </em>v. <em>Wylie, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 151, 156 (2005) (\u201c[t]he typical mischief that the [anti-SLAPP] legislation is intended to remedy was lawsuits directed at individual citizens of modest means for speaking publicly against development projects\u201d). However, Brice Estates possessed an independent basis for its complaint \u2014 that the defendants committed a trespass on the property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And although the defendants\u2019 petitioning activities may have served as the genesis for the plaintiff\u2019s decision to file suit, we have repeatedly denied G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, motions to dismiss where the underlying conduct involves both petitioning activity and activity not considered petitioning, in this case trespass. See <em>Ayasli </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 740, 748-749 (2002); <em>Garabedian </em>v. <em>Westland, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 427, 432-433 (2003). The Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s decision in <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Products Corp., supra </em>at 167-168 &amp; n.20, noted that the term \u201cbased on\u201d does not mean \u201cin response to\u201d; thus, the mere fact that the defendants\u2019 submission of the form may have prompted Brice Estates\u2019s complaint does not necessitate dismissal pursuant to the anti-SLAPP statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">We acknowledge the defendants\u2019 assertion that the claimed trespass is a mere pretense and that this suit in truth is based on petitioning activity; in support of this they further assert that the trespass itself caused no \u201cactual injury\u201d to Brice Estates, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We note that the trespass claim, even if entitling Brice Estates to no more than nominal damages<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> assuming it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>prevails, would potentially also merit injunctive relief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Given these considerations, the trial judge did not err in denying the defendants\u2019 special motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">\n<em>Order denying special motion to dismiss pursuant to G.
