He timely appealed his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Represented by new counsel, defendant filed a motion for a new trial under Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), arguing that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to obtain and utilize certain school and psychiatric records of the victim to impeach her credibility<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; the Commonwealth introduced evidence of multiple extrajudicial complaints by the victim, in contravention of the first complaint rule; the victim improperly was allowed to present irrelevant and prejudicial evidence of self-mutilation; and the prosecutor made improper and inflammatory remarks in his closing argument. After hearing, the motion judge, who was the trial judge, allowed the defendant\u2019s new trial motion on the basis that trial counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The Commonwealth filed an appeal, arguing that a new trial should not have been granted because the defendant failed to prove that any inadequate performance of trial counsel resulted in the deprivation of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). The defendant first contends that the Commonwealth\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely, that a single justice of this court erred in allowing that notice to be filed late, and that therefore this court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal. In addition, in a cross appeal he asserts he is entitled to a new trial based on the alternate grounds he had raised below in his rule 30 motion, which the judge specifically declined to address.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We briefly recite the facts the jury reasonably could have found. The victim testified the defendant sexually abused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>her, on repeated occasions, when she was between the ages of six and twelve. He had met the victim, Nora, and her brother, Tyler,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at their local elementary school. The defendant became a friend to both children and their mother, who was divorced. Since the divorce, the children\u2019s father had ceased any involvement with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The defendant, a retired school teacher, grew to become a grandfather-like figure to the children. He often \u201cbabysat\u201d for them while their mother was at work or otherwise away from the home. The defendant would read to Nora and Tyler while they were all in bed together. On one such occasion, the defendant moved his hand under a bedspread and touched Nora\u2019s breast and vaginal areas, over her pajamas. Believing her brother was unaware of this at the time, Nora made no mention of it to him or anyone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Over time, the defendant\u2019s conduct \u201cprogressed\u201d to touching Nora under her clothing and groping her bare chest, bare vaginal area, and bare buttocks. He would \u201crub\u201d his penis against her hip and clothed vaginal area. The defendant partially inserted his finger in Nora\u2019s vaginal opening. This usually happened when they were alone. Nora did not speak of this. She feared no one would believe her if she did. She also believed that she would be blamed for \u201ctearing her family apart\u201d if she spoke out.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">The defendant ceased his abuse when Nora was twelve years old, when she no longer needed a sitter in her mother\u2019s absence. It was in her sophomore year of high school when Nora informed a close friend of the abuse. She did so in guarded terms, however, refusing to identify the perpetrator other than to describe him as a family friend or grandfather-like figure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">Around that time, at age fifteen, Nora had recurring bouts of depression that led to episodes where she \u201ccut\u201d herself, using her fingernails, a knife, or scissors.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">After graduating from high school, Nora moved out of the family home, as a result of a falling-out with her mother\u2019s new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>husband. Ultimately, Nora, when she was eighteen, presented herself to a hospital where she was placed in a psychiatric ward for three days. She was released and referred to an outpatient program at McLean Hospital. With treatment and therapy, she ceased her cutting behavior. This occurred in the fall of 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Later, in March of 2005, during a meeting with her mother, the defendant\u2019s friend Mary Doe (a pseudonym), and Doe\u2019s daughter-in-law, Nora disclosed the abuse. (Up to this time, the defendant had maintained a close presence within Nora\u2019s family.) The police were contacted. Nora recounted the sexual abuse in a videotaped interview conducted by the district attorney\u2019s office, a process referred to as a sexual abuse intervention network (SAIN) interview. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>448 Mass. 122, 125 n.3 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">2. <em>Defense case. </em>The defense case centered on a fundamental premise: Nora\u2019s accusations were false and a recent contrivance. In his opening statement, on cross-examination, and in his closing argument, defense counsel sharply questioned her credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Specifically, in his opening, counsel recited quite a detailed account of Nora\u2019s activities with the defendant, such as riding on a bus to New Hampshire for nights out for bingo, going to eat with him at her favorite restaurant, or joining him, with Doe\u2019s extended family, on vacation to Florida and North Carolina. With reference to these particulars, counsel gave context to Nora\u2019s love of the defendant, and the friendship he had with Nora\u2019s mother, which was later \u201cshattered,\u201d according to counsel, when \u201c[o]ut of nowhere\u201d came the accusations of sexual abuse. Counsel indicated to the jurors that by the close of the evidence in the case, \u201cthere will be all kinds of reasons why you should not and will not buy into [Nora\u2019s] story.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">During trial, at defense counsel\u2019s urging, the judge allowed the jury to watch a video recording of the SAIN interview. In his summation, counsel reminded the jury that, in her SAIN interview, Nora made no mention of ever having been digitally raped by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">The defendant did not testify. Nor did he call a witness to testify on his behalf. Defense counsel urged the jury to find that the victim\u2019s accusations were false, motivated by attention-seeking or jealousy of the defendant\u2019s female companion. With this backdrop, we turn to the parties\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>3. <em>Request for dismissal. </em>The Commonwealth filed a notice of appeal from the order on the new trial motion on October 12, 2007, one day beyond the thirty-day period within which it could do so by right. See Mass.R.A.P. 4(b), as amended, 378 Mass. 928 (1979). Six months later, on April 18, 2008, the Commonwealth filed a motion with this court, under Mass.R.A.P. 14(b), as amended, 378 Mass. 939 (1979), asking that its late notice of appeal be accepted. A single justice allowed the motion and we consolidated the defendant\u2019s appeal from that order with the cross appeals on the merits of the new trial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">In acting on a party\u2019s motion under Mass.R.A.P. 14(b),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for an enlargement of time to file a notice of appeal from a lower court order or judgment, a single justice may, within his or her sound discretion, grant relief \u201cfor good cause shown.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barboza, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 180, 183 (2007). Good cause is the standard that must be met under rule 14(b), as compared to the \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d standard that a party must meet under Mass.R.A.P. 4(c), as amended, 378 Mass. 928 (1979).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Though there is a general equivalence in meaning between these two standards in the civil realm, see, e.g., <em>Bernard </em>v. <em>United Brands Co., </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 415, 418 n.8 (1989), the same does not hold true in the criminal setting. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trussed, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 452, 454-460 (2007). Factors such as finality and public interest in the State\u2019s prosecution of those accused of crime point to a somewhat different calculus in the criminal context,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which is implicitly why rule 14(b) does not prohibit a single justice or appellate court from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>permitting the Commonwealth to file a late notice of appeal when warranted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casimir, </em>442 Mass. 1031, 1031 (2004) (\u201cIt is not too late for the Commonwealth to obtain leave, if warranted, to enlarge the time for filing a notice of appeal\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The single justice acted within her discretion in determining good cause had been shown for the requested relief. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>429 Mass. 258, 264-265 (1999)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swartz, </em>454 Mass. 330, 334 &amp; n.3 (2009). The Commonwealth had caused it to be shown that its appeal, noticed just one day late,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> presented a meritorious claim of error and that it also furthered the efficient administration of justice insofar as a decision on appeal might obviate the need for another trial. There is no discernible prejudice to the defendant. See <em>White, supra </em>at 265. Therefore, we decline the defendant\u2019s request to dismiss the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">4. <em>Motion for a new trial. </em>\u201cThe trial judge upon motion in writing may grant a new trial at any time if it appears that justice may not have been done.\u201d Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b). \u201cWhether an appeal is from the granting or the denial of a motion for a new trial, an appellate court will examine the motion judge\u2019s conclusion only to determine whether there has been a significant error of law or other abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 307 (1986). Special deference is afforded to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>decision of a motion judge who was also the trial judge, as is the situation here.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>442 Mass. 485, 499 (2004). If a new trial is sought on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant is required to show (a) \u201cbehavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer\u201d and (b) that it \u201clikely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The defendant alleged his trial counsel was ineffective based on a failure to (1) use Nora\u2019s school records, available to him under a prior subpoena, and (2) obtain her psychiatric records. He argued that these records, had they been used, would have supported an alternative explanation for Nora\u2019s accusations.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">a. <em>School records. </em>The defendant complained of counsel\u2019s failure to use a particular school record: a 2002 letter from a school guidance counselor who had favorably recommended Nora for college admission. We do not agree that the letter could have helped the defendant in a significant way. The guidance counselor\u2019s letter was a classic type of \u201cdouble-edged\u201d proof, for it posed the potential to do more harm than good to the defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">Specifically, in her letter, the school guidance counselor described Nora in glowing terms: an \u201cintelligent and determined young woman,\u201d who \u201chas an immense love of learning\u201d and \u201cis the quintessential scholar\u201d who \u201cwill be the ideal college student.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">The guidance counselor was careful not to gloss over the fact that Nora\u2019s freshman year of high school \u201cwas particularly difficult.\u201d In making this observation, the guidance counselor added: Nora\u2019s brother, Tyler, a high school freshman also, had \u201cstopped attending\u201d school; a \u201ccertain amount of discord ensued at home <em>between her mother and her brother\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied); and Nora felt \u201c \u2018stuck in the middle and off to the side\u2019 at that time in her life.\u201d This is the portion of the letter that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>defendant says would have aided his case. However, other than offering a highly complimentary picture of Nora\u2019s school record and her virtues of diligence, hard work, and perseverance, the counselor\u2019s letter provides no basis to call into question Nora\u2019s accusations or the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The guidance counselor explained how Nora had successfully managed to overcome her poor freshman record by attending three consecutive summer school terms. Nora formed good relationships with teachers and discovered a wide range of academic interests, including art and literature. Apart from her demonstrated classroom achievements, Nora participated in school drama productions and volunteer efforts in the community; drawing from this, the guidance counselor was led to offer these pointed observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-6\">\u201cAlthough I have had the pleasure of working with [Nora] as her counselor in her senior year only, it has been made clear to me by those who have worked with her throughout her four years at [high school], that [Nora] has matured from a passive adolescent to a responsible, pleasant and interesting young woman. She has been able to overcome hardships and to create a meaningful education for herself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">The judge ruled that counsel\u2019s failure to use the guidance counselor\u2019s letter had \u201cdeprived [the defendant] of an otherwise substantial ground of defense.\u201d The record does not support that conclusion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Counsel\u2019s failure to use the letter, even if not by design, cannot be decried, with hindsight of the jury\u2019s verdict, as constituting ineffective assistance.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">b. <em>Psychiatric records. </em>Nor does the record support the judge\u2019s conclusion that counsel\u2019s failure to obtain and use the victim\u2019s psychiatric records amounted to ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>Despite not having reviewed them himself, the judge ruled that the failure to use the psychiatric records necessitated a new trial. In so ruling, the judge noted that \u201cSalinger and the Commonwealth <em>appeared </em>to agree on the substance of the records\u201d (emphasis supplied). The judge\u2019s observation is not borne out by the transcript of the hearing in question; the transcript reflects the fact that the Commonwealth took exception with and sharply contested the defense theory as to why Nora was hospitalized in the fall of 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The defendant said the hospitalization was due to the fact that Nora had ingested two vicodin, not her prescribed dosage, in an apparent suicide attempt. On the other hand, the Commonwealth asserted Nora had presented treating medical personnel with depression issues that had led her to cut herself more frequently. Without having reviewed them, the judge decided the psychiatric records \u201cappear to cast doubt on some of [her trial] testimony.\u201d Quoting directly from the defendant\u2019s memorandum, the judge evidently accepted the defense claim made therein that counsel could have used certain information in those records, such as the reference to Tyler\u2019s alleged physical and emotional abuse of his sister, to support the defense claim that Nora\u2019s accusations were driven by attention-seeking in the context of family strife.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Having examined the psychiatric records, we conclude they are not exculpatory. Rather, they are inculpatory and support the Commonwealth\u2019s case. The psychiatric records memorialize Nora\u2019s report to medical personnel of the fact that she had been sexually abused by her babysitter, between the ages of six and twelve, describing the sitter as a family friend who remained in close contact with her mother.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This is a pointed reference to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">The psychiatric records do not indicate that Nora\u2019s depression or \u201ccutting\u201d behavior existed prior to the events that gave rise to the defendant\u2019s charged crimes; thus, if these records had been introduced at trial, the Commonwealth would likely have used them to show inferentially that any debilitating condition experienced by Nora was the likely result of her being sexually abused by the defendant, starting at a tender age and up to her early teenage years. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bourgeois, </em>68 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>App. Ct. 433, 438 (2007).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baxter, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 45, 48-52 (1994) (records of complainant\u2019s pre-existing psychiatric condition admissible to show impairment of her ability to perceive or recall the subject events).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">The defendant has not made a convincing showing that the psychiatric records would have materially aided his defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. 109, 115 (1977). He has not shown how the records are anything other than cumulative proof of the victim\u2019s much described emotional troubles, which she experienced in her middle-to-late teenage years, <em>after </em>the abuse ended. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 743, 747 &amp; n.8 (2008). This was a topic the jury was well acquainted with as a result of effective work of trial counsel for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Moreover, we have no doubt the resulting failure to use the records at trial did not cause the defendant to be deprived of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. at 96. A lawyer, in the shoes of trial counsel, would recognize the victim\u2019s psychiatric records posed a grave risk to the defendant\u2019s case if the strong inculpatory material contained therein, pointing to him as the perpetrator of the charged sexual abuse, were brought to the jury\u2019s attention. The failure to use the psychiatric records did not amount to ineffective assistance. This is one of those \u201crare\u201d instances where reversal is required to correct an abuse of discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schand, </em>420 Mass. 783, 787 (1995). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caillot, </em>449 Mass. 712, 713 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the order of the single justice allowing the late filing of the Commonwealth\u2019s notice of appeal, and vacate the order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. The case is remanded to allow the trial judge to consider the remaining, unaddressed grounds in the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-8\"> Although the motion also purported to rely on Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(a), that portion of the rule is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b819-9\"> The defendant also filed a motion to stay the execution of his sentence pending the disposition of his motion for new trial, and a motion for posttrial discovery. Both motions were allowed by the Superior Court motion judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b819-10\"> The defendant\u2019s direct appeal from his convictions was stayed by a single justice pending resolution of his new trial motion and is not before us at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b820-10\"> We use pseudonyms to refer to the victim and her brother. See G.

The judge gave an appropriate limiting instruction before the jury heard this testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b822-6\"> Rule 14(b) provides: \u201cThe appellate court or a single justice for good cause shown may upon motion enlarge the time prescribed by these rules or by its order for doing any act, or may permit an act to be done after the expiration of such time; but neither the appellate court nor a single justice may enlarge the time for filing a notice of appeal beyond one year from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed, or, in a criminal case, from the date of the verdict or finding of guilt or the date of imposition of sentence, whichever date is later.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\"> Rule 4(c) states in relevant part that \u201c[ujpon a showing of excusable neglect, the lower court may extend the time for filing the notice of appeal by any party for a period not to exceed thirty days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by this rule.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b822-8\"> \u201cThe public, whom the Commonwealth represents, \u2018has a substantial interest in prosecuting those accused of crime and bringing the guilty to justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borders, </em>73 Mass.
