The members sentenced him to confinement for 6 months, a dishonorable discharge, and reduction to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>lowest enlisted pay grade. The convening authority approved the sentence as adjudged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">We have reviewed the record of trial, the appellant\u2019s nine assignments of error,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Government\u2019s response. We heard oral argument on the first three assignments of error. Because we find merit in the first assigned error, which we conclude entitles the appellant to a new trial, we will not discuss the other assignments of error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">The appellant lived with his wife, his adopted 11-year-old daughter, CM, and their 9-year-old son in Government housing. CM\u2019s best friend, AW, was an 11-year-old neighbor girl. On Saturday, 17 September 1994, after playing Nintendo together, CM invited AW to spend the night at her home. The appellant, whose wife was working late that evening, gave his permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">At some point during the evening, the appellant asked AW if she was a \u201clight sleeper.\u201d She told him that she was such a very heavy sleeper that she could sleep through just about anything. About 2100 the two girls got ready for bed. After engaging in a pillow fight and tickling with the younger brother, innocent horseplay in which the appellant became involved, CM and AW got into their beds. CM testified that she did not fall asleep. Instead, she claimed she listened to music on the radio. After 30 minutes or so, AW started crying and told CM about a sexual assault that the appellant had just committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-16\">AW testified that, some time after falling asleep, a large man, whom she took to be the appellant, sat down on the side of her bed. He separated her legs and used his finger to assault her sexually. Repulsed but fearful, she pretended to be asleep and turned on her side. Her assailant then left the room. When AW was sure he was gone, she complained to CM of what her father had just done to her. AW insisted upon returning to her own home, where she immediately reported the assault to her older sister, her sister\u2019s friend, and her parents. The next day her mother reported the incident to the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>Special Agent Bruce Rogers, Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), was the final witness the Government called in its case-in-chief. He testified that he was the lead investigator in the case, interviewed several witnesses, and viewed CM\u2019s bedroom 4 days after the incident. He also interviewed the appellant on that day. After being advised of his rights and the offense of which he was suspected of committing, the appellant denied asking AW if she were a light sleeper. He also denied that he touched her inappropriately. However, he admitted checking on the girls \u201ctwo maybe three times\u201d after they had gone to bed. The appellant explained he understood that AW left the house because she \u201cwanted her privacy.\u201d Record at 195. The final portion of Special Agent Rogers\u2019 direct testimony proceeded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-4\">Q: Did he eventually terminate the interview?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-5\">A: He asked that it stop until he could get advice from legal counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-6\">Q: Then he terminated the interview?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AemA\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-7\">Q: How long did the entire interview last, approximately?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-8\">A: I\u2019d have to refer to the notes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-9\">Q: Just the approximate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-10\">A: From the time of his rights waiver to the end of the \u2014 this is off the top of my head. About a half hour or so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-11\">Q: Not a very long interview?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-12\">A:, No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-13\">TC: That\u2019s all I have, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0sd\">Record at 195-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-14\">At the next Article 39(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 839(a) session, the defense team requested \u201ca brief instruction to the members that they should not hold it against Petty Officer Miller that he invoked his right to counsel as was testified to by Special Agent Rogers.\u201d The military judge responded: \u201cDo you want me to emphasize that? Are you sure you want me to do that?\u201d Both of the defense counsel responded independently: \u2018Yes, Your Honor.\u201d The assistant defense counsel observed: \u201cI think that was clearly directed at the members and the members \u2014 I found them taking notes immediately upon that statement.\u201d Record at 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-17\">The trial counsel then contributed the following: \u2018We don\u2019t have to do it now. We could do it along with the instructions. It doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d The defense counsel agreed that they could \u201cdo it with the rest of the instructions.\u201d At this point the military judge stated: \u201cOkay, then don\u2019t let me forget.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Later, the military judge did not propose or give any instruction on the matter; the appellant made no objection to the instructions, either as proposed or as given. Nor did he request any additional instructions. Record at 275, 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-18\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b929-19\">The appellant contends that the military judge erred in failing to take adequate steps to remedy an obvious error during the trial: the introduction into evidence of his decision to terminate the interview with the NCIS until he could speak with an attorney. The Government agrees that such testimony would \u201cnormally\u201d constitute error, even plain error. However, the Government\u2019s position is that, under the circumstances of this case, it was not so prejudicial as to entitle the appellant to relief. We disagree. We hold that the admission of the NCIS agent\u2019s testimony materially prejudiced the substantial rights of the appellant and that, because the military judge failed to take the necessary steps to remedy the prejudice, he is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-20\">Our superior court has long recognized that when an accused is interrogated concerning an offense he is suspected of committing, his pretrial reliance upon his Article 31, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 831 rights \u201cmay not be paraded before a court-martial in order that his guilt may be inferred from his refusal to comment on the charges against him.\u201d <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>12 C.M <em>A. </em>423, 425-26, 31 C.M.R. 9, 11-12, 1961 WL 4509 (1961). <em>See United States v. Nees, </em>18 C.M.A. 29, 33-34, 39 C.M.R. 29, 33-34, 1968 WL 5050 (1968); <em>see also </em>Mil.R.Evid. 301(f)(3), Manual foe Coubts-Maetial, United States (1995 ed.).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-21\">This principle is founded upon the open-eyed realization that to many, even to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>those who ought know better, the invocation by a suspect of his constitutional and statutory rights to silence and to counsel equates to a conclusion of guilt \u2014 that a truly innocent accused has nothing to hide____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-4\"><em>United States v. Moore, </em>1 M.J. 390, 391 (C.M.A.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">When the Government brings such inadmissible information to the attention of the members, the test for prejudice is the constitutional standard of harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 391-92 (relying upon <em>United States v. Ward, </em>1 M.J. 176, 180 (C.M.A.1975)); <em>see </em>U.S. Const. amend. V; <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 21-22, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Applying this standard, we must set aside the conviction unless our \u201cexamination of the record supports the conclusion that there is no reasonable possibility that the error might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>1 M.J. at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">A recent ease which focused on a similar problem is <em>United States v. Riley, </em>47 M.J. 276 (1997). In <em>Riley, </em>our superior court found plain error in repeated references an NCIS agent made to the accused\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent. <em>Id. </em>at 277. Both the appellant and the Government agree that, unless there are factual distinctions, the legal principles in <em>Riley, </em>which are largely founded upon <em>Moore </em>and the other authorities cited above, must govern the disposition of this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">The Government argues that there are important distinctions between <em>Riley </em>and this case. The NCIS agent in <em>Riley </em>was the first witness the Government called. He therefore became the \u201cfilter\u201d through which the members viewed the rest of the evidence. In the instant case, the agent was the final witness the Government called. However, we see that as a distinction without a difference. One could equally well argue that the members, having heard the testimony of the NCIS agent more recently, would give it more weight, and that it would be the \u201clens\u201d through which they would examine the other evidence they had heard. There is every indication, in both <em>Riley </em>and this case, that the trial counsel made a concerted decision to elicit the agent\u2019s testimony so that it would have the maximum impact on the members.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">Another distinction to which the Government points is that in <em>Riley </em>the NCIS agent had no other important admissible evidence concerning which he could testify. In the instant case, the NCIS agent testified about other relevant matters, including the appearance of the crime scene and several statements the appellant made before invoking his right to counsel. This could be a more important distinction, particularly if the agent had blurted out the inadmissible evidence. However, our superior court\u2019s central concern in emphasizing this point in <em>Riley </em>appears to be that the Government had called the NCIS agent to the stand for the purpose of introducing the inadmissible evidence. <em>See Riley, </em>47 M.J. at 280. Our reading of the instant record, in which the trial counsel affirmatively elicited the circumstances under which the interview \u201cterminated,\u201d was calculated to draw out the fact that the appellant had invoked his constitutional and statutory rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This was unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">Additionally, the Government notes that the special agent in <em>Riley </em>repeated the fact that the accused had invoked his right to remain silent three separate times. In the instant case, there was only one such overt reference. However, the trial counsel focused on the general topic for several questions, asking the circumstances under which the appellant \u201cterminated\u201d the interview. The trial counsel also got the witness to agree that it was \u201cnot a very long interview,\u201d clearly suggesting to the members that but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>for the appellant\u2019s request to end the interrogation, it would have continued. <em>See </em>Record at 195-96. Moreover, the assistant defense counsel noted on the record his observation that as soon as the NCIS agent testified to that effect, the members took notes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Record at 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Although the trial counsel did not specifically argue the appellant\u2019s invocation of his right to consult with counsel during her argument on findings, the trial counsel reminded the members that he had a chance to tell NCIS more of what he testified to during the court-martial. The trial counsel argued that his failure to do so should be held against him in evaluating his credibility.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Record at 265-66. Whether the inadmissible evidence came before the members one time or several times, we conclude that very real damage was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">The Government also notes that the only thing it had to rely on in <em>Riley </em>was the testimony of the complaining witness, whose testimony this court evaluated as wavering. <em>United States v. Riley, </em>44 M.J. 671, 674 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.1996), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>47 M.J. 276 (1997). The Government argues that the instant case is far stronger. Although we have not reviewed the entire record in <em>Riley </em>such as to draw a valid comparison, the case against the appellant was also not without its weaknesses. The appellant, who put on a parade of unre-butted character witnesses, emphatically denied committing the offense. Moreover, AW, the Government\u2019s key witness, told different versions of her story prior to trial. The defense called several witnesses that she had a reputation for stretching the truth to draw attention to herself. After reviewing the entire record, we are convinced that there was a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that this tainted evidence might have contributed to the members\u2019 decision to convict the appellant of these offenses when they might otherwise have acquitted him. <em>See Moore, </em>1 M.J. at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">Finally, the Government contends that the appellant never objected to the instructions as proposed or given, thus waiving his earlier request for a curative instruction and forfeiting the issue on appeal. This is the strongest point in the Government\u2019s argument, but nonetheless not convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">The Government notes that the military judge, the trial counsel, and the defense team met in an \u201c802 conference\u201d to discuss findings instructions. Record at 275. <em>See </em>Rule foe Courts-Martial 802, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.)[hereinafter R.C.M.]. This session took place less than 4 hours after the military judge had told the appellant\u2019s two counsel to \u201cremind\u201d her of the need for a curative instruction. The Government argues that it was during this session that the defense team <em>must have made a \u201ctactical decision\u201d </em>not to seek such an instruction because they did not want to remind the members of the tainted testimony. Answer on Behalf of the Government at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">This theory relies on conjecture and supposition; nothing on the record supports the argument that the appellant ever addressed the issue of waiving his earlier request for a curative instruction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The military judge had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>promised to give such an instruction. Record at 207. Although the military judge admonished the defense counsel not to let her forget the issue, it is not the appellant\u2019s obligation to do so. The military judge has the responsibility to manage the proceedings to ensure a fair trial. <em>See </em>R.C.M. 801(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">The military judge had the obligation either to give an instruction or to ensure that the record reflected an affirmative withdrawal of the appellant\u2019s earlier request.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She did neither. The failure to provide a curative instruction worked to the substantial prejudice of the appellant. Therefore, this first assignment of error has merit and entitles the appellant to appropriate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">Accordingly, we set aside the findings and the sentence. An appropriate convening authority may order a rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Senior Judge SEFTON and Judge LEO concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-8\">.

After applying the tests for legal and factual sufficiency our superior court articulated in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>25 M.J. 324, 324-25 (C.M.A.1987), we conclude that the third assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b930-8\">. We recognize that the primary focus of the <em>Riley </em>opinion was on the question of \"plain error\u201d and on the interrelationship between Articles 59(a) and 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 859(a) and 866(c). <em>See Riley, </em>47 M.J. at 278-80. However, the fact patterns are quite similar. Unless we are able to adequately distinguish it, the holding is binding on us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b930-12\">. We note that the assistant defense counsel stated on the record that the testimony was \"clearly directed at the members.\u201d Record at 207.

During oral argument, Government counsel suggested that there is no way we can be sure that this statement was true. However, we are persuaded that this near contemporaneous representation by an officer of the court, with which neither the trial counsel nor the military judge took issue, was an accurate statement that at least some of the members recorded this inad-' missible statement of the NCIS agent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b931-8\">. The specific reference trial counsel made during her argument was to the appellant\u2019s testimony during trial that, as AW was walking past his room on her way out of the house, he was saying his evening prayers.

He\u2019s ly-ing____\u201d While nothing prevents the trial counsel from making fair comment on the credibility of any witness, including the accused, this argument (to which there was no objection) comes close to commenting on his decision not to tel! his entire version of events to the NCIS prior to trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b931-16\">.
