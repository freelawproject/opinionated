(Rule) 404(b) and 414, a determination at the appellate level that the evidence was properly admitted under Rule 404(b) moots any issue regarding Rule 414; and, 3) questions by appellate defense counsel as to \u201cwhy\u201d trial defense counsel did or did not do certain things before and during the trial, without more, do not raise any cognizable issue regarding ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-24\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b980-25\">Tried by general court-martial, appellant was convicted, contrary to his pleas, of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>sensual oral sodomy, two instances of committing indecent acts, and conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman. Articles 125, 134, and 133, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7'\u00a7 925, 934, and 933. He was sentenced to a dismissal and confinement for 6 years, which the convening authority approved. Appellant submits 11 assignments of error, only one of which has merit, and only four of which merit extended discussion. We grant partial relief but otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">The charges appellant was convicted of arose from repeated instances of him molesting his son and daughter between 1976 and 1995. Due to the statute of limitations, however, he was charged only with those instances which occurred between September 20, 1990, and May 1995. <em>See </em>Article 43(b)(1), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b)(1). The first issue we consider is appellant\u2019s assertion that the military judge erred in not granting his motion to suppress the results of a search of his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">II. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">The military judge made extensive findings of fact on this issue. They are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0t\">First, on or about 24 April 1995, [JLH] and [DRH] were interviewed by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. They completed signed, sworn statements in which they alleged a long history of sexual abuse perpetuated upon them by the accused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-8\">The statement of [DRH] related the accused watched pornographic movies with him on Sunday mornings; made video tapes of [DRH] involved in sexual conduct with the accused; that [the accused] showed to [DRH] \u201cdirty magazines\u201d and showed him homemade video tapes of sexual conduct occurring between the accused and his wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-9\">In the statement of [DRH], he indicated that often this type of behavior occurred as a method used by the accused in initiating sexual acts with [DRH].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-10\">Second, after reviewing the statements and consulting with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations Detachment Superintendent, Special Agent [B] telephonieally contacted Lieutenant Colonel Nancy A. Slicner, an Investigative Psychologist assigned to AFOSI. She reviewed the case information and provided a memo indicating an opinion that the subject described was \u201csexually indiscriminate\u201d or [a] \u201ctry-sexual\u201d [meaning they will try anything plus everything sexual]. She further opined that there was an \u201cexceptional strong likelihood\u201d that such an individual would keep articles of past sexual exploitations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-12\">Three, Lieutenant Colonel Slicner told Special Agent [B] that, based on the information she had been provided, it was her opinion the accused was a \u201cclassic pedophile.\u201d Special Agent [B] then reviewed information from a treatise on pedophilia titled <em>The Sexual Exploitation of Children </em>by Seth Goldstein. That information included certain common characteristics of persons who, among other things, molest children. Those criteria include collecting sexually explicit materials and rarely, if ever, disposing of such materials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-13\">Fourth, Special Agent [B] took the statements of [JLH] and [DRH], the statement of Dr Nancy Slicner, and the information obtained from the Goldstein treatise to Detective [S] of Live Oak [Texas] Police Department. He briefed Officer [S] on the investigation and allowed her to review and inspect the information he had regarding the case. Agent [B] prepared an affidavit for search warrant and Officer [S], accompanied by Agent [B], appeared before Judge R.N. Cate [a magistrate of Bexar County, Texas]. Officer [S] and Agent [B] were sworn by Judge Cate, related the information substantially as it is contained in [the affidavit]. It provided Judge Cate with the statements of [JLH] and [DRH], the statement from Lieutenant Colonel Slicner, and a summary of the information from the Goldstein treatise. Judge Cate took approximately one hour to review the information provided to him prior to him issuing the warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-14\">Five, none of the information provided to Judge Cate specifically told him the materials had last been seen by [JLH] and [DRH] in 1990 in a location other than the accused\u2019s residence in Live Oak, Texas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>Six, Judge Cate did have available for his review, the 24 April \u201995 sworn statements of the Henley children, which allege sexual abuse occurred in California, Arkansas, Germany, Abilene, Texas, and Warrens-burg, Missouri. Additionally, the statements clearly indicated the time frame of the alleged abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-4\">Seven, [JLH] indicated in her 24 April \u201995 statement that she presently resided in the premises which the affidavit requested permission to search.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-5\">Eight, on 25 April \u201995, the Live Oak Police Department did not have an open case involving the accused, nor was any case ever opened by the Live Oak Police Department on [the accused] arising from this investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-6\">Nine, the warrant obtained from Judge Cate was executed by Officer [S] with the assistance of the Live Oak Police Department and the [AFOSI] and resulted in the seizure of [over 1000 video tapes; video recording equipment, including a camcorder camera; and, numerous sexually explicit magazines, some of which depicted nude children and homosexual acts, were seized].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">After making the above findings, the military judge ruled that Judge Cate had a substantial basis for finding probable cause to search and denied the motion to suppress. We find no error in the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">A. Probable Cause to Search</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">A military judge\u2019s ruling on the admission or exclusion of evidence, including rulings on motions to suppress, are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ayala, </em>43 M.J. 296 (1995); <em>United States v. Agosto, </em>43 M.J. 745, 748 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App. 1995). As search issues generally are mixed questions of fact and law, we review a military judge\u2019s findings of fact under a clearly erroneous standard, and we review the military judge\u2019s conclusions of law under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review. A military judge abuses his or her discretion on a motion to suppress only if the factual findings are clearly erroneous or the law is applied erroneously. <em>Ayala, </em>43 M.J. at 298; <em>United States v. Burris, </em>21 M.J. 140, 144 (C.M.A.1985). Finding the military judge\u2019s findings in full accord with the evidence of record, we adopt them as our own. Article 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-12\">Both at trial and before this Court, appellant\u2019s primary assertion is that the information on which the magistrate relied was too stale to constitute the probable cause necessary to support issuance of the warrant. In support of this position, appellant argues the fact that DRH\u2019s and JLH\u2019s statements omitted the fact that they last saw the referenced sexually explicit video tapes and other materials in 1990 in a location other than appellant\u2019s Live Oak, Texas, residence. Further, appellant avers Dr. Slicner\u2019s \u201cprofile\u201d of appellant was insufficient to fill this gap. Although appellant is relying, in part, on information which was not included in SA B\u2019s and Detective S\u2019 affidavit, trial defense counsel specifically stated that he was not asserting misrepresentation or a reckless disregard for the truth by SA B and Detective S. Therefore, that issue is not before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-13\">Probable cause exists when there is sufficient information to provide the authorizing official a reasonable belief that the person, property, or evidence sought is located in the place or on the person to be searched. Mil.R.Evid. 315(f)(2); <em>United States v. Mix, </em>35 M.J. 283 (C.M.A.1992). Whether probable cause exists for a magistrate to issue a search warrant is determined by the totality of the circumstances presented to the magistrate. <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 233, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). In <em>Gates, </em>the Court emphasized the fact that the law does not demand that a magistrate make technical legal determinations when deciding whether to issue a warrant. Instead, only a practical, common sense assessment is required, because the central question is whether there is probable cause, not whether there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 231, 103 S.Ct. 2317 and cases cited therein. Searches authorized by magistrates are preferable to searches conducted under other bases. Consequently, a magistrate\u2019s determination that probable cause existed is entitled to great deference. <em>See United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 914, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984); <em>United States v. Hester, </em>47 M.J. 461, 466 (1998) (Gierke, J., concurring in part and in the result); <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>35 M.J. 35, 49-50 (C.M.A.1992) (Wiss, J., concurring in the result). In light of this deference, this Court\u2019s <em>de novo </em>review is confined to whether the military judge was correct in ruling that Judge Cate had a substantial basis for finding probable cause existed to search appellant\u2019s residence. <em>United States v. Figueroa, </em>35 M.J. 54, 56 (C.M.A.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Timeliness of the information relied on is a vital part of the probable cause decision matrix. <em>Lopez, </em>35 M.J. at 38. As stated, <em>ante, </em>appellant\u2019s primary complaints are: the information presented by DRH and JLH was too stale for the magistrate to rely on, and the magistrate improperly relied on Dr. Slicner\u2019s opinion and the information provided from Goldstein\u2019s treatise to overcome the alleged staleness of the information provided. However, although sufficient time may have elapsed in a given situation whereby the most reasonable inference is that the contraband or evidence is no longer at the place to be searched, the lapse of a substantial period of time, standing alone, between the event or events relied on and the search is not determinative. <em>Id. </em>The factors a magistrate, or other authorizing official, must consider are: the location to be searched; the type of crime being investigated; the nature of the article or articles to be seized; how long the criminal activity has been continuing; and, the relationship, if any, of all these items to each other. <em>Id. </em>at 38-39 and cases cited therein; <em>accord United States v. Lacy, </em>119 F.3d 742, 745 (9th Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 118 S.Ct. 1571, 140 L.Ed.2d 804 (1998); <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>2 F.3d 1318 (3d Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Peden, </em>891 F.2d 514, 518-519 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">As regards Judge Cate\u2019s consideration of Dr. Slicner\u2019s memorandum and the information from Goldstein\u2019s treatise, neither appellate government nor civilian appellate defense counsel have invited our attention to military precedent addressing the use of expert, or other informed, opinions by a magistrate. This need not detain us, however, for \u2014 as appellate government counsel\u2019s brief reflects, the federal circuit courts of appeals have considered the issue and found no impropriety in a magistrate relying, in part, on opinion evidence. <em>See Lacy, </em>119 F.3d at 745; <em>Harvey, </em>2 F.3d at 1320; <em>Peden, </em>891 F.2d at 518. We discern no reason to reject their reasoning as it may apply to search issues before trials by courts-martial.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">The general operative concept is that, as long as there is an underlying factual basis for any opinion tendered by the requesting investigator, the magistrate (or other authorizing official) may use it as part of his/her probable cause determination. In the instant case, this means that there must have been some evidence in either the affidavit or other information submitted to Judge Cate which demonstrated appellant is a pedophile, and that pedophiles are unlikely to dispose of certain possessions. <em>Lacy, </em>119 F.3d at 746 n. 6; <em>Harvey, </em>2 F.3d at 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-11\">Dr. Sliener reviewed DRH\u2019s and JLH\u2019s statements, thereby providing her a factual basis for her assessment and opinion. Similarly, SA B and Detective S consulted Gold-stein after obtaining and reading DRH\u2019s and JLH\u2019s statements. Further, Judge Cate thoroughly reviewed the sworn statements of DRH and JLH. DRH\u2019s statement contained the sordid details of appellant\u2019s constant molestation of him during the prior 14 years, and JLH\u2019s statement recounted appellant\u2019s sexual abuse of her. With this factual basis, it was entirely permissible for Judge Cate to entertain Dr. Slicner\u2019s professional opinion and the excerpts from Goldstein\u2019s treatise, to conclude that, appellant probably is a pedophile, and that he probably still possessed the video tapes, sexually explicit magazines, and the sexual implements DRH referenced in his statement. <em>Lacy, </em>119 F.3d at 745 (with evidence that defendant is a pedophile, customs agent could rely on his training and experience to opine to magistrate that defendant still possessed child pornography 10 months later); <em>Peden, </em>891 F.2d at 519 (with evidence that defendant is a pedophile, agent could opine to magistrate that such persons are unlikely to dispose of materials sought); <em>accord United States v. Koelling, </em>992 F.2d 817, 819-20 (8th Cir.1993). This was not an instance of a magistrate relying on a \u201cpolice<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>man\u2019s hunch\u201d to issue a search warrant, which hornbook search and seizure law teaches is insufficient. <em>See United States v. Sam, </em>46 C.M.R. 124, 129, 1973 WL 14462 (C.M.A.1973). Instead, there was a credible factual foundation underlying the opinions rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">In light of the underlying factual basis present in the instant case, we eschew the parties\u2019 use of the term \u201cprofile\u201d as it related to appellant and Judge Cate\u2019s determination. Accordingly, we hold that, when a magistrate or other official is presented sufficient information, via affidavit or orally by the requesting investigator, to factually connect the suspect with the criminal activity or evidence in question, there is no impropriety in the magistrate considering the informed, relevant opinion of either the investigator or other person or expert when determining whether probable cause exists to issue a search warrant or authorization. When an investigator renders an opinion, the investigator must inform the magistrate of the basis of the investigator\u2019s qualification to render the opinion (training, experience, etc.). <em>See Lacy, </em>119 F.3d at 745. Obviously, if an expert\u2019s opinion is presented to a magistrate, it must be demonstrated that the expert is familiar with the underlying information which connects the suspect with the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">Given these factors, Judge Cate clearly had a substantial basis for determining that appellant probably still possessed the items referenced in DJH\u2019s statement. Therefore, this assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">B. Evidence of Other Wrongs or Acts</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">As stated in Part I, <em>ante, </em>the military judge admitted, over trial defense counsel\u2019s objection, evidence of appellant\u2019s acts of molestation of DRH and JLH which fell outside the statute of limitations. The prosecution proffered the evidence under both Rules 404(b) and 414, and the military judge entered findings and conducted the Rule 403 balancing test before admitting the evidence under both rules. As a result, civilian appellate defense counsel has submitted three assignments of error which attack the propriety of admitting the evidence under Rule 414, including an averment that Rule 414 is unconstitutional. Civilian appellate defense counsel\u2019s brief is silent on the propriety of admitting the evidence under Rule 404(b). In light of the basis for the military judge\u2019s rulings at trial, we need not address counsel\u2019s assertions regarding Rule 414 to conclude the evidence was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">Frequently, appellate courts must apply a hierarchy of sources of law to resolve various issues. The most frequent hierarchy referenced is: the Constitution of the United States; federal statutes, including the UCMJ; executive orders, including the Manual for Courts-Martial and Military Rules of Evidence; <em>et al. See Lopez, </em>35 M.J. at 39. The primary rule of application is that the highest source of authority is paramount unless a lower source accords greater rights or protection for the individual or accused. <em>Id.; accord United States v. Davis, </em>47 M.J. 484 (1998). This principle also applies when applying a particular source; in the instant ease, the Military Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">Without going into substantial detail, suffice it to say that Rule 414 was promulgated specifically to allow the admission of evidence of prior instances of child molestation by an accused. The provisions of Rule 414, and its limited legislative history, reflect that Congress intended for Rule 414 to have a broader reach than Rule 404(b). <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>48 M.J. 700 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App.1998); <em>Id. </em>at 724 (Snyder, S.J., concurring in part and in the result). One of the consequences of this fact is that the relevancy threshold for Rule 414 is lower than that for the other rules, and the balancing test of Rule 403 is less restrictive for evidence admitted under Rule 414 than for evidence submitted under Rule 404(b). <em>Id. </em>at 716; <em>see also, e.g., United States v. LeCompte, </em>131 F.3d 767, 769 (8th Cir.1997). Therefore, if the evidence in question was properly admitted under Rule 404(b), any question of admissibility under Rule 414 is rendered moot. We now consider the military judge\u2019s ruling that the evidence was admissible under Rule 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>Our standard of review for this issue is abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Acton, </em>38 M.J. 330 (C.M.A.1993); <em>United States v. Mukes, </em>18 M.J. 358 (C.M.A.1984). Rule 404(b) provides, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-5\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">There now is a well established three-part test for determining admissibility, which is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-7\">1. Does the evidence reasonably support a finding by the court members that appellant committed prior crimes, wrongs, or acts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-8\">2. What \u201cfact ... of consequence\u201d is made \u201cmore\u201d or \u201cless probable\u201d by the existence of this evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-9\">3. Is the \u201cprobative value ... substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-10\"><em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>29 M.J. 105, 109 (C.M.A.1989) (citations omitted). The first part of this test presents a very low threshold. Simply, the military judge has only to find that the members <em>could </em>reasonably find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that appellant committed the crimes in question. Mil.R.Evid. 104(b); <em>Acton, </em>38 M.J. at 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">This prong was more than satisfied by the testimony of both DRH and JLH, and the testimony of SA B describing appellant\u2019s oral admissions. The second part of the test addresses relevance. <em>See </em>Rules 401 and 402. Appellant was charged with the forcible sodomy of DRH via the constructive force of parental coercion which cancelled DRH\u2019s ability to resist appellant\u2019s actions. The prosecution informed the military judge that the evidence was offered to prove that appellant had conditioned DRH over the years to submit to his sexual demands and that DRH had come to believe it would be useless to resist appellant. <em>See United States v. Palmer, </em>33 M.J. 7 (C.M.A.1991). Further, after additional developments during the trial, the prosecution also asserted, and the military judge concurred, that the evidence was admissible to prove appellant\u2019s \u201cidentity\u201d as the perpetrator of the indecent acts charged in the specifications involving JLH. She testified she was playing a computer game when she felt a penis rub across the back of her neck. Although she did not turn around when it occurred, she believed it was appellant because of his prior acts of abuse of her, and she ignored the act so appellant would go away. During cross-examination of JLH, trial defense counsel suggested the prospect that it was DRH, not the appellant, who touched the back of her neck with his penis, as well as being the one who stood next to her bed in her darkened bedroom and masturbated.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-13\">First, we observe that the evidence clearly was offered for a purpose other than to show appellant\u2019s propensity to commit the offenses charged. This Court previously has held that similar crimes which fall outside the statute of limitations may be admitted on the issue of consent where parental coercion is in issue. <em>United States v. Hansen, </em>36 M.J. 599, 603-4 (A.F.C.M.R.1992). Moreover, given the defense\u2019s theory of mistaken identity, appellant\u2019s crimes outside the statute of limitations plainly were probative on that issue as well as the issue of consent, and satisfied the second part of the <em>Reynolds </em>test. <em>Acton, </em>38 M.J. at 333. The final question is whether the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighed whatever probative value the evidence had, which is the balancing test of Rule 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-14\">Even evidence otherwise admissible must be excluded if its potential for unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value of the evidence. Mil.R.Evid. 403; <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>29 M.J. 145, 151 (C.M.A.1989). The military judge performed this test as required and found the probative value was not outweighed by the potential for unfair prejudice. While the military judge did not detail the factors of her balancing test, we do not consider that fatal in light of the significant probative value of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-15\">Therefore, we conclude the military judge did not abuse her considerable discretion in admitting the evidence. Even if she commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>ted error by doing so, it was harmless. <em>See </em>Article 59(a), UCMJ. The military judge provided the members a limiting instruction on the proper use of the evidence. It is evident from the findings that the members followed the instructions and confined the evidence to its proper role. Appellant was found not guilty of forcible sodomy, two of the indecent acts with DRH, and the charged act of rubbing his penis across the back of JLH\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">In light of the evidence being properly admitted under Rule 404(b), we need not address the Rule 414 issues asserted by civilian appellate defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">IV. Factual Sufficiency</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">Appellant asserts that the evidence is factually insufficient to support the findings of guilty. We disagree. To find a conviction factually sufficient, we must determine that, after weighing the evidence in the record of trial and making allowances for not having personally observed the witnesses, we are convinced of the accused\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>25 M.J. 324 (C.M.A.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">To support this averment, appellant refers to DRH\u2019s and JLH\u2019s admitted prior inconsistent statements and their inability to provide firm dates for the instances of appellant\u2019s abuse of them. Considering the lengthy time period involved, like the members, we do not find this factor remarkable. Further, there is the matter of appellant\u2019s admissions, especially the one made in the presence of his supervisor, Lieutenant Colonel (Lt Col) L, when he escorted appellant to his home to retrieve personal items before departing for a mental examination. Lt Col L testified that, before departing his home, appellant told his wife that she would be hearing some bad things about him and they were true. Contrary to his approach on the admissions appellant made to SA B, trial defense counsel did not suggest that the admission in Lt Col L\u2019s presence related to the acts outside the statute of limitations. Instead, he relied on Mrs. H\u2019s testimony that appellant said no more than she would hear some bad things and for her to go to her parents\u2019 home in Fort Worth. We find SA B, Lt Col L, DRH, and JLH, more credible. We too are convinced, beyond reasonable doubt, of appellant\u2019s guilt. Article 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">V. <em>Ex Post Facto</em></p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">Appellate government counsel properly concede that the amendment of Article 57(a), UCMJ, and the enactment of Article 58b, UCMJ, as applied to appellant, violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause of the Constitution. <em>United States v. Gorski, </em>47 M.J. 370 (1997). We will direct corrective action in our decre-tal.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">VI. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b986-12\">Civilian appellate defense counsel avers that appellant \u201carguably did not receive effective assistance of counsel,\u201d and requests a post-trial fact-finding hearing. <em>See United States v. DuBay, </em>37 C.M.R. 411, 1967 WL 4276 (C.M.A.1967). Whether counsel\u2019s performance is ineffective is measured by the Supreme Court\u2019s standards promulgated in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and its ever growing progeny. The first and foremost teaching of <em>Strickland </em>is that counsel\u2019s competency is presumed, and appellant has the substantial burden of rebutting that presumption. When testing for whether an appellant has carried this burden, this Court resolves three basic questions, which are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU_\">(1) are appellant\u2019s allegations true and, if so, is there a reasonable explanation for counsel\u2019s actions in the defense of the case? (2) If true, did the level of advocacy fall measurably below the performance ordinarily expected of fallible lawyers? and (3) If ineffective assistance of counsel is found to exist, is there a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt regarding guilt?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-13\"><em>United States v. Polk, </em>32 M.J. 150, 153 (C.M.A.1991); <em>accord United States v. Lonetree, 35 </em>M.J. 396, 412-13 (C.M.A.1992); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>24 M.J. 186, 188 (C.M.A.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-14\">In the instant case, neither appellant nor his civilian appellate defense counsel assert any specific failing, shortcoming, or misrepresentation by trial defense counsel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>Nonetheless, civilian appellate defense counsel requests a post-trial hearing to answer a series of questions which strike this Court as musings rather than specific assertions of deficient performance. As this and our superior Court have held previously, trial defense counsel\u2019s tactics will not be second-guessed on appeal. <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>37 M.J. 407 (C.M.A.1993); <em>United States v. Stephenson, </em>33 M.J. 79 (C.M.A.1991); <em>United States v. Rivas, </em>3 M.J. 282, 289 (C.M.A.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Based on appellant\u2019s offerings, we hold that appellant has not even keyed the <em>Polk </em>test. Questions such as: why wasn\u2019t Lt Col M challenged peremptorily?; Why didn\u2019t trial defense counsel \u201cpush the government to start appellant\u2019s trial before the effective date of [Mil.R.Evid. 414]?\u201d; and, why weren\u2019t photographs taken of the \u201cglove box in the van?,\u201d strike this Court as no more than an indication of how appellate defense counsel, with the not insubstantial advantage of hindsight, may have tried the case. Questions such as those set forth do not raise any factual issue for a post-trial hearing to address, <em>see United States v. Ginn, </em>47 M.J. 236 (1997), being as they address the realm of tactical decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">Therefore, in the absence of a colorable claim of inadequate preparation by trial defense counsel or appellant\u2019s non-acquiescence in trial defense counsel\u2019s tactics, the issue of ineffectiveness simply is not raised. <em>See United States v. Duffey, </em>37 M.J. 511, 516 (A.F.C.M.R.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">VII. Sentence Severity</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">Appellant asserts that his sentence is inappropriately severe. We disagree. This Court\u2019s statutory mandate directs that we approve only so much of a sentence as found to be correct and appropriate. Article 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866(c). Performance of this function, however, does not entail granting clemency. <em>United States v. Healy, </em>26 M.J. 394, 395-96 (C.M.A.1988). The primary manner of discharging this Court\u2019s statutory duty on sentence is to give individualized consideration to appellant, including the nature and seriousness of the offenses and the character of appellant\u2019s service. <em>United States v. Snelling, </em>14 M.J. 267 (C.M.A.1982). Applying these factors, we do not find appellant\u2019s sentence to be inappropriately severe. Further, the record convinces us that the members sentenced appellant solely for the offenses of which he was convicted. Article 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-10\">VIII. Other Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b987-11\">The military judge did not abuse her discretion in denying the challenge for cause of Lt Col M. The record amply supports the military judge\u2019s determination of Lt Col M\u2019s credibility based on his demeanor and responses. Further, we conclude that a reasonable person hearing Lt Col M\u2019s responses would not have a perception of unfairness as a result of his sitting as a court member. <em>See United States v. Youngblood, </em>47 M.J. 338 (1997) and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-12\">We agree with appellate government counsel that appellant waived any issue with respect to his confession. Trial defense counsel did not interpose any objection to appellant\u2019s confession, his attack on the legality of the search of appellant\u2019s residence notwithstanding. Mil.R.Evid. 103(a)(1). Further, our review of the record discloses no plain error. It is especially noteworthy that SA B, not appellant, terminated his only interview of appellant due to the lateness of the hour. Therefore, appellant forfeited any issue regarding his confession. Mil.R.Evid. 103(d); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Fisher, </em>21 M.J. 327, 328-9 (C.M.A.1986); <em>see also United States v. Tarleton, </em>47 M.J. 170, 172 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-13\">Appellant also asserts for the first time that the military judge erred when instructing the members on the conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman offense. This offense was based on the inadvertent discovery of numerous photographs and magazines at appellant\u2019s work station in his desk. Most of the photographs were of partially clad sunbathers. Some, however, were photographs of male genitalia, including one of appellant, and female genitalia. The magazines depicted nude children, apparently at a nudist colony. Trial defense counsel requested an expansion of the instruction, which was refused, but did not interpose any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>objection to the instruction given. Our review discloses no error. In view of the nature of the photographs and magazines, and the fact they were inadvertently discovered in appellant\u2019s government desk, the instructions were entirely proper. <em>See United States v. Shober, </em>26 M.J. 501 (A.F.C.M.R.1986). Further, the instruction contained every point trial defense counsel desired covered. This assertion is without merit. Rules For Courts-Martial 905(e), 920(f), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.); <em>see also United States v. Maxwell, </em>45 M.J. 406 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">IX. Decretal</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">The automatic collection of forfeitures not included in the sentence of the court-martial pursuant to Article 58b, UCMJ, are declared to be without legal effect. Any such forfeitures already collected from appellant will be restored at the appropriate pay grade. The record of trial is returned to The Judge Advocate General for appropriate action. The case need not be returned to this Court following administrative correction unless further appellate review is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">Accordingly, the findings and sentence are correct in law and fact, and are hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">Senior Judge YOUNG and Judge SENANDER concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
