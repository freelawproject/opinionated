Appellant\u2019s approved sentence is a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for 30 months, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to E-l. Appellant challenges the court member selection process and exclusion of impeachment and exculpatory evidence he offered at trial. We find merit in each assignment of error and set aside the findings and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-22\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b852-23\">Appellant had been on active duty only 16 months when he pulled a gun on Kentara Heywood and fired it several times during an off-base altercation. Appellant and Heywood first met about one week before the incident as appellant was leaving the base gym. Heywood, who was driving by the gym, didn\u2019t like the way appellant looked at him and called appellant a \u201cbitch ass nigger.\u201d Hey<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>wood then drove around the gym and pulled alongside appellant again. The two exchanged words and parted. Heywood admitted at trial that appellant was minding his own business at the time and did not start the confrontation. Heywood also admitted that he was the only one who used \u201cfighting words.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">A few days later, appellant was driving through town with two friends when Heywood drove by. Both stopped their ears. Appellant and his friends got out and walked over to Heywood\u2019s car. Appellant was holding a bat. Appellant and Heywood argued through the passenger window, then Heywood drove off. The next day, Heywood drove onto base to deliver a pizza. When Heywood pulled into a dormitory parking lot, he recognized appellant\u2019s voice coming from one of the rooms and began to honk his horn until appellant came out. Heywood yelled at appellant that he wanted to fight him for \u201cpulling a bat on him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Appellant and several friends walked down to the parking lot. As appellant and his friends entered the parking lot, Heywood drove his car toward appellant. Appellant jumped out of the way, then began throwing rocks at Heywood\u2019s car. Heywood yelled \u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you, you punk ass nigger, I\u2019m from New York and we don\u2019t play that shit\u201d and left. Heywood returned to base later that night and ended up in a fight with appellant\u2019s roommate that resulted in Heywood hitting <em>the </em>roommate with a brick.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">The next night, appellant went downtown with another airman. The airman, who was driving, had a loaded pistol between the front seats. The airman testified that he carried the gun for safety and had no idea appellant would join him when he took the gun out of the base armory. Driving through town, they passed Heywood, who yelled out of his car \u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you.\u201d The airman and appellant pulled into a parking lot with Heywood following a few moments later. Appellant grabbed the pistol, tucked it under his waistband behind his back, and started walking toward Heywood. Heywood climbed out of his car and walked quickly toward appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">According to the four defense eyewitnesses, Heywood was holding one hand under his shirt as he approached appellant, leading each to conclude he had a weapon. At least one witness speculated it was a gun. According to Heywood and the prosecution\u2019s one eyewitness, Marc Martinez, Heywood had both hands up as if asking for a fight. When Heywood and appellant were within 5 to 8 feet of each other, appellant pulled the gun from behind his back, said \u201cI\u2019m tired of your shit,\u201d and fired 5 shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">Heywood ducked as appellant fired. According to the four defense eyewitnesses, appellant was aiming the gun up in the air at an angle. According to Heywood and Martinez, the gun was aimed straight at Heywood. Heywood was not hit nor, apparently, was anything else in the vicinity. A police detective testified that he checked the parking lot and surrounding area for bullets or marks, including the building at the end of the parking lot in the line of fire, and saw no bullets or marks. The detective also testified that, several days after the shooting, Martinez told him that appellant was holding the gun over his head when he fired it.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">After the shots were fired, appellant walked back to the car and tossed the gun inside. Heywood ran to his car, grabbed a bat, and came back swinging at appellant, hitting him once or twice in the arm. A brawl broke out among the onlookers, which quelled when the police arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">I. COURT MEMBER SELECTION</p>\n<p id=\"A40\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">At trial, appellant argued that the court member selection process deliberately and systematically excluded enlisted members below the grade of master sergeant (E-7).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">The crux of the motion concerned a memorandum that Colonel Koerner, the special court-martial convening authority (SPCMCA), issued entitled \u201cNomination of and Service as Courb-Martial Members.\u201d The memorandum begins by explaining that a disciplined force is the ultimate key to combat readiness. It goes on to emphasize confidence in the judicial system and fairness to the accused in selecting the best officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>and non-commissioned officers (NCOs) as court members. The memorandum then states that \u201cindividuals selected for court-martial service should understand that they are personally selected for this important duty by either [the general court-martial convening authority] or myself,\u201d that officers and NCOs \u201chave a responsibility to ensure a disciplined force,\u201d and \u201cI expect those selected for this important duty to fulfill their responsibility.\u201d Finally, the memorandum specifies that group commanders will nominate officers in all grades and NCOs in the grade of master sergeant or above for service as court-members.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">The commanders nominated approximately 30 enlisted members to the SPCMCA before trial. Of the 30 names, 3 were senior master sergeants (E-8s), 26 were master sergeants (E-7s), and 1 was a technical sergeant (E-6). Although appellant requested the appointment of enlisted members several weeks before trial, apparently none of the 30 were available. Consequently, the staff judge advocate\u2019s (SJA\u2019s) military justice section began contacting persons on the installation alpha roster (an alphabetic list of 4500 names) and first sergeants. When they had four master sergeants and four senior master sergeants, they sent the list to Colonel Koer-ner. The acting SJA reminded the SPCMCA of the member selection requirements of Uniform Code of Military Justice Article 25 and the fact that he could go outside the list of eight nominees if he chose. Colonel Koerner approved the list and forwarded it to the general court-martial convening authority (GCMCA), who selected four senior master sergeants and one master sergeant.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Colonel Koerner testified on the motion. He stated that he was familiar with Article 25 criteria, that Cannon AFB had a large population of master sergeants and senior master sergeants, and that he knew master sergeants and senior master sergeants would meet the requirements of Article 25 in most cases. The purpose of the memorandum, he said, was not to \u201cdisallow any capability to take anybody of a, let\u2019s say, a staff sergeant [E-5] or tech sergeant [E-6].\u201d Colonel Koerner testified that his SJA\u2019s office prepared the memorandum. On cross-examination, he explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agm\">I felt like, and I still feel like, in most cases, again, it\u2019s not excluded that I couldn\u2019t find a tech sergeant or staff sergeant that would meet the proper qualifications. But in general a master sergeant has been around long enough in the Air Force, has that additional education level, maturity level experienced with the Air Force. So, it is a general guideline, I guess you might say.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Colonel Koerner admitted that he had never appointed a staff or technical sergeant to sit on a court-martial panel. He was also not informed that his enlisted member picks for this case came from the SJA\u2019s resources, not the commanders\u2019 nominees.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">The military judge ruled that the defense failed to demonstrate institutional bias to achieve a particular result in the selection of court members or that any unlawful command influence occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">Court-martial panels are ordinarily composed of commissioned officers. Article 25(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 825(a). An enlisted accused may, however, request that the panel be composed of at least one-third enlisted members. Article 25(c)(1), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 825(c)(1). When detailing officer or enlisted members to a court-martial, the convening authority selects those best qualified for the duty by reason of age, education, training, experience, length of service, and judicial temperament (the Article 25 criteria). Article 25(d)(2), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 825(d)(2). Selection of court members on the basis of improper criteria threatens the integrity of the military justice system and violates the UCMJ. <em>See United States v. Daigle, </em>1 M.J. 139, 140 (C.M.A.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">In our superior court\u2019s most recent analysis of the issue at hand, it warned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alr\">Undoubtedly there is a close correlation between these criteria [Article 25(d)(2)] and the grade of a commissioned or non-commissioned officer. Indeed, because of that correlation, there is a danger that, in selecting court members, a convening authority may adopt the shortcut of simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>choosing by grade. In that event, the resulting blanket exclusion of qualified officers or enlisted members in the lower grades is at odds with congressional intent and cannot be sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-5\"><em>United States v. Nixon, </em>33 M.J. 433, 434 (C.M.A.1991). Appellant argues that Colonel Koerner ignored this warning when he limited nomination of enlisted members to master sergeants and above; thus, the selection of his court-martial panel violated congressional intent. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Exclusion of potential court members based on grade was first addressed in the landmark case of <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>35 C.M.R. 3, 1964 WL 4914 (C.M.A.1964). In <em>Crawford, </em>the court focused on the intent of the convening authority, holding that first looking to senior noncommissioned grades for prospective members was permissible as long as the convening authority did not intend to exclude any group on prohibited grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 12. <em>Compare United States v. Yager, </em>7 M.J. 171 (C.M.A.1979)(exclusion of E-2 and E-l members permissible based on demonstrable relationship to Article 25(d)(2) criteria) <em>and United States v. Nixon, </em>33 M.J. 433 (selection of only the two most senior enlisted grades upheld based on explicit testimony of convening authority that he complied with statutory criteria and appointed junior grades to other court panels).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">When circumstances surrounding the selection process create an appearance of systematic exclusion of qualified persons, however, doubts will be resolved in the accused\u2019s favor. <em>See United States v. Greene, </em>43 C.M.R. 72, 1970 WL 7433 (C.M.A.1970)(selection of only colonel and lieutenant colonel members gave rise to the appearance that members had been \u201chand picked\u201d by the government), <em>United States v. Daigle, </em>1 M.J. 139 (selection process under which commanders asked to nominate only captains and above impermissibly used rank as a device for systematic exclusion of qualified persons), <em>and United States v. McClain, </em>22 M.J. 124 (C.M.A.1986)(coneern raised by nomination of only,E-4s and above and selection of only E-7s and above, coupled with SJA intent to eliminate lenient sentences, resolved in appellant\u2019s favor).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">In <em>Crawford, </em>our superior court took judicial notice \u201cthat many enlisted persons below the senior noncommissioned ranks are literate, mature in years, and sufficiently judicious in temperament to be eligible to serve on courts-martial.\u201d 35 C.M.R. at 12. We go one step further in taking judicial notice that, in the Air Force; the majority of E-4s have served 5 or more years on active duty, the majority of E-5s have served 10 or more years on active duty, and the majority of E-6s have served 15 or more years on active duty. Air Force Personnel Center, Military Years of Service by Grade (released April 2, 1998) &lt;http://www.afpe.af.mil$. Likewise, we take judicial notice that 88 percent of E-4s have some amount of post-secondary education, 18 percent of E-5s have an associate\u2019s or higher degree, and 33 percent of E-6s have an associate\u2019s or higher degree. <em>Id. </em>at Highest Education Level by Grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">Appellant argues that the impropriety in this case took shape at the court member nomination level. Although Colonel Koerner\u2019s memorandum to subordinate commanders resulted in 29 E-7 or above nominations out of 30, the nominations did not factor since the members proposed for selection in this case were hand-picked by the SJA\u2019s office. However, Colonel Koerner\u2019s E-7 and above mandate was even more effective with his legal staff, who had drafted the policy in the first place and picked only master sergeants and above to serve on appellant\u2019s court-martial. At trial, the government offered no explanation for the E-7 and above picks from the entire pool of eligible alpha roster candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">Even if we accept at face value Colonel Koerner\u2019s assertion that he does not <em>per se </em>exclude E-5s and E-6s from service as court members, the practical effect of his policy is that no one below E-7 is selected for court-martial duty at Cannon AFB. Furthermore, we are troubled that the grade E-5 appears to be Colonel Koerner\u2019s bottom-line for even considering a potential court member. Even under <em>Yager, </em>our superior court only went so far as to permit exclusion of members in grades E-l and E-2 on the basis of grade. 7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>M.J. 171. At Cannon AFB, the reality of the member selection process is that E-3s to E-6s are excluded on only one basis \u2014 grade\u2014 and that is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">We conclude that the government has failed to demonstrate by clear and positive evidence that no impropriety occurred in the member selection process; thus, we set aside the findings and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Our holding is based on three rules. First, while a convening authority may look first to senior grades, grade alone cannot be used as a shortcut in the application of Article 25(d)(2) criteria. <em>Daigle, </em>1 M.J. at 141; <em>Nixon, </em>33 M.J. at 434. Second, the convening authority may not systematically exclude any grade above E-2 in the selection of court members. <em>Yager, </em>7 M.J. at 173. Third, the burden of demonstrating systematic exclusion of qualified persons is on the defense; merely showing a disproportionate selection of higher ranks will not be sufficient. <em>See United States v. Townsend, </em>12 M.J. 861, 862 (A.F.C.M.R.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Finally, we note that appellant does not raise any issue of unlawful command influence based on the tone of Colonel Koerner\u2019s letter asking subordinate commanders to nominate court members. We remind commanders and their SJAs that using phrases like \u201censure a disciplined force\u201d when asking for court member nominees sounds a lot like \u201cpick hardliners,\u201d which would raise unlawful command influence concerns. <em>See United States v. Lewis, </em>46 M.J. 338, 339 (1997)(\u201ceourt stacking\u201d condemned).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">II. EXCULPATORY STATEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"A37\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">Three months after the shooting, appellant met Airman Basic (AB) D, a female airman who had just arrived on Cannon AFB for her first assignment. Appellant told her that he was in trouble with the law because of a shooting downtown. He eiqfiained that he told the authorities that he fired in self-defense because he thought the \u201cother guy\u201d had a gun, but he actually just \u201cwanted to bust a cap in [the other guy\u2019s] ass.\u201d Several days later, appellant told her that he was just kidding about the \u201cbust a cap\u201d comment and actually did shoot in self-defense because the \u201cother guy\u201d had a gun. About one month later, AB D reported appellant\u2019s initial statement to criminal investigators.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">At trial, AB D admitted that, when she went to investigators, she was angry with appellant for telling people they had sexual relations. She said that the other reason she reported appellant was that he had asked her if she could \u201cpad\u201d his paycheck since she worked in finance. She admitted, however, that appellant spoke in a joking tone when he talked about her padding his paycheck.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">The prosecutor moved <em>in limine </em>to prevent defense counsel from asking AB D about appellant\u2019s subsequent statement that he had only been joking about \u201cbust[ing] a cap.\u201d Defense counsel opposed this motion on the basis of \u201ccompleteness,\u201d citing Military Rule of Evidence (Mil.R.Evid.) 304(h)(2). The military judge granted the motion under Mil.R.Evid. 802, Hearsay Rule, prohibiting defense counsel from cross-examining AB D about the \u201cjust kidding\u201d conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b856-14\">The standard of review on issues concerning admissibility of evidence is whether the military judge abused her discretion. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>46 M.J. 8 (1997). If the prosecution introduces only part of an incriminating statement against an accused, the defense may introduce remaining portions of the statement under the evidentiary rule of \u201ccompleteness.\u201d Mil.R.Evid. 304(h)(2). The policy behind Mil.R.Evid. 304(h)(2) is analogous to that of Mil.R. Evid. 106; namely, to present statements that ought in fairness be considered contemporaneously with the statement introduced. <em>See United States v. Morgan, </em>15 M.J. 128, n. 5 (C.M.A.1983). The common law rule of completeness was designed to prevent one side from misleading the trier of fact. <em>Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Rainey, </em>488 U.S. 153, 109 S. Ct. 439, 102 L.Ed.2d 445 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-17\">This assignment of error asks us to determine how much time can pass between telling a \u201cjoke\u201d and being stuck with it. Read literally, Mil.R.Evid. 304(h)(2) can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>interpreted to only permit introduction of words uttered in the same breath as an inculpatory statement. We hold that such a narrow interpretation of the rule does not promote the policy of fairness it is based on.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">We see no reason why the admissibility of a \u201cjust kidding\u201d should turn on whether appellant said it three seconds or three days after his original comment. In either case, it gives context to and <em>completes </em>the statement. Given the fact that AB D did not go to the authorities until one month later, it is hard to imagine why appellant\u2019s motives to say \u201cjust kidding\u201d would have changed significantly over a three-day period. Even if a good argument can be made that his motives did change during that period, the argument goes to the weight of the statement rather than its admissibility. <em>Cf. United States v. King, 461 F.2d 152, 154 </em>(D.C.Cir.1972)(timing is a matter which normally goes to the weight of evidence, not its admissibility). The passage of three days does not, in this case, change whether fairness dictates the statement be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Moreover, had the members known appellant told AB D that he was kidding, it could have led to a different conclusion on the central issue of appellant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the shooting. If the members believed that appellant \u201cjust wanted to bust a cap in [Heywood\u2019s] ass,\u201d his case was dead in the water. We note, in this regard, that the prosecutor ended his closing argument with this quote and, during his rebuttal argument, emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-7\">As for all of this stuff about, you know, whether there were other comments made during the conversation? Remember what [AB D] said it came down to? It finally came down to, she said it went back and forth for a while, well, \u201cwhat were you troubled about,\u201d well, this, that, and, kind of, it was \u2014 eventually\u2014drawn out conversation \u2014 and what it came down to was, \u201cWell I told them I fired in self-defense, but\u201d and you know the end of that sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">This argument leaves the incorrect impression that appellant\u2019s last words to AB D concerning Heywood were \u201cI just wanted to bust a cap in his ass.\u201d Without any reason to question whether appellant was serious when he made the comment, the members lacked context to weigh it in. This is evinced by their apparent willingness to believe appellant was the world\u2019s worst shot at 5 to 8 feet. We find the government\u2019s remoteness concern outweighed by the risk of the members being misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">Finally, we take issue with the military judge\u2019s ruling that appellant\u2019s \u201cjust kidding\u201d statement was inadmissible hearsay. We agree that hearsay statements are generally inadmissible. Mil.R.Evid. 802. However, a statement that demonstrates the accused\u2019s then-existing state of mind is not excluded by the hearsay rule. Mil.R.Evid. 803(3), Then Existing Mental, Emotional, or Physical Condition. Moreover, arguments that an accused\u2019s exculpatory state-of-mind comments are merely self-serving are better left to the argument of counsel than used to exclude evidence. <em>See </em>Saltzburg, Schinasi &amp; Sehlueter, <em>Military Rules of Evidence Manual, </em>p. 946-47 (4th ed 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">At trial, defense counsel argued that appellant\u2019s \u201cjust kidding\u201d statement was admissible under Mil.R.Evid. 803(3) and the holding in <em>United States v. Elliott, </em>23 M.J. 1 (C.M.A.1986). In <em>Elliott, </em>trial defense counsel sought to prove innocent possession of a stolen television by offering the accused\u2019s statement to a friend that a third person gave him the television. The trial judge refused to admit the statement, ruling it was inadmissible hearsay. On appeal, the Court ruled the statement was admissible to show the accused had an innocent state of mind while still in possession of the television. <em>Id. </em>at 8. Applying this analysis to the case at hand, appellant\u2019s \u201cjust kidding\u201d statement was admissible under Mil.R.Evid. 803(3) to demonstrate his then-existing \u201ckidding\u201d state of mind concerning his \u201cbust a cap\u201d quip.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">We conclude that preventing the trial defense team from cross-examining AB D on appellant\u2019s \u201cjust kidding\u201d statement was error, and that this error was prejudicial to appellant\u2019s efforts to demonstrate he was acting in self-defense. This error forms the second basis on which we set aside the findings and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>III. IMPEACHMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">One month after the shooting, appellant\u2019s roommate was sitting in his car at a convenience store when Heywood walked up, lifted his shirt, produced a semi-automatic handgun from the waist of his pants, pulled the slide back and said \u201cBrian [the appellant] missed but I won\u2019t.\u201d Another airman pumping gas at the station reported this, which resulted in Heywood being charged with aggravated assault \u2014 a charge he was facing at the time of appellant\u2019s trial. The defense sought to introduce evidence of this incident as <em>modus operandi, </em>as well as two other assaults Heywood was involved in. However, the military judge granted a prosecution motion <em>in li-mine, </em>ruling that any relevance of the incidents was \u201coutweighed\u201d by their \u201cancillary\u201d nature and risk of starting a separate \u201cmini-trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">On direct examination, Heywood testified that, during the altercation with appellant, \u201cI wasn\u2019t tryin\u2019 to take nobody\u2019s life, I ain\u2019t that kind of person.\u201d He later testified that \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna go buy no gun and do this and that with a gun, you know.\u201d On cross-examination, Heywood acknowledged that he had just testified that he was not the kind of person to threaten a life. The defense then requested an opportunity to cross-examine Heywood on the convenience store incident, arguing that Heywood opened the door on his direct examination. The military judge refused, finding the incident irrelevant to appellant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the shooting and, once again, that any other relevance was \u201coutweighed\u201d by the \u201cancillary\u201d nature of the incident and risk of starting a separate \u201cmini-trial\u201d on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">We first address the military judge\u2019s ruling that Heywood\u2019s act of drawing a gun on appellant\u2019s roommate was irrelevant. The military judge has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of impeachment evidence. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>48 M.J. 49, 55 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">The success or failure of appellant\u2019s efforts to show he acted in self-defense turned on what the court members believed about his state of mind \u2014 whether he simply wanted to \u201cbust a cap in [Heywood\u2019s] ass\u201d or, on the other hand, whether he was attempting to ward off an armed assailant by firing warning shots. The four defense witnesses testified that Heywood approached appellant with his hand under his shirt, leading each to conclude Heywood was concealing a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">The similarity of this event with the convenience store incident could have led the members to find Heywood\u2019s scheme for dealing with enemies was to approach and threaten them with a weapon tucked under his shirt. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is admissible under Mil.R.Evid. 404(b) to show plan or intent. Evidence that Heywood\u2019s scheme was to threaten people with a weapon tucked under his shirt is relevant to his plan or intent on the night in question. This evidence could, therefore, have added significant weight to the defense theory of events \u2014 that Heywood approached appellant with what appeared to be a weapon under his shirt. That no weapon was found in Heywood\u2019s possession does not diminish the relevance of this evidence; after all, no bullets or markings were found as a result of appellant\u2019s shots despite the fact that he clearly fired the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">In the realm of reasonable doubt, we cannot overlook the chance that evidence of the convenience store incident would have affected the members\u2019 view of the facts in question. The fact that this incident occurred subsequent to the shooting affects its weight, but does not affect its admissibility under Mil.R.Evid. 404(b). <em>See United States v. McClure, </em>546 F.2d 670, 673 (5th Cir. 1977)(fact that Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) evidence offered by defendant concerned subsequent similar acts affects weight but not admissibility); <em>cf. United States v. Aboumoussallem, </em>726 F.2d 906 (2d Cir.1984)(standard of admissibility is not as restrictive under Fed. R.Evid. 404(b) when defendant offers evidence of another\u2019s acts). Therefore, we conclude the military judge erred in finding this evidence irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-13\">We next turn to the military judge\u2019s ruling that any other relevance of this evidence was \u201coutweighed\u201d by the \u201cancillary\u201d nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>incident and risk of starting a separate \u201cmini-trial.\u201d When Heywood testified on direct examination that he wasn\u2019t the kind of person to try to take someone\u2019s life and he \u201cain\u2019t gonna go buy no gun and do this and that with a gun,\u201d he opened the door to impeachment by contradiction. <em>Compare United States v. Pruitt, </em>43 M.J. 864 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App.1996)(witness who denies committing certain misconduct may be impeached by contradiction), <em>aff'd, </em>46 M.J. 148 (1997), <em>and United States v. Welker, </em>44 M.J. 85 (1996)(discussing methods of impeachment).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Heywood portrayed himself as someone who would not buy a gun, threaten a person\u2019s life with a gun, or \u201cdo this and that with a gun.\u201d This portrayal was directly at odds with proffers of the convenience store incident. Concerns of the \u201cancillary\u201d nature of this evidence or starting a \u201cmini-trial\u201d pale in comparison to the relevance of this evidence to Heywood\u2019s truthfulness. As the alleged victim, Heywood\u2019s version of the events was the core of the prosecution\u2019s case. Based upon the members\u2019 verdict, it appears they found Heywood\u2019s testimony more convincing than that of four defense witnesses. Cross-examination of Heywood on this matter could have turned the tables.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Finally, we find the military judge\u2019s ruling that this evidence was <em>outweighed </em>by \u201cancillary\u201d and \u201cmini-trial\u201d concerns misses the mark. The military judge repeatedly ruled that the relevance of defense evidence was merely <em>outweighed </em>by other concerns; Mil. R.Evid. 403 only permits exclusion of relevant evidence that is <em>substantially outweighed </em>by such concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">The military judge erred in conducting her Mil.R.Evid. 403 balancing test. We conclude that this error was prejudicial to appellant. This error forms the third basis on which the findings and sentence are set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">IV. STAFF JUDGE ADVOCATE\u2019S RECOMMENDATION</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">Though not raised as an error by appellant\u2019s counsel, we note one matter in the record of trial that merits comment. The Staff Judge Advocate\u2019s Recommendation does not provide a summary of appellant\u2019s character of service as required by Rule for Courts-Martial 1106(d)(3)(C). This error is mooted by our disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">V. DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">The findings of guilty and sentence are set aside. The convening authority may order a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">Judges MORGAN and SPISAK concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
