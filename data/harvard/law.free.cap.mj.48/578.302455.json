Contrary to his pleas, a military judge sitting as a general court-martial found the appellant guilty of rape in violation of Article 120, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 920. The military judge found the appellant not guilty of forcible sodomy in violation of Article 125, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 925. The convening authority approved the adjudged sentence of a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for thirteen months, and forfeiture of all pay and allowances.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-20\">This case is before the court for review under Article 66, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 866. We have considered the record of trial, appellant\u2019s two assignments of error, matters raised by the appellant pursuant to <em>United States v. Grostefon, </em>12 M.J. 431 (C.M.A.1982), and the government\u2019s reply thereto. Appellant contends that the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to prove the crime of rape and that the military judge erred by admitting, over the trial defense counsel\u2019s objection, a Criminal Investigation Command (CID) special agent\u2019s testimony under Military Rule of Evidence 803(1) [hereinafter Mil.R.Evid.], as a present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule. While we find appellant\u2019s second assignment of error to be meritorious, we find any error to be harmless in the total context of the case. We affirm the findings and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-21\">LEGAL AND FACTUAL SUFFICIENCY OF THE RAPE GUILTY FINDING</p>\n<p id=\"b695-22\">LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b695-23\">The test for legal sufficiency of the evidence is whether, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, a court could rationally find the existence of every element beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>United States v. Blocker, </em>32 M.J. 281, 284 (C.M.A.1991). The test for factual sufficiency is whether, after weighing the evidence in the record of trial and making allowances for not having personally observed the witnesses, this court is convinced of appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>lant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. UCMJ art. 66(c); <em>United States v. Turner, </em>25 M.J. 324 (C.M.A.1987). Where the evidence raises defenses, the government must also prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense so raised does not apply. <em>United States v. Berri, </em>33 M.J. 337 (C.M.A.1991); Rules for Courts-Martial 916(b) and (j) [hereinafter R.C.M.].</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Appellant and two other soldiers met the victim at a servicemembers\u2019 club. Her ser-vicemember husband had for all intents and purposes abandoned the five-month pregnant victim earlier in the evening. At closing time the victim accompanied the three soldiers back to the barracks where a party was purportedly taking place. No party was taking place in the barracks. In the barracks appellant and his friends continued drinking beer and gave the victim some snack cakes to eat. The victim testified that she was subsequently held down, forcibly undressed, and raped by the three soldiers. Appellant and the two co-defendants each had sexual intercourse with the victim at least , once during the course of conduct. The victim made a complaint and supporting sworn statement, and testified numerous times during the co-defendants\u2019 separate Article 32, UCMJ, investigations (appellant waived his Article 32 investigation), and three separate trials. Appellant\u2019s trial was the last trial in the series. During the course of appellant\u2019s trial, the victim was successfully challenged numerous times concerning variations in her present and past testimonies and was likewise impeached concerning whether she had been to the barracks previously with one of the co-defendants, whether she yelled during the rape, and how much noise was being made in the room during the rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Having reviewed the evidence of record, the military judge\u2019s extensive special findings, and recognizing the military judge\u2019s unique opportunity to see and hear the witnesses, including both the victim and appellant, to weigh the evidence and to judge credibility-in making his findings, we find that the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to sustain the rape conviction. UCMJ art. 120; <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789; <em>Turner, </em>25 M.J. at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">Despite the numerous inconsistencies and incongruities in the victim\u2019s testimony, the totality of the evidence supports the military judge\u2019s findings that the victim did not consent to having sexual intercourse with the appellant, that the sexual intercourse was forcibly obtained, and that appellant could not have reasonably believed that the victim consented. We summarize and adopt the military judge\u2019s special findings as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-10\">\u2022 The victim did not consent to sexual intercourse with any of the three men, including appellant. The victim made her lack of consent manifest by her demeanor, conduct, and words (and lack of words) during the sex acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-11\">\u2022 The victim made her lack of consent reasonably manifest at the beginning of the sex acts: She physically resisted having her clothing removed. Appellant knew that she resisted having her clothing removed. Thereafter, more physical resistance by the victim would have been futile considering the totality of the circumstances, including the fact that she was pregnant and that three men were having sex with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-12\">\u2022 The sexual intercourse was accomplished by force. The initial act of sexual intercourse by appellant\u2019s accomplices was accomplished by actual physical force. Appellant\u2019s act of sexual intercourse was accomplished by constructive force because of his use of intimidation against the victim. The threat of physical injury to the victim and her unborn child made further resistance futile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-13\">\u2022 Appellant did not have a mistake of fact defense because he did not have an honest and reasonable belief that the victim consented to sexual intercourse with him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-14\">It is plain from the military judge\u2019s special findings that appellant was found guilty of rape for his own act of forcible, nonconsensual sexual intercourse with the victim. Thus, appellant was found guilty as a perpetrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>rather than as a principal to the acts of the other two soldiers. UCMJ art. 77, 10 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">We have considered our brother judge\u2019s dissent and respectfully disagree. In reaching our decision we, like the trial judge, are fully aware of the inconsistencies in the victim\u2019s testimony and challenges to the victim\u2019s veracity. We do not judge the victim as harshly, nor appellant as benignly, as does our brother. Rape is sexual intercourse by force and without consent. UCMJ art. 120. Appellant engaged in sexual relations with the victim as the third man in an unwelcomed sexual assault. Appellant\u2019s own testimony and pretrial statements admit that the victim did not undress herself and never consented to sexual relations with him. Indeed, she never said anything at all, but appeared anguished, distraught, and \u201csad and desperate\u201d as he took his \u201cturn\u201d at his friends\u2019 urging. As found by the judge, force was both manifest and implicit in the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The victim\u2019s and appellant\u2019s statements are essentially consistent concerning the operant facts of appellant\u2019s intercourse with the victim. We are satisfied with the victim\u2019s truthfulness concerning the core elements of the rape offense despite other obvious challenges to her veracity. After a full review of the record and the military judge\u2019s special findings, we find the victim credible on the issues of force and consent <em>at the moment of sexual intercourse with appellant </em>and agree with the military judge\u2019s findings. In making our findings we are particularly aware that both the victim and appellant testified in this ease and that the military judge was in the unique position of being able to see and hear the evidence and witnesses in judging credibility and making findings. UCMJ art. 66(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">ADMISSION OF EVIDENCE PURSUANT TO Mil.R.Evid. 803(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">The military judge admitted CID Special Agent (SA) Lafayette\u2019s testimony concerning a conversation with another special agent, SA Hilton, under the Mil.R.Evid. 803(1), \u201cpresent sense impression\u201d hearsay exception, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-9\">Rule 803. Hearsay exceptions; availability of declarant immaterial</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-10\">The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-11\">(1) <em>Present sense impression. </em>A statement describing or explaining an event or condition made while declarant was perceiving the event or condition or immediately thereafter, (second and third emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b697-13\">Appellant was interviewed multiple times by multiple CID investigators. An initial interview occurred on 2 August 1995. The contested evidence involved follow-up interviews on 29 August 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-14\">Special Agent Hilton conducted the first interview on 29 August. Special Agent Hilton testified for the government on the merits addressing only the execution of the appellant\u2019s Article 31 rights waiver. Special Agent Hilton testified for the defense on the merits that appellant said \u201cno\u201d when asked if he held down the victim\u2019s feet during the sexual acts. Special Agent Hilton did not recall appellant ever answering \u201cyes\u201d to that question. On cross-examination, SA Hilton testified it was possible that appellant could have answered \u201cyes\u201d and that he just didn\u2019t recall the response. Investigator Muerer, who observed portions of SA Hilton\u2019s interview of appellant through a two-way mirror, testified on the merits for the government that appellant repeatedly denied holding the victim\u2019s feet, but at one point told SA Hilton that he did so. The victim testified that she was held by the shoulders and feet during various parts of the sexual assaults. Appellant testified and denied holding the victim\u2019s feet while his co-accused engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-15\">The challenged testimony was SA Lafayette\u2019s rebuttal testimony offered by the government. Special Agent Lafayette\u2019s testimony was presented to corroborate Investigator Muerer\u2019s testimony. Special Agent Lafayette assumed the interview from SA Hilton and obtained the appellant\u2019s written statement. Special Agent Lafayette testified that before he assumed the interview, SA Hilton told him that appellant told SA Hilton that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>he held the victim\u2019s feet while his co-accused engaged in sexual intercourse. During SA Lafayette\u2019s interview the appellant did not confirm holding the victim\u2019s feet. The government submitted SA Hilton\u2019s oral statement to SA Lafayette under Mil.R.Evid. 803(1), as a present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">The defense objected to the court considering SA Lafayette\u2019s testimony recounting SA Hilton\u2019s statement because it was hearsay. Special Agent Hilton did not testify in relation to the defense objection concerning his alleged statement or SA Lafayette\u2019s assumption of the interview. Special Agent Lafayette testified only that the conversation took place before he assumed appellant\u2019s interview from SA Hilton. No testimony addressed how long SA Hilton\u2019s initial interview lasted, when or how quickly the hand-off to SA Lafayette occurred following SA Hilton\u2019s initial interview, or what time the conversation took place. The rights warning statement and appellant\u2019s written statement executed on 29 August were introduced as prosecution exhibits. Both documents include time references. The rights warnings statement indicates a time of 0814. Appellant\u2019s written statement indicates two times: \u201c4230\u201d (alteration in original) and \u201c1602.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The trial defense counsel objected to the court considering the evidence as a hearsay exception under Mil.R.Evid. 803(1) because the direct testimony and other evidence did not establish that the statement was made <em>immediately </em>after the appellant\u2019s initial interview. The military judge disagreed and admitted the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Although alerted to the trial defense counsel\u2019s concerns and having the opportunity to establish the conversation as immediately following the initial interview, the trial counsel failed to take the opportunity to perfect the hearsay exception. The trial defense counsel chose not to perfect the government\u2019s case and did not inquire further as to the chronology of SA Hilton\u2019s initial interview and SA Hilton\u2019s subsequent conversation with SA Lafayette.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">The military judge\u2019s decision to admit or exclude hearsay evidence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hyder, </em>47 M.J. 46, 48 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">Military Rule of Evidence 803(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">Military Rule of Evidence 803(1) permits the admission of a hearsay statement describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the <em>event </em>or condition or made <em>immediately </em>after perceiving the event. \u201cRule 803(1) is taken from the Federal Rule verbatim____ It is somewhat similar to a spontaneous exclamation, but does not require a startling event.\u201d Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, (1995 edition), app. 22, Mil.R.Evid. 803 analysis, at A22-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-14\">The authors of the Military Rules of Evidence Manual note the following underlying theory of the exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-15\">[T]he Rule ... seeks to avoid calculated or planned statements when possible, because these are not as likely to be as sincere as spontaneous statements. Thus, Rule 803(1) applies only to statements made at the time of the <em>event </em>or immediately thereafter. <em>The term \u201cimmediately thereafter\u2019\u2019 is not defined in the Rule or its drafters\u2019 Analysis. </em>However, the contemporane-ousness of the statement is crucial to its admission, and should be the proponent\u2019s main foundational concern. Courts will generally evaluate admissibility on a case-by-case basis, focusing on whether the de-clarant had an opportunity to reflect on his thoughts and thereby modify them. We believe that a statement must be made as soon as the opportunity to speak arises. The burden is on the person who claims the benefit of this or another exception to show entitlement to it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-16\">Stephen A. Saltzburg et al., Military Rules of Evidence Manual 942 (4th ed.1997) [hereinafter cited as Saltzburg] (emphasis added). <em>See Wolfson v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York, </em>455 F.Supp. 82 (M.D.Pa.), <em>aff'd, </em>588 F.2d 825 (3d Cir.1978) (one hour is too long a gap). <em>But see United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number><em>States v. Blakey, </em>607 F.2d 779 (7th Cir.1979) (23 minutes is acceptable).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Military Rule of Evidence 803(1) has been rarely litigated in military law. Such evidence appears to be more frequently admitted under other Mil.R.Evid. 803 exceptions. As predicted by the Drafter\u2019s Analysis, when courts discuss Mil.R.Evid. 803(1) evidence, the discussion is generally tied to Mil.R.Evid. 803(2), excited utterance, precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The instant case raises two questions. First: Is a conversation or an interrogation an \u201cevent or condition\u201d for the purposes of MiLR.Evid. 803(1)? Second: If a conversation or an interrogation is an event or condition for the purposes of Mil.R.Evid. 803(1), did SA Hilton\u2019s conversation with SA Lafayette occur <em>\u201cwhile </em>[SA Hilton] was perceiving the event or <em>immediately thereafter\u201d </em>as required by the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">Is a Conversation or an Interrogation an Event for the Purposes of MiLR.Evid. 803(1)?</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">Numerous cases have held that conversations are events for the purposes of the present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See Phoenix Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Adams, </em>30 F.3d 554, 567 (4th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Portsmouth Paving Corp., </em>694 F.2d 312, 322-323 (4th Cir.1982). Use of the exception to admit even hearsay within hearsay is routine. <em>Cargill, Inc. v. Boag Cold Storage Warehouse, Inc., </em>71 F.3d 545, 555 (6th Cir.1995); <em>Portsmouth Paving Corp., </em>694 F.2d at 322-323. In <em>United States v. Gil, </em>58 F.3d 1414, 1422 (9th Cir.1995), the court found the notes of officers transcribing the statements of other officers conducting a surveillance to be admissible as present sense impressions under Rule 803(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">We find that SA Hilton\u2019s conversation/interrogation with the appellant and subsequent recounting of it to SA Lafayette is an <em>event </em>for the purposes of MiLR.Evid. 803(1). The interrogation of a suspect and the subsequent handoff of that interrogation from one investigator to another investigator is an event even more noteworthy than a normal conversation. The circumstances provide particular indicia of reliability. Special Agent Hilton knew that his primary role was to merely advise the appellant of his Article 31, UCMJ, rights and obtain appellant\u2019s rights waiver. Special Agent Hilton knew that SA Lafayette would conduct any actual interrogation. Accordingly it was incumbent upon SA Hilton to accurately note any comments that the appellant made during the rights warning session and to accurately convey that information to SA Lafayette for consideration and inclusion during the actual interrogation and in any subsequent statement. Likewise, it was incumbent upon SA Lafayette to accurately note the ground already covered by SA Hilton, appellant\u2019s preliminary admissions, and to obtain a full and accurate statement from the appellant. Similar situations occur frequently in military life, e.g., duty officers brief their replacements concerning the present status of the command, on-going actions, and what has occurred during the preceding period; and mechanics advise the next maintenance echelon what repairs have been effected as the vehicle passes down the line for additional work.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">Accordingly, we answer the question of whether SA Hilton\u2019s conversation/ interrogation with the appellant was an event for the purposes of MiLR.Evid. 803(1), affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">Did The Conversation Occur Immediately After The Event or As Soon As Possible Thereafter?</p>\n<p id=\"b699-14\">No military appellate court has defined \u201cimmediately thereafter\u201d beyond Saltzburg\u2019s suggested definition, <em>ie., </em>\u201cas soon as the opportunity to speak arises.\u201d In the sole reported case directly applying the rule, the statement was made \u201ccontemporaneously, if not instantaneously, with the event being perceived.\u201d <em>United States v. Evans, </em>23 M.J. 665 (A.C.M.R.1986). In cases referencing possible Mil.R.Evid. 803(1) consideration, but actually applying other Mil. R.Evid. 803 exceptions, periods of twelve hours up to two-and-a-half weeks have been rejected as untimely. <em>Cf. United States v. Miller, </em>46 M.J. 80, 83 (1997) (fifteen hours); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>30 M.J. 127, 129 (C.M.A.1990) (twelve hours); <em>United States v. LeMere, </em>22 M.J. 61, 67 (C.M.A.1986) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>(twelve hours); <em>United States v. Sandoval, </em>18 M.J. 55, 62 (C.M.A.1984) (two-and-a-half weeks); <em>United States v. Ferguson, </em>15 M.J. 12, 22 (C.M.A.1983) (five days).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Considering the testimony and documentary evidence, SA Hilton\u2019s statement to SA Lafayette may have occurred instantaneously or as much as four to eight hours after the perceived event. The trial defense counsel correctly objected to the absence of evidence of timeliness. The actual chronology of SA Hilton\u2019s interview with the appellant and subsequent conversation with SA Lafayette was never established. Accordingly, no evidence was presented that SA Hilton\u2019s conversation with SA Lafayette was, in fact or in any sense, <em>immediately </em>after the interview as required by Mil.R.Evid. 803(1). Likewise, no evidence was presented upon which to make a determination that SA Hilton\u2019s statement to SA Lafayette was made \u201cas soon as the opportunity to speak [arose].\u201d Saltz-burg at 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Because the \u201cimmediate\u201d character of the evidence was not established the military judge clearly abused his discretion by admitting the hearsay evidence over the appellant\u2019s objection. Accordingly, we find that the military judge erred by admitting SA Lafayette\u2019s testimony recounting SA Hilton\u2019s purported statement as permissible hearsay under the Mil.R.Evid. 803(1), present sense impression exception. However, under the total evidentiary circumstances of this case as discussed above, we conclude that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); <em>United States v. Kindle, </em>45 M.J. 284, 286 (1996). Moreover, the contested testimony was cumulative with the victim\u2019s and Investigator Muerer\u2019s previously admitted testimony. Accordingly, the contested testimony did not materially prejudice the substantial rights of the appellant in this case. UCMJ art. 59(a); <em>United States v. Flack, </em>47 M.J. 415, 417 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">On consideration of the entire record, including consideration of those issues personally asserted by the appellant, we hold the findings of guilty and the sentence as approved by the convening authority correct in law and fact. Accordingly, those findings of guilty and the sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Judge CARTER concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b700-9\">TRANT, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ahx-dedup-0\">concurring in part and dissenting in the result:</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">I agree with the majority opinion\u2019s finding that it was error for the military judge to admit as \u201cpresent sense impression\u201d (Mil.R.Evid. 803(1)), SA Lafayette\u2019s testimony concerning SA Hilton\u2019s statements to SA Lafayette recounting the appellant\u2019s statements to SA Hilton.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">Having weighed the evidence presented at trial, excluding the above-mentioned erroneously admitted hearsay, and making allowances for not having personally observed the witnesses,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>1 am not convinced of appellant\u2019s guilt of rape beyond a reasonable doubt. I recognize that the trial judge had a singular advantage over this court in being able to discern the demeanor of the witnesses. Although I do not minimize the significance that demeanor may have in assessing truthfulness, credibility is not solely a function of demeanor. Other evidence, such as corroboration or the lack thereof, may be more persuasive in determining the believability of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">The prosecutrix exaggerated some aspects of her testimony, embellished other parts, and fabricated some details in an effort to put herself in a better light. Her attempt to minimize her prior contact with appellant and his co-accused, and thus bolster her version of the incident, seriously diminished her credibility. Her rendition of events leading up to the alleged rape is implausible, rebutted by defense evidence, and contradicted by her own prior statement. Her assertion of resistance manifested by prolonged screaming was successfully debunked by defense evidence, including her husband\u2019s testimony that she told him that she didn\u2019t scream at all. Overall, her account of what occurred stretches the limits of plausibility beyond the breaking point.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>While corroboration is not required, and a victim should not be penalized for being unfortunate enough not to have any available, when a victim\u2019s testimony is contradictory and improbable, corroboration would certainly facilitate the prosecution in meeting its evidentiary burden. The government\u2019s ease lacked sufficient corroboration to compensate for a prevaricating prosecutrix. Appellant\u2019s testimony describing the demeanor of the victim, which the majority considers to be an admission of lack of consent being manifest, I conclude only evinces acquiesence. The lack of physical evidence, fresh complaint, or corroborating witnesses further weakened the government\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">I am unconvinced that the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the intercourse was by force or that the victim made her lack of consent reasonably manifest by taking such measures of resistance as were called for by the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Accordingly, I would set aside the finding of guilty as to Charge I and its specification and order them dismissed, affirm the remaining findings of guilty, set aside the sentence and authorize a rehearing as to the sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-13\">. <em>Turner, 25 </em>M.J. at 325.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
