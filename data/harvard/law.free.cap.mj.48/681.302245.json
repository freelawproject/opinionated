The convening authority approved the adjudged sentence to a dishonorable discharge, confinement for ten years, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to Private El, but credited appellant with ninety-four days towards his sentence to confinement. This case is before the court for automatic review pursuant to Article 66, UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Appellate defense counsel argue that the evidence is factually insufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction and that the military judge erred in admitting certain aggravation evidence. On review of appellant\u2019s personal claims pursuant to <em>United States v. Groste-fon, </em>12 M.J. 431 (C.M.A.1982), we specified the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-5\">I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-6\">WHETHER THE APPELLANT MAY PROPERLY BE CONVICTED UNDER ARTICLE 118(3), UCMJ, WHEN THE CHARGE AND THE SPECIFICATION ALLEGE EXCLUSIVELY AN OFFENSE UNDER ARTICLE 118(2), UCMJ.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-8\">IF SO, ARE THE FACTS SUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN THE CONVICTION IN THE APPELLANT\u2019S CASE?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">We have carefully considered the facts of this case, along with the briefs of counsel on both the original and the specified issues. We hold that appellant was properly convicted of unpremeditated murder under Article 118(3), UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">Background and Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">After visiting another club on the evening of 12-13 November 1994, appellant, his roommate, Private First Class (PFC) C, and two fellow soldiers, arrived at the Flash disco in St. Wendel, Germany. Appellant and PFC C were described as good friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">Opinion and reputation testimony characterized appellant as a peaceful, nonviolent person and a good soldier. However, earlier in the evening, appellant had displayed a knife to his companions and indicated that he was \u201cready\u201d if any trouble broke out and that he had the group \u201ccovered.\u201d Appellant and his companions had been drinking throughout the evening, but were not drunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-16\">While the group was preparing to leave the Flash disco and return to the barracks, appellant and PFC C got into a physical altercation. Private First Class C, the taller and stronger of the two, appeared to be winning, but both soldiers were throwing and landing blows. Finally, one of the other soldiers stepped between the two, separated them, and physically restrained appellant. Private First Class C took advantage of this development and punched appellant in the face. The peacemaker then turned and restrained PFC C. At this point, appellant and PFC C were facing each other with the third soldier between them. Private First Class C attempted a left punch around the third soldier while appellant landed what appeared to be a direct blow to PFC C\u2019s upper body with his right hand. This blow was directed around the third soldier and past a gathering of club patrons pressing on the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-17\">No witnesses saw a knife. None of appellant\u2019s acts were described as \u201cflailing\u201d or suggesting the waving of a weapon to hold another at bay. Appellant immediately exited the club. As his party began to follow, PFC C collapsed and fell backwards into the atrium. He was taken to a local German hospital, where he died of a lateral, penetrating stab wound to the heart, entering from the left side of the chest. Private First Class C had no other cuts or injuries to his body, including none to his left hand and arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-18\">Subsequently, a knife identified as appellant\u2019s was found on a rooftop within throwing distance of where the automobile used by the soldiers had been parked. Laboratory analysis identified fibers attached to it as being consistent with those in the shirt PFC C was wearing when stabbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-19\">Appellant was charged with unpremeditated murder using the form specification set forth in Manual Foe Coukts-Maetial, United States (1995 ed.), Part IV, para. 43f [hereinafter MCM, 1995].<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The form speeifi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>cation uses the same operative words to charge murder under subsections 2 and 3 of Article 118. At arraignment and entry of the plea, the offense was described as \u201cmurder\u201d or \u201cunpremeditated murder,\u201d otherwise unspecified.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">The defense never inquired as to the theory of unpremeditated murder on which the government was proceeding<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> nor did they seek to make the specification more definite and certain through a bill of particulars. <em>See </em>Rule for Courts-Martial 906(b)(6)[hereinafter R.C.M.].<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial presentations of the parties, and particularly closing argument on findings, reveal that both sides viewed the charge as unpremeditated murder of the type described by Article 118(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Appellant did not testify during the findings portion of the trial. His defense focused on the doctrine of self-defense, while alternatively seeking to mitigate culpability to the offense of voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">The military judge found appellant guilty, by exceptions and substitutions, of unpremeditated murder as characterized in subsection 3 of Article 118.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> No objection, motion for mistrial, or request for specific findings was made concerning this finding prior to the end of trial. However, defense counsel later filed a motion with the military judge seeking a mistrial on this basis and asked for a post-trial hearing on the issue. The judge denied this motion and authenticated the record of trial. Subsequently, defense counsel requested that the convening authority direct the military judge to conduct a post-trial hearing pursuant to R.C.M. 1102(a) and Article 39(a), UCMJ. The issue was also cited as error in appellant\u2019s R.C.M. 1105/1106 submission. These requests were rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">Law</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">The question before us is whether the findings of guilty under Article 118(3) can be affirmed as either a lesser-included offense of Article 118(2) or as an alternate theory of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>guilt under the circumstances of this trial. This issue involves three interrelated questions: (a) are the terms used in the pleading sufficient to reasonably implicate the act on which a conviction is based; (b) would appellant be protected against future prosecution for the same conduct; and (c) is there a likelihood of being mislead or having substantial rights prejudiced? The first and second questions relate to notice and double jeopardy. <em>See United States v. Russell, </em>47 M.J. 412 (1998) (citing <em>United States v. Brecheen, </em>27 M.J. 67 (C.M.A.1988); <em>United States v. Watkins, 21 </em>M.J. 208 (C.M.A.1986)). The third question implicates fundamental fairness. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>46 M.J. 216 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">In the military, the statute and pleadings serve to provide notice sufficient for constitutional requirements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Weymouth, </em>48 M.J. 329, 333 <em>(1995); </em>Gilligan and Lederer, supra n. 3, at \u00a7 6-12.00. Among other things, the specification (e.g., the pleadings) should be \u201csufficiently specific to inform the accused of the conduct charged [and] to enable the accused to prepare a defense ...\u201d R.C.M. 307(c)(3) discussion at para. (G)(iii). However, the evidence introduced at trial also serves as a component of notice. <em>See Weymouth, </em>43 M.J at 335; <em>United States v. Foster, </em>40 M.J. 140, 145 n. 5 (C.M.A.1994) and the concurrence by Sullivan, C.J., at 148; <em>United States v. Davis, </em>10 C.M.R. 3, 2 U.S.C.M.A. 505, 1953 WL 1764 (1953)(specifically addressing unpremeditated murder).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">\u201cAn accused may be found guilty of an offense <em>necessarily included </em>in the offense charged ...\u201d UCMJ art. 79 (emphasis added). The Manual for Courts-Martial expands the article\u2019s phrase \u201cnecessarily included therein\u201d by noting that a lesser offense is included in a charged offense when the \u201callegations [in the specification] ... either expressly or by fair implication put the accused on notice ... to defend against it....\u201d MCM, 1995, para. 3b(l). Applicable included offenses are determined not only by the scope of the pleadings but by the proof at trial. <em>See </em>R.C.M. 920(e)(2) and discussion; DA Pam. 27-9, Ch. 1, Sec. V, Lesser Included Offenses at 50. The Manual lists common lesser or included offenses for each specific crime discussed, \u201cbut the lists are not all-inclusive.\u201d MCM, 1995, para. 3b(4). Accordingly, the Manual sets out three tests for notice of lesser-included offenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-10\">(a) All of the elements of the lesser offense are included in the greater offense, and the common elements are identical ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-11\">(b) All of the elements of the lesser offense are included in the greater offense, but one or more elements is legally less serious ...; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-12\">(c) All of the elements of the lesser offense are included and necessary parts of the greater offense, but the mental element is legally less serious ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">MCM, 1995, para. 3b(l). To properly apply these concepts to appellant\u2019s case, we must first review aspects of our law of homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-14\">Under the Articles of War, murder was defined simply. The offense was sub-divided into two degrees: premeditated and unpremeditated murder. The dividing line between degrees was determined by the authorized punishment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This scheme of differentiation continues today. Subsections (1) \u2014 (4) of Article 118 represent four different states of mind proscribed by the crime of murder, not four different crimes. <em>United States v. Graves, </em>47 M.J. 632, 638-39 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>(Army Ct.Crim.App.1997). <em>But see McMonagle, </em>34 M.J. at 868 n. 5 (Johnston, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The mental element for murder historically has been described as malice aforethought. It may be either express, or it may be implied or imputed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While Article 118, UCMJ, eliminated the term from the statutory definition, \u201c[n]o change, however, was effected in the substantive crime of murder [as expressed in the Articles of War].\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>15 C.M.R. at 134. The <em>McDonald </em>court went on to note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-5\">The different states of mind [expressed by malice aforethought under the Articles of War] were set out in a separate subdivision [of Article 118 for punitive purposes] ... and to permit each to be more easily dealt with at trial____ It is clear from this that Article 118, supra, defines but one crime---- [The] subdivisions [including]\u00ae) and (3) describe the states of mind characterizing murder in a lesser degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aiv-dedup-0\">15 C.M.R. at 134 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">Article 118(2) and (3) constitute unpremeditated murder in the military. <em>United States v. Judd, </em>26 C.M.R. 881, 890, 1958 WL 3497 (A.F.B.R.1958); <em>Sandoval, </em>15 C.M.R. at 64. Subsection 2 defines a specific intent crime while subsection 3 involves general intent. <em>United States v. McMonagle, </em>38 M.J. 53, 60 (1993)(citing <em>United States v. Craig, </em>2 U.S.C.M.A. 650, 659, 10 C.M.R. 148, 157, 1953 WL 1795 (1953)). Both subsections are alleged by the same form specification and constitute alternate theories of unpremeditated murder. <em>See McMonagle, </em>38 M.J. at 54 (alternate theories); <em>Berg, </em>30 M.J. at 196; <em>United States v. Dacanay, </em>4 U.S.C.M.A. 263, 15 C.M.R. 263, 265, 1954 WL 2286 (1954); <em>McDonald, </em>15 C.M.R. at 132 (same speeification). <em>But cf., United States v. Valdez, </em>35 M.J. 555 (A.C.M.R.1992)(tailored specification may be sufficient to fix the theory of murder being prosecuted).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-19\">The elements of proof for both theories are contained in the Manual for Courts-Martial. Id., at paras. 43b(2), 43b(3). The only significant difference concerns malice or mental intent. For subsection 2 of Article 118, this is a single concept stated as a \u201c[specific or focused] intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm.\u201d MCM, 1995, para. 43b(2)(d). See also <em>Berg, </em>30 M.J. at 198; <em>United States v. Hartley, </em>16 U.S.C.M.A. 249, 36 C.M.R. 405, 409, 1966 WL 4499 (1966); <em>Davis, </em>10 C.M.R. at 6. In subsection 3 of Article 118, the offense is bifurcated and stated as: (a) an \u201cact inherently dangerous to another\u201d showing \u201cwanton disregard for human life\u201d for which (b) \u201cthe accused knew that death or great bodily harm was a probable consequence.\u201d MCM, 1995, para. 43b(3). This imputed malice will support a finding of guilt under subsection 3 even if the accused has no intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm or specifically wishes that such a result will not occur. <em>Id., </em>at para. 43b(3)(c) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-20\">The accused\u2019s knowledge of the probable consequences means actual knowledge, which may be proved by circumstantial evidence. <em>Id., </em>at para. 43c(4)(b); <em>United States v. Stokes, </em>6 U.S.C.M.A. 65, 19 C.M.R. 191, 194-96, (1955); Milhizer, <em>supra </em>note 8, at 218. Wanton disregard for human life is defined as conduct reflecting heedlessness, indifference, recklessness, a depraved or \u201cso what\u201d attitude about the probable fatal consequences of an act, or some combination thereof. <em>See generally </em>MCM, 1995, para. 43c(4)(a); <em>Berg, </em>30 M.J. at 200; <em>Stokes, </em>19 C.M.R. at 196; <em>Sandoval, </em>15 C.M.R. at 66; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number><em>McMonagle, </em>34 M.J. at 861. The phrases \u201cinherently dangerous to another\u201d and \u201cdisregard for human life,\u201d given the specific amending of Article 118(3) in 1992,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> now contemplate an attitude of wantonness toward human life as a general value and can include circumstances involving only one person. <em>See also </em>MCM, 1995, para. 43e(4)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Neither subsection 2 nor 3 of Article 118 is listed in the Manual as a Iesser-included offense of the other, nor have they been so listed in earlier editions. <em>See, e.g., </em>MCM, 1951; MCM, 1969, app. 12, Table of Commonly Included Offenses at 539. <em>Cf. McMo-nagle, </em>34 M.J. at 867 (Johnston, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Appellant was properly charged using the approved specification form alleging both the specific intent and wanton act theories of unpremeditated murder. Further, the government was free to proceed with its proof under either or both theories without advising the defense of its intent to do so, and, under <em>McDonald, </em>was not bound to its theory of prosecution if the proof at trial justified a change. Appellant did not contest this at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">We are satisfied that the \u201callegations [in the specification] ... either expressly or by fair implication put the accused on notice ... to defend against\u201d both theories. MCM, 1995, para. 3b(l). Further, the difference between the alternate theories went to the question of malice. Certainly, by the close of the evidence on the merits the fact that both theories were implicated was clear. This is especially true in light of a 1992 change to Article 118(3) that brought it closer to the form of unpremeditated murder on which the defense focused. We also note that the defense sought to characterize appellant\u2019s conduct as the lesser offense of involuntary manslaughter during the failed plea attempt, and then alternatively, with the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter during the trial. Given the parallels in the legal differences in these Iesser-included offenses and similar differences between the theories of unpremeditated murder, we are satisfied that the defense was on notice that both theories of unpremeditated murder applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">In reviewing the record, we find that appellant\u2019s presentation of evidence was in no way hindered regardless of the theory considered. To the contrary, the defense presentation was thorough, the cross-examination focused, and every appropriate defense and fact bearing on the question of reasonable doubt was raised and argued. Finally, there is no evidence of government misconduct or affirmative acts to misrepresent or mislead the defense concerning the theory of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">Notwithstanding the military judge\u2019s findings, we note that the evidence presented at trial supported both the wanton act theory and the specific intent theory of unpremeditated murder. The judge\u2019s findings by exceptions and substitutions did not \u201csubstantially change the nature of the offense or ... increase [its] seriousness ... or the maximum punishment.\u201d R.C.M. 918(a)(1); MCM, 1995, para. 43e(2). <em>Cf. Moreno, </em>46 M.J. 216 (citing <em>United States v. Collier, </em>14 M.J. 377 (C.M.A.1983)(finding by variance of overt act different than that alleged in the specification charging conspiracy not a substantial change; accused not prejudiced)). Accordingly, the specification sufficiently identified the act upon which appellant\u2019s conviction was ultimately based and permitted him to prepare a defense. Further, the findings did not change the offense from unpremeditated murder or increase the potential punishment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Appellant is therefore protected from future prosecution for the same conduct based on these findings and suffered no prejudice to his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Next we turn to appellant\u2019s contention that the evidence is factually insufficient to support his conviction. When testing a case for factual sufficiency, this court must, after weighing the evidence and making allowances for not having seen the witnesses in person, be convinced that an accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>25 M.J. 324 (C.M.A.1987). We are so convinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">More specifically, we find that the drawing and thrusting of an open knife in one\u2019s hand during a fist fight in a crowded bar constitutes an intentional and inherently dangerous act. Further, the thrusting of that knife around one person and past pressing patrons during the jostling of a tumultuous confrontation in a crowded bar, evidences a wanton disregard of the human life of another. Appellant knew of those circumstances. Because the evidence supports either theory of malice, we find the military judge\u2019s announced findings are factually sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">The appellant also claims self-defense precludes his conviction. Self-defense in homicide cases excuses the killing where the accused reasonably apprehends he may suffer death or grievous bodily harm, and believes the force used was necessary for protection from that threat. R.C.M. 916(e)(1); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>40 M.J. 426, 430 (C.M.A.1994)(citing <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>15 U.S.C.M.A. 603, 36 C.M.R. 101, 1966 WL 4427 (1966)). However, self-defense is not available where an accused is an aggressor, engages in mutual combat, or provokes an attack and has not withdrawn or broken off the fight before the claimed act of self-defense. R.C.M. 916(e)(4). Because the government bears the burden to disprove this defense where it is placed in issue by some evidence, the <em>Turner </em>test for factual sufficiency applies equally to this issue. <em>Turner, </em>25 M.J. 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">Appellant aggressively pursued a mutual combat situation and chose to turn a simple fistfight into a deadly confrontation by using his knife. There is no evidence justifying this escalation. There is also no evidence appellant desired to end or breakoff the combat. His assailant was his roommate and good friend, not an unknown bar brawler of uncertain propensities and intentions. He was not being severely beaten or in jeopardy of suffering death or great bodily harm. Finally, another friend and member of appellant\u2019s group was attempting to break up the confrontation. The victim was being held at the time of the stabbing. Accordingly, the evidence is factually sufficient to rebut appellant\u2019s claim of self-defense.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">The remaining allegations of error, to include those raised personally by the appellant pursuant to <em>United States v. Grostefon, </em>12 M.J. 431 (C.M.A.1982), are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">The findings of guilty and the sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">Senior Judge GORDON<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and Judge JOHNSTON concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-12\">. Appellant attempted to plead guilty to the lesser offense of involuntary manslaughter under Article 119(b), Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 919(b). However, his plea was very quickly held improvident, and the military judge entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf to the original charge of unpremeditated murder. <em>See United States v.

A tailored version, deleting language for murders under subsections (1) and (4) is used in the current edition of the Military Judges\u2019 Benchbook for unpremeditated murders defined by Article 118(2) and (3). It is exactly the same for both subsections. <em>See </em>Dep\u2019t of Army, Pam. 27-9, Military Judges\u2019 Benchbook, para. 3-42-2, 3-43-3 (30 Sep 1996)[hereinafter Benchbook]. <em>But cf., </em>DA Pam. 27-9, paras. 3-86 IIa., 3-86 IIIa.

The evidence also establishes that appellant\u2019s use of the knife was an intentional and focused act. In arguing for voluntary manslaughter as a lesser finding of culpability, the defense conceded as much. While the \"sucker punch\u201d thrown by PFC C just before the knifing undoubtedly made appellant mad, we do not find it to constitute, in the context of an on-going fistfight, adequate provocation likely to incite uncontrollable passion. Further, appellant\u2019s stated predisposition to use his knife, the absence of rage or heightened agitation, and his apparent controlled exit from the club, suggest an absence of such passion. <em>See </em>MCM, 1995, para. 44c(l)(b).
