The findings and sentence are correct in law and fact and no error materially prejudicial to the substantial rights of the appellant was committed. We affirm the findings and sentence; our reasoning is set out below.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">A Summary of the Case and the Appellant\u2019s Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Contrary to his pleas the appellant was convicted by enlisted and officer members of aggravated assault upon his two-year-old natural daughter and violating a lawful general order by failing to register his shotgun. Art. 92 and 128, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 892 and 928 (1994) [hereinafter UCMJ],</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The appellant now asserts that he was denied his right to a speedy trial in violation of Rule foe Courts-Martial 707, Manual foe Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.) [hereinafter R.C.M.]. The appellant did not make this claim at trial, but he asks us to consider it because he was denied effective assistance of counsel, his arraignment was a sham, and the military judge committed plain error by not dismissing the charges <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">In addition to his procedural claim, the appellant contends that certain documentary evidence was improperly admitted, that the evidence introduced at trial was not factually sufficient, and that, in any event, his sentence is inappropriately severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The Speedy-Trial Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">The findings or sentence in this case \u201cmay not be held incorrect on the ground of an error of law unless [an] error materially prejudices the substantial rights of the accused.\u201d Art. 59(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 859(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">The appellant\u2019s speedy-trial right under R.C.M. 707(d) to \u201cdismissal ... with ... prejudice to the [Government\u2019s right to reinstitute court martial proceedings against the accused for the same offense at a later date\u201d is one of these substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Kossman, </em>38 M.J. 258 (C.M.A.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-14\">The appellant\u2019s lesser right under R.C.M. 707(d) to \u201cdismissal ... without prejudice\u201d is not. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>46 M.J. 472, 476 (1997). The appellant has not demonstrated the substantial prejudice to his defense or any presumptive prejudice which would warrant an initial consideration of his claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-15\">There was no pretrial restraint in this case. At trial the appellant faced some charges and specifications which were more than 120-days-old and others which were less than 120-days-old. <em>See generally </em>R.C.M. 707(a). As a result, the appellant could have moved for dismissal of some of the charges and specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-16\">We cannot say whether or not such a motion would have warranted relief because the trial court did not hear it. We can say that at worst the appellant would have faced two courts-martial rather than one. In the light of this Hobson\u2019s choice, we have no difficulty finding that the appellant waived any administrative speedy-trial claim. R. C.M. 905(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-18\">The appellant\u2019s naked assertions regarding the delays in his trial present nothing to trigger a speedy-trial analysis warranting dismissal with prejudice of the affected charges. <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972); <em>Kossman, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>38 M.J. at 262. Without a showing of prejudice, we will not further consider the military judge\u2019s actions or the effectiveness of counsel regarding any speedy trial claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The Evidentiary Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Prosecution Exhibit 2 is the record of medical treatment afforded the victim after the assault. The appellant says that portions of this record are irrelevant and that the military judge should not have admitted them.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The assertion that the medical officers\u2019 observations regarding the cause and nature of the victim\u2019s injuries are irrelevant is without foundation in law or fact. The assertion that other observations regarding the victim\u2019s physical condition might be misconstrued by the members warrants brief discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Prosecution Exhibit 2 mentions that the victim also had an infected earlobe and facial impetigo when she was presented for treatment. Photographs admitted into evidences unavoidably reflect these conditions as well as the eye injuries inflicted by the appellant. Hydrogen peroxide and alcohol, used to treat these other conditions, were also ruled out as causes of the eye injuries. A witness testified, without objection, regarding these other medical conditions and their treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">The military judge astutely recognized these relationships and admitted the medical records in their entirety. He also gave a well-crafted cautionary instruction to the members directing them that they \u201cshould not speculate as to the cause or responsibility for any other ailments.\u201d Record at 171. Prosecution Exhibit 2 is relevant. The military judge\u2019s cautionary instruction, though perhaps not required, helped to ensure that the trial\u2019s outcome was \u201cjustly determined.\u201d Mil.R.Evid. 102 and 402, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"A_a\">Proof of Guilt and Appropriate Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">The appellant does not contest the legal sufficiency of the evidence presented against him, but he does assert that the government did not prove his guilt of aggravated assault beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See generally Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>United States v. Turner, </em>25 M.J. 324 (C.M.A.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">As to guilt, based on our review of the record we are \u201cconvinced of the accused\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>25 M.J. at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">As to sentence, clemency is not the function of this court, <em>United States v. Healy, </em>26 M.J. 394, 395-96 (C.M.A.1988), and the sentence is appropriate for these offenses and this appellant. <em>United States v. Snelling, </em>14 M.J. 267, 268 (C.M.A.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">Accordingly, the findings of guilty and the sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-16\">Senior Judge CLARK and Judge LEO concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-15\">.

Assertions of the denial of a speedy trial and the effective assistance of counsel, raised for the first time on appeal, have in common the requirement for substantial prejudice. Without such a claim of prejudice reaching statutory or constitutional dimensions neither claim has merit. <em>Compare Barker, </em>407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, <em>with Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
