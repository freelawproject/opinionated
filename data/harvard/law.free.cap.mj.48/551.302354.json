The convening authority approved the sentence and, except for the bad-conduct discharge, ordered it executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">We have examined the record of trial, the six assignments of error,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Government\u2019s response thereto. After careful consideration, we conclude that the findings and the sentence are correct in law and fact and that no error materially prejudicial to the substantial rights of the accused was committed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, further administrative review, and possible relief, is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">Factual Insufficiency</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">In his first two assignments of error, the appellant contends that the Government failed to prove two of the offenses against him, Specification 3 of Charge I and Specification 2 of Additional Charge II, beyond a reasonable doubt. After reviewing the evidence and the applicable standard in <em>United States v. Turner, </em>25 M.J. 324, 325 (C.M.A.1987), we are confident, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the appellant committed all of the crimes of which he was convicted. His arguments to the contrary are without substantial merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">Unconstitutional Policy on Sexual Harassment</p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">In his third assignment of error, the appellant contends that he cannot be held erimi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>nally liable for violating the Department of the Navy\u2019s policy on sexual harassment because the language of the order is unconstitutionally vague. He also contends that it is unconstitutionally overbroad because of its potential chilling effect on the exercise of his First Amendment rights. We disagree that the appellant was in any doubt that the activities in which he was engaged were criminal or that the instruction had any chilling effect on his constitutional freedom of expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">The appellant focuses on the language of the applicable regulation that prohibits sexual harassment which creates a \u201chostile environment.\u201d <em>See </em>Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5300.26B of 6 Jan. 1993, subj: Department of the Navy (DON) Policy on Sexual Harassment [hereinafter SECNA-VINST 5300.26B].<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Paragraph 8b of the instruction prohibits DON personnel from engaging in sexual harassment, defined in enclosure (1) of the instruction. The Government had the military judge take judicial notice of SECNAVINST 5300.26B which, absent objection, he did. Record at 8. A copy was included as part of the record of trial. <em>Id.; see </em>Appellate Exhibit II.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">This is the first time this court has considered directly the constitutionality of this instruction. In <em>United States v. Daniel, </em>42 M.J. 802, 803-04 n. 4 (N.M.Ct.CrimApp.1995), an appellant assigned the precise issues presented in this case. However, this court determined that the earlier version of this instruction (SECNAVINST 5300.26A) was not a punitive order and set aside the sexual harassment conviction on that basis. <em>Daniel, </em>42 M.J. at 806. The Secretary of the Navy clearly intended that the subsequent version, under which the appellant was convicted, be punitive. SECNAVINST 5300.26B, 1\u00cd 8c; <em>see id., </em>HH 4b, 8a. Therefore, we are squarely faced with the constitutional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">In <em>United States v. Peszynski, </em>40 M.J. 874 (N.M.C.M.R.1994), <em>review denied, </em>44 M.J. 270 (1996), this court concluded that SECNAVINST 5300.26A was directed toward behavior within the military working environment, and not sexual harassment in which the appellant engaged while moonlighting as the evening manager of a Pizza Hut franchise.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Before reaching this conclusion, however, the court articulated the following principles applicable to the instant case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-9\">A fundamental feature of due process of law is that one\u2019s guilt or innocence of a criminal accusation be determined by objective, clearly understood standards of criminality. <em>Smith v. Goguen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 94 S.Ct. 1242, 39 L.Ed.2d 605 (1974). This feature is bound closely to another central theme of due process \u2014 that criminal statutes and implementing regulations provide fair notice to the public that certain proscribed behavior is subject to criminal sanction. <em>Parker v. Levy, </em>417 U.S. 733, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974). To comply with these constitutional requirements, criminal statutes must define ... precisely what constitutes criminal behavior and set forth an adequate yardstick by which to distinguish it from non-criminal behavior. <em>Smith, </em>415 U.S. at 574, 94 S.Ct. at 1248.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-10\"><em>Peszynski, </em>40 M.J. at 878 (dictum).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">As a general rule, service members, no less than other citizens, are entitled to most of the protections of the Constitution. <em>Chappell v. Wallace, </em>462 U.S. 296, 304, 103 S.Ct. 2362, 2367-68, 76 L.Ed.2d 586 (1983); <em>Brown v. Glines, </em>444 U.S. 348, 354, 100 S.Ct. 594, 599, 62 L.Ed.2d 540 (1980). But the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Court \u201chas long recognized that the military is, by necessity, a specialized society separate from civilian society.\u201d <em>Parker, </em>417 U.S. at 743, 94 S.Ct. at 2555. <em>See Chappell, </em>462 U.S. at 300, 103 S.Ct. at 2365-66; <em>Orloff v. Wil-loughby, </em>345 U.S. 83, 94, 73 S.Ct. 534, 540, 97 L.Ed. 842 (1953). The UCMJ may constitutionally \u201cregulate aspects of the conduct of members of the military which in the civilian sphere are left unregulated.\u201d <em>Parker, </em>417 U.S. at 749, 94 S.Ct. at 2558. In <em>Parker </em>the Supreme Court expanded on this theme: \u201cWhile the members of the military are not excluded from the protection granted by the [Constitution], the different character of the military community and of the military mission requires a different application of those protections.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 758, 94 S.Ct. at 2563.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">Some behavior that might be tolerable in the civilian community, such as adultery and fraternization (unduly personal relationships within an organization), could well prove disruptive in the military environment by undermining the effectiveness of a unit. Moreover, under certain circumstances, such sexual behavior might be discrediting to the military service. <em>Id. </em>at 759, 94 S.Ct. at 2563. If the effect of the conduct \u201cdirectly and palpably\u201d prejudices good order and discipline, undermines the mission, or discredits the service, the military may constitutionally prosecute such conduct, even though the Constitution would ordinarily protect such conduct from criminal prosecution if civilians engaged in it. <em>Id. </em>at 753, 94 S.Ct. at 2560. Military personnel must regularly submit to restrictions on their freedoms which would never pass constitutional muster on the \u201coutside.\u201d <em>See Goldman v. Weinberger, </em>475 U.S. 503, 510, 106 S.Ct. 1310, 1314-15, 89 L.Ed.2d 478 (1986)(holding constitutional uniform regulations which prohibited an Orthodox Jew from wearing a yarmulke while in uniform indoors); <em>Brown, </em>444 U.S. at 361, 100 S.Ct. at 603 (recognizing restrictions on the right of military personnel to petition for redress of grievances).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">We recognize that SECNAVINST 5300.26B is, in many respects, not a model of precise legal draftsmanship.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is no doubt because the nature of sexual harassment, which is criminal, varies only in degree from the way some Sailors and Marines conduct their interpersonal affairs, which can be boorish and coarse.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Even so, we conclude that SECNAVINST 5300.26B adequately defines what constitutes \u201csexual harassment,\u201d prohibits DON personnel from engaging in such harassment, and makes it clear that any violation of the relevant provisions \u201cby military personnel is punishable in accordance with the UCMJ....\u201d SECNAVINST 5300.26B, It 8c. Although perhaps somewhat \u201cimprecise,\u201d the standards contained in the instruction are \u201ccomprehensible.\u201d <em>Parker, </em>417 U.S. at 755, 94 S.Ct. at 2561.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The appellant argues at length that the criminality of actions under this instruction are based on \u201cthe vagary of individual sensibilities as an essential element \u2014 as opposed to the community\u2019s standards.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief and Assignment of Errors at 13; <em>see id. </em>at 12-16. However, we are not persuaded. The determination of whether \u201cunwelcome sexual behavior ... produces a work atmosphere which is offensive, intimidating, or abusive\u201d is tested against \u201cthe reasonable person standard.\u201d SECNAVINST 5300.26B, Enclosure (2), U 4; <em>see id., </em>116. This court made the following observation in <em>Peszynski:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">To constitute sexual harassment under Navy policy, the behavior must not only be of a certain nature, it must also <em>cause </em>a certain <em>result, </em>namely, interference with the victim\u2019s job performance or creation of a \u201chostile\u201d working environment. Those key features of sexual harassment are at least standards that can be measured objectively. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number><em>Peszynski, </em>40 MJ. at 881 (dictum)(emphasis in original).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">While there are hypothetical situations which might give us reason to set aside the conviction on the basis that the accused was convicted unfairly, the evidence in this case clearly established that the appellant\u2019s conduct both interfered with his victim\u2019s performance and created an intimidating, hostile, and offensive environment. Moreover, there is no doubt that the appellant was (or certainly should have been) aware that his actions constituted sexual harassment. The appellant advised several of his victims that it would be better if they would keep the discussions a secret between them, because he did not want to get into any \u201ctrouble.\u201d <em>See </em>Record at 35 (Mrs. Gandy); Record at 14-15 (after Airman Apprentice Penning rebuffed him when asked whether she would be willing to masturbate him or watch him while he masturbated, the appellant advised her: \u201cI don\u2019t want somebody coming up to me on Monday and, you know, ask me about this[.]\u201d); <em>see also </em>Record at 56 (requesting that Fireman Massie keep a lookout on his behalf while he masturbated in a room just off the quarterdeck).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">While there was no evidence which directly established that the appellant had received sexual-harassment training, during cross-examination of the victims the defense counsel elicited testimony that they had all received such training. As an 11-year veteran and supervisor, there is no question but that he should have been well aware that he was not to solicit his subordinates for sex or engage in sexual banter or activities which would likely make them uncomfortable. Nor could he have had any doubt that his actions in this case crossed well over the line into the area of criminal behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The appellant argues a slightly different theory as well: he contends that SECNA-VINST 5300.26B is unconstitutional because it might have a chilling effect on protected speech. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">Because the instruction clearly prohibited the appellant\u2019s conduct, he has no standing to challenge its constitutionality on the basis that it is vague and overbroad. As our higher court has held, an appellant has no standing to attack a law if he is not one of the \u201crare \u2018entrapped\u2019 innocents\u201d under the statute with which he is charged. <em>United States v. McGuinness, </em>35 M.J 149, 152 (C.M.A.1992) (quoting <em>United States v. Morison, </em>844 F.2d 1057, 1071 (4th Cir.1988)). <em>See Parker, </em>417 U.S. at 756, 94 S.Ct. at 2561-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">While a military accused may prevail in having a regulation declared overbroad where the defect is obvious, that is hardly the case here. The instruction at issue regulates both conduct and speech. To prevail on this constitutional challenge, the appellant must show that the overbreadth is not only \u201creal, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the [instruction\u2019s] plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 615, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2918, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). The clear purpose of the instruction is legitimate: to promote good order, discipline, and military effectiveness. The remote possibility that the appellant may have experienced an unconstitutional \u201cchilling\u201d of his free-speech right does not overcome the principle, discussed above, that if the effect of the service member\u2019s conduct \u201cdirectly and palpably\u201d prejudices good order and discipline, undermines the mission, or discredits the service, the military may constitutionally prosecute such conduct. <em>Parker, </em>417 U.S. at 753, 94 S.Ct. at 2560.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">After careful review of the excellent briefs of counsel, appellate case law, and the facts of this case, we hold that SECNAVINST 5300.26B is constitutional and was applied appropriately in this case. Therefore, this assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-14\"><em>Ex Post Facto </em>Punishment</p>\n<p id=\"ANI\">In his fourth assignment of error, the appellant contends that the 1996 amendment to Article 57, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 857, and addition of Article 58b, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 858b (1996), violate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number><em>ex post facto </em>clause of the Constitution. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 104-106, \u00a7\u00a7 1121, 1122, 110 Stat. 462, 463, <em>as amended by </em>Pub.L. No. 104-201, \u00a7 1068, 110 Stat. 2655 (1996). We agree that the appellant is entitled to administrative review of his claim and, if appropriate, restoration of any property illegally taken from him. Our superior court recently resolved a similar appellate issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-4\">Collection of any forfeitures, and execution of [any] reduction in grade prior to the date of the convening authority\u2019s action are hereby declared to be illegal. Any [illegal] forfeitures already collected from appellant and any pay and allowances withheld because of the illegal reduction in grade will be restored.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-5\"><em>United States v. Gorski, </em>47 M.J. 370, 375 (1997). In our decretal paragraph we will order appropriate administrative review.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Defective Court-Martial Order</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">In a summary assignment of error, the appellant contends that the military judge merged Specifications 1 and 2 of Charge I pursuant to his multiplicity motion. Therefore, he argues that the court-martial order, which indicates that the appellant was found guilty of both specifications, is incorrect and must be reissued.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Having studied the record of trial closely, we do not fully understand what the military judge intended to do. He first announced separate findings of guilty, <em>inter alia, </em>to Specifications 1 and 2 under Charge I. After the appellant and his counsel had resumed their seats, the military judge stated: \u201cNow Specifications 1 and 2 under Charge I will be merged into one Specification and treated as such. The other multiplicity motions are denied.\u201d Record at 95-96. We conclude that the military judge intended to find the appellant guilty of both of these Specifications, but to treat the two as multiplicious for the purpose of sentencing. Therefore, the promulgating order correctly sets forth \u201cthe findings or other disposition of each charge and specification^]\u201d Rule for Courts-Martial 1114(e)(1), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.)[hereinafter R.C.M].</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">We also note that the appellant did not comment on this alleged defect in his response to the Staff Judge Advocate\u2019s Recommendation. Since the two specifications are not \u201cfacially duplicative,\u201d the appellant waived the issue on appeal. <em>United States v. Lloyd, </em>46 M.J. 19, 23 (1997)(quoting <em>United States v. Broce, </em>488 U.S. 563, 575, 109 S.Ct. 757, 765-66, 102 L.Ed.2d 927 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">Therefore, this assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">Inquiry Into the Appellant\u2019s Mental Capacity</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">Finally, citing <em>United States v. Van Tassel, </em>38 M.J. 91 (C.M.A.1993), the appellant contends in a summary assignment of error that the convening authority erred by failing to order an inquiry into his mental capacity in light of trial defense counsel\u2019s representations in matters submitted pursuant to R.C.M. 1106. In the petition for clemency, the trial defense counsel requested that a qualified mental health care professional evaluate the appellant to determine if he suffered from one or more sexual disorders which manifested themselves in the behavior for which he was convicted. Having read the petition and the applicable law carefully, we conclude that this assignment of error is without merit. <em>See </em>Art. 50a, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 850a; R.C.M. 1107(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-14\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b673-15\">Accordingly, we affirm the findings and sentence, as approved on review below. The record of trial is returned to the Judge Advocate General of the Navy for appropriate remedial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-16\">Senior Judge CLARK and Judge LEO concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-15\">.

Because the issue was not raised at trial or on appeal, we will not discuss whether the preemption doctrine should have barred prosecution of the appellant\u2019s misconduct under Article 92, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 892. See <em>United States v. Asfeld, </em>30 M.J. 917, 923 (A.C.M.R.1990)(dictum). Because this matter was resolved at a special court-martial, the appellant was not subjected to an enhanced punishment. Moreover, unlike the subjective standard found wanting in the Army's sexual harassment order in <em>Asfeld, id., </em>Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5300.26B of 6 Jan. 1993, subj: Department of the Navy (DON) Policy on Sexual Harassment, incorporates a reasonable-person standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b670-6\">.
