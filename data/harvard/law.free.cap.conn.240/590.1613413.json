App. 705, 712-14, 673 A.2d 134 (1996). We conclude, contrary to the Appellate Court, that an automatic erasure under \u00a7 54-142a (c) that occurs thirteen months following the entry of a nolle prosequi constitutes a dismissal within the meaning of \u00a7 53-39a. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The opinion of the Appellate <em>Court sets </em>forth the relevant facts and procedural history. \u201cOn October 12, 1989, the plaintiff, a Shelton police officer, was arrested and charged with the sexual assault of a police informant. Subsequent to the arrest of the plaintiff, the informant disappeared. On January 24, 1991, the assistant state\u2019s attorney entered a nolle prosequi in open court in the criminal action against the plaintiff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The assistant state\u2019s attorney entered the nolle because of the disappearance of the informant. The plaintiffs counsel in the criminal action objected to the entry of the nolle and moved to dismiss the case. The trial court declined to dismiss the case and accepted the entry of the nolle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>pursuant to [General Statutes \u00a7 54-56b<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and] Practice Book \u00a7 726.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">\u201cOn March 4, 1992, the plaintiff brought [this] action against the defendant pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53-39a,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> seeking indemnification for the economic losses he incurred in the defense of the criminal charges brought against him. Subsequent to the filing of the complaint, the plaintiff and the defendant filed cross motions for summary judgment. On January 11, 1994, the trial court, <em>Rush, </em>J., denied the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granted the defendant\u2019s cross motion. In its memorandum of decision regarding the cross motions for summary judgment, the trial court determined that the plaintiff was not entitled to relief under \u00a7 53-39a. The trial court found as a matter of law that the plaintiff was not entitled to relief because \u00a7 53-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>39a provides for indemnification only where the criminal charges against a police officer are dismissed or where the officer is found not guilty, and that here, the underlying criminal action against the plaintiff was terminated by the entry of a nolle prosequi.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On January 27,1994, judgment was rendered in favor of the defendant and this appeal [to the Appellate Court] followed. In his initial appeal, the plaintiff claim[ed] that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">\u201cOn April 16,1994, during the pendency of his appeal, the plaintiff filed a motion in the trial court seeking to dismiss the criminal charges against him that had previously been nolled. On April 27,1994, the trial court in the criminal action, <em>Skolnick, J., </em>granted the motion to dismiss. On May 3, 1994, the plaintiff filed a motion in the trial court to open the judgment and to set aside the summary judgment in the present action, claiming that the recent dismissal of the nolled criminal charges made him eligible for indemnification under \u00a7 53-39a. On August 19, 1994, the trial court in the civil action, <em>Rush, J., </em>denied the plaintiffs motion to open and found that because the criminal charges against the plaintiff had been nolled, they were no longer pending and could not have been properly dismissed for the purpose of seeking indemnification under \u00a7 53-39a. On September 7, 1994, the plaintiff filed an amendment to his appeal, adding the claim that the trial court improperly denied the plaintiffs motion to open the judgment and to set aside the summary judgment.\u201d <em>Cislo </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>supra, 40 Conn. App. 706-709.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment, concluding that: (1) \u00a7 53-39a does not provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>for indemnification when criminal charges against a police officer have been nolled; and (2) the subsequent \u201cdismissal\u201d of the charges was of no effect because, following the nolle, there were no criminal charges pending against the plaintiff that could have been dismissed. Id., 715-16. This certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The plaintiff renews in this court the two claims that the Appellate Court rejected, namely, that: (1) under \u00a7 54-142a (c), a nolle followed by thirteen months is tantamount to a dismissal, thereby qualifying the plaintiff for indemnification under \u00a7 53-39a; and (2) in the alternative, the dismissal entered by Judge Skolnick was sufficient to qualify the plaintiff for indemnification under \u00a7 53-39a. We conclude that the entry of a nolle followed by the elapse of the statutory period of thirteen months, which results in the mandatory erasure of the pertinent records pursuant to \u00a7 54-142a (c), constitutes a dismissal for purposes of \u00a7 53-39a. We therefore need not consider the plaintiffs second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Section 54-142a (c) mandates the automatic erasure of records following the entry of a nolle and the passage of thirteen months. Whether this application constitutes a dismissal for purposes of \u00a7 53-39a is a question of statutory interpretation. \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431, 650 A.2d 557 (1994). In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number><em>Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New </em>Haven, 240 Conn. 422, 431, 692 A.2d 742 (1997). Insofar as the language of the statute will permit, we interpret it in accordance with the purpose of the statute, because legislation is a purposive act. Id., 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Section 53~39a, which was originally enacted in 1973; see Public Acts 1973, No. 73-627; authorizes indemnification for economic loss, including legal fees, incurred by officers of local police departments who are prosecuted for crimes allegedly committed by them in the course of their duties when the charges against them are dismissed or they are found not guilty. See, e.g., <em>Link v. Shelton, </em>186 Conn. 623, 627, 443 A.2d 902 (1982). The general puipose of the statute is to permit police officers to recoup the necessary expenses that they have incurred in defending themselves against unwarranted criminal charges arising out of their conduct in the course of their employment. Id., 628-29. Whether the charges are unwarranted, however, is determined objectively, namely, by whether an officer has been found not guilty or the charges have been dismissed. The plaintiff in the present case does not claim that he was found not guilty of the charges. The question, therefore, is whether the charges were \u201cdismissed\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 53-39a.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">We begin our inquiry by acknowledging the strength of the defendant\u2019s two principal contentions. The first is that \u00a7 53-39a, as a statute that abrogates or modifies governmental immunity, must be strictly construed. <em>Rawling </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>206 Conn. 100, 105, 537 A.2d 439 (1988). The second is that terms such as \u201cdismissal\u201d and \u201cnolle\u201d are ordinarily used as terms of art and, as such, are to be construed in accordance with their \u201cpeculiar and appropriate meaning in the law . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a); <em>Link </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>supra, 186 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Conn. 627.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These two contentions appear to lead to the conclusion that a nolle \u2014 even a nolle ultimately resulting in the erasure of records pursuant to \u00a7 54-142a (c) \u2014 cannot be considered to be a dismissal under \u00a7 53-39a. We nonetheless conclude that the entry of a nolle plus the passage of thirteen months, which results in the automatic erasure of relevant records under \u00a7 54-142a (c), constitutes a dismissal for the purposes of \u00a7 53-39a.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">First, although the term \u201cdismissed\u201d as used in \u00a7 53-39a was undoubtedly used as a term of art,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the legislative history of \u00a7 54-142a (c) indicates that the legislature did not intend the term \u201cnolle\u201d as used in \u00a7 54-142a (c) necessarily to be restricted to its ordinary specialized meaning. Instead, the indication is that the legislature specifically designed \u00a7 54-142a (c) in order to avoid the speedy trial violations that the legislature feared otherwise might occur. That fear was based on its interpretation of the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Klopfer </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>386 U.S. 213, 87 S. Ct. 988, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The erasure provisions of \u00a7 54-142a (c) have their origins in legislation enacted in 1963. Prior to 1963, General Statutes (1958 Rev.) \u00a7 54-90, which is the statutory progenitor of \u00a7 54-142a (c),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> provided simply that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>whenever a criminal case was nolled, \u201cthe clerk of the court shall make a record of such nolle.\u201d In 1963, \u00a7 54-90 was amended by No. 482 of the 1963 Public Acts, which required that the clerk also record not guilty findings, and provided that, upon a nolle or not guilty finding, \u201cthe court . . . upon petition of the arrested person or his heirs, may order all police and court records and records of the state\u2019s or prosecuting attorney pertaining to such case to be erased, provided at least three years have elapsed from the date of arrest.\u201d A petition to the court and court action were thus required for erasure of records in cases in which either a nolle or a not guilty finding had been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">In 1967, \u00a7 54-90 was amended further by No. 181 of the 1967 Public Acts in three significant respects: (1) the erasure of records was made possible when the charges had been dismissed, as well as when they had been nolled or the defendant had been found not guilty; (2) the waiting period was reduced from three years from the date of the arrest to one year from the date of nolle, dismissal or not guilty judgment; and (3) the legal effect of the erasure was specified \u2014 \u201c[n]o person who shall have been the subject of such an erasure order shall be deemed to have been arrested ab initio within the meaning of the general statutes with respect to the proceedings so erased.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1968) \u00a7 54-90.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Consequently, an individual who suc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>cessfully petitioned the court for erasure legally could state that he or she had not been arrested with respect to the relevant charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The next significant statutory amendment took place in 1969. By virtue of No. 229, \u00a7 1, of the 1969 Public Acts, \u00a7 54-90 was divided into subsections (a) through (e). Subsection (a) dealt with findings of not guilty and dismissals, and provided that upon such a finding or dismissal \u201call police and court records and records of the state\u2019s or prosecuting attorney pertaining to such charge <em>shall be immediately and automatically </em>erased.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1971) \u00a7 54-90 (a). Subsection (b) dealt with not guilty findings and dismissals <em>prior to October 1, 1969, </em>and provided for a petition by the individual, or his heirs, for erasure. Subsection (c) dealt with nolles, and continued to provide that a petition for erasure could be filed after the passage of one year from the date of the nolle. Subsection (d) dealt with erasure of records when an absolute pardon had been granted, and provided for a petition procedure similar to that of nolles or pre-Octo-ber 1, 1969 dismissals. Subsection (e) clarified the meaning of erasure by providing that the \u201cclerk of the court . . . shall not disclose to anyone information pertaining to any charge erased under any provision of this section. . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1971) \u00a7 54-90 (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>In 1972, \u00a7 54-90 (c) was amended by No. 20, \u00a7 2, of the 1972 Public Acts, which drew a functional equivalence between nolled cases and cases in which both a continuance had been granted and \u201cthere ha[d] been no prosecution or other disposition of the matter\u201d for a period of one year. In such continued cases, the act mandated that \u201cthe charge shall be construed to have been nolled as of the date of termination of such one-year period and a petition for erasure may thereafter be filed as provided in this subsection for nolled cases.\u201d Public Acts 1972, No. 20, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">In 1973, the legislature again amended \u00a7 54-90 (c) by No. 73-276 of the 1973 Public Acts. First, the one year period for nolled, but not for continued, cases was changed to thirteen months. Second, the petition procedure was eliminated for both types of cases, and the statute specifically provided that, with respect to nolled cases, \u201cif at least thirteen months have elapsed since such nolle, all police and court records and records of the state\u2019s or prosecuting attorney . . . pertaining to such charge shall be erased. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Public Acts 1973, No. 73-276, \u00a7 1. Thus, for the first time, the notion of an <em>automatic </em>erasure of records, rather than erasure triggered by a petition, was inserted into the statute. The legislative debate indicates that this automatic erasure mechanism had two purposes. The first was administrative: eliminating the petition process would ease the administrative burden on the courts.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The second was substantive: elimination of the petition procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>would be fairer to those who might not have known that they needed to file a petition.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The legislative colloquy also indicates a general legislative view that the erasure of records of nolled cases should be treated like the erasure of records of dismissed cases.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The legislative record of the 1973 amendment, however, does not disclose the origin or purpose of the thirteen month period. The legislature revisited the erasure provisions of \u00a7 54-90 (c) the very next year, however, and the legislative history of <em>that </em>amendment does shed some light on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">By virtue of No. 74-52 of the 1974 Public Acts,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the legislature made two significant changes in \u00a7 54-90 (c). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>First, it changed the one year time period applicable to continued cases to thirteen months, thus rendering that procedure for erasure of records consistent with the procedure for nolled cases. Second, it specifically provided, for both types of cases, that \u201csuch records shall be deemed erased by operation of law and the clerk or chief clerk or any person charged with the retention and control of such records shall not disclose to anyone their existence or any information pertaining to any charge so erased . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Public Acts 1974, No. 74-52, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The legislative debate in 1974 demonstrates that the legislature intended the 1974 legislation to be largely a clarification of its intent in enacting the 1973 legislation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The debate indicates that the legislature primarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>intended to reinforce the ability of those persons whose records had been erased after a nolle to state that, with respect to those erased charges, they had never been arrested.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The 1974 legislation was also aimed at easing the administrative burden that the erasure process placed on the courts, by the simple device of expanding the automatic erasure provision for nolled cases, which had been legislated in 1973, to dismissed cases as well.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This close relationship between the 1973 and 1974 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>amendments leads us to consider their legislative histories together.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The 1974 legislative record reveals the origin and meaning of the thirteen month period instituted for erasure of nolled cases in 1973 and continued cases in 1974. The provision was inspired by the 1967 United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Klopfer </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>supra, 386 U.S. 213.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Based on its interpretation of that case, the legislature considered the passage of a thirteen month period after a nolle to be constitutionally mandated, and thus to be the equivalent of, a dismissal.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">In <em>Klopfer, </em>the court held that the federal constitutional right to a speedy trial applies to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, and that this right affords \u201caffirmative protection against an unjustified postponement of trial for an accused discharged from custody . . . .\u201d Id., 219. The court reached this conclusion \u201cin the context of an application of an unusual North Carolina criminal pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>cedural device known as the \u2018nolle prosequi with leave.\u2019 \u201d Id., 214. Under that procedure, if the prosecutor enters a nolle prosequi with leave, the defendant is discharged but the statute of limitations is tolled, and the prosecutor may restore the case to the docket at any time in the future. Id., 214.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Although the entry of a nolle under our law does <em>not </em>toll the statute of limitations; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaston, </em>198 Conn. 435, 441, 503 A.2d 594 (1986); the legislature in 1973 and 1974 interpreted <em>Klopfer </em>to mandate that, following a nolle, a defendant cannot be kept under an indefinitely overhanging cloud of subsequent prosecution. The legislature perceived that, in order to render our law consistent with <em>Klopfer, </em>some additional procedural protection for a defendant whose case had been nolled was necessary, namely, the automatic erasure of records of the nolled case. Moreover, the legislative history; see footnote 23; demonstrates the legislature\u2019s belief and intention that, in order to comply with <em>Klopfer, </em>the erasure of records of nolled cases \u201cby operation of law\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 54-142a (c), following the requisite thirteen month period, should have the same practical effect as would the immediate erasure of records in dismissed cases pursuant to \u00a7 54-142a (a).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus, the history persuades us that, although the legislature used the term \u201cnolle\u201d in subsection (c) of \u00a7 54-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>142a, and although that term is ordinarily understood to have a technical meaning different from \u201cdismissal,\u201d the legal and practical effect of a nolle under subsection (c) was intended by the legislature to be the same as the legal and practical effect of a dismissal under subsection (a) of \u00a7 54-142a.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">We conclude that \u00a7 54-142a (c) should be construed to give it the legal and practical effect intended by its drafters, as revealed by the legislative history. That being so, we can perceive no sound reason why that construction should not also carry over to the provisions of \u00a7 53-39a. Although \u00a7 53-39a does, as we indicated previously, use the term \u201cdismissed\u201d in its technical sense, \u00a7 54-142a (c) does not use the term \u201cnolle\u201d in that sense and, instead, uses it in a context that renders the provisions of \u00a7 54-142a (c) the functional equivalent of a dismissal. Thus, given that a dismissal and erasure pursuant to \u00a7 54-142a (a) or (b) would trigger the application of \u00a7 53-39a, we conclude that the same result should follow from the erasure of records of a nolled case under \u00a7 54-142a (c). This construction is consistent with the general puipose of \u00a7 53-39a, namely, to indemnify police officers against whom criminal charges have been made but not prosecuted or of which the officer has been found not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">This construction of \u00a7 54-142a (c) is also consistent with much of the general jurisprudence of nolles and dismissals. Although they have some doctrinal and procedural differences; see footnote 9; in some legal respects they are treated as fungible. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaston, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 440 (nolle and dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>treated same for purposes of speedy trial analysis); <em>See </em>v. <em>Gosselin, </em>133 Conn. 158, 160-61, 48 A.2d 560 (1946) (nolle and dismissal treated same for purposes of subsequent action for malicious prosecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">In addition, we note that between 1973, when \u00a7 53-39a was first enacted, and October 1, 1987, there were two forms of dismissal under Practice Book \u00a7 819: with and without prejudice.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> A dismissal without prejudice did not prevent the state \u201cfrom subsequently charging the defendant with the same crime and [the accused was placed] in essentially the same position as he or she would have been had a nolle entered.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Talton, 209 Conn. 133, 141, 547 A.2d 543 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lenczyk, </em>11 Conn. App. 224, 225-26 n.1, 526 A.2d 554 (1987). Thus, when the legislature used the term \u201cdismissed\u201d in enacting \u00a7 53-39a in 1973, it must be presumed to have understood that a dismissal without prejudice \u2014 the functional equivalent of a nolle \u2014 would trigger the compensatory provisions of \u00a7 53-39a. Accordingly, in the absence of clear evidence that it intended to do so, the legislature should not be deemed to have excluded from indemnification functional equivalents of a dismissal without prejudice, such as a nolle and erasure pursuant to \u00a7 54-142a (c).
