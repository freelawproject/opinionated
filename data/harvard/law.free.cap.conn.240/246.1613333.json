Chotkowski, that the defendant, the state of Connecticut, improperly reduced his salary while he was employed at the state Veterans\u2019 Home and Hospital over twenty years ago. The principal issues raised by this appeal are: (1) whether a special act of the legislature; Spec. Acts 1991, No. 91-8;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> authorizing the plaintiff to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>present a claim to the claims commissioner requesting permission to bring an action against the state after the expiration of the limitation period applicable to his claim, constitutes an \u201cexclusive public emolument\u201d prohibited by article first, \u00a7 1, of the Connecticut constitution;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) if not, whether the trial court properly rejected the plaintiffs claims for breach of express contract, breach of implied contract and promissory estop-pel. The plaintiff commenced this action after the claims commissioner, acting pursuant to the authority conferred upon him by No. 91-8 of the 1991 Special Acts (S.A. 91-8), granted the plaintiff permission to sue the state. At trial, the state claimed that S.A. 91-8 violates article first, \u00a7 1, of the state constitution and, consequently, that the claims commissioner lacked jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs request for permission to sue the state. The state further maintained that even if S.A. 91-8 satisfies constitutional requirements, the plaintiff had failed to establish that he was entitled to relief under any of his claims. The trial court rejected the state\u2019s constitutional argument, but rendered judgment for the state on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to prove his claims. The plaintiff appealed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. In November, 1969, the plaintiff, a physician, left his private medical practice to accept an appointment as a \u201cspecial assistant\u201d at the state Veterans\u2019 Home and Hospital in Rocky Hill. In February, 1975, the position of special assistant was eliminated, and the plaintiff was reclassified as a \u201cprofessional specialist\u201d with no reduction in pay. The plaintiff then received notice of his proposed reclassification to \u201cchief of medicine.\u201d Through correspondence with various state administrators, the plaintiff protested his reclassification and corresponding salary reduction. On May 20, 1975, he forwarded a letter to the state department of personnel and administration requesting the \u201copportunity of appealing this decision before it should become final.\u201d The commissioner of personnel and administration, Frederic Rossomando, responded by letter dated June 3,1975 (Rossomando letter), in which, contrary to applicable law, he stated: \u201cI am advised that there is no existing statute or regulation which would permit such an appeal, either to me or any other appropriate body.\u201d Thereafter, on June 6, 1975, the plaintiff was reclassified to the position of \u201cchief of medicine,\u201d and his salary was reduced by $303.64 biweekly.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">On April 8, 1976, nearly one year later, the plaintiffs employment was terminated as a result of his continued conflicts with administration officials over his salary reduction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff appealed the termination to the state personnel appeal board (board), which dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the appeal, concluding that the plaintiff was not entitled to review of his claims because he was not a \u201cpermanent employee holding a position in the classified service\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 5-202 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs administrative appeal of the board\u2019s decision was sustained by the trial court, <em>Pickett, J., </em>on the ground that the plaintiff was a permanent employee in the classified state service for purposes of \u00a7 5-202 (a). The board appealed to this court, and we affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>Chotkowski </em>v. <em>Connecticut Personnel Appeal Board, </em>176 Conn. 1, 404 A.2d 868 (1978). The parties eventually agreed to a settlement of the plaintiffs employment termination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">After settling his employment termination claim, the plaintiff filed a notice of claim with the claims commissioner under General Statutes \u00a7 4-147<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> requesting permission to sue the state for lost wages based upon the allegedly improper reclassification and salary reduction. The claims commissioner rejected the plaintiffs claim, concluding that it was barred by the one year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>limitation for presenting claims against the state prescribed by General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 4-148 (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Thereafter, the legislature, at the plaintiffs urging, passed No. 85-24 of the 1985 Special Acts (S.A. 85-24),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which authorized the plaintiff to prosecute his claim against the state despite his failure to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 4-148 (a). The plaintiff then renewed his claim to the claims commissioner, who granted the plaintiff permission to sue the state in accordance with General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 4-160 (a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>The plaintiff subsequently commenced an action against the state alleging breach of contract and promissory estoppel. The trial court, <em>O'Neill, </em>-/., granted the state\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiff, as a permanent employee in the classified state service, enjoyed only statutory, and not contractual, employment rights. The plaintiff appealed to this court and we held that S.A. 85-24 constituted an \u201cexclusive public emolument\u201d prohibited by article first, \u00a7 1, of the state constitution. Accordingly, we remanded the case to the trial court with direction to dismiss the plaintiffs action for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Chotkowski </em>v. <em>State, </em>213 Conn. 13, 566 A.2d 419 (1989) <em>(Chotkowski II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The legislature then enacted No. 90-284 of the 1990 Public Acts (P.A. 90-284), now codified at \u00a7 4-148 (b),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which provides that the legislature, by special act, may excuse a claimant\u2019s failure to file a timely notice with the claims commissioner provided that the legislature \u201cdeems such authorization to be just and equitable and makes an express finding that such authorization is supported by compelling equitable circumstances and would serve a public purpose.\u201d Section 4-148 (b) also purports to ensure that the legislature\u2019s \u201cfinding shall not be subject to review by the superior court.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Acting under the aegis of \u00a7 4-148 (b), the legislature, again at the request of the plaintiff, enacted S.A. 91-8, which, like S.A. 85-24, authorizes the plaintiff to present his claim to the claims commissioner notwithstanding his lack of compliance with \u00a7 4-148 (a). Unlike S.A. 85-24, however, S.A. 91-8 is predicated upon an express legislative finding that the plaintiff \u201cfailed to timely file a notice of a claim against the state with the claims commissioner because he was misinformed by a state official and was misled by such official into believing that he had no right of redress against the state for the damages he allegedly suffered,\u201d and, further, \u201cthat there are compelling equitable circumstances to support such authorization and that such authorization would serve a public purpose.\u201d See footnote 1. The plaintiff, upon passage of S.A. 91-8, renewed his claim with the claims commissioner, who again granted him permission to bring an action against the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The plaintiff then commenced this suit alleging breach of express contract, breach of implied contract and promissory estoppel.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The state moved to dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>the action for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that S.A. 91-8 violates article first, \u00a7 1, of the state constitution. The trial court, <em>Stengel, J., </em>denied the state\u2019s motion. The state thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment in which it renewed its constitutional challenge to S.A. 91-8 and, in addition, claimed that (1) the plaintiffs request for permission to sue the state was barred by \u00a7 4-148 (c), and (2) the plaintiff had failed to state a legally sufficient cause of action because his employment rights were statutory, rather than contractual, in nature. The trial court, <em>Fineberg, J., </em>denied the state\u2019s motion on the ground that there were disputed factual issues material to the plaintiffs claims; see Practice Book \u00a7 378 et seq.; see also <em>Doty </em>v. <em>Mucci, </em>238 Conn. 800, 805, 679 A.2d 945 (1996); and a trial to the court ensued. At the conclusion of the trial, the court, <em>Fineberg, J., </em>rendered judgment for the state, concluding that the plaintiff had failed to establish that his employment with the state gave rise to any contractual rights and, further, that he had failed to prove the elements of his promissory estoppel claim.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly determined that he had failed to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>that he was entitled to relief under each of his claims.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The state contends that the trial court improperly rejected its claim that S.A. 91-8 violates article first, \u00a7 1, of the state constitution and that the claims commissioner did not have jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs claim requesting permission to sue the state. The state further contends that even if S.A. 91-8 is constitutional, the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiffs action because the claim that he filed with the claims commissioner was barred by both General Statutes \u00a7 4-142<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and General Statutes \u00a7 4-148 (c).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Finally, the state maintains that even if the claims commissioner had jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs request for permission to bring this action, the trial court properly concluded that the plaintiff had failed to establish that he was entitled to relief under any of his claims.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Because we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusions, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Before turning to the plaintiffs contention that the trial court improperly rejected his claims, we must first consider the state\u2019s claim that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiffs action. See <em>Cannata </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>239 Conn. 124, 134, 680 A.2d 1329 (1996); <em>Figueroa </em>v. <em>C &amp; S Ball Bearing, </em>237 Conn. 1, 4, 675 A.2d 845 (1996). The state\u2019s principal contention is that S.A. 91-8 violates the prohibition against \u201cexclusive public emoluments or privileges from the community\u201d contained in article first, \u00a7 1, of the Connecticut constitution and, consequently, that the claims commissioner lacked authority to entertain the plaintiffs request for permission to sue the state. The trial court concluded that S.A. 91-8 serves a valid public purpose and, therefore, that it does not run afoul of article first, \u00a7 1. We agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">To prevail under article first, \u00a7 1, of our constitution, the state must demonstrate that \u201cthe sole objective of the General Assembly is to grant personal gain or advantage to an individual.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Higgins </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>139 Conn. 102, 106, 90 A.2d 862 (1952). If, however, an enactment serves a legitimate <em>public </em>purpose, then it will withstand a challenge under article first, \u00a7 1. <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>233 Conn. 437, 458-59, 664 A.2d 279 (1995); <em>Tough </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>162 Conn. 274, 292, 294 A.2d 67 (1972). Moreover, we conduct our review of S.A. 91-8 mindful that \u201clegislative enactments carry with them a strong presumption of constitutionality, and that a party challenging the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>stitutionality of a validly enacted statute bears the heavy burden of proving the statute unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Beccia </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>192 Conn. 127, 133, 470 A.2d 1202 (1984); see also <em>Farad </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>211 Conn. 166, 168, 558 A.2d 234 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court lacked authority to consider the propriety of the legislative finding that S.A. 91-8 serves a public purpose because such review is barred by \u00a7 4-148 (b), which provides in pertinent part that \u201c[sjuch finding shall not be subject to review by the superior court.\u201d See footnote 10. The plaintiff maintains that this legislative prohibition against judicial review is valid because \u00a7 4-148 (b) deals with the doctrine of sovereign immunity, and \u201c[i]t is a matter for the legislature, not this court, to determine when our state\u2019s sovereign immunity should be waived.\u201d <em>Struckman </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>205 Conn. 542, 558, 534 A.2d 888 (1987). We disagree. Because an enactment must serve a valid public purpose in order to avoid the prohibition against the granting of \u201cexclusive public emoluments and privileges\u201d contained in article first, \u00a7 1, of the state constitution, the determination of whether an enactment serves such a purpose is necessarily one of constitutional magnitude. It is the court\u2019s duty to ensure that legislative action falls within constitutional boundaries; <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177-78, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803); <em>Szarwak </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>167 Conn. 10, 27, 355 A.2d 49 (1974); even if that action involves a waiver of the immunity from suit enjoyed by the state under the common law. Consequently, the legislature cannot \u201cby mere fiat or finding, make \u2018public\u2019 a truly \u2018private\u2019 purpose . . . .Its findings and statements about what is or is not \u2018public\u2019 cannot be binding upon the court. <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Adorno, </em>[133 Conn. 511, 517, 52 A.2d 702 (1947)].\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Connecticut Product Development Corp., </em>167 Conn. 111, 116 n.2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>355 A.2d 72 (1974). Accordingly, \u00a7 4-148 (b) would be constitutionally infirm to the extent that it were construed to shield from judicial review a legislative determination that its enactment meets the requirements of article first, \u00a7 1, of our state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The scope of our review as to whether an enactment serves a public purpose is limited. \u201c[Wjhat constitutes a public purpose is primarily a question for the legislature, and its determination should not be reversed by the court unless it is manifestly and palpably incorrect.\u201d <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>140 Conn. 8, 15, 98 A.2d 523 (1953); see also <em>Wilson v. Connecticut Product Development Corp., </em>supra, 167 Conn. 115-16; <em>Roan v. Connecticut Industrial Building Commission, </em>150 Conn. 333, 345, 189 A.2d 399 (1963). \u201c[W]e are not to assess [the constitutionality of an act] in the light of what we think of the wisdom and discernment of the law-making body in the particular instance. Rather we are bound to approach the question from the standpoint of upholding the legislation as a valid enactment unless there is no reasonable ground upon which it can be sustained.\u201d <em>Roan v. Connecticut Industrial Building Commission, </em>supra, 338; see also <em>Warner v. Gabb, </em>139 Conn. 310, 313, 93 A.2d 487 (1952). Thus, \u201cif there be the least possibility that making the gift will be promotive in any degree of the public welfare, it becomes a question of policy and not of natural justice; and the determination of the legislature is conclusive.\u201d <em>Lyman v. Adorno, </em>supra, 133 Conn. 524. In other words, if we can discern \u201cany conceivable justification for [the] challenged legislation from the public viewpoint\u201d; <em>Merly v. State, </em>211 Conn. 199, 205, 558 A.2d 977 (1989); we are bound to uphold it against a constitutional challenge predicated on article first, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Although \u201c[w]e have taken abroad view of the legislative goals that may constitute a \u2018public puipose\u2019 \u201d; <em>Beccia v. Waterbury, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 134; \u201c[b]ecause the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>elements of a public purpose vary as much as the circumstance in which the term is appropriate, each case must be determined on its own peculiar facts.\u201d <em>Tough </em>v. Ives, supra, 162 Conn. 292. In general, however, we have found \u201cthat an act serves a public purpose under article first, \u00a7 1, when it promote[s] the welfare of the state ... or when the principal reason for the appropriation is to benefit the public. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Beccia </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 134; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Connecticut Product Development Corp., </em>supra, 167 Conn. 117. Furthermore, an enactment will be deemed to serve a valid public purpose, even though it confers a direct benefit upon a particular individual, if it remedies an injustice done to that individual for which the state itself bears responsibility. <em>Sanger </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>124 Conn. 183, 189, 198 A. 746 (1938); see also <em>Chotkowski II, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 18; <em>Merly </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 213-14; <em>Vecchio </em>v. <em>Sewer Authority, </em>176 Conn. 497, 506-507, 408 A.2d 254 (1979); <em>Hillier </em>v. <em>East Hartford, </em>167 Conn. 100, 108-109, 355 A.2d 1 (1974). In such circumstances, the benefit conferred upon a private party by the legislature may be viewed as incidental to the overarching public interest that is served in remedying an injustice caused by the state.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>In this case, the legislature, acting on the basis of undisputed testimony detailing the circumstances surrounding the plaintiffs failure to file a claim within the period prescribed by \u00a7 4-148 (a); see Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 2, 1991 Sess., pp. 610-14; expressly found that the plaintiff had failed to comply with \u00a7 4-148 (a) \u201cbecause he was misinformed by a state official and was misled by such official into believing that he had no right of redress against the state for the damages he allegedly suffered.\u201d S.A. 91-8; see footnote 1. The legislature further concluded that the plaintiffs request for special authorization to file a late claim with the claims commissioner was supported by \u201ccompelling equitable circumstances\u201d and that \u201csuch authorization would serve a public purpose.\u201d S.A. 91-8; see footnote 1. These conclusions are supported by the testimony presented to the legislature and, as the trial court determined, by the evidence adduced at trial. We cannot conclude, therefore, that the legislative findings and conclusions are manifestly and palpably incorrect.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">As noted by the plaintiff, the circumstances of this case are similar to those of <em>Sanger v. Bridgeport, </em>supra, 124 Conn. 183, in which we upheld the constitutionality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>of a special act validating a statutorily defective notice to the city of Bridgeport alleging injuries suffered by the plaintiff due to a defective sidewalk. In <em>Sanger, </em>the plaintiff had \u201calleged that [the defective notice] was prepared by an assistant to the city clerk of Bridgeport, upon whom the plaintiff relied for its preparation and to whom was given all essential facts which were necessary for a notice sufficient to the requirements of the statute . . . .\u201d Id., 185. In concluding that the challenged legislation did not contravene constitutional requirements, we recognized that there exist \u201cstrong equitable grounds for legislative interference\u201d when a government official has caused a procedural default that adversely affects the substantive rights of the party seeking legislative intervention. Id., 189; see also <em>Chot-kowski II, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 18. Here, as in <em>Sanger, </em>the challenged special act seeks to remedy an inequity that the legislature rationally concluded had resulted from the plaintiffs reasonable reliance on the misleading conduct of a state official.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The state contends that <em>Chotkowski II </em>disposes of the plaintiffs claim that a valid public purpose is served by allowing the plaintiff to prosecute his claim against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>the state. The state, however, miscontraes the scope of our decision in <em>Chotkowski II, </em>wherein the plaintiff disputed the state\u2019s constitutional challenge to S.A. 85-24 solely on the ground that equity required the enactment of such remedial legislation in light of the promise of permanent employment allegedly made to him by the state. Thus, as we expressly noted in <em>Chotkowski II, </em>\u201c[the plaintiff] does not even claim . . . that the state caused the delay in presenting his claim to the claims commissioner .... The only consideration he advances is that the legislature may have intended to recognize an honorary obligation so that substantial justice could be realized. . . . The honorary obligation relied upon by the plaintiff, however, is based wholly upon the asserted merit of his cause of action for breach of contract and does not implicate the delay in filing his claim with the claims commissioner.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chotkowski II, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Similarly, nowhere does the legislative history of S.A. 85-24 indicate that the legislature was apprised of the Rossomando letter or of the plaintiffs failure to file a claim in a timely manner in reliance on the representations contained therein. Indeed, because the testimony in support of S.A. 85-24 focused solely upon the alleged merit of the plaintiffs claim against the state; see Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 4, 1985 Sess., pp. 1090-92, 1249; we must presume that the enactment of S.A. 85-24 was predicated on that information. Thus, our conclusion in <em>Chotkowski II </em>that, S.A. 85-24 did not serve a public purpose does not preclude a determination that S.A. 91-8 satisfies that constitutional requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">We conclude, therefore, that because S.A. 91-8 serves a legitimate public purpose, it does not violate article first, \u00a7 1, of the Connecticut constitution. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>the trial court properly rejected the state\u2019s constitutional challenge to S.A. 91-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">We next consider the state\u2019s argument that the plaintiffs claim requesting permission to sue the state was barred by \u00a7 4-142. See footnote 15. We are not persuaded by this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">The claims commissioner has authority to hear all claims against the state except those expressly enumerated in \u00a7 4-142. The state first contends that the plaintiffs claim was barred by \u00a7 4-142 (1), which excepts from the claims commissioner\u2019s jurisdiction \u201c[cjlaims for the periodic payment of disability, pension, retirement or other employment benefits.\u201d The state further maintains that the plaintiff was entitled to a review of his salary reduction by the personnel appeal board under \u00a7 5-202<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and, consequently, that consideration of his claim by the claims commissioner was precluded by \u00a7 4-142 (3), which bars the claims commissioner\u2019s review of \u201cclaims for which an administrative hearing procedure otherwise is established by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">The plaintiffs claim that his wages were improperly reduced by the state when he was reclassified to the position of chief of medicine does not fall into either of these two categories limiting the claims commissioner\u2019s jurisdiction. With respect to \u00a7 4-142 (1), the plaintiff does not claim that he was improperly deprived of a periodic payment of the kind enumerated therein; instead, he seeks lump sum damages for his lost wages. Furthermore, because the plaintiffs action against the state is predicated solely on principles of contract law, it does not appear that the board was authorized under \u00a7 5-202 to afford the plaintiff the contract remedy that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>he seeks.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We are not persuaded, therefore, that the plaintiff had an available administrative remedy within the meaning of \u00a7 4-142 (3). Accordingly, we agree with the trial court that the plaintiffs claim requesting permission to bring this action against the state was not barred by \u00a7 4-142.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The state also claims that the plaintiffs request for permission to sue the state was foreclosed by \u00a7 4-148 (c), which provides in pertinent part that \u201cno claim once considered by the claims commissioner, by the general assembly or in a judicial proceeding shall again be presented against the state in any manner.\u201d See footnote 16. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">As the state maintains, the principle underlying \u00a7 4-148 (c) is that of res judicata. That common law doctrine, also known as \u201cclaim preclusion, [provides that] a former judgment on a claim, if rendered on the merits, is an absolute bar to a subsequent action on the same claim.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Delahunty </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>236 Conn. 582, 589, 674 A.2d 1290 (1996). Although the state concedes that our judgment in <em>Chotkowski II </em>ordering the dismissal of the plaintiffs action did not entail a consideration of the merits of the plaintiffs claim, the state maintains that \u00a7 4-148 (c) imposes a broader prohibition against successive claims than does the doctrine of res judicata. Under the interpretation urged by the state, \u00a7 4-148 (c) bars a claim against the state if that claim has already been reviewed by the claims commissioner, the legislature or the judiciary whether or not the reviewing body considered the merits of the claim.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>We reject this interpretation for two principal reasons. First, in the absence of any persuasive reason to the contrary, we are not inclined to construe \u00a7 4-148 (c) more narrowly than the common law doctrine upon which it is concededly based.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Second, under the state\u2019s construction of \u00a7 4-148 (c), a claimant whose request for permission to sue the state has been rejected as untimely by the claims commissioner would be precluded from seeking a special act of the legislature waiving the applicable limitation period even though that claimant could have established that the filing delay had been caused by the state.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We are not persuaded that the legislature intended such a result. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>237 Conn. 501, 514-15, 680 A.2d 956 (1996) (law favors sensible and rational construction of statute rather than one leading to difficult and possibly bizarre consequences). Accordingly, we reject the state\u2019s argument that \u00a7 4-148 (c) bars the claims commissioner from considering the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">We now turn to the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly rendered judgment for the state on the ground that the plaintiff, as a classified state employee, enjoyed only statutory, and not contractual, employment rights. We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>We have previously concluded that state employees do not have contractual employment rights absent a clear and unambiguous expression of legislative intent to the contrary. <em>Pineman </em>v. <em>Oechslin, </em>195 Conn. 405, 416, 488 A.2d 803 (1985); see also <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>State, </em>213 Conn. 54, 65 n.17, 566 A.2d 670 (1989). If this were not the case, \u201cthe state would be powerless to reduce the pay or shorten the tenure of any state employee without posing a possible contract clause violation. We do not believe that such a heavy obligation may be imposed upon the state unless the legislature clearly evidences an intent to assume it.\u201d <em>Pineman </em>v. <em>Oechslin, </em>supra, 416; see also <em>National R. Passenger Corp. </em>v. <em>Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co., </em>470 U.S. 451, 465-66, 105 S. Ct. 1441, 84 L. Ed. 2d 432 (1985) (absent clear indication by legislature to contrary, presumption is that legislation does not create private contractual rights but merely sets policy to be followed until legislature ordains otherwise). Thus, state employees serve by appointment, and \u201ctheir entitlement to pay and other benefits \u2018must be determined by reference to the statutes and regulations governing [compensation], rather than to ordinary contract principles.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kizas </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>707 F.2d 524, 535 (D.C. Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1042, 104 S. Ct. 709, 79 L. Ed. 2d 173 (1984), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Larionoff, </em>431 U.S. 864, 869, 97 S. Ct. 2150, 53 L. Ed. 2d 48 (1977). Accordingly, the plaintiff can prevail on his contract claims only if he can establish that the legislature intended to bind the state contractually under the statutory scheme pursuant to which he was appointed. <em>See Pineman v. Oechslin, </em>supra, 416; see also <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>302 U.S. 74, 78, 58 S. Ct. 98, 82 L. Ed. 57 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The plaintiff points to nothing in the statutes applicable to classified state employees; see General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7\u00a7 5-200 through 5-208; or elsewhere in our laws and regulations, to support his claim of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>tractual entitlement Because his express and implied contract<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> claims are predicated on the existence of rights that he does not possess, the trial court properly concluded that the plaintiff is not entitled to relief on those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The trial court also properly determined that the plaintiff could not prevail on his claim of promissory estoppel. \u201cUnder our well-established law, any claim of estoppel is predicated on proof of two essential elements: the party against whom estoppel is claimed must do or say something calculated or intended to induce another party to believe that certain facts exist and to act on that belief; and the other party must change its position in reliance on those facts, thereby incurring some injury. . . . It is fundamental that a person who claims an estoppel must show that he has exercised due diligence to know the truth, and that he not only did not know the true state of things but also lacked any reasonably available means of acquiring knowledge.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Voog, </em>233 Conn. 352, 366, 659 A.2d 172 (1995); see also <em>D\u2019Ulisse-Cupo </em>v. <em>Board of Directors of Notre Dame High School, </em>202 Conn. 206, 213, 520 A.2d 217 (1987). \u201cIn addition, estoppel against a public agency is limited and may be invoked: (1) only with great caution; (2) only when the action in question has been induced by an agent having authority in such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>matters; and (3) only when special circumstances make it highly inequitable or oppressive not to estop the agency.\u201d <em>Kimberly-Clark Corp. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>204 Conn. 137, 148, 527 A.2d 679 (1987). Finally, a claim for promissory estoppel will not lie against the state unless \u201cthe party claiming estoppel would be subjected to substantial loss if the public agency were permitted to negate the acts of its agents.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The evidence fully supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the plaintiff failed to prove his claim of estoppel. The only statement made by state officials to the plaintiff was that \u201che would be paid $35,000.00 per year, and . . . that said rate of pay would be subject to future increases.\u201d As the trial court found, the facts alleged and proven by the plaintiff were \u201cneither sufficiently promissory nor sufficiently definite\u201d to support the plaintiffs claim. See <em>D\u2019Ulisse-Cupo </em>v. <em>Board of Directors of Notre Dame High School, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 214. Moreover, the plaintiff offered no proof that the state officials were empowered to bind the state; see, e.g., <em>Kimberly-Clark Corp. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 148; or that the plaintiff exercised due diligence in seeking to ascertain whether they were authorized to do so. See <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Voog, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 366. Because the plaintiff failed to establish the essential elements of his claim of promissory estoppel, the trial court properly rendered judgment for the state with respect to that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The plaintiff contends that his rights vis-a-vis the state are not limited to the statutory rights that he possessed in 1975 because, he claims, \u00a7 4-160 places the state in the position of a private person and, therefore, allows any claims that could be brought against a private person to be brought against the state, including claims for breach of an employment contract. It is true that \u00a7 4-160 provides for the waiver of the state\u2019s sovereign immunity, thus making the state\u2019s rights and liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>\u201ccoextensive with and equal to those of a private person in like circumstances.\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>State, </em>189 Conn. 550, 557, 457 A.2d 304 (1983). The sole purpose of \u00a7 4-160, however, is to remove the bar of sovereign immunity when the claims commissioner determines that it would be \u201cjust and equitable\u201d to permit a claimant to seek redress against the state. See footnote 8. Contrary to the plaintiffs claim, there is no indication that the legislature, in empowering the claims commissioner to waive the state\u2019s immunity from suit, intended to enhance or otherwise to modify a plaintiffs substantive rights. Consequently, \u00a7 4-160 cannot be construed to alter the terms and conditions of the plaintiffs state employment or otherwise affect the fundamental nature of the parties\u2019 relationship.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">In this opinion KATZ, MCDONALD and PETERS, JS., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-8\"> Special Acts 1991, No. 91-8, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning the Claim Against the State of Ludmil Chotkowski,\u201d provides: \u201cBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Assembly convened:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">\u201c(a) Notwithstanding the failure to file a proper notice of a claim against the state of Connecticut with the clerk of the office of the claims commissioner, as required by section 4-147 of the general statutes, within the time specified by section 4-148 of the general statutes, and notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of section 4-148 of the general statutes barring the presentment of a claim once considered by the claims commissioner, by the general assembly or in a judicial proceeding, Ludmil Chotkowski is authorized to present his claim against the state to the claims commissioner, provided he files a notice of such claim with the clerk of the office of tire claims commissioner in accordance with section 4-147 not later than October 1, 1991.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-11\">\u201c(b) The general assembly finds that: In 1975 Ludmil Chotkowski was employed by the state as a physician at the Rocky Hill Veterans\u2019 Home and Hospital; that in 1975 he received notice that Iris job title would be changed and his salary would be reduced; that Ludmil Chotkowski in a letter dated May 20, 1975 wrote to the department of personnel and administration to request the \u2018opportunity of appealing this decision before it should become final\u2019; that the commissioner of personnel and administration advised Ludmil Chotkowsld in a letter dated June 3, 1975 that \u2018there is no existing statute or regulation which would permit such an appeal, either to me or any other appropriate body\u2019; that subsequently in 1975 Ludmil Chotkowski\u2019s job title was changed and Iris salary was reduced; and that the preceding findings were not contradicted by any testimony on the record at legislative public hearings held on March 14, 1983, March 29, 1985, and March 11, 1991.

Thus, legislation cannot survive a constitutional challenge under article first, \u00a7 1, if it excuses a party\u2019s failure to comply with a statutory notice requirement simply because the noncompliance precludes consideration of the merits of the party\u2019s claim. <em>Merly </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 214; <em>Vecchio </em>v. <em>Sewer Authority, </em>supra, 506-507; <em>Hillier </em>v. <em>East Hartford, </em>supra, 108-109.

As the trial court determined, however, the undisputed facts and reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom support the express legislative findings and conclusions underlying the enactment of S.A. 91-8. In light of the deference we must accord the legislature in respect to its determinal ion that, the challenged legislation serves a public purpose; see <em>Merly </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 205; <em>Roan </em>v. <em>Connecticut Industrial Building Commission, </em>supra, 150 Conn. 338; <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Adorno, </em>supra, 133 Conn. 524; and because the legislature rationally could have concluded that the plaintiff reasonably relied on the representations contained in the Rossomando letter in failing to seek redress in a timely manner, we must reject the state\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b284-7\"> Although the state notes that \u201cone commentator has stated that <em>Sanger </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, [124 Conn. 183] has Very little vitality\u2019 and \u2018may well not be the law in Connecticut today\u2019 W.

Rather, the state seeks to distinguish <em>Sanger </em>from this case on the ground that <em>Sanger </em>provided a more compelling factual basis for legislative intervention. In light of the legislative finding that the Rossomando letter misled the plaintiff into believing that he had no recourse against the state, we conclude that this case is indistinguishable from <em>Sanger </em>with respect to the factual issue of critical constitutional significance, namely, whether the state caused the procedural default that the legislature sought to remedy. Furthermore, we see no reason to overrule <em>Sanger </em>because we perceive no constitutional infirmity in an enactment that reinstates a claimant\u2019s right to seek redress against a governmental entity whose employee was responsible for the claimant\u2019s noncompliance with a statutory notice requirement promulgated solely for the benefit of that entity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b286-10\"> See footnote 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b287-9\"> Indeed, the Rossomando letter itself indicated that the plaintiff had no administrative recourse with respect to his reclassification to the position of chief of medicine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b287-10\"> Special Act 91-8 (c) expressly provides that \u201c[t]he state shall be barred from . . . setting up the fact that the claim had once been considered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>the claims commissioner, by the general assembly or in a judicial proceeding as defenses to [the plaintiffs] claim.\u201d See footnote 1.

I disagree with part IV of the majority opinion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which states that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>by adopting General Statutes \u00a7 4-160, the legislature did not intend to enhance the plaintiffs substantive rights against the state. I conclude, on the basis of the plain language of \u00a7 4-160, its legislative history, several recent decisions of this court, and the construction of similar statutes by other jurisdictions and the United States Supreme Court, that the state stands in the shoes of a private person, for liability purposes, when the state claims commissioner, pursuant to \u00a7 4-160, finds that it is just and equitable to authorize a claimant to bring an action against the state. In other words, if a private person would be liable for the claim, then the state would also be liable. Before setting forth my analysis, it is helpful to put this issue in its historical setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Historically, the legislature of this state would grant compensation, through the enactment of special acts, to citizens who were injured or who had other claims against the state. Indeed, prior to 1959, before the legislature created the office of the claims commission, the General Assembly in the first instance considered what action, if any, was appropriate on claims made against the state.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That is, the General Assembly either authorized payment of a claim against the state,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or authorized an action to be brought against the state in court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>standard for the recompense was whether justice required the state to pay for an injury it had caused. It is important to note that the predicate was not that the state was hable for such compensation, but, rather, that justice and equity required that the state make the payment or that the state respond to an action as if it were a private person. Indeed, in a special act that reflects facts that are strikingly similar to the present case, the legislature, in 1959, authorized a compensatory payment to a state employee because he was relieved of his duties and subsequently reinstated at a lower salary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">It reached a point where the number of claims submitted to the legislature became a major burden and this interfered with the more important function of enacting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>general legislation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When legislation was proposed by the legislative council<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to establish a claims commission in order to relieve the General Assembly of a major portion of this burden, its director, George Oberst, explained the need to establish this alternative procedure for the processing of claims in order to ensure that \u201cequity and justice\u201d is done.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A statutory procedure for the disposition of claims against the state, to be administered by a claims commission, was adopted by the enactment of Public Acts 1959, No. 685. Subsequently, in 1975, the legislature substituted a claims commissioner (commissioner) for the claims commission. See Public Acts 1975, No. 75-605. Therefore, the commissioner is in reality the conscience of the state, assuming in part the prior role of the legislature to ensure that justice and equity is done. It is the commissioner who now determines what claims should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>paid,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> what claims should be referred to the legislature for payment,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or which claimants should be authorized to institute an action against the state.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The basis for the plaintiffs claim that he filed with the commissioner, and upon which he was authorized to bring an action, can be crystallized as breach of contract and promissory estoppel.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The state argued before the commissioner that Special Acts 1991, No. 91-8, the act that validated the plaintiffs untimely notice of claim, was unconstitutional and beyond the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>commissioner\u2019s jurisdiction. Because of this argument, the commissioner, instead of adjudicating the claim himself pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-158 or making a recommendation to the legislature of an amount for payment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-159, authorized the plaintiff to institute this action pursuant to \u00a7 4-160.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The trial court, finding that <em>Pineman </em>v. <em>Oechslin, </em>195 Conn. 405, 488 A.2d 803 (1985),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> was controlling, rejected the plaintiffs breach of contract claim against the state. Also, the trial court, in finding that the requirements to hold a public agency responsible based upon promissory estoppel were not met; see <em>Kimberly-Clark Corp. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>204 Conn. 137, 148, 527 A.2d 679 (1987);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Pineman </em>v. <em>Oechslin, </em>supra, 415;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>rejected that claim. Neither the trial court nor this court are correct in relying on <em>Pineman </em>and <em>Kimberly-Clark Corp., </em>because those cases were direct actions against the state and are not relevant to the standards that must be applied once an action has been authorized by the commissioner.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Indeed, the majority\u2019s entire analysis is predicated on Pineman<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and <em>Kimberly-Clark Corp.,</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>without any recognition that in neither of those cases did the commissioner authorize an action against the state pursuant to \u00a7 4-160.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">This present action against the state must be viewed through the lens of \u00a7 4-160,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> upon which the commissioner predicated his order. Our rules of statutory construction are clear. If words of a statute are clear, the duty of a reviewing court is to apply the legislature\u2019s directive. \u201c[T]he meaning of [a] statute must, in the first instance, be sought in the language in which the act is framed .... If the language of the statute is clear, it is assumed that the words themselves express the intent of the legislature .... Where [a] statute presents no ambiguity, we need look no further than the words themselves which we assume express the intention of the legislature.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 307, 311, 567 A.2d 1195 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The clear words of \u00a7 4-160 provide that once an action is authorized by the commissioner, the liability of the state is to be determined as if the action were against a private person \u2014 if a private defendant would be liable, then so would the state. The plain words of \u00a7 4-160, as indicated in the following italicized portions of the statute, demonstrate this point. Subsection (a) provides: \u201cWhen the Claims Commissioner deems it just and equitable, he may authorize suit against the state on any claim which, in his opinion, presents an issue of law or fact under which the state, <em>were it a private person, could be liable.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Subsection (b) provides: \u201cIn each action authorized by the Claims Commissioner pursuant to subsection (a) of this section or by the General Assembly pursuant to section 4-159, the claimant shall allege such authorization and the date on which it was granted. The state waives its immunity from liability and from suit in each such action and waives all defenses which might arise from the eleemosynary or governmental nature of the activity complained of. <em>The </em>rights and <em>liability of the state in each such action shall be coextensive with and shall equal the </em>rights and <em>liability of private persons in like </em>circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The identical \u201cwere it a private person\u201d standard is found in the last sentence of \u00a7 4-159, which applies to the General Assembly when it is deciding whether to grant a claimant permission to bring an action against the state. If the legislature did not make it clear in subsection (a) of \u00a7 4-160 that the liability of the state, once the commissioner deemed \u201cit just and equitable,\u201d was to be coextensive with that of a private person, it was made crystal clear in subsection (b) of that statute, which provides, in pertinent part, that the \u201cliability of the state . . . shall be coextensive with and shall equal the . . . lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>bility of private persons in like circumstances.\u201d \u201cCoextensive\u201d is defined as \u201chaving the same scope or boundaries . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary; see also General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) (\u201c[i]n the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The majority states that the \u201csole purpose of \u00a7 4-160 . . . is to remove the bar of sovereign immunity . . . .\u201d This, however, is accomplished by the second sentence in \u00a7 4-160 (b), which waives such defenses on the part of the state. Under the majority\u2019s reading of the statute, there would be no purpose for the language in subsection (a) of \u00a7 4-160, which sets forth the \u201cwere it a private person, could be liable\u201d standard, or, more importantly, for the third sentence in subsection (b), which provides that the \u201cliability of the state in each such action shall be coextensive with and shall equal the . . . liability of private persons in like circumstances.\u201d \u201cThere is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase in a legislative enactment so that in construing it no part is treated as insignificant and unnecessary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Zichichi </em>v. <em>Middlesex Memorial Hospital, </em>204 Conn. 399, 407, 528 A.2d 805 (1987); see also <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 337, 347, 680 A.2d 1261 (1996) (\u201c[w]e presume that the legislature had a purpose for each sentence, clause or phrase in a legislative enactment, and that it did not intend to enact meaningless provisions\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). In addition, \u201cthe use of different words in the same enactment must indicate a difference in legislative intention.\u201d <em>Steadwell </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>186 Conn. 153, 164, 439 A.2d 1078 (1982) <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting). It is clear that it was the legislature\u2019s intention to make the state liable as if it were a private person once the commissioner authorized an action pursuant to \u00a7 4-160, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>and, in doing so, the legislature leveled the playing field by also giving the state the same rights (including defenses) in such litigation as a private person.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The legislative history, as indicated by Oberst, whose office drafted the statute at the direction of the 1953 legislature, clearly indicates that its intent was that once the permission to bring an action against the state was granted by the claims commission, the state\u2019s liability would be coextensive with that of a private person. Litigants regularly brought actions in court against state employees and officers because sovereign immunity barred such actions brought directly against the state, and those state employees and officers could be held liable on the same basis as a private person. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Appropriations, Pt. 3, 1959 Sess., p. 922. In justifying No. 685, \u00a7 25, of the 1959 Public Acts, the portion of the act that would grant immunity to state employees and would force claims for the conduct of employees to be disposed of by the proposed claims legislation, Oberst testified that \u201c [w]ith the state providing its citizens with a just and equitable means of presenting claims [as a result of the claims commission legislation], continuing the liability of state employees appears unnecessary and, in practice, constitutes a burden on state employment. Such a provision [providing immunity for state officers and employees] has been included in the proposal recommended by the Council.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>This court has clearly indicated that once the commissioner authorizes a claimant to bring an action against the state, pursuant to \u00a7 4-160, the state\u2019s liability is coextensive with that of a private person. In <em>Tamm </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>222 Conn. 280, 281-82, 610 A.2d 590 (1992), the plaintiff sought damages against the state claiming a taking of his land under the state constitution because of the \u201cstate\u2019s operation of a truck inspection and weigh station on its property, which [was] adjacent to his [property], [that] caused additional noise, unsightliness and air pollution on his property . . . .\u201d The court found that the inverse condemnation allegations did not support a traditional taking that would trigger the state constitution, but, rather, the allegations did show a substantial interference with the plaintiffs property. Id., 285-86. The court held that it need not decide whether a substantial interference with property rights reaches the level of a constitutional taking under a more expansive view of the state constitution, because the plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by not seeking, among other things, permission from the commissioner to bring an action for damages against the state pursuant to \u00a7 4-160. Id., 288-90. In <em>Tamm, </em>the court reasoned that another remedy had been available to the plaintiff as follows: \u201cIn accordance with article eleventh, \u00a7 4, of the Connecticut constitution, the Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>eral Assembly has established the office of the . . . commissioner, granting to the . . . commissioner the power to waive the state\u2019s sovereign immunity when he \u2018deems it just and equitable\u2019 and to authorize suit \u2018on any claim which, in his opinion, presents an issue of law or fact under which the state, were it a private person, could be hable.\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 4-160 (a).\u201d <em>Tamm </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 289-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Likewise, in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>204 Conn. 17, 35-36, 526 A.2d 318 (1987), this court acknowledged that in actions authorized by the commissioner under \u00a7 4-160, the state\u2019s liability to the claimant is coextensive with that of a private person. The plaintiffs in <em>Doe </em>sought attorneys\u2019 fees from the state with respect to litigation in which they had successfully compelled the state to fund abortions requested by women eligible for state medical assistance. Id., 18-19. The court, in determining whether the plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by not seeking relief from the commissioner, stated: \u201cOur determination in part I [of the opinion] that a private party in the same position as the state in this case would not have been liable for attorneys\u2019 fees would render fruitless an authorization to sue the state, because its liability in such a suit is \u2018coextensive\u2019 with that of a private person [pursuant to \u00a7 4-160 (a)].\u201d Id., 36. Nevertheless, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies because they could have sought relief from the commissioner under his authority to grant compensation pursuant to other statutory provisions. Id., 36-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Finally, in <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>State, </em>189 Conn. 550, 457 A.2d 304 (1983), the plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of General Statutes \u00a7 4-165, which prohibits an action against a state employee. The court refused to resolve the question because the plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies by not seeking permission to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>sue the state from the commissioner pursuant to \u00a7 4-160. Id., 559. The court stated that \u201c[i]n such authorized actions the rights and liability of the state are coextensive with and equal to those of a private person in like circumstances.\u201d Id., 557. Similarly, this court pointed out in <em>Fidelity Bank </em>v. <em>State, </em>166 Conn. 251, 254, 348 A.2d 633 (1974), where the plaintiffs direct action against the state based on negligence was dismissed, that a claim could have been presented to the claims commission and that if the action were permitted, the state\u2019s liability would have been coextensive with and equal to the liability of a private person.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Other jurisdictions have considered similar \u201cprivate person\u201d standards in their tort claims acts and have held that recovery is to be allowed against the state if recovery would be allowed against a private party. See <em>Reddish </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>468 So. 2d 929, 932 (Fla. 1985) (\u201crecovery is to be allowed [against the state] only to the extent that such is available against a private person for the same kind of conduct\u201d); <em>Barringer </em>v. <em>State, </em>111 Idaho 794, 801, 727 P.2d 1222 (1986) (stating that, under state\u2019s Tort Claims Act, \u201cthe state waives sovereign immunity and subjects itself to the <em>same liability as would attach to a private person\" </em>[emphasis added]); <em>Sterling </em>v. <em>Bloom, </em>111 Idaho 211, 216, 723 P.2d 755 (1986) (\u201cThe statute says that <em>if \u00f1. </em>private person would be liable for the misconduct alleged against the government, regardless of whether the private individuals ordinarily fill the same underlying function or role of the government, so will be the government.

Ct. 122,100 L. Ed. 48 (1955), under the Federal Tort Claims Act. In <em>Indian Towing Co., </em>the court stated that \u201c[t]he broad and just purpose which the [Federal Tort Claims Act] was designed to effect was to compensate the victims of negligence in the conduct of governmental activities in circumstances like unto those in which <em>a private person would be liable </em>and not to leave just treatment to the caprice and legislative burden of individual private laws.\u201d (Emphasis added.)

Id., 62. The Supreme Court addressed the government\u2019s argument as follows: \u201c[T]he Government contends that the language of the [Federal Tort Claims Act] imposing liability \u2018in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances . . .\u2019 must be read as exclud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>ing liability in the performance of activities which private persons do not perform. Thus, there would be no liability for negligent performance of \u2018uniquely governmental functions.\u2019 The Government reads the statute as if it imposed liability to the same extent as would be imposed on a private individual \u2018under the same circumstances.\u2019 But the statutory language is \u2018under like circumstances,\u2019 and it is hornbook tort law that one who undertakes to warn the public of danger and thereby induces reliance must perform his \u2018good Samaritan\u2019 task in a careful manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u201cFurthermore, the Government in effect reads the statute as imposing liability in the same manner as if it were a municipal corporation and not as if it were a private person, and it would thus push the courts into the \u2018non-governmental\u2019-\u2018govemmentar quagmire that has long plagued the law of municipal corporations. . . . The Federal Tort Claims Act cuts the ground from under [the] doctrine [of sovereign immunity]; it is not self-defeating by covertly embedding the casuistries of municipal liability for torts.\u201d Id., 64-65. The Supreme Court has subsequently relied on its decision in <em>Indian Towing Co. </em>See <em>Sheridan </em>v. <em>United, States, </em>487 U.S. 392, 401, 108 S. Ct. 2449, 101 L.

For example, in this case, after the finding by the commissioner that justice requires that the state respond to the claims of the plaintiff, it would make no sense for this court to then deny the claim because there is, with respect to an employee contract, no such recognized cause of action against the state or because of an extraordinary showing that must be made in an action brought against the state based on promissory estoppel. The legislature simply wanted to provide that if a claim is authorized by law against a private person, and the plaintiff can prove each element required for liability against a private person under such cause of action (subject, of course, to the state being able to exert any such defenses that a private person would have), then damages should be awarded. The commissioner does not authorize every claimant to bring an action against the state, but, rather, only those claimants with claims that are deemed \u201cjust and equitable.\u201d See <em>Circle Lanes of Fairfield, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>195 Conn. 534, 535-36, 489 A.2d 363 (1985) (commissioner refused to permit claimant to bring action against state for damage to plaintiffs property as result of alleged negligence of state in causing flooding).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The nature of the state\u2019s liability in any action brought pursuant to the commissioner\u2019s permission under \u00a7 4-160 is a legislative determination. The majority, without any analysis, summarily proclaims that the language of \u00a7 4-160 \u2014 that provides that the state\u2019s liability will be as if it were \u201ca private person\u201d and that the \u201crights and liability of the state in each such action shall be coextensive with and shall equal the rights and liability of private persons in like circumstances\u201d \u2014 does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>mean what it says. This failure on the part of the majority to give effect to the clear intent of the legislature tramples on the separation of powers clause set forth in article second of the state constitution.

By general law, the Governor and the Comptroller have authority to settle claims of a very minor nature. But traditionally it is the duty of the General Assembly to hear and decide the great variety of demands made upon the State for the payment of money. When claims are few in number and the financial outlay is small, legislative determination can function efficiently. But as the number of claims increases and demands upon the treasury grow in size, the legislative process becomes progressively incapable of handling them efficiently. Other more important demands upon the time of legislators and the natural limitations of legislative investigation do not always insure a just determination. This natural inadequacy is further complicated by the fact that some unsatisfied claimants reappear every session with the same claims, forcing the legislature into useless repetition. Despite an earnest desire to honor legitimate claims, there is little to assure the equity and justice which the state rightly demands and which claimants rightly deserve.\u201d Conn.
