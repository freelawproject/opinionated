The defendants, the city of New Haven, the New Haven tax collector and the New Haven tax assessor, appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the partial summary judgment rendered by the trial court in favor of the plaintiff, United Illuminating Company.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendants claim that the trial court miscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>strued \u00a7 12-53, and that the assessor has the authority under that statute to revalue property after giving notice of an audit within three years of the filing of the taxpayer\u2019s list. As an alternate ground to affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment, the plaintiff claims that the notice given to it under \u00a7 12-53 (c) was insufficient, and that it did not waive any such deficiency in the notice. We agree with the defendants with respect to their claim, and we disagree with the plaintiff\u2019s alternate ground for affirmance. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for trial on the third and fourth counts of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The parties stipulated to the following facts. On or about November 1, 1990, the plaintiff, a public service company supplying electric power to New Haven and Fairfield counties, filed with the New Haven tax assessor a list of personal property showing a valuation for assessment purposes of its personal property, other than motor vehicles, of $92,079,800. The assessor included all of this listed property on the grand list for October 1,1990, at the submitted value and, in February, 1991, lodged the October 1, 1990 grand list in the town clerk\u2019s office as required by General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 12-55.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The New Haven tax collector rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>bills to the plaintiff for that grand list on the basis of the values set forth on the plaintiffs list of personal property, and the plaintiff paid those bills in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In a letter dated September 20, 1993, the assessor notified the plaintiff that he was scheduling a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 12-53 (b). The hearing took place on September 29, 1993, and various persons testified. In a letter dated October 12, 1993, the assessor notified the plaintiff that the hearing was concluded. On or about October 31, 1993, the plaintiff received three tax bills and accompanying letters from the tax collector. These tax bills set forth a total of $6,315,614.96 claimed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>due for the October 1, 1990 grand list, and were based on an increase in the value of the plaintiffs personal property from the values that had been declared by the plaintiff and included by the assessor on that grand list. The increase in valuation resulted in an increase in the assessment, after application of a 70 percent equalization factor, of the plaintiffs personal property from $92,079,800 to $143,416,860. The plaintiff received no written communication from the defendants in the thirty days following October 12, 1993, other than the three tax bills and accompanying letters of October 31, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiff appeared before the New Haven board of tax review and requested that the tax bills be declared illegal. The board of tax review denied this relief. The plaintiff brought this action by amended complaint, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-119<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> seeking: (1) a declaratory judgment that the taxes sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>to be collected were illegal;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (2) temporary and permanent injunctive relief against the collection of those taxes. The defendants filed a counterclaim for collection of the taxes at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The parties filed cross motions for partial summary judgment on the first two counts of the complaint and the counterclaim. The trial court concluded that the assessor lacked authority under \u00a7 12-53 to increase the assessment of the plaintiffs personal property on the October 1, 1990 grand list. The trial court determined, however, that with respect to the plaintiffs alternate claim that the increased assessment was illegal because the assessor had failed to provide written notice to the plaintiff of the increased assessment within thirty days of the hearing as required by \u00a7 12-53 (c), the plaintiff had waived any defect in the notice by appealing to the board of tax review. Nonetheless, because the plaintiff had established one of its two contentions, the trial court granted the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and denied the defendants\u2019 motion. Upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>certification by the trial court that the delay incident to an appeal was justified; see footnote 3; this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The defendants claim that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 12-53 was improper. More specifically, the defendants claim that the assessor\u2019s authority under \u00a7 12-53 (b) to conduct an audit regarding the valuation of the taxpayer\u2019s property within three years after the filing of the taxpayer\u2019s list of personal property necessarily carries with it the implied power to revalue that property for tax purposes, and that this implied power is specifically referred to in \u00a7 12-53 (c). The plaintiff contends, to the contrary, that the trial court properly interpreted \u00a7 12-53, that the assessor\u2019s only authority under \u00a7 12-53 is to add omitted property, and that the assessor\u2019s authority to revalue listed property instead must be exercised pursuant to \u00a7 12-55. We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431, 650 A.2d 557 (1994). In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, \u201cwe look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.; <em>Carpenteri-Waddington, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Ser</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number><em>vices, </em>231 Conn. 355, 362, 650 A.2d 147 (1994); <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 755-56, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992). From the language of \u00a7 12-53, its legislative history and the circumstances surrounding its enactment, the policy it was designed to implement, and its relationship to other legislation governing the same subject matter, we conclude that an assessor has the authority under \u00a7 12-53 (b) and (c) to revalue and reassess, for tax purposes, property that was listed and valued on a grand list filed within the previous three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Section 12-53 is part of the general statutory scheme for the taxation of personal property by municipalities. In general terms, under General Statutes \u00a7 12-40,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> taxpayers are required to file lists \u201cof the taxable property belonging to them on the first day of October in that year.\u201d Under General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 12-42,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>each taxpayer must file its list with the assessor by November 1 and, under General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 12-49,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> must declare under penalties of false statement that the list \u201cis a true statement of all my property liable to taxation.\u201d Under \u00a7 12-55,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the assessor, upon receipt of the lists, after making any adjustments permitted by that section, is required, by the following January 31, to: (1) arrange the lists in alphabetical order; (2) lodge them either in the assessor\u2019s office or the town clerk\u2019s office for public inspection; and (3) make \u201can abstract\u201d of the lists and lodge this \u201cgrand list abstract\u201d in the town clerk\u2019s office for public inspection. This \u201cgrand list abstract\u201d is what is known as the grand list for October 1 of the particular year. Thus, under \u00a7 12-55, the assessor has a ninety day window of time\u2014 from November 1 through the following January 31 \u2014 within which to revalue personal property before including it in the grand list for that taxable year. Under General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 12-63,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the assessor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>is required to value the property for tax purposes at its \u201cfair market value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">This system rests on two fundamental premises. First, it is, in the first instance, a self-reporting system. \u201cIt is well settled that it is the responsibility of the taxpayer to provide the assessor with sufficient facts to value personal property for tax purposes.\u201d <em>IBM Credit Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax </em>Review, 227 Conn. 826, 829, 633 A.2d 294 (1993). It is a self-reporting system by practical necessity, because it simply would be too burdensome on municipal assessors to locate, identify and value all of the taxable personal property in their environs.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Second, and closely related to the first, it is a system that has long rested on the notion that taxation \u201cbe as nearly equal as possible. Hence, it is the policy of the law to require all property, except such as is specially exempted, to bear its proportion of the public burdens.\u201d <em>Cornwall </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>38 Conn. 443, 447-48 (1871); <em>Low Stamford Corp. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>164 Conn. 178, 181, 319 A.2d 369 (1972) (\u201c[t]he incidents of taxation should fall, as far as possible, equally on all similarly situated\u201d). This notion of equality is closely related to the success of the self-reporting system because, to the extent that property tax burdens fall equally on all taxable property, taxpayers are more likely to comply willingly and honestly with their self-reporting obligations. Indeed, \u00a7 12-55 (a) explicitly recognizes this notion of equality by providing that \u201c[w]hen the lists of any town have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>so received or made by the assessor or board of assessors, they shall equalize the same, if necessary . . . .\u201d See footnote 4. We have referred to this obligation as \u201ca continuing duty ... to achieve administratively a fair and equal assessment for all taxpayers. The power to equalize the lists, if necessary, imports a watchtower role for the assessor to correct inequalities . . . .\u201d <em>84 Century Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>207 Conn. 250, 262, 541 A.2d 478 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The fact that the personal property taxation system is a self-reporting system premised on the notion of equality in tax imposition also suggests, however, a need for some mechanisms by which the assessor can make adjustments in the information that is supplied to him for purposes of arriving at a fair and equitable tax on all property, as well as suggesting some limitations on the use of those mechanisms. With this background in mind, therefore, we turn to one of those mechanisms, namely, the provisions of \u00a7 12-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">We start with the language. Section 12-53 is entitled, \u201cAddition of omitted property to list.\u201d Section 12-53 (a) provides that the assessor, during \u201cthe period prescribed by law for the completion of [his] duties . . . shall add to the list given in by any person . . . any taxable property which [the assessor has] reason to believe is owned by [the taxpayer] and has been omitted from such list,\u201d and that this added property shall be assessed at the appropriate percentage of its true market value. There is no dispute that subsection (a) applies only to property that was omitted from \u2014 that, is, was not included in \u2014 the list submitted by the taxpayer. Indeed, prior to the legislative amendments involved in this case, the predecessor to \u00a7 12-53 had been held to apply only to property added to the list, and not to an increased valuation of property listed. See <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>103 Conn. 149, 154, 130 A. 84 (1925). At issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>in the present case, however, is the meaning of the current language of \u00a7 12-53 (b) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Section 12-53 (b) provides in general terms that, if the assessor believes \u201cthat taxable property has been omitted\u201d from a taxpayer\u2019s list, if the assessor believes that \u201ctaxable property belongs to any person who has not given in a list,\u201d or if the assessor is \u201cunable to determine the value of any property without the assistance of the owner,\u201d the assessor may give notice to the owner of a hearing regarding \u201cany such property or the valuation thereof.\u201d This notice must be given \u201cwithin three years after the due date for the filing of such list or within three years after the date on which such list is received by the assessor ... if later.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-53 (b). The notice \u201cshall direct the person named therein to appear before the assessor . . . with books of account, papers, documents and other records for examination under oath relative to such property or the valuation thereof.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-53 (b). This hearing is what the defendants refer to as an audit, the notice of which must be given no more than three years after the filing of the taxpayer\u2019s list for the prior year in question. Subsection (b) goes on to provide that \u201c[a]ll omitted taxable property\u201d discovered at this hearing shall be added to the taxpayer\u2019s list at its fair market value, plus a 25 percent penalty. Thus, subsection (b), although it specifically explains the treatment of property omitted from the list but disclosed by the audit, does not explicitly deal with anything else that might be disclosed by the audit, such as an undervaluation of the property as initially submitted on the taxpayer\u2019s list and included on the October 1 grand list for that prior year.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Subsection (c) of \u00a7 12-53, however, provides that \u201c[i]f the assessor . . . adds property to the list of any person or makes out a list for any person not filing a list <em>or increases or decreases the valuation of any taxable </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>property under the provision of subsection (b)f </em>the assessor shall, \u201cwithin thirty days of such hearing or any adjournment thereof give [the taxpayer] notice thereof in writing by mailing the same, postage prepaid, to his Jast-known address and the same shall be held to be sufficient.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The language of subsection (b) of \u00a7 12-53, taken together with the language of subsection (c), strongly suggests that, as the defendants argue, the power to audit necessarily carries with it the implied power to revalue. Subsection (b) gives the assessor, within three years of the submission of the personal property list, the power to audit the taxpayer\u2019s books and records. This audit power, however, is not limited to property that has been omitted from the taxpayer\u2019s list or to property of a taxpayer who has not submitted a list. This power also applies when \u201cthe assessor . . . [is] unable to determine the value of any property without the assistance of the owner . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-53 (b). The word \u201cvalue\u201d in this clause must be read to mean fair market value because that is the benchmark for the assessor\u2019s function. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-63. Thus, under subsection (b) of \u00a7 12-53, if, within the three year period, the assessor has a doubt about the fair market value of property contained on the current or a prior year\u2019s list that cannot be satisfied \u201cwithout the assistance of the owner\u201d of the property, he has the power to initiate an audit with respect to that property.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Subsection (c) of \u00a7 12-53 provides that if the assessor, as a result of the audit procedure authorized by subsection (b) of \u00a7 12-53, adds property to a taxpayer\u2019s list, generates a list for a taxpayer who has failed to file one, \u201cor increases or decreases the valuation of any taxable property under the provisions of subsection (b),\u201d he is required, \u201cwithin thirty days of such hearing [under subsection (b)] or any adjournment thereof,\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>give the taxpayer written notice thereof. Thus, there is statutory symmetry between the audit power provided in subsection (b) and the notice requirement in subsection (c). Just as the audit power under subsection (b) applies in three instances \u2014 when there is property omitted, when no list was submitted, and when the assessor questions the accuracy of the fair market value of listed property \u2014 the notice requirement under subsection (c), which is specifically linked to the audit conducted under subsection (b), applies in three instances \u2014 when omitted property is being added, when a list is being generated when none had been submitted, and when the assessor increases or decreases the value of any property.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Because it confirms that the increase or decrease in value determined by the assessor under subsection (c) of \u00a7 12-53 was the result of the assessor\u2019s inquiry into the property\u2019s fair market value under subsection (b) of \u00a7 12-53, this symmetry lends weight to the linguistic suggestion that the audit power implies the power to revalue. There would be little purpose to an audit, based on the assessor\u2019s doubt about the accuracy of the fair market value of property and permitting an \u201cexamination under oath relative to . . . <em>the valuation thereof'] </em>(emphasis added) General Statutes \u00a7 12-53 (b); that did not give the assessor the authority to take appropriate action based on the results of that audit. Indeed, because the same clause that gives the assessor the authority to \u201cincrease\u201d value gives him the corresponding authority to \u201cdecrease\u201d value, the contrary conclusion would also mean that, if the audit disclosed that the questioned property had been overvalued on the taxpayer\u2019s list, the assessor would be powerless to reduce the taxpayer\u2019s burden accordingly. Similarly, there would be little purpose in requiring the assessor to give statutory written notice of an increase or decrease in the value of property if that notice were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>not going to result in some financial consequence to the taxpayer. We do not ordinarily read legislative language in such a way as to render it superfluous. <em>Strat-ford </em>v. <em>State Board of Mediation &amp; Arbitration, </em>239 Conn. 32, 55, 681 A.2d 281 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Although we have not previously specifically read taxing statutes to give implied powers to municipal taxing authorities, the principle has deep roots in our jurisprudence of municipal law that, in addition to those powers specifically conferred by statute, public officials have those implied powers that are necessary to the proper execution of their duties. See <em>Gesmonde, Pietrosimone, Sgrignari, Pinkus &amp; Sachs </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>231 Conn. 745, 750, 651 A.2d 1273 (1995) (municipal commission has implied power to hire outside counsel in light of corporation counsel\u2019s conflict of interest); <em>Perretta </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>185 Conn. 88, 102, 440 A.2d 823 (1981) (in absence of express provision, authority necessary for effective exercise of granted municipal power conferred by implication); <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>American Arbitration Assn., </em>174 Conn. 472, 479, 391 A.2d 137 (1978) (same); <em>Mallory </em>v. <em>Huntington, </em>64 Conn. 88, 94, 29 A. 245 (1894) (authority of selectmen to submit claim to arbitration implied from power to prosecute and defend actions); <em>Union </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>19 Conn. 331, 336 (1848) (authority of selectmen to prosecute and defend actions implied from power to manage town and settle actions against it). We see no compelling reason to preclude that principle from operating with respect to assessors.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Furthermore, this conclusion is buttressed by the genealogy of \u00a7 12-53, and by the legislative history of the language at issue in this case. Before 1984, the statute provided that, if the assessor were to call the taxpayer in for an audit, he must have given notice of the audit at least ten days before the \u201cdate prescribed by law for the completion of the duties of the assessors.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 12-53 (b).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> At that time, General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 12-53 (c) provided for notice by the assessor to the taxpayer only if the assessor added omitted property to the list or made out a list for a taxpayer who had not filed one \u201cunder the provisions of either or both of subsections (a) and (b).\u201d Thus, prior to 1984, subsection (c) did not explicitly provide for revaluation of any property, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>it explicitly linked its provisions regarding omitted property and the failure to file a list with the provisions of both subsections (a)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and (b) of General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 12-53. Additionally, subsection (c), like subsection (b), provided that the notice in writing of such action was required to be given by assessors on or before the \u201cdate prescribed by law for the completion of their duties.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 12-53 (c).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The \u201cdate prescribed by law for the completion of [the assessor\u2019s] duties,\u201d when the assessor was required to lodge the grand list in the town clerk\u2019s office for public inspection, was then, and is now, January 31. General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 12-55 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Thus, prior to 1984, it was fairly clear\u2019 under General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 12-53 that: (1) subsection (a) applied only to omitted property; (2) whatever audit power an assessor had under subsection (b) was required to be exercised by January 31 of the assessment year; and (3) if the assessor were to add omitted property or make out a list of property for a taxpayer who had failed to file one, under either subsection (a) or (b), the assessor was required to do so by January 31. Essentially, then, before 1984, General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 12-53 operated in pari materia with General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 12-55 because under either the assessor had only a ninety day window of time in which to challenge the taxpayer\u2019s list of personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">In 1984, however, the legislature amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 12-53 (b) and (c) by virtue of No. 84-477 of the 1984 Public Acts. That public act extended the period of time for an assessor to give notice of an audit under subsection (b), and for the assessor to notify the taxpayer of changes to his list under subsection (c), from January 31 to the \u201cend of the assessment year.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, the period of time in which the assessor could bring in a taxpayer for an audit was extended, in effect, from ninety days to one year. Similarly, the period under subsection (c) within which the assessor was required to notify the taxpayer of an addition to his list or of the making out a list was extended from ninety days to one year. Public Act 84-477 did not, however, amend General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 12-53 (a).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>After the 1984 amendments, therefore, it was fairly clear under \u00a7 12-53 that: (1) the provisions of subsection (a) , regarding omitted property, remained the same; (2) whatever audit power an assessor had under subsection (b) was extended to the end of the assessment year; and (3) the period for the notice to the taxpayer, under subsection (c), of an addition of omitted property or the making out of a list, under either subsection (a) or subsection (b), was also extended to the end of the assessment year. Furthermore, after the 1984 amendments, \u00a7 12-53 no longer operated in pari materia with \u00a7 12-55, because the time period for action by the assessor under \u00a7 12-53 was one year, whereas the time period for action by the assessor under \u00a7 12-55 remained \u2014 and remains \u2014 at ninety days.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">In 1986, the legislature revisited \u00a7 12-53 by enacting No. 86-84 of the 1986 Public Acts.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Public Act 86-84 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>amended subsections (a), (b) and (c) of General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 12-53. It amended subsection (a) in two significant respects: (1) it specifically provided that the assessors\u2019 action under subsection (a)\u2014 namely, adding omitted property to a taxpayer\u2019s list\u2014 was to be effected \u201c[d]uring the period prescribed by law for the completion of their duties,\u201d namely, by Janu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>aiy 31 following the October 1 assessment date; and (2) it specifically provided that, when such omitted property is added to the list, the assessor \u201cshall notify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>such person, in accordance with section 12-55, of any such increase in the assessed valuation.\u201d Public Act 86-84 amended subsection (b) by extending the time period for the assessor to notice an audit from the end of the assessment year to \u201cwithin three years after the due date for the filing of such list or within three years after the date on which such list is received by the assessor ... if later . . . .\u201d Furthermore, Public Act 86-84 amended subsection (c) in three significant respects: (1) in addition to the preexisting authority of the assessor to add property to a taxpayer\u2019s list and to make out a list for a taxpayer who had not filed one, the public act added the authority to \u201cincrease or decrease the valuation of any taxable property\u201d; (2) it deleted the preexisting reference in subsection (c) to \u201cthe provisions of either or both of subsections (a) and (b),\u201d and provided that the assessor\u2019s action under subsection (c) \u2014 namely, adding omitted property, making out a list, or revaluing property \u2014 would be \u201cunder the provisions of subsection <em>(t\u00ed)\u201d; </em>and (3) it provided that, upon taking any such action, the assessor shall notify the taxpayer in writing \u201cwithin thirty days of such hearing [under subsection (b)] or any adjournment thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The amendments to subsection (a) of \u00a7 12-53, when read together with the amendment to subsection (c) of \u00a7 12-53 eliminating the reference to subsection (a), and when also read together with \u00a7 12-55, are significant, because they, for the first time, created a difference in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>treatment between, on the one hand, the addition of omitted property by the assessor under \u00a7 12-53 (a) and, on the other hand, the addition of omitted property, the making out of a list when none had been filed, or the revaluation of listed property by the assessor under \u00a7 12-53 (b) and (c). This difference is, in essence, that under the provisions of \u00a7 12-53 (a), unlike the provisions of \u00a7 12-53 (b) and (c), the assessor may, by January 31, add omitted property to a taxpayer\u2019s list without the necessity of \u2014 indeed, without the authority for \u2014 an audit of the taxpayer\u2019s books and records. Under the provisions of \u00a7 12-53 (b) and (c), however, the assessor has three years in which to notice an audit of the taxpayer regarding omitted property under the following circumstances: if either no list has been filed or the assessor has a doubt about the valuation submitted by the taxpayer, and if, as a result of that audit, the assessor adds omitted property, generates a list when none has been filed, \u201cor increases or decreases the valuation of any taxable property under the provisions of subsection (b)\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 12-53 (c); the assessor must give written notice of his action within thirty days of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">This difference in treatment between the provisions of \u00a7 12-53 (a) and the provisions of \u00a7 12-53 (b) and (c) is confirmed by the 1986 amendment to \u00a7 12-53 (a) requiring the assessor to notify the taxpayer in such a case \u201cin accordance with section 12-55, of any such increase in the assessed valuation\u201d of the taxpayer\u2019s property by virtue of the addition of omitted property. Section 12-55 (a) permits the assessor, who neither needs to nor is authorized to perform an audit, to revalue a taxpayer\u2019s property that is listed on the taxpayer\u2019s current list or was included on the previous grand list, provided that the assessor mails written notice to the taxpayer \u201cin accordance with subsection (b) of\u2019 \u00a7 12-55. Section \u00a7 12-55 (b) requires that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>notice of such increase in valuation is to be mailed \u201con or before the tenth day immediately following the date on which the grand list abstract is signed and attested to by the assessor . . . .\u201d Thus, as a result of the 1986 amendments, the assessor may, under \u00a7 12-53 (a), add omitted property to the taxpayer\u2019s current list without an audit and, if he does so, he is required to give notice of that action under the provisions of \u00a7 12-55 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In effect, therefore, this portion of the 1986 amendment regarding \u00a7 12-53 severed any link between the assessor\u2019s action of adding omitted property under the provisions of \u00a7 12-53 (a) and his actions under \u00a7 12-53 (b) and (c). In other words, as a result of this amendment, when the assessor adds omitted property to the current list of a taxpayer, without an audit, he gives notice to the taxpayer of an increase in the total value of its list, by virtue of that addition, pursuant to \u00a7 12-55 (b) and not pursuant to \u00a7 12-53 (b) or (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">This difference in treatment is reinforced by the 1986 amendment to General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 12-53 (c) , which eliminated the reference to subsection (a). Before 1986, when an assessor, under \u00a7 12-53 (c), added omitted property or made out a list when none had been filed, he did so \u201cunder the provisions of <em>either or both of subsections (a) and (b).\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 12-53 (c). After the 1986 amendment, however, when the assessor adds property, under \u00a7 12-53 (c), makes out a fist when none had been filed, or increases or decreases the value of any property, he does so \u201cunder the provisions of <em>subsection (b)\u2019\u2019 </em>only. (Emphasis added.) This amendment means that, when the assessor takes remedial action, after conducting an audit under the provisions of \u00a7 12-53 (b), he does so only under the provisions of \u00a7 12-53 (b) and (c), and not pursuant to any authority given him under \u00a7 12-53 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>The net effect of these amendments is to separate out two different procedures, and to make clear that they operate pursuant to different statutory sections. Under the first procedure, the assessor adds omitted property to a taxpayer\u2019s current list without conducting an audit. In that situation, the assessor operates pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 12-53 (a) and gives the taxpayer its notice pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 12-55. Under the second procedure, the assessor, as a result of an audit of a taxpayer\u2019s list filed, or not filed, within the past three years, including the current list: (1) adds omitted property to that list; (2) makes out a list when none had been filed; or (3) increases or decreases the value of any property on that list. In that situation, the assessor conducts the audit pursuant to \u00a7 12-53 (b), and gives the taxpayer its notice pursuant to \u00a7 12-53 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">This evolution of the provisions of \u00a7 12-53 (b) and (c), and their ultimate statutory separation from the provisions of \u00a7 12-53 (a), support the conclusion that the assessor\u2019s authority under \u00a7 12-53 (b) and (c) includes the authority to revalue listed property. The specific link between the assessor\u2019s actions under \u00a7 12-53 (c), which are described in terms that include increasing or decreasing the value of any property, and the results of his audit conducted under \u00a7 12-53 (b), is further evidence of a legislative purpose to provide the assessor with the authority to revalue as an implied necessary incident of the assessor\u2019s authority to audit. Furthermore, the corresponding separation of his authority to add omitted property, without an audit, under \u00a7 12-53 (a), from his actions under \u00a7 12-53 (c), and the link between his authority under \u00a7 12-53 (a) to the notice he is required to give under \u00a7 12-55, undermine the plaintiffs insistence that \u00a7 12-53 applies only to the addition of omitted property.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The legislative history of the 1986 amendments also strongly supports the conclusion that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>intended to give the assessor the implied authority, under \u00a7 12-53 (b) and (c), to revalue listed property pursuant to an audit. Despite the plaintiffs assertion to the contrary, it is now well settled that testimony before legislative committees may be considered in determining the particular problem or issue that the legislature sought to address by the legislation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>240 Conn. 317, 337, 692 A.2d 713 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>204 Conn. 259, 274 n.8, 528 A.2d 760 (1987), and cases cited therein. This is because legislation is a purposive act; <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 430-31 n.15; and, therefore, identifying the particular problem that the legislature sought to resolve helps to identify the purpose or purposes for which the legislature used the language in question. Accordingly, we first turn to the committee hearings on the bill that ultimately became Public Act 86-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Charles Feldman, a personal property tax auditor for the city of New Haven, was one of the principal witnesses before the Joint Committee on Finance, Revenue and Bonding regarding Senate Bill No. 402, which ultimately became Public Act 86-84. Feldman\u2019s testimony indicates that one of the problems that the legislature sought to address by the bill was that many companies, despite just having been audited, would revert to under-reporting their personal property the next year because they viewed the risks of noncompliance to be less than the potential gain.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Significantly, as a specific example <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>of the kind of underreporting that the bill sought to address, Feldman cited the instance of a company that had significantly undervalued its personal property on its tax list, which resulted in a significant tax loss to the city.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The floor debate, although much more sparse and less specific, does nothing to dispel the strong suggestion arising from the committee hearing that one purpose of the bill was to reach the kind of underreporting that Feldman had identified, namely, undervaluing of listed personal property. Senator James H. McLaughlin reported to the Senate that the bill had been requested by the \u201cBoard of Assessors,\u201d and that \u201cit would basically allow us to do just what the Internal Revenue Service does now.\u201d 29 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1986 Sess., p. 1009. The reference to the Internal Revenue Service conceivably can be read narrowly to refer only to the fact that, under federal law, tax audits go back only three years. See Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501 (a). Particularly in light of the testimony before the committee, however, it more plausibly is read broadly to include the fact that if a federal taxpayer were to inflate the cost of its assets for purposes of a depreciation deduction, the Internal Revenue Service could certainly go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>back and revalue those assets for the same three years. This reading is consistent with the view of the assessors, articulated by Feldman, that, in an analogous situation, municipal taxing authorities should have the authority to go back three years in order to determine whether a taxpayer has underreported the value of its personal property for purposes of the personal property tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Furthermore, we note that, as the parties agreed at oral argument to this court, \u00a7 12-53 (b) and (c) are the only statutory provisions that an assessor has available to him to remedy a fraudulent undervaluation of personal property that is not discovered within the very brief time period provided by \u00a7 12-55. Although there is no suggestion of such improper conduct in the present case, we cannot blind ourselves to the fact that such conduct does occur. It is difficult to conceive that the legislature, having given the assessors the authority to audit for three years of grand lists, did not also intend to give them the power to remedy a fraudulent undervaluation disclosed by the exercise of that authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Finally, we afford some weight to the fact that the Handbook for Connecticut Assessors, which was cosponsored by the Connecticut office of policy and management, specifically recognizes a difference between omitted property and underreported, or undervalued, property, and specifically notes that, pursuant to \u00a7 12-53, assessors may increase the value of undervalued personal property disclosed by their audits under that statute.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The office of policy and management has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>the statutory responsibility to promote uniformity of municipal assessment practices, issue uniform guidelines pertaining to methods of property valuation and assessment, and assist municipal assessors by preparing manuals and handbooks regarding those functions. General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 12-2b.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This handbook, which was issued pursuant to those statutory responsibilities, is entitled to some deference as a statement of the practical construction of \u00a7 12-53 by one of the agencies charged with the responsibility for implementing that statute. <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>United Illuminating Co., </em>168 Conn. 478, 493, 362 A.2d 785 (1975); <em>Fenn </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>24 Conn. App. 430, 437, 589 A.2d 5, cert. denied, 219 Conn. 908, 593 A.2d 133 (1991); cf. <em>Levanti </em>v. <em>Dow Chemical Co., </em>218 Conn. 9, 16, 587 A.2d 1023 (1991). Indeed, we have previously been guided by this handbook in interpreting statutes regarding local taxation. See <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>203 Conn. 425, 437-38 n.14, 525 A.2d 91 (1987); see also <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Casazza, </em>204 Conn. 336, 339, 528 A.2d 774 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1006, 108 S. Ct. 699, 98 L. Ed. 2d 651 (1988) (office of policy and management is state agency charged with supervision of municipal assessors).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The plaintiffs arguments begin with the well established authority that a municipality has only those powers of taxation expressly granted to it by the legislature, that such powers must be exercised in strict conformity to the terms by which they were given, and that any doubt regarding such powers must be resolved against the municipality and in favor of the taxpayer. <em>Pepin </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>171 Conn. 74, 83, 368 A.2d 88 (1976). From this foundation, the plaintiff argues that: (1) \u00a7 12-55, and not \u00a7 12-53, contains the legislature\u2019s express and explicit grant of authority to revalue personal property; (2) \u00a7 12-53 confers no authority on an assessor to revalue such property; (3) the notice provision in \u00a7 12-53 (c) does not empower an assessor to revalue property already listed on a previous grand list; (4) the power to revalue cannot be conferred on assessors by necessary implication; and (5) even if we were to consider \u00a7 12-53 to be ambiguous with respect to the assessor\u2019s power, the ambiguity must be resolved in the taxpayer\u2019s favor. We are not persuaded by any of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">We do not disagree with the axioms for construing municipal taxing powers articulated in <em>Pepin </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>supra, 171 Conn. 83. These axioms, however, cannot displace the need for careful and thoughtful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>interpretation of statutes regarding taxation, nor can they displace the firm conclusions that such a process of interpretation yields. These axioms, like all rules or canons of statutory construction, serve as important guidelines to the determination of legislative meaning. To permit them to displace the conclusions that careful interpretation yields, however, would be a disservice to the legislative process, as well as to the judicial exercise of inteipreting legislative language based upon the premise that the legislature intends to enact reasonable public policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Although it has a superficial textual appeal, the plaintiffs first argument \u2014 that the power to revalue property exists only pursuant to \u00a7 12-55 \u2014 is unpersuasive. It is true, as the plaintiff points out, that pursuant to \u00a7 12-55 (a) an assessor \u201cmay increase or decrease the valuation of property as named in any of such [current] lists or in the last-preceding grand list . . . .\u201d We do not read this explicit grant of authority under \u00a7 12-55, however, to preclude a similar authority under \u00a7 12-53 (b) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">First, because the assessor has no power to audit under \u00a7 12-55, this authority cannot arise as a result of any audit performed by an assessor. Thus, any exercise of the revaluation authority under this section could only come about when the assessor somehow knows, from sources other than an audit of the taxpayer\u2019s books and records, that property on a current taxpayer\u2019s list, or on the previous grand list, was valued improperly. It simply is not reasonable to infer that the legislature intended to give assessors the authority to revalue property, based on sources other than the taxpayer\u2019s records, but to deny them the authority to revalue property based on records revealed through an audit of the taxpayer, which records are likely to provide more reliable information than some other sources. Second, although prior to the legislative amendments to \u00a7 12-53, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>and particularly the 1986 amendments, a strong textual case could have been made for the proposition that revaluation could have occurred only under \u00a7 12-55,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> that argument cannot survive the enactment of those amendments. This brings us to the plaintiffs second argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The plaintiff further argues that \u00a7 12-53 only applies to <em>omitted </em>property \u2014 that is, property owned by the taxpayer on October 1, but not listed by it on the list submitted to the assessor under that statute. Relying on the title of the section, the references in both subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 12-53 to \u201comitted property,\u201d and, again, the corresponding reference in \u00a7 12-55 to revaluation, the plaintiff contends that we are bound by the plain language of the statute to conclude that it does not empower an assessor to revalue property. We do not read \u00a7 12-53 so restrictively.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">First, as we have explained, subsection (a) of \u00a7 12-53 governs only omitted property. The assessor\u2019s authority under its provisions, however, has been specifically separated from his authority under subsections (b) and (c) of \u00a7 12-53, and has, instead, been specifically linked to his authority under \u00a7 12-55. Thus, under both \u00a7 12-53 (a) and \u00a7 12-55, the assessor acts without having conducted an audit, and must do so within the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>limits set by \u00a7\u00a7 12-53 (a) and 12-55. Second, under \u00a7 12-53 (b) the assessor\u2019s power to audit is not limited to omitted property; it specifically includes those instances in which the assessor is \u201cunable to determine the value of any property without the assistance of the owner,\u201d and specifically includes the power to require the owner to appear for \u201cexamination under oath relative to any such property <em>or the valuation thereof.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) Third, this contention ignores the provisions of \u00a7 12-53 (c) and the specific statutory link between the assessor\u2019s authority under that subsection and his authority under subsection (b) of \u00a7 12-53. This brings us to the plaintiffs third argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The plaintiff next contends that \u201c[s]ubsection (c) of \u00a7 12-53 plainly is a notice provision that grants no power to assessors at all.\u201d The plaintiff argues that: (1) subsec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>tion (c) specifically refers to subsection (b) of \u00a7 12-53, which, in the plaintiffs view, only applies to omitted property and to property that the assessor determines should <em>not </em>have been on the taxpayer\u2019s list; and (2) the \u201cincreases or decreases in valuation\u201d under subsection (c) refer only to such changes in the total value of a taxpayer\u2019s list \u2014 in effect, the bottom line, but not to any of its specific items. Although we agree that subsection (c) is specifically linked to subsection (b), we disagree that subsection (b) is confined to omitted or erroneously included property on a taxpayer\u2019s list, as we have explained. Furthermore, under the language of \u00a7 12-53 (c), the assessor is to give notice to the taxpayer if he \u201cincreases or decreases the valuation of <em>any taxable property </em>under the provisions of subsection (b) . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) A more plausible reading of this language is that it applies, not to the bottom line of a taxpayer\u2019s list, but to any specific property included thereon. This reading, moreover, is consistent with our conclusion that the assessor has the implied power under subsection (b) to revalue property. That leads us to the plaintiffs fourth contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The plaintiff argues that the doctrine of necessary implication of municipal powers \u201cis appropriate only to imply <em>incidental </em>or <em>secondary </em>powers that are necessary to implement a general, or express, power conferred by the General Assembly,\u201d and that such an implication is not appropriate in this case. (Emphasis added.) We disagree with this narrow interpretation of the implied authority doctrine and reaffirm the proposition that \u201c [w]hen a general power is given to a municipal officer, whatever is necessary for effective exercise of that power is, in the absence of express authority, conferred by implication.\u201d <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>American Arbitration Assn., </em>supra, 174 Conn. 479. Under \u00a7 12-53 (b), the assessor <em>has </em>the power to audit a taxpayer\u2019s books and, in the process, to require the taxpayer to submit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>examination under oath regarding its property \u201cor the valuation thereof.\u201d This is a general power to audit regarding valuation of property listed by the taxpayer, including property that may have been fraudulently undervalued. Moreover, this power to audit takes place within the general obligation of the assessor to equalize the burden of taxation, so as to help effectuate the self-reporting system envisioned by the entire statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Under these circumstances, it is hardly extravagant to imply, from the power to audit, the power to revalue based on the results of that audit. We acknowledge that we ought to be cautious about implying power to taxing authorities. In the present case, however, the grant of the audit power to the assessor and the obligation of the assessor to notify the taxpayer of an increase or decrease in the value of the taxpayer\u2019s property as a result of that audit strongly suggest the corresponding implied power to revalue that property for tax purposes, and the strength of that suggestion is sufficient to overcome any caution about recognizing such an implied power.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">In any event, unlike the usual cases involving the implied authority doctrine, in the present case we are confronted by a set of specific statutory amendments enacted for certain purposes. The question, therefore, is not whether the power to audit carries with it the power to revalue, as a general matter or as a matter of law. The question, instead, is whether the legislature, in enacting the 1986 amendments, intended to give the implied power to revalue as an incident of the power to audit that it explicitly granted. To be sure, the legislation could have been drafted more clearly so as to make explicit what was only implied. We are persuaded, however, from the legislative language, genealogy and history, that the legislature did have that purpose. \u201cWe see no justification to thwart the legislature\u2019s purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>simply because that purpose could have been stated more clearly. <em>\u201d Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The plaintiffs final argument is that, even if \u00a7 12-53 is ambiguous regarding whether the assessor has the authority to revalue, the axiom that any ambiguity must be resolved in the taxpayer\u2019s favor mandates that we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment. We are not persuaded that this axiom controls this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">First, like the closely related axioms articulated in <em>Pepin </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>supra, 171 Conn. 83 (municipalities have only taxing powers expressly granted by legislature, exercisable only in strict conformity to grant thereof), this long-standing axiom of statutory construction applied to taxing statutes is an important guideline to legislative meaning, but it cannot displace the result of careful and thoughtful interpretation. In the present case, that process of interpretation leads us to disagree with the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Second, taken literally, the axiom proves too much, because there are few, if any, tax or other statutes that are free from \u201cany ambiguity.\u201d It may well be that the axiom\u2019s proper application is to cases in which, after the court has engaged in the interpretive process and the arguments are essentially in equipoise \u2014 that is, the legislative meaning is nonetheless in doubt \u2014 the axiom applies to resolve the case in favor of the taxpayer. In this sense, it would operate as a kind of interpretive tiebreaker. In our view, this is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">Third, we have generally, albeit not exclusively, applied the axiom to statutes that we have characterized as \u201ctax imposition statute[s].\u201d <em>Prudential Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bannon, </em>233 Conn. 243, 248, 658 A.2d 567 (1995); see also <em>Foodways National, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>232 Conn. 325, 331, 654 A.2d 1228 (1995); <em>Altray Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>224 Conn. 426, 432, 619 A.2d 443 (1993); <em>Morton Buildings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bannon, </em>222 Conn. 49, 54, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>607 A.2d 424 (1992). For instance, the axiom has been applied to resolve ambiguities in the statutory language describing the property or transaction taxed, as applied to the facts of the particular case. See, e.g., <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 749 (whether generation of electricity constitutes \u201cmanufacturing\u201d for purposes of sales tax exemption); <em>Eastern Connecticut Cable Television, Inc. </em>v. <em>Montville, </em>180 Conn. 409, 414, 429 A.2d 905 (1980) (whether communications tower was taxable \u201cbuilding\u201d or \u201cmachinery\u201d within meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 12-64). It is true, as the plaintiff points out, that in <em>Altray Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>supra, 435, we applied the axiom to the \u201cright to apportion income under [General Statutes] \u00a7 12-218, as in other cases involving the imposition of a tax.\u201d Whatever the appropriate reach of, or limits on, this axiom, however, we are persuaded that it should not apply to the provisions of \u00a7 12-53 (b) and (c) at issue in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">One of the principal purposes of these provisions is to afford assessors the authority to audit the books and records of taxpayers who may have reported the value of their personal property inaccurately, whether unintentionally or as a result of fraud. These provisions neither describe the property to be taxed, nor the method of valuation. The legislative history indicates that they were enacted to combat the widespread problem of undervaluation that the assessors could not resolve satisfactorily within the limits of their resources and the preexisting time limits. See <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>supra, 103 Conn. 154 (construing tax statute by reference to whether legislature intended to impose difficult administrative burden on assessor). This purpose and this history bring this statute within the guideline that statutes establishing the procedure for the collection of taxes, including statutes enacted to prevent tax frauds, are given a liberal, rather than strict, construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>tion. 3A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th Ed. Singer 1992) \u00a7 66.06; see <em>International Business Machines Corp. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>167 Conn. 123, 129, 355 A.2d 236 (1974) (use tax, as gap-filling measure, merits liberal construction).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4140 (c),<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the plaintiff presents an alternate ground on which to affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment, namely, that the assessment was illegal because the assessor did not comply with his mandatory duty pursuant to \u00a7 12-53 (c) to give the plaintiff notice. Relying on the principle that \u201cstrict compliance with the statutory provisions is a condition precedent to the imposition of a valid tax\u201d; <em>Empire Estates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>147 Conn. 262, 264, 159 A.2d 812 (1960); the plaintiff argues that because the notice required pursuant to subsection (c) of \u00a7 12-53 is mandatory, rather than directory, and because, according to the stipulation, the plaintiff received no written notice from the assessor within thirty days after the hearing, the assessment was illegal. The defendants respond that: (1) the plaintiff, by bringing this action, waived any defect arising from the failure of the assessor to give timely notice;<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and (2) even if there was no waiver, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>the notice provided for in \u00a7 12-53 (c) is directory, not mandatory, and the plaintiff was not prejudiced by the fact that the notice was given, in the first instance, by the tax collector, rather than by the tax assessor. We disagree with the defendants\u2019 waiver claim but agree with their contention that the notice under \u00a7 12-53 (c) is directory and that there was no prejudice to the plaintiff. We therefore reject this alternate ground for affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The following additional facts are relevant to this issue. The hearing, or audit, conducted pursuant to \u00a7 12-53 (b) terminated on October 12, 1993. On or about October 31, 1993, the <em>tax collector, </em>not the assessor, sent three letters to the plaintiff, together with three tax bills.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In addition, on January 25,1994, the <em>assessor, </em>in response to an inquiry by the plaintiff, sent the plaintiff a four page schedule detailing the increased assessments on the various categories of the plaintiffs personal property.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Section 12-53 (c) provides that \u201c[i]f <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>the assessor or board of assessors\u201d increases or decreases the value of any taxable property under the provisions of \u00a7 12-53 (b), \u201cthey shall, within thirty days of such hearing or any adjournment thereof give [the taxpayer] notice thereof in writing by mailing the same, postage prepaid, to his last-known address and the same shall be held to be sufficient.\u201d We turn, first, to the defendants\u2019 claim of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">This claim is premised on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Manners </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>86 Conn. 573, 86 A. 14 (1913). In that case, a property owner challenged the assessment of benefits for the layout of a new street on the ground of lack of the legally required notice of the assessment to the property owner. This court held that, by appealing to the court from the assessment, the property owner had waived any defect arising from the lack of prior notice. Id., 578; see also <em>Palo </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>116 Conn. 601, 605, 165 A. 803 (1933) (plaintiff waived lack of required notice by bringing action for injunction and damages in connection with establishment of building line). We seriously doubt whether the waiver principles embodied in <em>Manners </em>and <em>Palo, </em>which were not tax assessment cases, are still valid, and we conclude, for the reasons that follow, that those principles cannot reasonably be applied to proceedings under \u00a7 12-53 (b) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Section 12-53 (d) specifically provides that \u201c[a]ny person claiming to be aggrieved by the action of the assessor or board of assessors under this section may appeal the doings of the assessor or board of assessors to the board of tax review and the superior court as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>otherwise provided in this chapter . . . .\u201d The plaintiff filed such an appeal with the boat'd of tax review and brought this action pursuant to \u00a7 12-119. The defendants do not challenge the propriety of this action in any way. It would be strange to hold that a taxpayer waives his right to challenge a purportedly illegal tax assessment by following the procedures specifically provided by the legislature for such a challenge. Moreover, it would, in effect, deprive the taxpayer of any effective remedy for such illegality. We decline to read our statutes, or apply extra-statutory waiver principles, to arrive at such a bizarre result.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">We turn, therefore, to the defendants\u2019 substantive claim that the assessor\u2019s duty of notice under \u00a7 12-53 (c) is directory, rather than mandatory. The criteria for determining whether such a notice is mandatory or directory are well established.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\u201cIn order to determine whether a statute\u2019s provisions are mandatory we have traditionally looked beyond the use of the word shall and examined the statute\u2019s essential purpose. <em>[Hall Manor Owner\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>212 Conn. 147, 152, 561 A.2d 1373 (1989)]. The test to be applied in determining whether a statute is mandatory or directory is whether the prescribed mode of action is the essence of the thing to be accomplished, or in other words, whether it relates to a matter of substance or a matter of convenience. . . . If it is a matter of substance, the statutory provision is mandatory. If, however, the legislative provision is designed to secure order, system and dispatch in the proceedings, it is generally held to be directory, especially where the requirement is stated in affirmative terms unaccompanied by negative words. . . . <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>234 Conn. 614, 617, 662 A.2d 762 (1995). Furthermore, if there is no language that expressly invalidates any action taken after noncompliance with the statutory pro visions, the statute should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>construed as directory. Id.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Crest Pontiac Cadillac, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hadley, </em>239 Conn. 437, 446, 685 A.2d 670 (1996). Applying this test, we conclude for the following four reasons that the notice by the assessor under \u00a7 12-53 (c) is directory, rather than mandatory, and that its purpose was complied with under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">First, although the statute uses the word, \u201cshall,\u201d there is no language expressly invalidating a defective notice. Second, the notice provision itself provides that the notice by the assessor within the thirty day period \u201cshall be held to be sufficient.\u201d This kind of language is often suggestive of a safe harbor type of notice, rather than a mandatory requirement. See, e.g., <em>Dart &amp; Bogue Co. </em>v. <em>Slosberg, </em>202 Conn. 566, 572, 522 A.2d 763 (1987). Third, although the notice triggers the right to appeal to the board of tax review, because the board may or may not be meeting at that particular time, \u00a7 12-53 (d) provides that \u201csuch appeal shall be extended in time to the next succeeding board of tax review if the statutory period for the meeting of such board has passed.\u201d This suggests that time is not necessarily of the essence with regard to this notice. Fourth, because \u00a7 12-53 (b) and (c) are the only statutory provisions under which an assessor may recover for fraudulent undervaluing discovered by an audit, we should require a very strong showing of prejudice that an assessor\u2019s defective notice under subsection (c) of \u00a7 12-53 would preclude such recovery. No such showing has been made in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The purpose of the notice is \u201cto notify a taxpayer that his property was being assessed at a higher figure than previously,\u201d so that, in the absence of such a notice the taxpayer could \u201crest on the assumption that the valuation of his property continues to be the same\u201d as that at which the taxpayer had listed it. <em>Empire Estates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 147 Conn. 266. In the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>case, the letters from the tax collector, together with the itemized bills, which were sent to the plaintiff within the thirty day period contemplated by \u00a7 12-53 (c), gave the plaintiff sufficient information to fulfill the purpose of the statutorily required notice, and this information was supplemented by the further detail given to the plaintiff by the tax assessor pursuant to the plaintiffs subsequent request. Under these circumstances, the plaintiff was not prejudiced in any way by the failure of the assessor strictly to comply with the notice provisions of \u00a7 12-53 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded (1) with direction to deny the plaintiffs motion for partial summaiy judgment on counts one and two of the plaintiffs complaint and to grant the defendants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment on those counts, and (2) for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">In this opinion BERDON, KATZ and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 12-53 provides: \u201cAddition of omitted property to list, (a) During the period prescribed by law for the completion of their duties the assessor or board of assessors of each town shall add to the list given in by any person and made according to law any taxable property which they have reason to believe is owned by him and has been omitted from such list, and property so added shall be assessed at the percentage of the actual valuation thereof, as determined by the assessor or board of assessors in accordance with the provisions of sections 12-63, 12-64 and 12-71, from the best information the assessor or board of assessors can obtain, and twenty-five per cent of such assessment shall be added thereto.

As we have explained previously, however, the statement of law articulated in <em>Empire Estates, Inc., </em>and <em>National CSS, Inc., </em>no longer applies to \u00a7 12-53 (b) and (c), because in both 1984 and 1986 the legislature lengthened the time for action by the assessor \u2014 to one year, in 1984, and then to three years, in 1986.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b479-6\"><em> </em>The plaintiff relies heavily on the fourth sentence of subsection (b) of \u00a7 12-53, which provides: \u201cAll omitted taxable property, discovered at such hearing . . . and not listed by the owner as required by law, shall be added to his list by such assessor ... at the percentage of its actual valuation, as determined by the assessor ... in accordance with the provisions of sections 12-63,12-64 and 12-71, and twenty-five per cent of such assessment shall be added thereto. . . .\u201d We do not read this sentence as urged by the plaintiff, namely, as confining the entire subsection to omitted property. Instead, we read it as imposing the specific penalty of 25 percent of the assessment for omitted property that is discovered during the audit conducted pursuant to subsection (b). Indeed, we have stated that \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 12-53 [(b)] authorizes a penalty only for property omitted from a <em>list Northeast Datacom, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wallingford, </em>212 Conn. 639, 651, 563 A.2d 688 (1989). This reading is consistent with: (1) the provisions of subsection (a) of \u00a7 12-53; (2) the position of the Handbook for Connecticut Assessors; and (3) the position of the defendants in this case, who disclaimed in oral argument that the penalty of 25 percent under subsection (b) could be applied to anything other than omitted property.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Thus, despite the dissent\u2019s insistence that we have somehow bypassed the \u201cpunitive nature of \u00a7 12-53 (a) and (b),\u201d we have not done so. The 25 percent penalty only applies to omitted property, not to all property reassessed pursuant to \u00a7 12-53 (a) and (b). Upon reading the dissent, however, one would think that we have, under the guise of interpreting \u00a7 12-53, reinstated the tax on tea that prompted the famous party in Boston Harbor in 1773.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 4140 provides in relevant part: \u201cPapers to be Filed by Appellant and Appellee . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">\u201c(c) Any party desiring to present alternative grounds for affirmance, adverse rulings or decisions in the event of a new trial or a claim concerning the relief ordered by the appellate court shall file a statement thereof within fourteen days from the issuance of notice of certification.

Section 12-55 <em>explicitly </em>gives the assessor the power to decrease or increase the valuation of such property listed but only on the <em>present </em>or last preceding grand list.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">In doing so, the majority attempts to surmount the plain language of \u00a7 12-53 (a) and (b), which restricts those sections to \u201comitted property\u201d rather than undervalued property, our past decision interpreting those sections as applying only to omitted property; <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>103 Conn. 149, 154, 130 A. 84 (1925); and the well established rule that ambiguities in taxing stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>utes are to be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. <em>Texaco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>215 Conn. 134, 137, 574 A.2d 1293 (1990); <em>Enthone, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bannon, </em>211 Conn. 655, 661, 560 A.2d 971 (1989); <em>Pepin </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>171 Conn. 74, 83, 368 A.2d 88 (1976); <em>Consolidated Diesel Electric Corp. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>156 Conn. 33, 36, 238 A.2d 410 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Believing it has cleared these three hurdles, the majority attempts to bypass the highest one, the punitive nature of \u00a7 12-53 (a) and (b), each of which contains a provision that requires a tax assessor to add a penalty of 25 percent to an added valuation. This penalty should have no application to a taxpayer who in good faith has a dispute with the tax collector over the value of its personal property. Such a severe penalty should apply only, as the statute provides, to a taxpayer who omits property on its list in order to avoid taxes or fails to file any list. We have so held. <em>Northeast Datacom, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wallingford, </em>212 Conn. 639, 651, 563 A.2d 688 (1989). Every provision for adding property valuation to the taxpayer\u2019s list under \u00a7 12-53 (a) and (b) mandates such a 25 percent penalty. In 1989, while the statute was in its present form, this court stated that \u201cthere is no statutory authority for the levy of a penalty assessment for understating the value of assessable property. . . . General Statutes \u00a7 12-53 authorizes a penalty only for property omitted from a list.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The majority concludes, however, by its statutory interpretation that \u00a7 12-53 (a) and (b) were also intended to apply to fraudulent undervaluation of property on a grand list. The simple answer to this interpretation is that if the legislature wanted \u00a7 12-53 (a) and (b) to apply to cases of fraudulent undervaluation it could have said so. It did not. Furthermore, in the case before us there is no claim or even suggestion that the taxpayer was acting in a fraudulent manner, as the majority recognizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>The result here is not founded on sound legal principle. Our constitutional warrant is not to rewrite the General Statutes the way we believe they should have been written, but to apply them the way they are in fact written. In the words of Justice Jackson: \u201cI should concur in this result more readily if the Court could reach it by analysis of the statute instead of by psychoanalysis of the Congress. . . . That process seems to me not interpretation of a statute but creation of a statute.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>345 U.S. 295, 319, 73 S. Ct. 706, 97 L. Ed. 1020 (1953) (Jackson, J., concurring). It is simply undemocratic for any public officers other than the elected representatives of the people to legislate. It should particularly rankle us, the heirs of revolutionary Connecticut, when this is done to tax us. After all, it was taxation without \u201cour consent\u201d that led the thirteen colonies to take on the British Empire and begin our constitutional system. The Declaration of Independence para. 19 (U.S. 1776).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is vital that we continue that system by recognizing the supreme power of the people and the resultant limitations on our power as a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-11\"> \u201cTaxation without representation is tyranny.\u201d Attributed to James Otis (1763).
