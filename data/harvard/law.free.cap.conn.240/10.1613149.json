The defendant surety on the bond, Seaboard Surety Company (Seaboard), appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court granting summary judgment to the plaintiff, Dysart Corporation (Dysart), the pub owner, on its claim under the payment bond for the amount of the dishonored checks. Because we conclude that, as a matter of law, Dysart is not a proper claimant under the payment bond, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">The following facts and procedural history are undisputed. Seaboard, in connection with a middle school construction project in Montville, provided the labor and material payment bond required by General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 49-41<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for all large-scale public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>works construction projects. The principal on the bond was the general contractor for the project, Suffolk Construction Company, Inc. (Suffolk). One of Suffolk\u2019s subcontractors, Diamond Construction, Inc. (Diamond), issued the checks in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">At all times relevant to this appeal, Dysart conducted business in Massachusetts as the Tara Pub. The sole connection Dysart had with the construction project was that Diamond\u2019s employees were frequent customers at the Tara Pub. As a service to these customers, and to solicit and maintain their business, the Tara Pub would often cash the employees\u2019 paychecks for them. In such instances, the Diamond employees would endorse their checks over to Dysart by blank endorsements, putting their signatures on the backs of the checks. See, e.g., J. White &amp; R. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code (2d Ed. 1980) \u00a7 13-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>From April 30, 1992, to June 12, 1992, Dysart cashed Diamond paychecks in the amount of $23,019 for the Diamond employees. When Dysart subsequently deposited the checks, however, they were dishonored by Diamond\u2019s bank because Diamond\u2019s account lacked sufficient funds. Dysart then filed a claim with Seaboard under the payment bond to collect the amount of the dishonored checks. Seaboard refused to pay Dysart\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Dysart subsequently commenced this action against Seaboard. The first count of Dysart\u2019s complaint was a claim that Dysart is entitled to payment under the payment bond, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 49-42, as an assignee of the rights of the Diamond employees in their paychecks.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The second count was a claim that Dysart has a right to make a claim under the payment bond as a holder in due course of the paychecks, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-203<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>the Uniform Commercial Code.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In its answer, Seaboard asserted, as special defenses, that Dysart is not a proper claimant within the meaning of \u00a7 49-42, and that \u00a7 42a-3-203 is inapplicable to the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Both parties moved for summary judgment. The trial court concluded that: (1) Dysart was an assignee of the payment bond rights of the Diamond employees in their paychecks and, as such, is a proper claimant under \u00a7 49-42; and (2) Dysart\u2019s status as a holder in due course pursuant to \u00a7 42a-3-203 also entitled it to make a claim under \u00a7 49-42. Accordingly, the trial court granted Dysart\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Seaboard\u2019s cross motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Seaboard first claims that the trial court improperly concluded that, by endorsing their paychecks over to Dysart, the Diamond employees assigned to Dysart their rights to make a claim under the payment bond. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">We begin by noting that Dysart does not fall within the specific intended scope of protection of \u00a7 49-41. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Section 49-42 (a) explicitly limits the class of claimants who may seek payment under a \u00a7 49-41 payment bond to those who have \u201cfurnished labor or material\u201d to the bonded construction project, including \u201c[a]ny person having [a] direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor but no contractual relationship express or implied with the contractor.\u201d Dysart does not argue that it qualifies as a claimant under the literal language of \u00a7 49-42. That is, Dysart does not allege that it has ever provided labor or materials to the construction project, or that a contractual relationship has ever existed between Dysart and any contractor or subcontractor on the construction project.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Instead, Dysart contends that the Diamond employees intended to assign, and did assign, their rights under the payment bond when they endorsed their paychecks over to Dysart.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Dysart notes that the Diamond employees themselves would have had the right to assert claims under the payment bond if they personally had attempted to deposit their paychecks and those checks had been dishonored. Dysart argues, and the trial court concluded, that it should be allowed to assert the Diamond employees\u2019 rights under the payment bond by virtue of the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Seaboard\u2019s response to Dysart\u2019s position is twofold. First, Seaboard argues that a right to make a claim under a payment bond cannot be assigned under \u00a7 49-41. Second, Seaboard argues that, even if such a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>can be assigned, no valid assignment was made in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Dysart relies on analogy to federal law to support its position that the assignees of proper claimants are also proper claimants. Section 49-41 was \u201cpatterned after federal legislation popularly known as the Miller Act; 40 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 270a through 270d; [and] we have regularly consulted federal precedents to determine the proper scope of our statute.\u201d <em>Okee Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Grange Mutual Ins. Co., </em>225 Conn. 367, 374, 623 A.2d 483 (1993); see also <em>American Masons\u2019 Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F. W. Brown Co., </em>174 Conn. 219, 223-24, 384 A.2d 378 (1978). It is true that in the context of the Miller Act, the United States Supreme Court has held that an assignee of the claims of persons furnishing labor or materials on a bonded project <em>is </em>within the protection of the statutory bond, even if the assignee itself did not furnish labor or materials. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>353 U.S. 210, 218-19, 77 S. Ct. 793, 1 L. Ed. 2d 776 (1957). We need not determine, however, whether assignees of proper payment bond claimants are also protected under our payment bond statute because we conclude that the Diamond employees cannot be deemed to have assigned their rights under the payment bond to Dysart.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">It is undisputed that thirty-two of Diamond\u2019s employees negotiated by blank endorsement a total of thirty-nine checks to Dysart. The negotiation of the checks to Dysart in exchange for cash unquestionably gave Dysart the rights of a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42a-3-203, 42a-3-302 and 42a-3-305. The question is whether the mere endorsement and delivery of the checks was sufficient to assign to Dysart the Diamond employees\u2019 separate and distinct rights to bring suit under the payment bond in the event that the checks were later dishonored. Assuming, without deciding, that these rights are assign<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>able, we conclude that no such assignment was made in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">We first note that the mere negotiation of the checks themselves to Dysart, with nothing more, did not operate as a legal assignment of the employees\u2019 separate payment bond rights. \u201cGenerally, to constitute an assignment there must be a purpose to assign or transfer the whole or a part of some particular thing, debt, or chose in action, and the subject matter of the assignment must be described with such particularity as to render it capable of identification.\u201d 6A C.J.S. 659, Assignments \u00a7 46 (1975); cf. <em>Windsor Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>86 Conn. 511, 513, 86 A. 1 (1913) (holding that transfer of bill of exchange not assignment of debt or chose in action where nothing in document or factual circumstances surrounding transfer indicated intention to assign). In this case, at the time of the transfer of the checks, there was no objective manifestation by the Diamond employees or Dysart that the employees were assigning to Dysart any rights they may have possessed in the payment bond. The subject matter of the purported assignment was not \u201cdescribed with such particularity as to render it capable of identification.\u201d 6A C.J.S., supra, 659. Although case law addressing this issue is scarce, we have found no authority that persuades us that the endorsement and delivery of a check transfers, as a matter of law, anything other than a right to payment from the drawer of the instrument and certain rights against the endorser.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>The question, therefore, becomes whether, when the Diamond employees endorsed their paychecks to Dysart, their payment bond rights can be considered to have been transferred to Dysart pursuant to principles of equity. In support of this theory, Dysart emphasizes the remedial purpose of \u00a7 49-41, and urges that this remedial purpose is served by allowing it to \u201cstep into the shoes\u201d of the Diamond employees and permitting it to assert those employees\u2019 rights against Seaboard. We agree with Dysart that \u00a7 49-41 is remedial legislation; <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>236 Conn. 750, 757, 674 A.2d 1313 (1996); and that remedial statutes should be construed liberally in favor of those whom the law is intended to protect. A recitation of this general principle, however, merely begs the question of whom the legislation is, in fact, intended to protect. <em>Cagiva North America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schenk, </em>239 Conn. 1, 14, 680 A.2d 964 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">We have held that the payment bond required by \u00a7 49-41 is intended to protect \u201cworkers and materials suppliers on public works projects who cannot avail themselves of otherwise available remedies such as mechanic\u2019s liens. See <em>Okee Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Grange Mutual Ins. Co., </em>[supra, 225 Conn. 373]; <em>Nor\u2019easter Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Colossale Concrete, Inc., </em>207 Conn. 468, 477-79, 542 A.2d 692 (1988); <em>Pelton &amp; King, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bethlehem, </em>109 Conn. 547, 556, 147 A. 144 (1929).\u201d <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 757. Section 49-42 provides that such workers and suppliers may bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>suit under the payment bond if full payment is not received. See footnote 3. The right of action under a payment bond is statutorily limited under \u00a7 49-42 (a) to those having a direct contractual relationship with a project contractor or subcontractor in order to \u201cprevent the imposition of unlimited liability upon the prime contractor and his surety.\u201d <em>American Masons\u2019 Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F. W. Brown Co., </em>supra, 174 Conn. 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">This limiting principle stems from the need of every general contractor to protect itself against excessively remote and, from its perspective, undetermined claims. Id. The general contractor and surety must be able to limit their liability by having a clearly delineated circle of inquiry. The present case illustrates the practical import of this principle. If the Diamond employees had themselves deposited their paychecks, then Suffolk undoubtedly would have discovered the problem with Diamond\u2019s finances quickly, after the first employee complained about his or her dishonored check. Suffolk could then have taken action to halt Diamond\u2019s work on the project, or at least have withheld the subcontract retainage pending any claims against the bond based on the bad checks, thereby limiting both its own and Seaboard\u2019s potential liability. As events actually transpired, however, Dysart accumulated the checks for over one and one-half months before attempting to deposit any of them. Suffolk, therefore, had no notice of, and no way of knowing about, Diamond\u2019s financial problems before it released the retainage and paid Diamond for its work. Accordingly, we see no compelling reason to invoke equity in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Indeed, the Washington Supreme Court has concluded, as a general rule, that equity should not be invoked to allow a person to whom a check has been negotiated to bring suit under a public works payment bond, due to the particular nature of a check. <em>National Market Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co., </em>100 Wash. 370, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>381, 174 P. 479 (1918). The court acknowledged that \u201cthe assignment of [a] debt\u201d will be construed as an equitable assignment and \u201cwill carry with it the security.\u201d Id., 380. The court noted, however, that, under Washington law, the endorsement and delivery of a check was <em>not </em>an assignment of debt. The court first explained that \u201c[t]he ordinary bank check is not, either in law or in equity, an assignment of the fund upon which it is drawn . . . but is purely and simply an order for the payment of money, which in no wise affects the debt for which it is given until the order is paid . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id. The court then explained that, because a check is only an order, the endorsement and delivery of a check could not be considered the assignment of a <em>debt. </em>Id. Accordingly, \u201cthe equitable doctrine that the assignment of debt will carry with it the security . . . cannot be applied here because there was no assignment of debt . . . .\u2019\u2019Id. The court concluded that the only rights that an endorsee of a check receives are those that arise by law when any negotiable instrument is endorsed. Id., 380-81.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>We find the reasoning of the Washington Supreme Court in <em>National Market Co. </em>persuasive and applicable to the present case, and thus conclude that the mere endorsement of a check does not constitute an equitable assignment of any right in an underlying payment bond. It is true that the assignment of a <em>debt </em>in Connecticut may also entail a concomitant equitable assignment of any security for that debt. See <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Stein, </em>100 Conn. 668, 677, 124 A. 546 (1924); <em>Lemmon </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>59 Conn. 448, 454, 22 A. 293 (1890). Under Connecticut law, however, a check is only an order for the payment of money, not an assignment of any particular funds. General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-408;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>see Bassett v. City Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>115 Conn. 1, 22, 160 A. 60 (1932). Moreover, Connecticut statutes specifically limit the scope of the check instrument and the effect of an endorsement. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42a-3-408, 42a-3-415 and 42a-3-416.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Thus, under Connecticut law the endorsement in blank of a check does not carry with it an assignment of any debt for which the check may have been issued. We see no reason to invoke equity and expand the effect of an endorsement of a check beyond what the statutes explicitly provide for, especially in the present context, where, as previously discussed, policy concerns mandate circumscribing the class of potential payment bond claimants.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the endorse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>ment of the checks in this case did not serve as either a legal or equitable assignment of the employees\u2019 rights under the payment bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Seaboard\u2019s second claim is that the trial court improperly concluded that \u00a7 42a-3-203<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> entitles Dysart, as a holder in due course, to make a claim against the payment bond issued by Seaboard. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Section 42a-3-203 (b) provides that \u201c[transfer of an instrument . . . vests in the transferee . . . any right as a holder in due course . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Section 42a-3-203 has no relevance, however, to Dysart\u2019s claim regarding the statutory payment bond. Dysart\u2019s status as a holder in due course simply means that it holds the checks in question free from certain claims and defenses of the drawer of the check. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42a-3-305<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>and 42a-3-306;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> see also J. White &amp; R. Summers, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 14-9, 14-10. The fact that Dysart is not subject to these specified defenses does not give it any affirmative rights concerning the payment bond. Being a holder in due course, in and of itself, does not give rise to an action under a surety bond pursuant to \u00a7 49-42.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">For the reasons stated previously, we conclude, as a matter of law, that Dysart is not a proper claimant under the payment bond. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment for Dysart. Furthermore, because, as a matter of law, Dysart is unable to maintain a claim under the bond, we conclude that the trial court should have rendered summary judgment for Seaboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny Dysart\u2019s motion for summary judgment and to grant Seaboard\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b33-10\"> Seaboard appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b33-11\"> The revision of the statute in effect on the date the bond was issued, April 30, 1991, is controlling. <em>American Masons\u2019 Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F.

The test for an assignment revolves around the indicia of intent present <em>a t the time of the assignment. </em>Cf. <em>Windsor Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 86 Conn. 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Moreover, we conclude that the \u201cassignment\u201d forms that Dysart subsequently received from several of the employees, in which the employees granted Dysart their present \u201crights to collect, sue and otherwise fully prosecute any and all claims\u201d; see footnote 6; were incapable of conveying any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>thing to Dysart. This is because once the Diamond employees endorsed and delivered their checks to Dysart in exchange for cash, and in the absence of any recovery back from them by Dysart for the dishonored checks, the employees themselves had no right to recover under the payment bond with regard to those checks. At that point, the employees could not claim to be persons who had \u201cnot been paid in full\u201d for their services within the meaning of \u00a7 49-42. See footnote 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b42-5\"> The South Dakota Supreme Court, however, has held that a person to whom a check has been negotiated may maintain an action under a public works surety bond. <em>Finch </em>v. <em>Enke, </em>54 S.D. 164, 166, 222 N.W. 657 (1929). The court in <em>Finch </em>agreed with the general principle that the endorsement of a check did not legally carry with it any payment rights under a surety bond, but concluded that the endorsement did constitute an equitable assignment that allowed the endorsee to assert a claim under the surety bond. Id., 169. \u201cWhen appellants became [endorsees of such checks, they became assignees of a valid, equitable assignment from the payees of such checks; this equitable assignment transferred to appellants the rights of the payees to have their claims paid, if need be, by [the surety] who had guaranteed their payment.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">A Texas appellate court also recently concluded that the right to make a claim under a payment bond is transferred when employees on a public construction project endorse their paychecks over to third parties. <em>J.W.D., Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co., </em>806 S.W.2d 327, 332 (Tex. App. 1991). The court did so, however, based largely upon a provision of the Texas codification of the Uniform Commercial Code that specifies that \u201c \u2018[u]nless otherwise agreed where an instrument is taken for an underlying obligation . . . the obligation is suspended pro tanto until the instrument is due or if it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>payable on demand until its presentment. <em>If the instrument is dishonored action may be maintained on either the instrument, or the obligation.\u2019 </em>[Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. \u00a7 3.802 (a) (1968 &amp; Supp. 1991)] (emphasis added). The official comment to section 3.802 makes it clear that any <em>holder, </em>not limited to the payee, of such an instrument is entitled to maintain an action on the underlying obligation . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 329. We need not consider the merits of this analysis, as an identical provision was deleted from Connecticut\u2019s version of the Uniform Commercial Code in 1991, before the transfers involved in the present case. Accordingly, <em>J.W.D., Inc., </em>is of limited persuasive value.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b43-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-408 provides: \u201cDrawee not liable on unaccepted draft.

Bartlett, </em>231 U.S. 237, 243, 34 S. Ct. 88, 58 L.

These eases all assume that a payment bond claim has been assigned, and merely provide that such an assignment does not prevent an assignee from recovering.

There was no question that the subcontractor was a proper claimant.
