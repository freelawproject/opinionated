Hartford accepted the defendant\u2019s application, and wrote specifications and solicited bids for improvements to the defendant\u2019s home. The bid of the plaintiff, Jacques All Trades Corporation, was accepted and the plaintiff and the defendant subsequently contracted for improvements to cost $20,150, which amount was entirely funded by the preservation loan obtained by the defendant from Hartford. The contract price included the improvements for which bids originally had been solicited as well as other work that had been agreed to by the plaintiff and the defendant and subsequently approved by Hartford. Hartford was not a signatory to the contracts. Among other things, however, it furnished the contract forms, approved the contracts and administered the project as construction manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">When the plaintiff was not paid upon completion of the work contracted for, it brought a two count complaint in the Superior Court. The first count alleged a breach of contract against the defendant. The second count sought release of the mortgage funds in the amount of $20,150 held by Hartford. The defendant filed special defenses and a counterclaim asserting, inter alia, that the contracts were invalid because they did not comply with the Home Improvement Act, General Statutes \u00a7 20-418 et seq. (act). Following a second trial,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>the court rendered judgment against the defendant on the first count of the plaintiffs complaint in the amount of $20,150 and against Hartford on the second count and ordered Hartford to pay to the plaintiff the $20,150 it was holding as a stakeholder. The trial court found that the contracts between the plaintiff and the defendant did not comply with the act because they failed to contain the required notice of cancellation. The court concluded, however, that the plaintiff could enforce the contracts because they fell within the municipal exemption of General Statutes \u00a7 20-428 (l),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which provides in pertinent part that the act does not apply to \u201c[t]he government of the state, municipalities of the state or any department or agency of the state or such municipalities . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The basis of the trial court\u2019s decision was that \u201cfor all practical purposes [Hartford] was a functional and essential party to [the contract]\u201d and that \u201csuch substantial municipal involvement\u201d rendered the transaction exempt from the act. The defendant appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment and the plaintiff cross appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The Appellate Court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment against the defendant and Hartford, concluding, inter aha, that the trial court improperly had found that the municipal exemption contained in \u00a7 20-428 (1) applied to the contracts between the plaintiff and the defendant. <em>Jacques All Trades Corp. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>42 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>App. 124, 679 A.2d 27 (1996). The Appellate Court determined that, because Hartford had not been a signatory or a party to the contracts, the municipal exemption did not apply, despite Hartford\u2019s substantial involvement in the transactions. Id., 128-29. The Appellate Court concluded that the plaintiff could not prevail because the contracts were neither exempt from nor in compliance with the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">We granted the plaintiff certification to appeal limited to the following issue: \u201cWhether the Appellate Court properly concluded, under the facts and circumstances of this case, that the municipal exemption contained in General Statutes \u00a7 20-428 did not apply to the contract in issue?\u201d <em>Jacques All Trades Corp. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>240 Conn. 903, 688 A.2d 332 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">After examining the record on appeal and after considering the briefs and arguments of the parties, we conclude that the judgment of the Appellate Court should be affirmed. The issue on which we granted certification was properly resolved in the Appellate Court\u2019s thoughtful and comprehensive unanimous opinion. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein.

The Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for a new trial. See <em>Jacques All Trades Corp. </em>v. Brown, 33 Conn.

The trial court found, however, that that contract did not comply with the act and was not exempt from the act pursuant to \u00a7 20-428 (1) because Hartford was not involved in that contract. The Appellate Court affirmed that aspect of the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>Jacques All Trades Corp. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>42 Conn.
