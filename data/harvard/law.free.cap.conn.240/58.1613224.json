In that decision, this court held that a contract between the plaintiff, Rizzo Pool Company, and the defendants, Daniel and Jo-Ann Del Grosso, to install a swimming pool at the defendants\u2019 home was subject to the requirements of the Home Improvement Act (HIA)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Home Solicitation Sales Act (HSSA).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we concluded that the trial court had improperly precluded the defendants from establishing their special statutory defenses to the plaintiffs claim of breach of contract. We further concluded that, because the requirements of the HIA are mandatory and must be strictly construed, the plaintiffs undisputed violation of the HIA rendered the contracts unenforceable. Finally, we declared that because the plaintiff had not performed any of the home improvement services contemplated by the contract, the plaintiff could not establish bad faith repudiation of the contract by the defendants or claim restitutionary relief based on a theory of quasi-contract, quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. Accordingly, we concluded that the plaintiff could not recover and that the defendants were entitled to judgment on the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Following the order by this court that the case be \u201cremanded with direction to render judgment thereon for the defendants,\u201d the defendants moved in the trial court for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb. The plaintiff objected, arguing that the defendants had not preserved the issue of attorney\u2019s fees in their initial appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, the plaintiff claimed that because we had not ordered further proceedings as part of the rescript, the trial court lacked authority to award attorney\u2019s fees on remand. The plaintiff further argued that because the contract at issue did not fall within the definition of a consumer contract found in General Statutes \u00a7 42-151 (b),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the defendants were not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 42-150bb. Finally, the plaintiff argued that, should the trial court nevertheless award attorney\u2019s fees, those fees must be subject to the limitations on any such award under General Statutes \u00a7 42-150aa.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court rejected the plaintiffs arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>and, following an evidentiary hearing, awarded attorney\u2019s fees of $6400 to Daniel Del Grosso and $7500 to Jo-Ann Del Grosso. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Although the plaintiff made a number of claims before the trial court, the claims are, for all intents and purposes, simply subparts of a single issue \u2014 whether the trial court improperly awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">We begin with the plaintiffs argument that no procedural basis existed for the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees. Specifically, the plaintiff asserts that the defendants failed to preserve the claim for attorney\u2019s fees at trial in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 285A<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>and 4185,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and before this court as part of their original appeal. Furthermore, in the absence of any order for further proceedings by this court, the plaintiff claims that the trial court was limited to the remand order.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">It is uncontested that the defendants had not requested attorney\u2019s fees in the trial court. It is also undisputed that in their initial appeal the defendants requested only that the plaintiffs verdict be set aside and that this court either order a new trial or direct a verdict in their favor based upon the violation of the HLA. Although the defendants concede that the first time they made the request for attorney\u2019s <em>fees was </em>following this court\u2019s remand to the trial court, they nevertheless argue that the trial court properly entertained their motion. We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">We first address the plaintiffs claim of waiver. Section 42-150bb provides for an award of attorney\u2019s fees to a consumer who has <em>successfully </em>defended an action. Because in the original proceedings the defendants had been prohibited from presenting any evidence of the plaintiffs violations of the HIA and the HSSA, the statutes upon which they were relying to bring them within \u00a7 42-150bb, they never had the opportunity during the trial to seek attorney\u2019s fees. Moreover, because the defendants had not been <em>successful, </em>they had neither reason nor opportunity to seek such an award at that time. We do not generally require parties to engage in futile conduct. See <em>Vachon </em>v. <em>Tomascak, </em>155 Conn. 52, 57, 230 A.2d 5 (1967). Consequently, because the defendants were not in a position to raise the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees until they succeeded on appeal, we fail to see how they were in a position to have waived their claim. Similarly, there was no reason for the defendants to have raised the issue of an award of attorney\u2019s fees before this court. This is not an instance of a party seeking to raise an issue after an appeal that could have been raised in the earlier appeal. See <em>Hartford National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>195 Conn. 218, 222, 487 A.2d 528, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 845, 106 S. Ct. 135, 88 L. Ed. 2d 111 (1985). Moreover, because the defendants had no basis upon which to request an award by the trial court, there was no record upon which to seek review by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Nevertheless, the plaintiff maintains that the defendants could have done one of two things: (1) prior to trial, the defendants could have notified the plaintiff that they would seek an award of attorney\u2019s fees should they prevail in defending against the plaintiffs claim; or (2) on appeal, they could have asked this court, in the event they succeeded on appeal, to direct the trial court on remand to award attorney\u2019s fees. The plaintiff cites no specific authority to support the assertion that either of these procedures is required, and we have found none. Indeed, unlike the plaintiffs claim or the defendants\u2019 counterclaim, to which a request for relief properly attaches, there is no procedural mechanism by which the defendants could have alerted the trial court or the plaintiff to a future conditional request for fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">As to the plaintiffs second proposal, although the defendants could have included a footnote in their brief alerting this court to their interest in obtaining attorney\u2019s fees upon our remand, there is nothing to suggest that the rescript would have been any different. For the reasons set forth in part I B of this opinion, under the circumstances of this case the order to render judgment for the defendants properly left the issue of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>postjudgment proceedings to the trial court, which had the evidence it needed to make the initial determination that attorney\u2019s fees were proper. Cf. <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Healey Ford-Subaru, Inc., </em>231 Conn. 707, 730-31, 652 A.2d 496 (1995) (holding trial court could not entertain request for attorney\u2019s fees when consumer contract upon which claim was based had not been introduced into evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The plaintiff next argues that the terms of our rescript deprived the trial court of the authority to award attorney\u2019s fees, despite the fact that they are available as a matter of law. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">\u201cWell established principles govern further proceedings after a remand by this court. In carrying out a mandate of this court, the trial court is limited to the specific direction of the mandate as interpreted <em>in light of the opinion. . . . </em>This is the guiding principle that the trial court must observe. . . . Compliance means that the direction is not deviated from. The trial court cannot adjudicate rights and duties not within the scope of the remand. ... It is the duty of the trial court on remand to comply strictly with the mandate of the appellate court according to its true intent and meaning. No judgment other than that directed or permitted by the reviewing court may be rendered, even though it may be one that the appellate court might have directed. The trial court should examine the mandate and <em>the opinion of the reviewing court and proceed in conformity with the views expressed </em>therein.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Halpern </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>231 Conn. 308, 311, 649 A.2d 534 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">We have also cautioned, however, that our remand orders should not be construed \u201cso narrowly as to prohibit a trial court from considering matters relevant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>the issues upon which further proceedings are ordered that may not have been envisioned at the time of the remand. ... So long as these matters are not extraneous to the issues and purposes of the remand, they may be brought into the remand hearing.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The relevant circumstances in this case necessarily include the fact that the attorney\u2019s fees statute, \u00a7 42-150bb, became applicable to the defendants only after the trial court had rendered judgment in their favor, postappeal. Consequently, the trial court was required to look carefully at the words of the appellate mandate in conjunction with the language of the statute in question. Under \u00a7 42-150bb, the court has no latitude to deny such an award to a consumer who successfully defends an action brought against him by a commercial party. Therefore, despite the absence of a specific mandate in the remand order, attorney\u2019s fees were available to the defendants by operation of law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">We expressly reject the plaintiffs implied suggestion that unless we specifically set forth, as part of the rescript, all statutorily mandated postjudgment awards, such awards are precluded. Indeed, adoption of the plaintiffs argument would have ramifications far beyond this case. In this regard, cases involving other postjudgment awards are instructive. For example, we note that costs are statutorily mandated as well; General Statutes \u00a7 52-257; and although the award of costs can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>be more ministerial than the award of attorney\u2019s fees,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> for purposes of this issue, the guiding principles behind costs and attorney\u2019s fees are sufficiently similar. The plaintiff has not pointed to any cases, and our research has revealed none, in which costs were specifically awarded to the prevailing party as part of the rescript. Indeed, despite the lack of a specific direction in the rescript, it is undisputed that, generally, costs have been available and have been awarded to the prevailing party by operation of such mandatory provisions for decades.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In this regard, <em>Cassidy </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>130 Conn. 237, 33 A.2d 142 (1943), is instructive. In <em>Cassidy, </em>this court ordered the trial court to set aside the judgment and to render judgment for the defendant. Id., 246. Thereafter, the plaintiff moved to reargue the appeal so as to request the court to amend its rescript to state specifically that no costs would be taxed in favor of the now prevailing party. Id. In declining to do so, the court relied upon the usual practice of allowing costs to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>determined at the trial court level, concluding that certain costs were justified although they had not been mentioned in the original remand order. Id. In the absence of any suggestion by the plaintiff in <em>Cassidy </em>that the usual rules as to taxation of costs should not follow upon the disposition of the appeal, the court declined to amend the rescript, out of concern that inviting postappeal motions to reargue would have the deleterious effect of delaying the publication of our decisions. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Similarly, in <em>Mazzotta </em>v. <em>Bornstein, </em>105 Conn. 242, 244, 135 A. 38 (1926), the propriety of granting then mandatory statutory interest following an appeal was confirmed, despite the absence of any express mandate in the rescript. In that case, in which the amount of the plaintiffs judgment had been increased on appeal, the court found that the trial court had, by calculating the interest on that additional amount using an incorrect date, exceeded the scope of the remand. Id., 244-45. In the course of its decision, the court noted that, \u201c[h]ad the judgment . . . been affirmed, interest would have run, <em>as of course, </em>from the date of that judgment .... While the rescript <em>did not specify </em>that the judgment as directed bore interest from the date of the judgment appealed from, it can bear no other interpretation . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Citation omitted; emphasis added.) Id., 244. As both <em>Cassidy </em>and <em>Mazzotta </em>illustrate, when costs and interest are statutorily mandated, and the incident of a judgment operates as a matter of law, this court has not required either to be specifically awarded in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>the remand order for the prevailing party to claim and receive them.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">We know of no reason why in this case it was improper for the trial court to follow standard operating procedure in connection with postjudgment awards generally, and \u00a7 42-150bb specifically, in light of the defendants\u2019 successful defense. Moreover, the plaintiff has failed to furnish us with any reasonable explanation as to how, in this case, adherence to standard procedure following our disposition of the appeal has worked a surprise or an injustice. On the record before us, there is no sufficiently compelling reason for the trial court to have deviated from established procedure. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly read the rescript in <em>Rizzo Pool Co. </em>v. <em>Del Grosso, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 689, and proceeded in conformity with our expressed intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">In addition to the claims of preclusion, the plaintiff asserts that because the contract at issue was not a consumer contract under \u00a7 42-151 (b), the trial court improperly relied on \u00a7 42-150bb as a basis upon which to award attorney\u2019s fees. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs reliance on \u00a7 42-151 is misplaced and that because the contract at issue satisfied the definition of consumer contract under \u00a7 42-150bb, the award of attorney\u2019s fees as provided therein was proper. We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The plaintiff first asserts that by originally permitting the jury to award the plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees well in excess of 15 percent of the amount of the judgment; see General Statutes \u00a7 42-150aa;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the trial court implicitly had determined that the contract at issue was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>a consumer contract,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> a finding that remained undisturbed on appeal. We disagree with this characterization of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">As one of their claims in the first appeal, the defendants challenged the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff because the amount awarded was greater than that authorized by \u00a7 42-150aa. Because we concluded that the defendants were entitled to a directed verdict on the plaintiffs breach of contract claim, we had no reason to address that claim. Nevertheless, we did determine that the contract at issue was governed by the HIA, which governs contracts between an \u201cowner\u201d and a \u201ccontractor\u201d relating to \u201chome improvements,\u201d which are defined as work performed on any land or building that \u201cis used or designed to be used as a private residence [or] dwelling place . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 20-419 (4). \u201cOwner\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who owns or resides in a private residence . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 20-419 (6). We also held that the contract for the defendants\u2019 swimming pool fell within the parameters of the HSSA, which defines a home solicitation sale as the sale of \u201cconsumer goods or services . . . .\u2019\u2019General Statutes \u00a7 42-134a (a). That statute further defines consumer goods and services as \u201cgoods or services purchased . . . primarily for personal, family, or household purposes . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-134a (b). Because both of these acts deal exclusively with consumer contracts, the trial court, in awarding attorney\u2019s fees, properly treated the contract as a consumer contract for purposes of the HIA and the HSSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The plaintiff further argues that, even if we assume that the contract at issue is a consumer contract for purposes of the HIA and the HSSA, it is not a consumer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>contract for purposes of an award under \u00a7 42-150bb. Rather, according to the plaintiff, the trial court should have confined itself to chapter 742 of the General Statutes and applied the definition of consumer contract contained in \u00a7 42-151. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Chapter 741 d of the General Statutes, entitled \u201cAttorneys\u2019 Fee Clauses,\u201d contains only two sections, \u00a7\u00a7 42-150aa and 42-150bb, both of which are specifically designated as treating attorney\u2019s fees in actions on consumer contracts. Both sections provide a definition of \u201cconsumer contract\u201d as one in which \u201cthe money, property or service that is the subject of the transaction is primarily for personal, family or household purposes.\u201d Notably, \u00a7 42-150bb contains no specific monetary limit on its applicability. Indeed, aside from the proviso that attorney\u2019s fees should be based as far as practicable on the terms governing the commercial party\u2019s fees, \u00a7 42-150bb contains no further qualification. Judging from its terms, the focus of chapter 741d is on the amount of attorney\u2019s fees that may be awarded, depending upon whether the claimant is the consumer or the commercial party. See part III of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Nevertheless, the plaintiff contends that the trial court should have disregarded the provision for attorney\u2019s fees in this chapter in favor of chapter 742, which, despite its broad title, \u201cConsumer Contracts,\u201d deals solely with the scope and enforcement of the plain language standard for consumer contracts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Section 42-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>151 (b) provides a definition of a \u201cconsumer contract,\u201d to be applied under that chapter, which the defendants in this case admittedly cannot satisfy,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and does not mention the issue of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Section 42-150bb provides its own definition of the type of contract for which attorney\u2019s fees may be recovered. It contains no reference to the following chapter and no suggestion that \u00a7 42-151 should apply. As indicated, the first sentence of \u00a7 42-151 expressly provides that the definitions provided \u201cshall apply <em>in this chapter,\u201d </em>and does not purport to provide a global definition of \u201cconsumer contracts.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We find no reason under the facts and circumstances of this case to look beyond \u00a7 42-150bb to define its scope or to limit its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The plaintiffs last challenge in this appeal concerns the amount of attorney\u2019s fees awarded by the trial court on remand pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb. In particular, the plaintiff argues that the trial court ignored specific statutory restrictions on the amount of such an award. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">We begin with the basic principle behind the \u201cAmerican rule.\u201d \u201cThe general rule of law known as the \u2018American rule\u2019 is that attorney\u2019s fees and ordinary expenses and burdens of litigation are not allowed to the successful party absent a contractual or statutory exception. See <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. </em>v. <em>Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 247, 95 S. Ct. 1612, 44 L. Ed. 2d 141 (1975); <em>Fleischmann Distilling Corporation v. Maier Brewing Co., </em>386 U.S. 714, 717, 87 S. Ct. 1404, 18 L. Ed. 2d 475 (1967). This rule is generally followed throughout the country. See 20 Am. Jur. 2d, Costs \u00a7 72. Connecticut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>adheres to the American rule. See, e.g., <em>Brookfield </em>v. <em>Candlewood Shores Estates, Inc., </em>201 Conn. 1, 14, 513 A.2d 1218 (1986); <em>Gino\u2019s Pizza of East Hartford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>193 Conn. 135, 140, 475 A.2d 305 (1984); <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 280, 297, 472 A.2d 306 (1984); <em>Litton Industries Credit Corporation </em>v. <em>Catanuto, </em>175 Conn. 69, 75, 394 A.2d 191 (1978); <em>Central New Haven Development Corporation </em>v. <em>Potpourri, Inc., </em>39 Conn. Sup. 132, 134, 471 A.2d 681 (1983).\u201d <em>Marsh, Day &amp; Calhoun </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>204 Conn. 639, 652, 529 A.2d 702 (1987). There are few exceptions. For example, a specific contractual term may provide for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees and costs; see, e.g., <em>Storm Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Baumgold, </em>186 Conn. 237, 245, 440 A.2d 306 (1982); or a statute may confer such rights. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 52-240a (attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded in product liability action).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">In the present action, the statute pursuant to which the defendants asserted their claim for attorney\u2019s fees is \u00a7 42-150bb. In considering this issue, the determinative question is the proper inteipretation of the provision of \u00a7 42-150bb limiting a consumer\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to \u201cthe terms governing the size of the fee for the commercial party.\u201d The plaintiff contends that this provision incorporates \u00a7 42-150aa<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> by reference, and therefore limits attorney\u2019s fees awarded to the holder of a contract to 15 percent of the amount of the judgment. The defendants, however, argue that a consumer\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 42-150bb is limited not by the provisions of \u00a7 42-150aa, but by the terms of the consumer contract. We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\u201cIn construing any statute, we seek to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . It is an axiom of statutory construction that legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>intent is to be determined by an analysis of the language actually used in the legislation. . . . [W]hen the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dos Santos </em>v. <em>F. D. Rich Construction Co., </em>233 Conn. 14, 20, 658 A.2d 83 (1995). \u201cWhen the language of a statute is unclear, we may ascertain the intent of the legislature by looking beyond the language to the statute\u2019s legislative history and the purpose that the statute was intended to serve.\u201d <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending Co., </em>223 Conn. 336, 341, 612 A.2d 1203 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Looking to the plain language of \u00a7 42-150bb, we are persuaded that the phrase, \u201cthe terms governing the size of the fee for the commercial party,\u201d relates to the parties\u2019 contract, and not to \u00a7 42-150aa. Had the legislature intended to limit a consumer\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to 15 percent, it would have incorporated the provisions of \u00a7 42-150aa by expressly providing \u201cas provided in section 42-150aa.\u201d Moreover, reading \u00a7 42-150bb in context, as we must, it is clear that the phrase, \u201cthe terms governing the size of the fee for the commercial party,\u201d relates to \u201cthe contract or lease\u201d as provided in the immediately preceding sentence in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Furthermore, even if there were ambiguity in the plain language of \u00a7 42-150bb, our conclusion that the phrase refers to the parties\u2019 contract is buttressed by the statute\u2019s legislative history. In 1979, the Connecticut legislature enacted. No. 79-453 of the 1979 Public Acts, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Attorney\u2019s Fee Clauses in Consumer Contracts.\u201d The original language of Substitute Senate Bill No. 1559, prior to its subsequent amendment, makes it clear that the phrase, \u201cthe terms governing the size of the fee for the commercial party,\u201d relates to the attorney\u2019s fee provisions of the consumer contract. That bill provided: \u201cExcept as hereinafter pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>vided, the size of the attorney\u2019s fee awarded to the consumer shall be based as far as practicable upon the terms governing the size of the fee for the commercial party, and <em>any term in such contract or lease for recovery of a,n attorney\u2019s fee </em>by the consumer on terms less favorable than those for the commercial party shall be void and shall constitute an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of chapter 735a of the General Statutes.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Indeed, speaking on behalf of the original bill, Senator Alfred Santaniello, Jr., remarked: \u201cThis bill makes attorney\u2019s fee clauses reciprocal. For example, a clause for the benefit of the creditor will automatically allow the attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing debtor who successfully prosecutes or defends an action or counterclaim based upon the contract or lease.\u201d 22 S. Proc., Pt. 8, 1979 Sess., p. 2542.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Representative Richard D. Tulisano proposed House Amendment A, which amended Substitute House Bill No. 1559 by deleting the language that provided for unfair or deceptive business practice liability, so that the statute would not require input from the department of consumer protection. 22 H.R. Proc., Pt. 22,1979 Sess., p. 7487. In the process, the amendment inadvertently deleted the clear reference that \u201cthe terms governing the size of the fee for the commercial party\u201d related to the attorney\u2019s fee provisions in the contract or lease. Nevertheless, Representative Tulisano expressly stated that the statute was now \u201cself-enforcing\u201d in that contractual attorney\u2019s fee provisions would be reciprocal. He stated: \u201c[T]he legislation before us today provides [for] the first time the ability for consumers in this state to obtain attorney\u2019s fees, of reasonable amount, as a result of defending or prosecuting any action in which the commercial party has provided for attorney\u2019s fees for their own behalf. What this does is give some equity to the situation. At the present time, many form contracts include attorney\u2019s fees provisions for the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>mercial party, and even though . . . that party may be wrong and a consumer successfully defends an action against him, or her, they would not be entitled to receive attorney\u2019s fees in defending that action. This will put some equity in the situation to the same extent that any commercial party will receive.\u201d Id., pp. 7487, 7489-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Furthermore, during the subsequent consideration of Representative Tulisano\u2019s amendment in the Senate, Senator Salvatore C. DePiano stated: \u201cHouse Amendment Schedule \u2018A\u2019 would, in effect, eliminate a provision of the bill which would have made it an unfair or deceptive trade practice for a commercial party to have included a clause in a contract or lease which provides for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees by a consumer on terms less favorable than those for the commercial party. . . . This bill would require that in a specified situation attorney\u2019s fees be awarded to a consumer who successfully brings or defends an action based upon a contract or lease whenever such contract or lease provides for the attorney\u2019s fees of a commercial party . . . .\u201d 22 S. Proc., Pt. 13, 1979 Sess., pp. 4274-75. Indeed, at no time during the debates with respect to \u00a7 42-150bb did the legislators make a single reference to \u00a7 42-150aa. Accordingly, we conclude that the legislature clearly intended the phrase, \u201cthe terms governing the size of the fee for the commercial party,\u201d to refer to the attorney\u2019s fees provisions in the parties\u2019 contract, and not to \u00a7 42-150aa.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Having reached this conclusion, we turn to the language of the parties\u2019 contract. The relevant provision in the agreement provides that in the event of cancellation of the contract by the defendants, the plaintiff would be entitled to liquidated damages in the amount of 20 percent of the contract price, plus costs of collection and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. Where a contract expressly provides for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees, an award under such a clause requires an evidentiary showing of reasonableness. <em>Bizzoco </em>v. <em>Chinitz, </em>193 Conn. 304, 310, 476 A.2d 572 (1984); <em>Appliances, Inc. </em>v. <em>Yost, </em>186 Conn. 673, 680, 443 A.2d 486 (1982). A trial court may rely on its own general knowledge of the trial itself to supply evidence in support of an award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Bizzoco </em>v. <em>Chinitz, </em>supra, 310. Because the trial court is in a more advantageous position to evaluate the services of counsel than a reviewing court, \u201c[t]he amount of attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal unless the trial court has abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Link </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>186 Conn. 623, 629, 443 A.2d 902 (1982). After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court awarded the defendants reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in the total amount of $13,900.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Having carefully reviewed the record, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in arriving at this figure.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-150bb provides: \u201cAttorney's tees in action based on consumer contract or lease. Whenever any cont ract or lease entered into on or after October 1, 1979, to which a consumer is a party, provides for the attorney\u2019s fee of the commercial party to be paid by the consumer, an attorney's fee shall be awarded as a matter of law to the consumer who successfully prosecutes or defends an action or a counterclaim based upon the contract or lease. Except as hereinafter provided, the size of the attorney\u2019s fee awarded to the consumer shall be based as far as practicable upon the terms governing the size of the fee for the commercial party. No attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>fee shall be awarded to a commercial party who is represented by its salaried employee. In any action in which the consumer is entitled to an attorney\u2019s fee under this section and in which the commercial party is represented by its salaried employee, the attorney\u2019s fee awarded to the consumer shall be in a reasonable amount regardless of the size of the fee provided in the contract or lease for either party. For the purposes of this section, \u2018commercial party\u2019 means the seller, creditor, lessor or assignee of any of them, and \u2018consumer\u2019 means the buyer, debtor, lessee or personal representative of any of them.

The Appellate Court denied the motion to dismiss without prejudice to raising the issue at oral argument. Although the parties briefed this issue, the defendants withdrew the claim at oral argument, based upon this court\u2019s decision in <em>Paranteau </em>v. <em>DeVita, </em>208 Conn. 515, 523, 544 A.2d 634 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b84-13\"> Practice Book \u00a7 285A provides: \u201cThe parties may, as of right, or shall, if the court so orders, file, at such time as the court shall determine, written trial briefs discussing the issues in the case and the factual or legal basis upon which they ought to be resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-14\">\u201cIf a party intends to raise any claim of law which may be the subject of an appeal, he must either state the same distinctly to the court before his argument is closed or state it in a written trial brief.

This court chose, however, to examine the matter further and concluded as a matter of law that the contract did not comply with the HIA. <em>Rizzo Pool Co. </em>v. <em>Del Grosso, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 681-82. Thus, according to the plaintiff\u2019s logic, by prevailing against the plaintiff on appeal, the defendants should get less despite having won more.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-257 and Practice Book \u00a7 412 establish the general procedure for the taxation of costs in cases in which money damages have been awarded. The taxation of costs in civil cases begins with action by the court clerk and either party may appeal from such taxation to the court. The clerk in essence acts as an agent of the court, and the clerk\u2019s action becomes part, of the trial court\u2019s judgment in the matter when there has been no resulting appeal. This general procedure applies in any civil action in which there is a prevailing party in whose favor a decision or verdict is rendered, money damages awarded and a judgment rendered. Where equitable relief is demanded, the taxing of costs is solely within the discretion of the trial court,. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-257 (e) and Practice Book \u00a7 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-81, which mandates the taxation of costs upon withdrawal of an action, has been interpreted so as to require the party against whom an action has been withdrawn to follow the procedures of Practice Book \u00a7 412. \u201cWhile the clerk has no discretion to order the taxation of the costs, the amount of the costs might well be contested at a hearing before the clerk. An appeal from that decision would lie in the trial court. . . . Should the clerk refuse to tax <em>any </em>costs pursuant to ... \u00a7 52-81, the remedy is to petition to the court to order the clerk to perform an act as required by law.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Triangle Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Young, </em>20 Conn.

Surely, the legislature did not intend such an irrational result. \u201cIn construing a statute, common sense must be used, and courts will assume that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ciarelli </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Cos., </em>234 Conn. 807, 812, 663 A.2d 377 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Although we read the language in \u00a7 42-150bb to refer to the attorney\u2019s fees provision in the parties\u2019 contract, we are not unmindful that when contracts are limited by statutory provisions, those provisions are generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>considered to be incorporated therein as a matter of law. See <em>Sanghavi </em>v. <em>Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>214 Conn. 303, 307, 572 A.2d 307 (1990); <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gode, </em>187 Conn. 386, 399, 446 A.2d 1059 (1982), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>Covenant Ins.

Thus, whenever there is an attorney\u2019s fees clause in the commercial party's contract, that clause is subject to \u00a7 42-150aa, and the contract must be read as incorporating that provision\u2019s 15 percent limitation. Therefore, when a consumer prevails on a counterclaim, his attorney\u2019s fees, like those of the successful contractor, would be limited to the 15 percent provision of \u00a7 42-150aa. This reading wmuld be consistent with both the language of \u00a7 42-150bb (\u201cthe size of the attorney\u2019s fee awarded to the consumer [would] be based as far as practicable upon the terms governing the size of the fee for the commercial party\u201d) and the purpose of the statute, namely, to make the '\u201cattorney\u2019s fees clauses reciprocal.\u201d 22 S. Proc., Pt. 8, 1979 Sess., p. 2542, remarks of Senator Alfred Santaniello, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In the case in which the consumer prevails on a counterclaim <em>and </em>successfully defends against a claim by the contractor, the 15 percent provision of \u00a7 42-150aa will prevail to control the fees generated by the counterclaim, while \u201c'reasonable\u201d will be the operative term controlling attorney\u2019s fees generated in connection with the defense to the contractor\u2019s action. See footnote 19. How the trial court allocates the consumer\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees between those two aspects of the case will necessarily call for the exercise of the court\u2019s sound discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b100-8\"> We further recognize that, in some instances, the parties\u2019 contract may provide.for attorney\u2019s fees based upon 15 percent of the recovery. In these circumstances, should the consumer prevail in defending an action brought by the commercial party, the consumer would receive pursuant to the contractual terms 15 percent of nothing \u2014 which would, of course, be nothing. Accordingly, an award of attorney\u2019s fees based upon the terms of the contract would not be practicable. See General Statutes \u00a7 42-150bb (\u201c[e]xcept as hereinafter provided, the size of the attorney\u2019s fee awarded to the consumer shall be based <em>as far as practicable </em>upon the terms governing the size of the fee for the commercialparty\u201d [emphasis added]). Therefore, notwithstanding the contractual terms that would effectively provide the consumer with no attorney\u2019s fees, the consumer nevertheless would be entitled to an award ofreasonable attorney\u2019s fees.
