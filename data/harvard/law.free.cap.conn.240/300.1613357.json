The plaintiff, Eric Anthony Abrahams, a Jamaican citizen, filed a ten count complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, alleging, inter alia, that the named defendant, Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc. (Young &amp; Rubicam),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a New York advertising agency, had violated CUTPA by engaging in a scheme wherein it paid approximately one million dollars to a third party in the mistaken belief that the money would be used to bribe the plaintiff, a former Jamaican public official.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff sought compensation under CUTPA for the damage to his reputation that resulted when Young &amp; Rubicam erroneously reported to Connecticut and federal authorities that the plaintiff had accepted the bribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The District Court dismissed the CUTPA claim, concluding that the acts constituting the alleged violation were not the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number><em>Abrahams </em>v. <em>Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., </em>793 F. Sup. 404, 407 (D. Conn. 1992). The plaintiff appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which asked this court to decide whether the plaintiffs allegations, if proven, would entitle him to relief under CUTPA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Abrahams </em>v. <em>Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., </em>79 F.3d 234, 239 (2d Cir. 1996). Pursuant to the applicable certification procedures; General Statutes \u00a7 51-199a;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>agreed to decide the issue. We agree with the District Court that, even if we were to assume without deciding that Young &amp; Rubicam\u2019s scheme, as alleged by the plaintiff, constituted \u201cunfair trade practices\u201d within the meaning of CUTPA, that scheme was not the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries. Accordingly, we conclude that the facts in the plaintiffs complaint, even if true, cannot provide the basis for a CUTPA claim against Young &amp; Rubicam and, therefore, we answer the certified questions in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The Court of Appeals\u2019 certification order included the following relevant facts from the plaintiffs complaint. \u201c[The p]laintiff . . . is a citizen and subject of Jamaica. From October 1980 to February 1989, [he] was an elected member of the Jamaican Parliament. In October 1980, [he] was also appointed Jamaican Minister of Tourism and Information and served in that post until about August 1984. In addition, [the plaintiff] has served as the Jamaican Director of Tourism and as a consultant on international tourism and marketing with the Organization of American States. Following his service as Minister of Tourism, [the plaintiff] acted as a consultant to various international businesses in Jamaica.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u201cUnbeknownst to [the plaintiff], a scheme was concocted by Robin Moore, a writer, and Arnold Foote, Jr., a Jamaican advertising executive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Many activities in furtherance of this scheme took place within the state of Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u201c[Moore and Foote] persuaded [Young &amp; Rubicam] that bribes and kickbacks would have to be paid to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Foote and to [the plaintiff] to influence the decisions of the Jamaican Tourist Board ... to ensure that [Young &amp; Rubicam] would receive the lucrative [Jamaican Tourist Board] advertising account. During the course of the scheme, [Young &amp; Rubicam] paid close to one million dollars ... in bribes to Moore and Foote. However, no money was ever paid to [the plaintiff], who neither demanded money nor was in a position to influence the award of the . . . contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u201cIn October 1989, the scheme was publicly exposed by a federal indictment . . . returned by a grand jury in Hartford, Connecticut. On February 9,1990, [Young &amp; Rubicam] pled guilty to knowingly and intentionally conspiring to pay bribes to influence the decision of the [Jamaican Tourist Board] in awarding its advertising account. Because [Young &amp; Rubicam] and other defendants falsely implicated [the plaintiff] in their scheme, [the plaintiff] was also indicted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, this indictment was later dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u201cNews regarding the criminal indictment of [Young &amp; Rubicam], including false statements by a number of defendants that depicted [the plaintiff] as a criminal, was widely published. As a result, [the plaintiffs] professional reputation was damaged, and his consulting business destroyed. His personal reputation was also severely impaired, and he suffered severe emotional distress, humiliation, and depression.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">In order to address whether these facts, if proven, would form the basis for a CUTPA claim, we first set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>forth the basic elements of such an action. CUTPA provides that \u201c[n]o person shall engage in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a). In order to enforce this prohibition, CUTPA provides a private cause of action to \u201c [a]ny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment of a [prohibited] method, act or practice . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (a); see generally <em>Fink </em>v. <em>Golenbock, </em>238 Conn. 183, 212-13, 680 A.2d 1243 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Thus, in order to prevail in a CUTPA action, a plaintiff must establish both that the defendant has engaged in a prohibited act <em>and </em>that, \u201cas a result of\u2019 this act, the plaintiff suffered an injuiy. The language \u201cas a result of\u2019 requires a showing that the prohibited act was the proximate cause of a harm to the plaintiff. See generally <em>Haesche </em>v. <em>Kissner, </em>229 Conn. 213, 223-24, 640 A.2d 89 (1994). With regard to the requisite causal element, it is axiomatic that proximate cause is \u201c[a]n actual cause that is a substantial factor in the resulting harm . . . .\u201d <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Federated Dept. Stores, Inc., </em>234 Conn. 597, 606, 662 A.2d 753 (1995). The question to be asked in ascertaining whether proximate cause exists is \u201cwhether the harm which occurred was of the same general nature as the foreseeable risk\u201d created by the defendant\u2019s act. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manheimer, </em>212 Conn. 748, 758, 563 A.2d 699 (1989). Proximate cause does not exist merely because there is cause in fact. \u201cPhilosophically, cause in fact is limitless; but for the creation of this world, no crime or injury would ever have occurred. . . . Lines must be drawn determining how far down the causal continuum individuals will be held liable for the consequences of their actions.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Federated Dept. Stores, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>supra, 605-606, citing W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, Torts (5th Ed. 1984) \u00a7 41, p. 264, and \u00a7 42, p. 273. \u201cThis line is labeled \u2018proximate cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Suarez </em>v. <em>Sordo, </em>43 Conn. App. 756, 769, 685 A.2d 1144 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">We assume, without deciding, that the bribery scheme in which Young &amp; Rubicam engaged is an act of the type proscribed by CUTPA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude, however, that this assumed violation was not the proximate cause of the injuries to the plaintiffs reputation and business. \u201cAlthough the issue of causation generally is a question reserved for the trier of fact . . . the issue becomes one of law when the mind of a fair and reasonable person could reach only one conclusion, and summary judgment may be granted based on a failure to establish causation.\u201d 1 R. Langer, J. Morgan &amp; D. Belt, Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (1994) \u00a7 6.10, p. 231; see also <em>Mather </em>v. <em>Griffin Hospital, </em>207 Conn. 125, 130, 540 A.2d 666 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In this case, Young &amp; Rubicam\u2019s bribery scheme did not, in and of itself, directly harm the plaintiff. The plaintiff has not alleged, nor can it be reasonably inferred from the plaintiffs allegations, that Young &amp; Rubicam either intended or could have foreseen that, as a result of its attempt to bribe the plaintiff, he would be injured by an erroneous indictment for bribery or by publication of the incorrect accusations therein.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In other words, Young &amp; Rubicam\u2019s conduct in attempting to bribe the plaintiff was not \u201ca substantial factor reasonably foreseeable as likely to bring about [the] plaintiffs indictment [on false charges] and his resulting damages. [The p]laintiff was neither the intended target nor victim of [Young &amp; Rubicam\u2019s] illegal activities.\u201d <em>Abrahams </em>v. <em>Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., </em>supra, 793 F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Sup. 406. It is trae that the plaintiff would not have been harmed but for the existence of the bribery scheme. As explained previously, however, mere \u201cbut for\u201d causation is not sufficient to support a CUTPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Rather, the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries was the confession that Young &amp; Rubicam gave to state and federal authorities after its scheme was discovered, in which it implicated the plaintiff as having accepted bribes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It was the confession, not the underlying bribery scheme, that directly and predictably led to the indictment against the plaintiff that damaged his reputation. As the Court of Appeals observed, the plaintiff was injured not by the bribery scheme itself, but \u201cby the fallout from the scheme\u2019s exposure.\u201d <em>Abrahams </em>v. <em>Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., </em>supra, 79 F.3d 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The plaintiff has never asserted that Young &amp; Rubi-cam\u2019s act of confessing was itself an unfair act or practice that violated CUTPA.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, on the one hand, the practice that assumedly did violate CUTPA \u2014 the bribery scheme \u2014 was not the proximate cause of the plaintiffs losses. On the other hand, the act that <em>was </em>the proximate cause \u2014 Young <em>&amp; </em>Rubicam\u2019s statement to authorities \u2014 was not pleaded by the plaintiff as being the type of act that CUTPA was intended to prohibit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Accordingly, we conclude that the plaintiff has not stated a cause of action under CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The answer to the certified questions is: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">No costs will be taxed in this court to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b324-6\"> In addition to Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., a number of its employees' and officers were named as defendants in this action, including Arthur Klein, Thomas Spangenberg, Steven McKenna, Mike Slosberg, Edward Daley, Edward Ney and Alex Kroll. We refer to all of these defendants collectively as Young &amp; Rubicam. Two other individuals were also named as defendants in the plaintiffs complaint. All claims against one of them, Robin Moore, have been dismissed. See footnote 5. The status of the other defendant, Frederick Sturges, is unclear. No papers were submitted on his behalf, and he is not mentioned either in the certification order from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit or in the briefs of either party. See <em>Abrahams </em>v. <em>Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., </em>79 F.3d 234, 235 n.1 (2d Cir. 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b324-7\"> In his original complaint in the District Court, the plaintiff brought numerous other claims against Young &amp; Rubicam, including a claim under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and common law claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence and defamation. See <em>Abrahams </em>v. <em>Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., </em>793 F. Sup. 404, 407 (D. Conn. 1992); see also <em>Abrahams </em>v. <em>Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., </em>79 F.3d 234, 239 (2d Cir. 1996). These claims are outside the scope of the questions we certified for review; see footnote 3; and, therefore, we do not discuss them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b325-5\"> Specifically, the Court of Appeals asked this court to answer the following questions: \u201c[W]hethert,he [plaintiffs allegations], if proven, constitute \u2018unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce\u2019 within the meaning of [General Statutes] \u00a7 42-110b, and whether [the plaintiff] is \u2018[a] person who [has] suffered] [a] . . . loss of money or property ... as a result of the use or employment of [such] a method, act, or practice\u2019 within the meaning of [General Statutes] \u00a7 42-110g (a)?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b325-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-199a provides: \u201cUniform Certification of Questions of Law Act.

Sup. 406. Indeed, the plaintiff specifically stated in his complaint that Young &amp; Rubicam <em>was </em>\u201cconvinced\u201d by the bribery scheme. Accordingly, nothing in the record or pleadings indicate that, at the time Young &amp; Rubicam made its confession to authorities, it believed anything but that the plaintiff <em>had </em>been a willing participant in the bribery scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b329-7\"> We state no opinion as to whether Young &amp; Rubicam\u2019s bribery scheme did, in fact, constitute an unfair act or practice within the meaning of CUTPA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b329-8\"> Indeed, on the contrary, the plaintiff alleged that Young &amp; Rubicam was convinced of the plaintiff\u2019s complicity. See footnote 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b330-7\"> The plaintiff argues that the question of whether his injuries were proximately caused by the bribery scheme or by Young &amp; Rubicam\u2019s subsequent statement to authorities is a question for the fact finder and not amenable to judgment as a matter of law. Although the plaintiff argues at some length in his brief that the bribery scheme itself was the proximate cause of his injuries, his reasoning is entirely conclusoiy and unpersuasive. We are persuaded that, as a matter of logic and of law, Young &amp; Rubicam\u2019s confession, and not the underlying bribery scheme, was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b330-8\"> Moreover, as noted previously; see footnote 6; the plaintiff nowhere alleged that Young &amp; Rubicam intentionally misled investigators, or that it lacked an honest belief that the plaintiff had, in fact, accepted bribes.
