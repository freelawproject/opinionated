The principal issue in this administrative appeal is whether the defendant, the department of social services (department), properly applied the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d standard in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>refusing to allocate resources to the spouse of an institutionalized applicant. The plaintiff Mary Burinskas applied for and was denied medicaid benefits by the department. The denial was affirmed both after a fair hearing before a hearing officer and, upon request, after a reconsideration of the fair hearing decision by the same hearing officer. Thereafter, Mary Burinskas and her husband, the plaintiff Walter Burinskas,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appealed from the department\u2019s decision to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a), which authorizes appeals to the trial court upon exhaustion of all administrative remedies. The trial court reversed the department\u2019s denial of medicaid benefits and remanded the case for further administrative proceedings. The department appealed from this judgment to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a751-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court in part and reverse it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. In 1994, the plaintiffs applied for medicaid benefits to defray costs associated with Mary Burinskas\u2019 institutionalization for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The department, after calculating the couple\u2019s total assets, determined that the value of Mary Burinskas\u2019 assets exceeded the $1600 limit for program eligibility;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17b-80 and 17b-264; Department of Income Maintenance, Uniform Policy Manual (1993) \u00a7 4005.10 (Uniform Policy Manual); and, on that basis, denied her application for medicaid benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The plaintiffs then exercised their right to an administrative appeal before a fair hearing officer. See 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>\u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (A); Uniform Policy Manual (1989) \u00a7 1570.25. At the fair hearing, they claimed that Mary Burinskas\u2019 allocation of the couple\u2019s assets should be decreased and Walter Burinskas\u2019 allocation increased in order to generate income necessary to cover Walter Burinskas\u2019 living expenses. In addition to presenting evidence regarding all of his monthly expenses,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiffs contended that Walter Burinskas suffered from emphysema and, as a result, incurred particular expenses for snow removal, home maintenance, lawn care, and housecleaning chores that he was unable to perform himself. Under the plaintiffs\u2019 reallocation proposal, resources would have been transferred to Walter Burinskas sufficient to reduce Mary Burinskas\u2019 asset share to the medicaid eligibility level.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Both after the fair hearing and upon reconsideration, the hearing officer refused to recalculate Mary Burinskas\u2019 asset share to reflect Walter Burinskas\u2019 expenses. In his reconsideration report, the hearing officer recognized that under relevant medicaid law, resources may be allocated to the spouse of an institutionalized applicant where the spouse needs income \u201cdue to exceptional circumstances resulting in significant financial duress.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (B); Uniform Policy Manual (1989) \u00a7 1570.25 (D) (3) (b). The hearing officer, in construing this standard, stated that in order for an expense to qualify under this standard, \u201cthe <em>expense </em>must be an exceptional circumstance . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The hearing officer then held that expenses associated with such things as snow removal and lawn care were \u201cexpected everyday expenses\u201d and thus insufficiently exceptional to war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>rant resource reallocation. The hearing officer refused to lower Mary Burinskas\u2019 asset share below the eligibility level and declined her medicaid application.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">On appeal to the trial court, the plaintiffs claimed that the hearing officer had improperly applied the exceptional circumstances standard. They argued that the hearing officer had focused on the exceptional nature of each <em>expense </em>and not on the <em>circumstances </em>giving rise to each expense. The trial court agreed. It concluded that the hearing officer \u201cunmistakably [had taken] his task to be determining whether an expense was exceptional,\u201d and not whether the expense arose from exceptional circumstances. Deeming this approach \u201cunsupported by the text\u201d of either department regulations or federal statutes, the trial court reversed the hearing officer\u2019s decision and remanded the case for further administrative proceedings. Additionally, the trial court awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiffs pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-184a (b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">On appeal, the department challenges the trial court\u2019s determinations. It contends that the hearing officer\u2019s reconsideration report,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> read in its entirety, reveals that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>the hearing officer functionally applied the proper exceptional circumstances standard and that, if the hearing officer imprecisely articulated this standard, he did so in response to the manner in which the plaintiffs had addressed their claims. The department further contends that the hearing officer\u2019s decision was consistent with Congress\u2019 intent, in prescribing relevant medicaid eligibility law, to prevent spousal impoverishment without guaranteeing any preset living standard. Finally, the department claims that the hearing officer\u2019s report, even if flawed, is not \u201cwithout any substantial justification\u201d as that phrase is used in subsection (b) of \u00a7 4-184a, the attorney\u2019s fees statute. We agree with the trial court that the hearing officer employed an improper standard in determining whether Walter Burinskas\u2019 expenses resulted from exceptional circumstances and that, therefore, the hearing officer\u2019s decision must be reversed. We conclude, however, that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 4-184a (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The department first claims that the trial court improperly reversed the decision of the administrative hearing officer. Judicial review of an agency decision is limited. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Connecticut </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number><em>Alcohol &amp; Drug Abuse Commission </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>233 Conn. 28, 39, 657 A.2d 630 (1995). \u201c[W]e must decide, in view of all of the evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily or illegally, or abused its discretion. . . . Even as to questions of law, [t]he court\u2019s ultimate duty is only to decide whether, in light of the evidence, the [agency] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Conclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a <em>correct application of the law </em>to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Although courts ordinarily defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of statutory text, where, as in this case, \u201cthe construction of a statute . . . has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny [or to] ... a governmental agency\u2019s time-tested interpretation\u201d; (citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>202 Conn. 583, 599, 522 A.2d 771 (1987); that construction constitutes a question of law for which deference is not warranted. See <em>Connecticut Alcohol &amp; Drug Abuse Commission </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 41-42. In the same vein, \u00a7 4-183 (j) authorizes a court to reverse the decision of an administrative body if that decision is, inter alia, \u201c[i]n violation of constitutional or statutory provisions ... in excess of the statutory authority of the agency . . . made upon unlawful procedure . . . [or] affected by other error of law . . . .\u201d The trial court in this case determined that the hearing officer\u2019s misapplication of the exceptional circumstances standard implicated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>heightened judicial review contemplated by \u00a7 4-183 (j) and merited reversal. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In order properly to characterize the issues on appeal, it is necessary to overview the complex of statutes and regulations governing medicaid eligibility for institutionalized applicants. The medicaid program, established in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social Security Act, and codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 et seq., is a joint federal-state venture providing financial assistance to persons whose income and resources are inadequate to meet the costs of necessary medical care. See <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Giardi, </em>237 Conn. 550, 555, 680 A.2d 113 (1996). States participate voluntarily in the medicaid program, but participating states \u201cmust develop a plan, approved by the secretary of health and human services, containing reasonable standards . . . for determining eligibility for and the extent of medical assistance . . . .Connecticut has elected to participate in the medicaid program and has assigned to the department the task of administering the program. General Statutes [\u00a7 17b-260].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 555-56. The department, as part of its uniform policy manual, has promulgated regulations governing the administration of Connecticut\u2019s medicaid system. See General Statutes \u00a7 17b-260.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">In 1988, Congress passed into law the Medicaid Catastrophic Care Act (catastrophic care act). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (1988). This enactment was intended, in part, to ease the financial burden placed on a community spouse<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> under the prior statutory regime that required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>the institutionalized spouse to spend down a large portion of the couple\u2019s resources, and thus impoverish the community spouse, before becoming eligible for medicaid. See, e.g, <em>Krueger Estate </em>v. <em>Richland County Social Services, </em>526 N.W.2d 456, 458 (N.D. 1994); H.R. Rep. No. 100-105 (II), 100th Cong, 2d Sess. 69-71 (1988), reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 857, 892-94. Under the catastrophic care act, a community spouse is entitled to receive a \u201c \u2018community spouse resource allowance\u2019 \u201d (resource allowance), which is approximately one half of the couple\u2019s total liquid resources or $60,000, adjusted annually for inflation, whichever is less. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (f) (2); see also Uniform Policy Manual (1996) \u00a7 4022.05 (B) (2) (using adjusted figures). The resource allowance is protected from the institutionalized applicant\u2019s health care obligations and does not count against the applicant\u2019s financial eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">In addition, under the catastrophic care act, a community spouse is entitled to a \u201cminimum monthly maintenance needs allowance\u201d (minimum needs allowance).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (d) (3); Uniform Policy Manual (1992) \u00a7 5035.30 (B) (2). If the community spouse\u2019s income from outside sources is insufficient to meet his minimum needs allowance, the institutionalized spouse is permitted to bridge this deficit by transferring income to the community spouse. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (d) (1) (B) and (2). If the transferred income is insufficient to reach the minimum needs allowance, the community spouse may then apply for an increase in his resource allowance to an amount adequate to fund his minimum needs allowance. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C); see <em>Krueger Estate </em>v. <em>Richland County Social Services, </em>supra, 526 N.W.2d 459. Because this increase in the resource allowance results from a transfer of resources <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>from the institutionalized spouse to the community spouse,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the value of the institutionalized spouse\u2019s resources is brought closer to the eligibility level.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (B),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a community spouse may obtain an increase in his minimum needs allowance by establishing, at a fair hearing, a need for additional income \u201cdue to exceptional circumstances resulting in significant financial duress . . . .\u201d See also Uniform Policy Manual (1989) \u00a7 1570.25. At issue in this appeal is whether the fair hearing officer properly applied the exceptional circumstances standard in measuring Walter Burinskas\u2019 financial needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">In his report, the hearing officer set forth his interpretation of the exceptional circumstances standard found in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (B). He parsed this standard into two requirements, concluding that in order for an expense to be \u201cdue to exceptional circumstances resulting in significant financial duress,\u201d the expense <em>\u201cmust be an exceptional circumstance\u201d </em>and the expense \u201cmust create significant financial duress.\u201d (Emphasis added.) On the basis of this interpretation, the hearing officer asserted that expenses \u201cexpected and . . . incurred in the normal course of everyday living are not exceptional circumstances. Thus food, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>clothing, lawn mowing, [and] snow removal are not exceptional circumstances. These expenses are expected everyday expenses of living and of home ownership, and therefore are not exceptional, extraordinary, uncommon, or sudden in nature.\u201d Having found that these everyday expenses failed to satisfy the exceptional circumstances standard, the hearing officer declined to increase Walter Burinskas\u2019 minimum needs allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">We agree with the trial court that, as a matter of law, the hearing officer set forth and relied upon a misinterpretation of the exceptional circumstances standard. The language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (B), entails a finding of core \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d that may give rise to expenses causing \u201csignificant financial duress.\u201d See footnote 11. This language does not require that the expenses themselves be exceptional. By narrowly focusing on the mundane nature of these expenses without inquiring into their allegedly exceptional genesis, the hearing officer failed to apply this standard properly. As a result, he did not properly address whether Walter Burinskas\u2019 emphysema was an exceptional circumstance causing significant financial duress in the form of increased home and yard maintenance costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">In support of the hearing officer\u2019s decision, the department contends that a full reading of the hearing officer\u2019s opinion demonstrates that the hearing officer was applying the proper standard, no matter how unart-fully phrased. We agree that, in certain instances in his opinion, the hearing officer appears accurately to have characterized the exceptional circumstances standard.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Yet, these instances alone are insufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>establish the overall propriety of the hearing officer\u2019s legal analysis. Although the department claims that it is impossible to imagine how the hearing officer could have considered Walter Burinskas\u2019 expenses without considering his emphysema as well, we conclude that it is impossible to say, upon a complete reading of the hearing officer\u2019s opinion, that the hearing officer did not apply the improper standard that he explicitly endorsed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The department also contends that even if the hearing officer misapplied the exceptional circumstances standard, he did so in response to the manner in which the plaintiffs had framed their claims at the fair hearing. In particular, the department contends that the plaintiffs focused their claims on the exceptional nature of Walter Burinskas\u2019 total monthly expenses and did not adequately characterize these claims in terms of any exceptional circumstances. While we agree that the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments at the administrative level were not limited to proving exceptional circumstances; see part II of this opinion; we nevertheless conclude that the plaintiffs sufficiently addressed his home and yard care expenses in terms of his medical condition<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and that, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the hearing officer\u2019s failure to apply properly the exceptional circumstances standard to this condition necessitates reversal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The department also challenges the trial court\u2019s decision on the basis of the legislative history of the catastrophic care act. The department contends that the act was intended only to prevent the impoverishment of a community spouse and not to guarantee the amenities of any current lifestyle. See H.R. Rep. No. 100-105 (II), 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 69-71 (1988), reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 857, 892-94. We do not disagree with this observation. Yet, recognizing Congress\u2019 primary intent does not serve to nullify the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d language that Congress itself inserted into the catastrophic care act; nor does it excuse the hearing officer from properly applying this language. If the plaintiffs can demonstrate that Walter Burinskas\u2019 minimum needs allowance legitimately should be increased on the basis of \u201cexceptional circumstances resulting in significant financial duress,\u201d such an increase would be in furtherance, and not in derogation, of the catastrophic care act.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">We conclude, accordingly, that the trial court properly determined that the hearing officer, by focusing on the exceptional nature of Walter Burinskas\u2019 expenses, rather than on the circumstances giving rise to these expenses, misapplied the standard set forth in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (B).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The department\u2019s second claim on appeal is that the trial court improperly awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiffs pursuant to \u00a7 4-184a (b). See footnote 5. Specifically, the department claims that the trial court improperly determined that the hearing officer\u2019s decision was not supported by \u201cany substantial justification.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-184a (b). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The decision to award attorney\u2019s fees for unjustified agency actions is within the discretion of the trial court. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-184a (b); <em>Labenski </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>41 Conn. App. 866, 871, 678 A.2d 496, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 910, 682 A.2d 1002 (1996). Thus, \u00a7 4-184a (b) provides that the \u201ccourt may, <em>in its discretion,\u201d </em>award reasonable fees to the prevailing party if the court determines that the agency acted \u201cwithout any substantial justification.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, we review the trial court\u2019s decision to award attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>224 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Conn. 445, 467, 619 A.2d 453 (1993) (reversal warranted \u201cwhere an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">In order to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 4-184a (b), it is first necessary to define the phrase \u201cwithout any substantial justification.\u201d Our sole aim in this endeavor is to ascertain the intent of the legislature. Where the words of the statute are not unambiguous, \u201cwe look ... to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Williams Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Courant Co., </em>232 Conn. 559, 581, 657 A.2d 212 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">In this case, the legislative history of \u00a7 4-184a (b) persuades us that the \u201cwithout any substantial justification\u201d test has its roots in a reasonableness standard. Representative Richard Tulisano, in support of this legislation, stated that \u00a7 4-184a (b) permits a court to award attorney\u2019s fees to those who can establish \u201cthe unreasonableness of a government\u201d action. 26 H.R. Proc., Pt. 11,1983 Sess., p. 3941. This interpretation is buttressed by a subsequently enacted statute, General Statutes \u00a7 38a-14 (k) (5), which, for purposes of awarding attorney\u2019s fees in a libel or slander action against an insurance commissioner, defines the phrase \u201csubstantially justified\u201d as \u201chav[ing] a reasonable basis in law or fact.\u201d Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court has construed the phrase \u201csubstantially justified\u201d as it is used in the attorney\u2019s fees provision of the Equal Access to Justice Act; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 (d) (1) (A); to mean \u201cjustified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.\u201d <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S. Ct. 2541, 101 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>We are persuaded by these sources that the phrase \u201csubstantial justification\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 4-184a (b) connotes reasonableness or a reasonable basis in law or fact. See <em>Labenski </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 872; see also <em>Federal Elections Commission </em>v. <em>Political Contributions Data, Inc., </em>995 F.2d 383, 386 (2d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1116, 114 S. Ct. 1064, 127 L. Ed. 2d 384 (1994) (test for \u201csubstantially justified\u201d incorporates reasonableness analysis). Accordingly, we construe the phrase \u201cwithout any substantial justification\u201d to mean entirely unreasonable or without any reasonable basis in law or fact. In our view, this demanding standard furthers the legislature\u2019s intent by striking a balance between compensating aggrieved litigants for unjustified agency action, and ensuring that not all agency actions that are subject to judicial reversal for legal error result in an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Informed by this construction of \u00a7 4-184a (b), we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that the hearing officer\u2019s report was \u201cwithout any substantial justification.\u201d As indicated previously, the hearing officer\u2019s misapplication of the exceptional circumstances standard flowed in part from the manner in which the plaintiffs couched their claims at the fair hearing. There, the plaintiffs focused, in part, on proving that Walter Burinskas\u2019 expenses, in the aggregate, created a financial hardship. They did not exclusively emphasize his emphysema-related expenses, nor did they clearly articulate these expenses in terms of the exceptional circumstances standard. That the plaintiffs may have imprecisely framed their claims at the administrative level does not legally validate the hearing officer\u2019s misapplication of the exceptional circumstances standard. It does, however, persuade us that this misapplication was not entirely unreasonable or without any reasonable basis in law or fact, particularly in view of the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>that the hearing officer applied the medicaid eligibility provisions without the benefit of prior judicial guidance regarding the exceptional circumstances standard. See part I of this opinion. Instead of undertaking an inquiry into the reasonableness of the hearing officer\u2019s actions, however, the trial court based its award of attorney\u2019s fees solely on its determination that the hearing officer had \u201csimply failed to give effect to the words\u201d of the exceptional circumstances standard. In our view, this is tantamount to awarding attorney\u2019s fees simply on the basis of legal error and thus constitutes an abuse of discretion under \u00a7 4-184a (b). See <em>Mallory </em>v. <em>Mallory, </em>207 Conn. 48, 56, 539 A.2d 995 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">The judgment is affirmed with regard to the reversal of the hearing officer\u2019s decision and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to remand the case to the department for further proceedings according to law; the judgment is reversed with regal'd to the award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-7\"> Hereafter, we refer to Walter and Mary Burinskas collectively as the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b165-8\"> The department found that the plaintiffs together owned $172,456.52 in liquid assets. Of this amount, the department allocated $72,660 to Walter Burinskas and the remaining $99,766.52 to Mary Burinskas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\"> The plaintiffs claimed that resources should be allocated to cover Walter Burinskas\u2019 expenses for such things as golf course fees, cable television bills, Elks membership, and groceries. At oral argument, the plaintiffs conceded that, to the extent these expenses do not flow from his health problems, they are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b167-7\"> The hearing officer did, however, reallocate resources for some expenses that he found met the exceptional circumstances standard. These included the cost of Walter Burinskas\u2019 medical treatment and the cost of his visiting Mary Burinskas in the medical institution where she resided. In addition, the hearing officer sheltered a portion of her assets in order to establish a burial fund. See Uniform Policy Manual (1989) \u00a7 4000.01. These recalculations, however, did not lower her asset share below the medicaid eligibility level.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b167-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-184a (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cIn any- appeal by an aggrieved person of an agency decision taken in accordance with section 4-183 . . . the court may, in its discretion, award to the prevailing party, other than the agency, reasonable fees and expenses in addition to other costs if the court determines that the action of the agency was undertaken without any substantial justification.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b167-9\"> Because the parties have focused their arguments on the hearing officer\u2019s reconsideration report and because that report contains a fuller and clearer depiction of the hearing officer\u2019s legal analysis than does his initial fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>hearing report, we will confine our discussion to the reconsideration report unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b168-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 0) provides: \u201cThe court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.

See footnote 4. He failed, however, to articulate clearly how emphysema was an exceptional circumstance for purposes of medical expenses but not for purposes of other health related expenses. We do not suggest that such a finding is impossible, only that proper analysis is required before making it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\"> At the fair hearing, counsel for the plaintiffs stated that \u201cbecause [Walter Burinskas] cannot do any heavy lifting or do any of the yard work with his emphysema, he has to rely on others to do the snow removal, his lawn care and his housekeeping.\u201d Again, in their letter requesting reconsideration, the plaintiffs claimed that Walter Burinskas\u2019 emphysema \u201cprevents him from performing the housecleaning, maintenance, lawn care and snow removal required to properly maintain his marital residence.\u201d The plaintiffs followed this request with a letter from a physician who stated that \u201c[d]ue to his lung disease [Walter Burinskas] is unable to perform several of the usual household tasks including laundry and cleaning.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\"><em> </em>The department also contends that, because the plaintiffs did not challenge the hearing officer\u2019s formulation of the exceptional circumstances standard at the fair hearing, they should not be permitted to raise this argument on appeal. See <em>Dragan </em>v. <em>Connecticut Medical Examining Board, </em>223 Conn. 618, 632, 613 A.2d 739 (1992) (party to administrative appeal may not raise claims not asserted at administrative proceeding). We disagree. Although it was not until their appeal to the Superior Court that the plaintiffs clearly articulated their attack on the hearing officer\u2019s exceptional expenses test, it was not until his final report upon reconsideration that the hearing officer clearly articulated his reliance on this improper standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\"> In so holding, we express no opinion on whether Walter Burinskas\u2019 emphysema constitutes an \u201cexceptional circumstance resulting in significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>financial duress\u201d or whether his house or yard care expenses constitute cognizable needs under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (B) and Uniform Policy Manual (1989) \u00a7 1570.25 (D) (3) (b). These are issues that fall within the hearing officer\u2019s province on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b176-8\"> The department contends that an appellate court should apply an abuse of discretion standard only to the trial court\u2019s actual decision to award attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 4-184a (b) and not to its predicate determination that the agency acted \u201cwithout any substantial justification.\u201d Under the department\u2019s construction of \u00a7 4-184a (b), this predicate determination would be subject to de novo review as a question of law. We disagree. The department has offered no persuasive authority, either in the form of legislative history or statutory analysis, to support this position, and we can discern none. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court, in considering similar language contained in the Equal Access to Justice Act; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 (d) (1) (A); has concluded that a trial court\u2019s decision that the action of a governmental agency was not \u201csubstantially justified\u201d for purposes of awarding attorney\u2019s fees is properly reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard and not as a question of law. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 557-63, 108 S. Ct. 2541, 101 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1988). The Supreme Court based this holding, inter alia, on principles of statutory construction and judicial administration that we find applicable and persuasive in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
