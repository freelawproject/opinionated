J.</author>\n<p id=\"AL6\">The primary issue in this appeal is whether the defendant, Jaime Matos, was deprived of his rights to due process and equal protection of the law when he was prevented by General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 54-76b<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from applying for treatment as a youthful offender because he was charged with, although not convicted of, the class A felony of murder. Additionally, we are asked to determine whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>trial court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of the victim\u2019s gang connections. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s due process and equal protection rights were not violated by \u00a7 54-76b and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit the proffered evidence. We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On June 10, 1990, the defendant, who was seventeen years of age, together with two friends, Angel Madeira and Julio Sanchez, attended a festival held at Colt Park in Hartford. The defendant carried a semiautomatic pistol with him to the festival. Also attending the festival were Roberto Sanchez and several of his friends. Apparently, there was an unsettled dispute between these two groups arising from a previous altercation. At 3:21 p.m. during the festival, which was attended by approximately 15,000 people, the two groups met. Roberto Sanchez spoke to the defendant\u2019s friend, Madeira, saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t get you last time. I\u2019m going to get you now.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Roberto Sanchez then struck Madeira with his fist, and the two became involved in a fist fight, during which the defendant pulled his gun from his waistband and fired several shots. Roberto Sanchez was struck four times by the defendant\u2019s bullets and was killed. Norberto Rivera, an innocent bystander, was hit in the shoulder and wounded by a stray bullet. The defendant was arrested later that night. Additional facts will be noted where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The defendant was charged in an amended information with murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> first degree assault in violation of General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>\u00a7 53a-59,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and criminal use of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-216.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, the defendant filed a youthful offender eligibility application, which was denied by the trial court. The defendant\u2019s subsequent motions requesting the court to reconsider his youthful offender application also were denied. After a hearing pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>court found probable cause for the murder charge. A jury later acquitted the defendant of murder, but convicted him of the lesser included offense of first degree manslaughter in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (l).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The jury also found the defendant guilty of first degree assault and criminal use of a firearm. The trial court dismissed the criminal use of a firearm count<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>and sentenced the defendant to a term of fifteen years on the manslaughter count and to a term of five years on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>the first degree assault count, to run consecutively, for a total effective sentence of twenty years. The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The defendant presents the following issues on appeal: (1) whether \u00a7 54-76b violates his rights to due process and equal protection under the state and federal constitutions;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (2) whether the trial court abused its discretion by excluding evidence concerning the gang with which the victim was supposedly affiliated and its reputation for violence. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">The defendant challenges \u00a7 54-76b on both substantive due process and equal protection grounds. It is well settled that a party challenging the constitutionality of a statute must prove its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>218 Conn. 580, 590, 590 A.2d 447 (1991); <em>Zapata </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>207 Conn. 496, 508, 542 A.2d 700 (1988) . While courts may declare a statute to be unconstitutional, the power to do so should \u201cbe exercised with caution, and in no doubtful case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brennan\u2019s Liquors, </em>25 Conn. 278, 288 (1856). Every presumption is to be given in favor of the constitutionality of a statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>217 Conn. 73, 79, 584 A.2d 1157 (1991); <em>Bottone </em>v. <em>Westport, 209 </em>Conn. 652, 657, 553 A.2d 576 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">The defendant first claims that \u00a7 54-76b violates his right to due process as guaranteed to him by the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>constitution. \u201cThe fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution provides that the \u2018State [shall not] deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . .\u2019In order to prevail on his due process claim, the [defendant] must prove that: (1) he has been deprived of a property [or liberty] interest cognizable under the due process clause; and (2) the deprivation of the property [or liberty] interest has occurred without due process of law. See <em>Double I Limited Partnership </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>218 Conn. 65, 76, 588 A.2d 624 (1991); <em>Connecticut Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Tirozzi, </em>210 Conn. 286, 293, 554 A.2d 1065 (1989) . . . .\u201d <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>222 Conn. 233, 241-42, 610 A.2d 574 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">\u201cLiberty interests protected by the Fourteenth Amendment may arise from two sources \u2014 the Due Process Clause itself and the laws of the States. <em>Meachum </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 223-227 [96 S. Ct. 2532, 49 L. Ed. 2d 451] (1976).\u201d <em>Hewitt </em>v. <em>Helms, </em>459 U.S. 460, 466, 103 S. Ct. 864, 74 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1983). The defendant does not claim that he has been deprived of a fundamental right by the youthful offender statute. He claims, rather, that the youthful offender statute itself has created a liberty interest and that he has been denied that liberty interest without due process of law. \u201c[0]nce a state provides its citizens with certain statutory rights beyond those secured by the constitution itself, the constitution forbids the state from depriving individuals of those statutory rights without due process of law.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>233 Conn. 44, 77, 658 A.2d 947 (1995), on appeal after remand, 235 Conn. 671, 669 A.2d 573 (1996). \u201cThe guarantee of substantive due process requires that a law be reasonable, rather than arbitrary or capricious, and that its operation has a real and substantial relation to the object to be obtained. <em>All Brand Importers, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>[213 Conn. 184, 205, 567 A.2d 1156 (1989)].\u201d <em>Langan </em>v. <em>Weeks, </em>37 Conn. App. 105, 118, 655 A.2d 771 (1995). In the absence of a claim of deprivation of a fundamental right, we have scrutinized such questions under a rational basis test. See generally <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>193 Conn. 93, 105, 475 A.2d 289 (1984); <em>Caldor\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bedding Barn, Inc., </em>177 Conn. 304, 314-15, 417 A.2d 343 (1979). The party claiming a constitutional violation \u201cbears the heavy burden of proving that the challenged policy has no reasonable relationship to <em>any </em>legitimate state purpose; <em>Caldor\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bedding Barn, Inc., </em>supra, 314-15 <em>. . . .\" </em>(Citation omitted; emphasis added.) <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">A brief examination of the benefits of youthful offender status and the statutory eligibility requirements for that status is in order before we consider the defendant\u2019s due process claims. The youthful offender statutes confer certain benefits on those youths eligible to be adjudged youthful offenders. For instance, all proceedings, except the motion for investigation of eligibility, are private. General Statutes \u00a7 54-76h.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If confined, a youth is segregated from other defendants over the age of eighteen years before and during trial and before sentencing. General Statutes \u00a7 54-76h. A youthful offender is also eligible to receive a more lenient sentence; compare General Statutes \u00a7 54-76j,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> with, e.g., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35a;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> is not disqualified from later holding public office, and does not forfeit any right or privilege to receive a license granted by a public authority. General Statutes \u00a7 54-76k.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, a youthful offender is not considered a criminal, and a determination that a defendant is a youthful offender is not deemed a conviction. General Statutes \u00a7 54-761c. A youthful offender\u2019s records are kept confidential; General Statutes \u00a7 54-767;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and are automatically erased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>\u201cwhen such person attains twenty-one years of age, provided such person has not subsequent to being adjudicated a youthful offender been convicted of a felony . . . prior to [having] attained such age.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-76o.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>Certain categories of defendants, however, are statutorily ineligible for treatment as youthful offenders. These groups can be characterized as comprising three general classifications: (1) those defendants who have already had the benefit of juvenile or youthful offender treatment or who have been afforded accelerated rehabilitation;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (2) those defendants previously convicted of a felony; and (3) those defendants who have been charged with certain serious crimes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The defendant makes two substantive due process claims: (1) that the legislature\u2019s decision to base eligibility for youthful offender status on the seriousness of the crimes charged violates his right to due process of law; and (2) that the legislature\u2019s decision to preclude a defendant from seeking the postverdict benefits of the youthful offender statutes if he or she is charged with, but not convicted of, one of the disqualifying offenses also violates the defendant\u2019s right to due process of law. We disagree with both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>With respect to the defendant\u2019s first claim, we believe that the legislature\u2019s decision to grant preverdict benefits and, therefore, to determine youthful offender status before trial, is rational. The preverdict benefits are real and substantial, and the early determination of eligibility is necessary to confer those benefits. We also conclude that it was rational for the legislature to exclude from youthful offender eligibility those defendants charged with murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The rationality of the legislature\u2019s choice is supported by our decision in <em>State </em>v. Anonymous, 173 Conn. 414, 378 A.2d 528 (1977), in which we concluded that it was rational for the legislature to carve out an exception to the juvenile court statutory scheme with respect to <em>juveniles </em>charged with murder. The defendant in <em>Anonymous </em>was charged with intentionally causing a death. At the time of the incident, the defendant was fifteen years of age. He was therefore referred to the juvenile court. After a hearing pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7 17-60a,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> however, the defendant\u2019s case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>transferred to the Superior Court for disposition, and his file was sealed by that court. Subsequently, \u201cthe grand jury returned a true bill of indictment charging the defendant with the crime of murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a of the General Statutes. On motion of the state, the court . . . ordered the file unsealed, but issued a stay of its decree to permit the defendant to file an appeal to this court.\u201d Id., 415. On appeal, we rejected the defendant\u2019s claim of a violation of his right to privacy as guaranteed by the United States and Connecticut constitutions because his file was to be unsealed upon his transfer from the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">We stated: \u201cAny privacy accorded to a juvenile because of his age with respect to proceedings relative to a criminal offense results from statutory authority, rather than from any inherent or constitutional right. Such statutory right to privacy reflects a legislative policy to the effect that juveniles should be treated in a manner different from that of other criminal offenders. Because the right to anonymity emanates from the legislature and does not involve any fundamental right, that right can be withdrawn or limited to certain classes of juvenile offenders by the legislature provided the classifications are founded upon a rational basis. <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 376 A.2d 359 [1977]. \u2018In exercising [the state\u2019s] police power the legislature has a broad discretion, both in determining what the public welfare requires, and in fashioning legislation to meet that need.\u2019 <em>C &amp; H Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>167 Conn. 304, 307, 355 A.2d 247 [1974].</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">\u201cMurder is the most serious of criminal charges. The enactment of \u00a7 17-60a of the General Statutes manifests the legislature\u2019s recognition of the special problems which arise in the processing and disposition of juveniles charged with murder. Because of such problems, the legislature in enacting \u00a7 17-60a carved out an exception to the juvenile court statutory scheme with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>to juveniles charged with murder. That statute, when viewed in the context of the crime charged, the required investigation, hearing and court findings, clearly demonstrates that it was rationally based.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>supra, 173 Conn. 417-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">We reach a similar conclusion in this case. The youthful offender statutes were enacted as Public Acts 1971, No. 72. From the debate on the Senate floor prior to passage, it is clear that the youthful offender statutes were intended to protect and possibly rehabilitate those youths who had made a mistake because of their immaturity. \u201cI believe this is a giant step forward in the way 16 and 17 year olds are treated by the State of Connecticut. This is a time in every boy or girl\u2019s life which is most crucial and the way they are handled during this delicate period will, in many instances, shape the type of men and women they become. In other words, the [die] is cast during this period . . . .\u201d 14 S. Proc., Pt. 2, 1971 Sess., p. 652, remarks of Senator Jay W. Jackson. \u201cI feel that young people at this stage of their lives have not adopted a life style of crime. And I think it\u2019s quite possible and I think that society ought to hope that through its rehabilitation] efforts it can prevent young people who have committed one act, perhaps irrationally and injudiciously, that they have embarked on the wrong road, and that the right road is one in which they will see society in a different light.\u201d 14 S. Proc., Pt. 2,1971 Sess., p. 735, remarks of Senator Lawrence J. Denardis. \u201cIt seems to me that we are moving backward when we do not give a young person a second chance. That\u2019s really what we are talking [about] here.\u201d 14 S. Proc., Pt. 2, 1971 Sess., p. 734, remarks of Senator Roger W. Eddy. \u201cI think we are giving an opportunity to a sixteen or seventeen year old who is at the threshold. And just how he crosses that threshold and in what direction he takes after he crosses it, I think is most important to all of us people in the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>of Connecticut.\u201d 14 S. Proc., Pt. 2, 1971 Sess., p. 659, remarks of Senator Jay W. Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The legislature, however, was also concerned that certain defendants should be statutorily ineligible for youthful offender status. The act as initially drafted excluded only youths charged with class A felonies.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> There was a proposed amendment to the youthful offender bill in 1971, however, which would have excluded youths charged with other serious crimes. The ensuing discussion on the Senate floor focused on the conflict between the rehabilitative concerns of the act and society\u2019s desire for harsh punishments for serious crimes. The ultimate conclusion reached by the 1971 legislature, as evidenced by the defeat of the amendment, was that the only charges serious enough to deny eligibility for youthful offender status ipso facto at that time were class A felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">It is rational, in light of the goals expressed by the legislature, to distinguish between those youths charged with murder after probable cause hearings and those charged with lesser crimes. A youth charged, after a hearing in probable cause, with having the intent to kill another person can be characterized reasonably as having crossed the threshold and chosen a direction in life incompatible with the lenient treatment available to youthful offenders. The legislature, therefore, rationally could have determined that the benefits of youthful offender status should not be available to such a defendant. It was consequently a legitimate legislative choice to exclude from the definition of a youthful offender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>those defendants charged with class A felonies. \u201c \u2018In exercising [the state\u2019s] police power the legislature has broad discretion, both in determining what the public welfare requires, and in fashioning legislation to meet that need.\u2019 <em>C &amp; H Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>[supra, 167 Conn. 307].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>supra, 173 Conn. 418. The defendant\u2019s first due process claim, therefore, fails.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">As to his second due process claim, the defendant argues that because \u00a7 54-76b defines a \u201cyouthful offender\u201d as one \u201cwho is charged with the commission of a crime which is not a . . . class A felony,\u201d a defendant who is ultimately acquitted of a class A felony would be prohibited from applying for the postverdict benefits of the youthful offender statutes. The denial of those benefits following such an acquittal, he claims, has no rational basis and therefore constitutes a due process violation. We agree with the defendant that a defendant who is convicted of a lesser included crime, but is acquitted of the class A felony that statutorily deprived him of youthful offender status, is unable to apply for postverdict benefits. We disagree, however, that that result violates the defendant\u2019s substantive due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">As mentioned above, the legislature provided a variety of benefits to youths eligible to be adjudged youthful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>offenders when it enacted the youthful offender statutes. Some benefits exist before and during trial; others exist subsequent to a determination that a defendant is guilty of being a youthful offender. Regardless of the timing of the benefits, however, the legislature has chosen to bestow or withhold these benefits as a whole, rather than on a piecemeal basis. It is entirely possible that the legislature decided that, in the best interests of our open public court system, any defendant tried as an adult and exposed to the public for trial should be sentenced as an adult, regardless of the crimes of which he or she is ultimately convicted. The legislature could have reasoned that conferring postverdict youthful offender benefits, such as a more lenient sentence, confidential records, and the right to hold office, on a defendant who had been tried and convicted in open court as an adult would damage society\u2019s perception of the fair administration of justice. Because there exists a rational basis for this legislative scheme; see <em>Caldor\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bedding Barn, Inc., </em>supra, 177 Conn. 314-15; we conclude that the legislature\u2019s decision to preclude a defendant from seeking the postverdict benefits of the youthful offender statutes if charged with, but acquitted of, one of the enumerated offenses that deny eligibility, but convicted of a lesser offense, does not violate the defendant\u2019s right to due process of law.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The defendant additionally claims that the youthful offender statutes as enacted by the legislature violate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>his right to equal protection under the United States constitution.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In order to analyze the constitutionality of the youthful offender statutes on that basis, we must first detail the principles applicable to equal protection analysis. \u201c \u2018[T]he concept of equal protection [under both the state and federal constitutions] has been traditionally viewed as requiring the uniform treatment of persons standing in the same relation to the governmental action questioned or challenged.\u2019 <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>377 U.S. 533, [565] 84 S. Ct. 1362, 12 L. Ed. 2d 506 (1964); <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 432, [440] 105 S. Ct. 3249, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1985); <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>200 Conn. 562, 578, 512 A.2d 893 (1986). The equal protection clause \u2018does not require absolute equality or precisely equal advantages . . . .\u2019 <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Moffitt, </em>417 U.S. 600, 612, 94 S. Ct. 2437, 41 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1974); <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>supra, 577-78. Rather, a state may make classifications when enacting or carrying out legislation, but in order to satisfy the equal protection clause the classifications made must be based on some reasonable ground. <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Moffitt, </em>supra [612]; <em>Magoun </em>v. <em>Illinois Trust &amp; Savings Bank, </em>170 U.S. 283, [293] 18 S. Ct. 594, 42 L. Ed. 1037 (1898); <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>supra [577-78]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>192 Conn. 520, 531, 473 A.2d 775 (1984). To determine whether a particular classification violates the guarantees of equal protection, the court must consider \u2018the character of the classification; the individual interests affected by the classification; and the governmental interests asserted in support of the classification.\u2019 <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Blumstein, </em>405 U.S. 330, 335, 92 S. Ct. 995, 31 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1972). Where the classification impinges upon a fundamental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>right or impacts upon an \u2018inherently suspect\u2019 group, it will be subjected to strict scrutiny and will be set aside unless it is justified by a compelling state interest. Id., 342; <em>Bruno </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>192 Conn. 335, 345, 472 A.2d 328 (1984); <em>Laden </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>169 Conn. 540, 542, 363 A.2d 1063 (1975). On the other hand, where the classification at issue neither impinges upon a fundamental right nor affects a suspect group it \u2018will withstand constitutional attack if the distinction is founded on a rational basis.\u2019 <em>Laden </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 543; see also <em>McGinnis </em>v. <em>Royster, </em>410 U.S. 263, 270, 93 S. Ct. 1055, 35 L. Ed. 2d 282 (1972); <em>Dandridge </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 485, 90 S. Ct. 1153, 25 L. Ed. 2d 491 (1970).\u201d <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>211 Conn. 591, 594-95, 560 A.2d 444 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">To implicate the equal protection clauses under the state and federal constitutions, therefore, it is necessary that the state statute in question, either on its face or in practice, treat differently persons standing in the same relation to it. As was the case with his due process claim, the defendant alleges two separate equal protection violations. He first asserts that the youthful offender statutes provide for disparate treatment of two individuals both of whom are ultimately convicted only of manslaughter although one is initially charged with murder. This is so, the defendant argues, because the individual who is charged with murder but acquitted of that charge cannot receive the postverdict benefits of being a youthful offender, while the individual who is initially charged with only manslaughter is eligible, in the court\u2019s discretion, to be treated as a youthful offender and receive the postverdict benefits. The classification the defendant complains of neither affects a suspect group nor impinges on a fundamental right. The defendant, therefore, must show that the statute bears no rational relation to some legitimate state purpose. See <em>State Management Assn. of Connecticut, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>204 Conn. 746, 754, 529 A.2d 1276 (1987); <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>179 Conn. 627, 640, 427 A.2d 830, appeal dismissed, 449 U.S. 801, 1015 S. Ct 45, 66 L. Ed. 2d 5 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">\u201cUnder the rational basis test, [t]he court\u2019s function . . . is to decide whether the purpose of the legislation is a legitimate one and whether the particular enactment is designed to accomplish that purpose in a fair and reasonable way.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Circuit-Wise, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>215 Conn. 292, 300, 576 A.2d 1259 (1990). \u201cIn general, the Equal Protection Clause is satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification, see <em>United States Railroad Retirement [Board] </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>449 U.S. 166, 174, 179 [101 S. Ct. 453, 66 L. Ed. 2d 368] (1980), the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to be true by the government decisionmaker, see <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Clover Leaf Creamery Co., </em>449 U.S. 456, 464 [101 S. Ct. 715, 66 L. Ed. 2d 659] (1981), and the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational, see <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc., </em>[supra, 473 U.S. 446].\u201d <em>Nordlinger </em>v. <em>Hahn, </em>505 U.S. 1, 11, 112 S. Ct. 2326, 120 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Our analysis of this equal protection claim of the defendant mirrors our analysis under the defendant\u2019s first due process claim because the fundamental concern of both claims is the disparate treatment given to defendants, between the ages of sixteen and eighteen, who are charged with murder and to those who are charged with manslaughter. The due process argument is that such a distinction itself has no rational basis, while the equal protection argument cites the comparison with another person allegedly similarly situated to make basically the same claim. \u201cIn areas of social and economic policy, a statutory classification that neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>proceeds along suspect lines nor infringes fundamental constitutional rights must be upheld against [an] equal protection challenge if there is <em>any reasonably conceivable </em>state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Broadley </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>229 Conn. 1, 8-9, 639 A.2d 502 (1994). Assuming arguendo that the two categories of defendants identified by the defendant are similarly situated with respect to the statute, and relying on our analysis under the defendant\u2019s first due process claim, we conclude that a rational basis does exist for this classification, which results in disparate treatment for those charged with murder and those charged with lesser crimes, and that the classification bear\u2019s a reasonable relationship to the legislative goal of the youthful offender statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">In his second equal protection claim, the defendant appears to claim that he is similarly situated to a child<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> whose age is between fourteen and sixteen and who is charged with similar crimes. He argues that children transferred to and tried in adult criminal court have the opportunity to resume juvenile status if they are ultimately acquitted of the charge for which they were transferred, but that a similar opportunity to reapply for youthful offender status is denied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">However, the factual predicate upon which the defendant relies for this argument \u2014 that children may resume juvenile status if they are ultimately acquitted of the charge for which they were transferred \u2014 is not true. In another case that we decide today, <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>240 Conn. 727, 694 A.2d 758 (1997), we conclude that a child does not resume juvenile status if acquitted of the specific statutory offense for which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>was transferred.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> With respect to the defendant\u2019s claim, therefore, both children and youths are treated similarly. The defendant\u2019s equal protection claim, therefore, must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim on appeal is that the trial court abused its discretion when it refused to admit evidence regarding the victim\u2019s alleged gang affiliation and the gang\u2019s reputation for violence. \u201cIt is well established that [t]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility [and relevancy] of evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 482, 522 A.2d 249 (1987). The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Avis, </em>209 Conn. 290, 298, 551 A.2d 26 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1097, 109 S. Ct. 1570, 103 L. Ed. 2d 937 (1989).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>236 Conn. 514, 549, 673 A.2d 1117 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">The defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s rulings that excluded evidence concerning the victim\u2019s affiliation with a gang, i.e., testimony that the victim was a gang member and that the gang was violent and had access to guns. The defendant argues that this evidence was relevant to his belief that the victim had deadly force at his command,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> although the victim himself was not using deadly force, and that this belief goes to his self-defense claim. The trial court ruled that because the defendant had testified that it was the victim whom he feared and that the victim was the person he shot, evidence concerning the other gang members\u2019 tenden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>cies for violence was not relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim. After a thorough review of the record, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the defendant\u2019s proffered evidence on the basis of its irrelevance to the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-10\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 54-76b provides: \u201cFor the purpose of sections 54-76b to 54-76n, inclusive, \u2018youth\u2019 means a minor who has reached the age of sixteen years but has not reached the age of eighteen years; and \u2018youthful offender\u2019 means a youth who is charged with the commission of a crime which is not a violation of section 53a-70a or a class A felony, who has not previously been convicted of a felony or been previously adjudged a youthful offender, or been afforded a pretrial program for accelerated rehabilitation under section 54-56e, and who is adjudged a youthful offender pursuant to the provisions of said sections.

In my view, it is not necessary to engage in the inquiry of whether the particular classification at issue has a rational basis<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the defendant cannot surmount the threshold of equal protection analysis, namely, that he is similarly situated to the person with whom he is to be compared.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">It is axiomatic that the equal protection clause only applies where the litigant before the court first establishes that he is similarly situated, with respect to the statutory scheme claimed to violate the clause, to someone else who is treated differently from him under the statutory scheme. <em>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. </em>v. <em>EI Constructors, Inc., </em>239 Conn. 708, 755, 687 A.2d 506 (1997). If he is so similarly situated, the court must then determine whether the classification effectuated by the statutory scheme survives the applicable level of scrutiny. Id., 755-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-10\">As the majority opinion makes clear, the defendant seeks to compare himself to the individual who is initially charged only with manslaughter and who is, therefore, eligible for youthful offender treatment. The defendant, however, is not similarly situated, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>respect to the youthful offender statutory scheme, to such an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The appropriate time for this inquiry is not, as the defendant assumes, at the end of the process, when he was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter. The appropriate time is at the beginning of the process, when he was charged, because that is when the court was required to determine whether the youthful offender statutory scheme was to be invoked. That statutory scheme provides a panoply of protections for one who falls within it, and those protections include pretrial, trial and posttrial provisions. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to determine whether defendants are similarly situated with respect to that scheme only at its end point.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">When the defendant was charged with murder, the state had evidence establishing probable cause that he had committed not only manslaughter, but murder. A defendant against whom there is sufficient evidence to charge him with murder is not, in my view, similarly situated to a defendant against whom there is only sufficient evidence to charge him with manslaughter. The defendant\u2019s equal protection claim founders, therefore, at this threshold stage.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b787-11\"> By joining the majority opinion, I also agree with and join its rational basis analysis. The purpose of this concurrence is simply to underscore my conclusion that it is not necessary to engage in that analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
