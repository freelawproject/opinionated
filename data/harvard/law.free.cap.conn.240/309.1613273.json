The plaintiff, the administratrix of the estate of William K. Remington (William), brought an action to recover underinsured motorist benefits under an automobile liability policy (policy) issued to Virginia Remington<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by the defendant, Aetna Casualty and Surety Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">After a trial to a jury on the issue of liability, a verdict was returned in favor of the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>mined that William was not a resident of Virginia Remington\u2019s household and, therefore, not covered by the policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court denied the plaintiffs motion to set aside the verdict and rendered judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the factors to be considered when determining whether William was a resident of Virginia Remington\u2019s household.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The following evidence was before the jury. William was the stepson of Virginia Remington. He had lived with Virginia Remington during her marriage to his father and at times after his father\u2019s death in 1987. In May, 1990, William sustained fatal injuries in a motor vehicle accident caused by an underinsured motorist. At the time of the accident, William had a bedroom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>available to him at the house in Cheshire where Virginia Remington was living. He also stayed at an apartment at 1308 Dixwell Avenue in Hamden that Virginia Remington had found and leased in her name. She paid the rent and furnished the apartment, and maintained a telephone there in her name. Although William listed his Hamden address as his residence on his 1989 tax returns, he used Virginia Remington\u2019s Cheshire address for his mail and bills, including his unemployment checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Virginia Remington handled all of William\u2019s financial affairs throughout his life. Although he was thirty-eight years old at the time of his death, William was unable to live on his own. William\u2019s inability to live apart from Virginia Remington was attributed to a 1965 motor vehicle accident in which he suffered head injuries and temporary blindness. In 1988, following his father\u2019s death, William lived with his brother for a year. He then moved into his own apartment for two months. At both locations, Virginia Remington leased the apartment and paid the rent for William. Thereafter, he lived with Virginia Remington in Cheshire, except for one week during which he lived in a motel, until he moved to Hamden in February, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The policy was introduced as an exhibit. The policy listed Virginia Remington as the named insured and defined covered persons to include her or \u201cany family member.\u201d Family member was defined as \u201ca person related to [Virginia Remington] by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of [Virginia Remington\u2019s] household. This includes a ward or foster child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The plaintiff requested that the trial court instruct the jury to consider a conglomeration of factors in determining household residency.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>refused to give the plaintiffs requested charge, and instead, instructed the jury that it could take into consideration where William was living, where he kept his belongings, the frequency of his contact with Virginia Remington, where his mail was sent, the address he used for formal purposes such as voting and filing tax returns, whether he had his own room in Virginia Remington\u2019s household, and his intentions insofar as they indicated where he was actually living.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>failed to inform the jury that Wilham\u2019s emotional or financial ability to establish a household separate from Virginia Remington was a factor to be considered. The plaintiff also requested an instruction that an individuai could have more than one residence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That instruction also was not given.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">This court has recognized that a trier of fact must determine where an individual resides by analyzing the facts unique to each case. <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>167 Conn. 450, 458, 356 A.2d 94 (1975); <em>Rathbun </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>144 Conn. 165, 168, 128 A.2d 327 (1956). In undertaking this analysis, the trier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>of fact must consider a conglomeration of factors. <em>Mid-dlesex Mutual Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>218 Conn. 681, 686, 590 A.2d 957 (1991). These factors include: the intent of the individual; the frequency of contact between the individual and other household inhabitants; the frequency with which the individual spends time at the household; the maintenance of a separate residence for the individual; whether the individual is emotionally and financially capable of establishing and maintaining a residence independent of the household; the location of personal belongings; the location of and address used for personnel and business records; the address at which mail is received; and the address used for formal purposes such as voting, licenses, and income tax filings. Id., 686-87, 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The trial court here omitted some of these factors when it instructed the jury what factors should be considered in determining William\u2019s household residency. The omitted factors included the frequency with which the individual spends time at the household, whether the individual is emotionally and financially capable of establishing and maintaining a residence independent of the household, and the location of and address used for personnel and business records. The court indicated that the decisive factor was whether William and Virginia Remington shared the same roof or dwelling. In essence, the trial court instructed the jury that William and Virginia Remington must share the \u201csame roof\u2019 and that the \u201csame roof\u2019 meant <em>one </em>roof. This was improper, as the description of a household and the determination of who resides in that household are decisions to be made upon consideration of the factual circumstances involved in each case. The jury reasonably might have concluded that wherever he stayed, William always returned to be with Virginia Remington, and that the apartment in Hamden was nothing more than a home away from home. William\u2019s inability to live apart from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Virginia Remington, therefore, was a circumstance to be considered. Furthermore, the focus of the charge was too narrow because a person may have more than one residence. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>168 Conn. 619, 621, 362 A.2d 795 (1975); see also <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>supra, 167 Conn. 461 <em>(Bogdanski, J., </em>dissenting), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u201c[A] jury charge is to be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict. ... A jury charge must be correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury. . . .A charge is not to be critically dissected for purposes of discovering possible inaccuracies . . . but rather, the initial charge and any supplemental charge are to be read as a whole. . . . The ultimate test of a court\u2019s instructions is whether, taken as a whole, they fairly and adequately present the case to a jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ellice </em>v. <em>INA Life Ins. Co. of New York, </em>208 Conn. 218, 226, 544 A.2d 623 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The trial court\u2019s instruction did not meet the requirement established in <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co. </em>that many factors under the particular circumstances must be included in the determination of household residency. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s charge was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">We must next determine whether that improper instruction was harmful because it would have been likely to affect the jury\u2019s verdict. See <em>Anonymous </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>168 Conn. 421, 430, 362 A.2d 532, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 935, 96 S. Ct. 294, 46 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1975); <em>Blancato </em>v. <em>Randino, </em>33 Conn. App. 44, 49, 632 A.2d 1144, cert. denied, 228 Conn. 916, 636 A.2d 846 (1993). We conclude that this improper instruction was harmful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>as it went to the central issue before the juiy, namely, whether William was a resident of Virginia Remington\u2019s household. Accordingly, a new trial is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-10\"> Virginia Remington has brought this case solely in her capacity as the administratrix of William\u2019s estate. The fact that she is the named insured on the policy is entirely coincidental to the fact that she has brought this claim on behalf of William\u2019s estate. In order to avoid confusion between her role as named insured and her role as administratrix, we will use Virginia Remington when referring to her as the named insured and the plaintiff when discussing the claims she raises as administratrix.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b332-11\"> The jury trial that forms the basis of this appeal was ordered on remand from the Appellate Court. <em>Remington </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>35 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Conn. App. 581, 646 A.2d 266 (1994). Initially, the trial court, <em>Hadden, J., </em>granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment after determining, as a matter of law, that William was not a resident of Virginia Remington\u2019s household and, therefore, was not covered by the policy. The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, which reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings after holding that summary judgment was inappropriate because genuine issues of material fact, had yet 1o be resolved. Id. On remand, the trial court, <em>Corradino, J., </em>bifurcated the issues of damages and liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b333-8\"> The jury\u2019s verdict form, dated November 3, 1995, stated: \u201cWe the Jury find for the Defendant, Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, and hereby conclude that William K. Remington was not a resident of the household of Virginia Remington at the time of his death.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b333-9\"> The plaintiff also claims that the trial court improperly: (1) failed to charge the jury that the policy was ambiguous and should be resolved in favor of coverage; and (2) refused to admit into evidence mail addressed to William that had been forwarded to Virginia Remington. In light of our resolution of the jury instruction issue, we need not reach the plaintiff\u2019s additional claims. Further, the plaintiffs argument that these issues should be considered because they are likely to surface on remand is not persuasive. We will not engage in speculation as to what evidence may be offered or instructions may be given at a future trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b334-8\"> The plaintiff requested in part the following instruction: \u201cThe definition of a household reveals two primary characteristics: a close familial relationship and joint occupation of a dwelling. ... A conglomeration of factors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>including the intent of the decedent, William Remington, must be considered by you to determine whether Virginia Remington and [William] shared a dwelling. . . . Intent is clearly a question of fact that is ordinarily inferred from one\u2019s conduct or acts under the circumstances of the particular case. . . . Besides intent, the conglomeration of factors which you should consider in this case as indicia of household residency include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">\u201c1. Whether [William] suffered from any physical or emotional disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">\u201c2. His familial relationship with his stepmother and other family members;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">\u201c3. The amount of time [William] spent living with his stepmother during the years prior to his death;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">\u201c'4. The circumstances surrounding his absences from Virginia Remington;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">\u201c5. His sleeping arrangements at 155 Nob Hill Road;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">\u201c6. The location of [William\u2019s] clothes, paperwork and other personal belongings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">\u201c7. The location where [William] received his mail and bills;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-13\">\u201c8. The address where he was registered to vote;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-14\">\u201c9. [William\u2019s] source of income;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-15\">\u201c10. The person in charge of the management of [William\u2019s] financial affairs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-16\">\u201c11. The ability of [William] to maintain an independent living situation and the permanent measures [William] took to achieve this;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-17\">\u201c12. Whether [William] was financially or emotionally capable of establishing and maintaining a household separate from his stepmother. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-18\">\u201cAs you can see from this list, your focus in determining whether William Remington was a resident of Virginia Remington\u2019s household on May 21, 1990, should not only consider physical presence but also amultitude of other factors which focus upon whether [William] was capable of establishing and maintaining a household on his own.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b335-19\"> The trial court instructed the jury in relevant part: \u201cIn defining \u2018resident of [Virginia Remington\u2019s] household,\u2019 you use the ordinary dictionary meaning of the term \u2018household.\u2019 A household is a domicile. A household is a domestic establishment, including the members of a family who live under the same roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-20\">\u201cThus, there must be, one, a close familial relationship; and, two, joint occupancy of a dwelling. A dwelling must be shared. Another one of our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>cases says that a household is a social unit comprised of those living together in the same dwelling place. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\u201cNow, what is the second element? The second element is, did . . . William and Virginia Remington live in the same dwelling place? Was William a resident of Virginia Remington\u2019s dwelling place?</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">\u201cYou must determine if William can be said to have actually lived in the household of Virginia Remington or jointly occupied the same dwelling. How do you determine these matters? You would consider where William was actually living at the time of his death. How long had he lived there? When was the last time he lived with Virginia Remington, and for how long?</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">\u201cYou will remember that there was testimony that William stayed with Virginia Remington on two occasions in early 1990, perhaps right at the end of 1989 in December. And that he lived in an apartment for a few months prior to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">\u201cYou will also consider the contacts he had with Virginia Remington at her Cheshire address through visits. For example, the fact that his mail was sent to . . . Virginia Remington\u2019s Cheshire home. You will consider what belongings of his were kept at the home of Virginia Remington prior to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">\u201cWas there any evidence he had an assigned room or bedroom at the Cheshire household of Virginia Remington? You will consider where he received his mail, including unemployment checks, where he was registered to vote, and where he listed his address, for example, on income tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">\u201cFactors of intent do have a bearing, but only as to how they relate to the question of where William was actually living.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b336-13\"> That request asked for the following instruction: \u201cIn this particular case you have heard evidence that William Remington lived at 155 Nob Hill Road, Cheshire, from approximately January, 1990, until the middle of February, 1990, when he began living at 1308 Dixwell Avenue, Hamden. Each address constitutes a residence. Connecticut law recognizes that individuals may have multiple residences at one time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
