J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3i\">Former Superior Court Judge Robert C. Flanagan appeals from the decision of the judicial review council (review council) to censure him publicly for engaging in a consensual sexual relationship with a married court reporter who regularly had been assigned to his courtroom over the course of their relationship.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-51n (a) (l),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the review council is authorized to censure a judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>of the Superior Court publicly for a \u201cwilful violation of . . . any canon of judicial ethics . . . ,\u201d as set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 51-51\u00cd (a) (2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The review council concluded, after a public hearing, that Flanagan\u2019s conduct had violated canons 1 and 2A of the canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The review council\u2019s investigation into Flanagan\u2019s conduct pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 <em>51-511 </em>(a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>precipitated by a written complaint filed by Penny Ross, a court reporter. In her written complaint, Ross alleged that \u201c[t]here was sex between [herself] and Judge Flanagan on countless occasions over the past four years.\u201d The bulk of Ross\u2019 written complaint alleged a course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>of conduct by Flanagan that she claimed had caused her repeatedly to engage in coerced sexual relations with him during their relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">After the probable cause proceedings at which Ross, Flanagan and several other witnesses testified, the review council charged Flanagan with having violated canons 1 and 2A of the Code of Judicial Conduct and \u00a7 51-51i (a) (2) by \u201cengag[ing] in a <em>consensual </em>sexual relationship with a married court employee . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>(Emphasis added.) The review council did not find probable cause to believe that Ross\u2019 relationship with Flanagan had been coerced in any way. Implicit in the review council\u2019s decision to charge Flanagan for ethical violations based solely on a consensual sexual relationship with a married court employee was the council\u2019s rejection of the substance of Ross\u2019 written complaint and her testimony at the probable cause hearing concerning coercion. The review council\u2019s rejection of Ross\u2019 coercion charges finds overwhelming support in the record in that Ross\u2019 written complaint and oral testimony were inconsistent and not credible. On cross-examination at the probable cause hearing, Ross admitted to several incidents that would indicate that her relationship with Flanagan had been consensual. Moreover, every other witness at the probable cause hearing testified to facts that left little doubt that the relationship had been consensual. Furthermore, none of the witnesses testified to a belief that Flanagan had coerced Ross to engage in a sexual relationship with him at any time. Finally, Flanagan himself admitted that he had had a sexual relationship with Ross for almost four years but testified that it had been entirely consensual.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">After a public hearing conducted pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-5H (c), at which only Ross, Moira Butler and Shepard Sherwood<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> testified, the review council made ten findings of fact. Those findings were as follows: \u201c(1) [Flanagan] was, at all relevant times, an active judge of the Connecticut Superior Court. (2) [Ross], at all relevant times, was a court reporter employed by the State Judicial Branch. (3) [Ross], at all relevant times, was a married woman. (4) [Flanagan] engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>in a consensual sexual relationship with [Ross] from March 1992, to October 1995. (5) For substantial periods of time during this relationship, [Ross] was consistently assigned as a court reporter to the courtroom in G.A. 6, New Haven, over which [Flanagan] presided. (6) On many occasions [Ross] was present in the chambers of [Flanagan] before the opening of court, during pretrial conferences with counsel present, and during recesses. (7) From early January 1995 to the fall of 1995, [Ross] also had a sexual relationship with Attorney Shepard Sherwood. (8) Attorney Sherwood was, at all relevant times, an assistant public defender at G.A. 6, New Haven, and weekly, and sometimes more often, appeared before [Flanagan] for pretrials in his chambers and other matters in court in the presence of [Ross] as the assigned court reporter. (9) The expert opinion evidence offered by [Flanagan] was not persuasive. (10) [Flanagan] willfully engaged in the conduct alleged.\u201d On the basis of those findings, the review council, by a nine to three vote, recommended a public censure of Flanagan on the grounds that, by engaging in a long-term consensual sexual relationship with his court reporter, he had violated canons 1 and 2A of the Code of Judicial Conduct. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Flanagan claims that the review council improperly: (1) charged him with consensual sexual misconduct on the basis of evidence adduced at the probable cause hearing even though Ross\u2019 written complaint had been limited to forced or coerced sexual misconduct; (2) concluded that he had violated canons 1 and 2A without any expert testimony to support that conclusion; (3) concluded that he had engaged in a \u201cwilful\u201d violation of canons 1 and 2A in the absence of evidence that he had the specific intent to violate those canons; (4) failed to dismiss the proceedings against him in light of Ross\u2019 violation of the confidentiality provision of \u00a7 51-51Z (a); (5) considered evidence beyond the scope of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>charges against him at the formal hearing; and (6) concluded, as a matter of law, that a consensual sexual relationship with his married court reporter constituted a violation of canons 1 and 2A.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Before analyzing Flanagan\u2019s procedural and substantive claims on appeal, however, we need first to set out the appropriate standards of review for the factual findings and legal conclusions of the review council. In reviewing the factual determinations of the review council, we \u201cmust take into account the risk that unfounded charges of judicial misconduct will impair society\u2019s interest in an independent judiciary. We must therefore depart from our normal rule of deference to factfinding by trial courts and administrative agencies. We have a nondelegable responsibility, upon an appeal, to undertake a scrupulous and searching examination of the record to ascertain whether there was substantial evidence to support the council\u2019s factual findings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Zoarski, </em>227 Conn. 784, 789-90, 632 A.2d 1114 (1993); <em>Council on Probate Judicial Conduct re: James H. Kinsella, </em>193 Conn. 180, 192, 476 A.2d 1041 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">As to the review council\u2019s ultimate legal conclusion that the facts found support a finding of a violation of one or more of the canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, we are persuaded that our review should be de novo. Pursuant to the constitution of Connecticut, article fifth, as amended by article eleven of the amendments, all judges within the state \u201cmay, in such manner as shall by law be prescribed, be removed or suspended by the supreme court.\u201d In addition to the authority it bestows upon this court, article fifth, as amended by article eleven of the amendments, also permits the General Assembly to create a judicial review council with the power to censure or to suspend any judge for a period not to exceed one year. The constitutional provisions relating to the disciplinary powers of this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>have been codified at General Statutes \u00a7 51-51j.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Similarly, the constitutional provisions pertaining to the powers of the review council have been codified at General Statutes \u00a7 51-51n.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Additionally, General Statutes \u00a7 51-51r<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> provides that any judge aggrieved by a decision of the review council may appeal that decision directly to this court. Together, the statutory and constitutional provisions make clear that this court may institute disciplinary proceedings against any judge and, after a hearing, remove or suspend any judge found guilty of a disciplinary violation. Although the review council is also empowered to review matters of judicial discipline, it may never order discipline more severe than a one year suspension. In those cases in which the review council believes that a sanction more severe than a one year suspension is appropriate, it only may recommend a disposition of the matter to this court, which has sole authority to suspend a judge for a period greater than one year or to remove a judge from office.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, even in those instances in which the action deemed appropriate by the review council is a one year suspension or any lesser form of discipline, this court may always review such decisions of the review council under \u00a7 51-51r.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Because we are empowered, by the constitution as well as by \u00a7 51-5lj, to determine all matters of judicial discipline in the first instance as well as upon appeal of the review council\u2019s decisions, we conclude that our review of the review council\u2019s legal conclusions is de novo. This approach promotes consistency in the enforcement of judicial discipline and finds support in the decisions of many of our sister Supreme Courts.

We are not persuaded that any of them warrants reversal of the review council\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Flanagan first claims that the review council was required to dismiss the proceedings against him when it found that Ross\u2019 allegations of a forced or nonconsen-sual sexual relationship were not supported by probable cause. Flanagan argues that, pursuant to the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and \u00a7 51-5U, the review council is without authority to make a finding of probable cause based upon facts that are not specifically alleged in the complaint that initiates the review council\u2019s investigation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">To address this claim, it is necessary for us to examine the statutory and regulatory procedures governing judicial discipline and how those procedures were employed in this case. The statutory and regulatory scheme pertaining to judicial discipline divides the procedure to be followed by the review council into two discrete stages: (1) an investigatory stage, during which the review council, acting either on a formal complaint or its own motion, may hold a confidential hearing to determine whether probable cause exists to believe that a judge has engaged in misconduct; and (2) in the event that the review council determines that probable cause does exist, an adjudicatory stage in the form of a public hearing to determine whether a violation has occurred. General Statutes \u00a7 51-5U;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 51-51k-6.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>In this case, the proceedings before the review council, as dictated by the statutes and regulations, were divided into those distinct investigatory and adjudicatory stages. The investigation into Flanagan\u2019s conduct was instigated by a written complaint from Ross alleging that Flanagan had coerced her into having sexual relations \"with him on various occasions for a period of more than three and one-half years.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Upon receipt of Ross\u2019 complaint, the review council provided a copy thereof to Flanagan and notified him of its intent to hold a confidential investigatory hearing to determine whether probable cause existed to believe that he had engaged in conduct that would constitute a violation of one or more of the canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct. The notice provided that \u201c[t]he area of inquiry by the council will be whether the conduct alleged in the complaint occurred, and, if it did, whether such conduct violated Canons 1, 2A or 2B of the Code of Judicial Conduct in violation of Section 51-5H (a) of the Connecticut General Statutes.\u201d In accordance with \u00a7 51-5U (a),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Flanagan was also notified that he had the right to attend the probable cause hearing, to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>represented by counsel, to testify, to present evidence and to examine and cross-examine witnesses. Pursuant to \u00a7 51-51k-5 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, Flanagan filed a written response with the review council.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This response stated: \u201cI deny the material allegations of the complaint as formulated by Ms. Penny Ross as set forth in her statement to Ms. Moira Butler.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Flanagan elected to appear at the hearing with counsel, to cross-examine the witnesses presented by the executive director and to present his own witnesses and testify on his own behalf. In his testimony, Flanagan admitted that he had had a consensual sexual relationship with Ross for approximately three and one-half years and that she had been assigned to his courtroom for much of that time. Flanagan denied that he had made any threats or that he had abused his position of authority in any way. After the probable cause hearing, the review council formally charged Flanagan with two counts of misconduct alleging that Flanagan\u2019s \u201cconsensual sexual relationship with a married court employee\u201d had violated canons 1 and 2A of the Code of Judicial Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">In response to the review council\u2019s issuance of formal charges, Flanagan\u2019s counsel sent a letter to the executive director of the review council stating that it was Flanagan\u2019s position that, by issuing charges on grounds not specifically alleged in Ross\u2019 complaint, the review council had initiated a new \u201cinvestigation\u201d and that Flanagan was entitled to a new probable cause hearing based on that conduct rather than proceeding immediately to the formal hearing stage. After stating that position, however, Flanagan\u2019s counsel wrote: \u201cNever<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>theless, we want to and will treat the hearing as a formal hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Flanagan also filed an answer to the review council\u2019s charges in which he responded to both counts of the charging document by admitting that he had \u201cengaged in a consensual sexual relationship with a married court employee\u201d but denying that such conduct constituted a violation of either canon 1 or 2A.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Flanagan now argues, for the first time, that, \u201c [h]aving found that [he] did not violate the code under the conduct alleged [in the initial citizen complaint] \u2014 rape and forced sex \u2014 the [review council] was legally obliged to dismiss the complaint for lack of probable cause.\u201d Flanagan claims that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Ruffalo, </em>390 U.S. 544, 88 S. Ct. 1222, 20 L. Ed. 2d 117, modified on other grounds, 392 U.S. 919, 88 S. Ct. 2257, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1380 (1968), is dispositive of this claim. We reject this argument on two alternate grounds: (1) Flanagan explicitly waived the claim in his letter to the executive director of the review council; and (2) even in the absence of waiver, <em>Ruffalo </em>does not require that a judge be given notice, during the <em>investigatory </em>stage of the proceedings against him, of each of the precise charges upon which he may be sanctioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>As noted previously, Flanagan\u2019s counsel sent a letter to the executive director of the review council in which he claimed that the procedure afforded by the council in finding probable cause on conduct not specifically alleged in the initial complaint by Ross may have been constitutionally suspect. In that letter, however, his counsel explicitly waived any claim on that basis by stating that Flanagan wanted to and would proceed to the formal hearing stage. Flanagan\u2019s counsel never again made any claim of lack of notice until his brief to this court. Because of this explicit waiver, we are not bound to consider the merits of Flanagan\u2019s notice claim. Practice Book \u00a7 4061.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Moreover, even if we were to address Flanagan\u2019s claim <em>under Ruffalo, </em>we are not persuaded that he could prevail. Ruffalo had been an active trial lawyer who was counsel in many actions against railroad companies under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act. <em>In </em>re <em>Ruf-falo, </em>supra, 390 U.S. 546. After an investigation into Ruffalo\u2019s handling of those cases, the Association of American Railroads made several charges of impropriety to the local bar association. Id. The Ohio board of commissioners on grievances and discipline (Ohio board) subsequently filed formal charges against Ruf-falo. Id. The Ohio board charged Ruffalo with twelve counts of misconduct, two of which accused Ruffalo of soliciting clients through an agent, Michael Orlando. Id. At the formal hearings on the charges, both Ruffalo and Orlando testified that Orlando had not solicited clients but that he had merely investigated certain complaints, some of which involved Orlando\u2019s employer, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad. Id. After hearing that testimony, the Ohio board added a thirteenth count of misconduct to its charge against Ruffalo based upon his hiring of Orlando to investigate Orlando\u2019s employer. Id. A motion to strike the additional count was denied, and Ruffalo was given an extended continuance in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>to respond to the new charge against him. Id., 547. After the continuance, no new evidence pertaining to the thirteenth count was introduced and the Ohio board sustained the charge contained in that count, as did the Ohio Supreme Court upon review. Id. Ruffalo was ordered disbarred in the state courts of Ohio. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">On the basis of the record and findings of the Ohio Supreme Court, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently disbarred Ruffalo from practice in that court on the grounds charged in the thirteenth count by the Ohio board. <em>In re Ruffalo, </em>370 F.2d 447 (6th Cir. 1966). The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the Sixth Circuit disbarment. <em>In re Ruffalo, </em>389 U.S. 815, 88 S. Ct. 30, 19 L. Ed. 2d 66 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The United States Supreme Court examined the procedure afforded Ruffalo in the state courts because, in determining whether disbarment by a state should be followed by disbarment on the same grounds in a federal court, the federal court must consider whether \u201c \u2018the state procedure from want of notice or opportunity to be heard was wanting in due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Ruffalo, </em>supra, 390 U.S. 550, quoting <em>Selling </em>v. <em>Radford, </em>243 U.S. 46, 51, 37 S. Ct. 377, 61 L. Ed. 585 (1917). The court concluded that, because attorney discipline proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature, an attorney is entitled by due process to reasonable notice of the charges against him \u201cbefore <em>the proceedings </em>commence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>In re Ruffalo, </em>supra, 390 U.S. 551. The court reasoned that the proceedings could \u201cbecome a trap when, after they are underway, the charges are amended on the basis of testimony of the accused.\u201d Id., 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Since <em>Ruffalo, </em>we have affirmed that an attorney subject <em>to </em>disciplinary proceedings must be given reasonable notice of the charges against him or her \u201cbefore <em>the proceedings </em>commence\u201d; (emphasis added) <em>Statewide </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number><em>Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Botwick, </em>226 Conn. 299, 308, 627 A.2d 901 (1993); and that this rale applies with equal force to judicial discipline proceedings. <em>Council on Probate Judicial Conduct re: James H. Kinsella, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 207. We conclude, however, that, under <em>Ruf-falo, </em>\u201cthe proceedings\u201d in advance of which reasonable notice must be given in judicial discipline proceedings are not the probable cause proceedings because those proceedings are investigatory, rather than adjudicatory, in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">We are guided by our decision in <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Presnick, </em>215 Conn. 162, 168-70, 575 A.2d 210 (1990), in which we addressed a procedural due process claim in the context of attorney disciplinary proceedings and distinguished between the different process due at the investigatoiy and adjudicatory stages of such proceedings. Presnick had appealed a decision of the Superior Court suspending him from the practice of law for a period of one year. Id., 163. He claimed, inter alia, that he had been denied due process of law because, at the stages preceding his formal presentment to the Superior Court, he had not been given the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses or to present his own testimony. Id., 168. We rejected Presnick\u2019s due process claim because the stages of the disciplinary process at which the alleged procedural defects occurred \u201cserved only as a predicate to a decision to file a presentment against the defendant in the Superior Court. The presentment that followed permitted the defendant a hearing in Superior Court according to the customary rules of evidence, and at which time he had the right to be present, to be represented by counsel if he chose, to cross-examine witnesses and to present evidence in his own behalf.\u201d Id., 170. We concluded that the process given to Presnick, \u201cwhen viewed in its totality, was adequate to meet the procedural safeguards required by the federal and state constitutions.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>We conclude that the due process protections afforded in disciplinary proceedings by <em>Ruff alo </em>and its progeny are inapplicable unless and until the review council brings formal charges akin to the presentment to the Superior Court in attorney discipline proceedings. \u201cSimply stated, a judge does not have the [constitutional] right to defend against a proceeding that has not yet been brought.\u201d <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance, </em>45 Cal. 3d 518, 528, 754 P.2d 724, 247 Cal. Rptr. 378 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Several other courts have drawn the distinction between the process due at the investigatory and adjudicatory stages of judicial disciplinary proceedings that we draw today. In the most analogous case, <em>McCartney </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Qualifications, </em>12 Cal. 3d 512, 519, 526 P.2d 268, 116 Cal. Rptr. 260 (1974), the California Supreme Court concluded that a judge who had been the subject of disciplinary proceedings had not been denied due process when he was not apprised of the commission\u2019s preliminary investigation into citizen complaints against him. The court concluded that, at the investigatory stage, \u201cthe Commission [on Judicial Qualifications] clearly has not yet commenced to perform any adjudicatory function, but is merely attempting to examine citizen complaints in a purely investigatory manner. Accordingly, notice to the judge under investigation as to the nature of the complaints against him is not compelled as a matter of due process.\u201d Id. Similarly, other jurisdictions have rejected other claimed due process rights at the investigatory stage of judicial disciplinary proceedings, including: the right to discovery; <em>In re Petition to Inspect Grand Jury Materials, </em>576 F. Sup. 1275, 1284 (S.D. Fla. 1983) (\u201c[during the investigatory stage, the required procedural protections are minimal at most\u201d); the right to be present; <em>In the Matter of Troy, </em>364 Mass. 15, 24, 306 N.E.2d 203 (1973) (investigation before special commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>\u201cwholly antecedent to the filing of the Information\u201d); the right to know the identity of one\u2019s accusers; <em>In re Elliston, </em>supra, 789 S.W.2d 473 (judge is only \u201centitled to know about the persons who will be called upon to give testimony in a <em>formal </em>hearing\u201d [emphasis added]); and the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses; <em>In re \u201cJudge Anonymous,\u201d </em>590 P.2d 1181, 1186 (Okla. 1978) (\u201cthe proceedings before the Council on Judicial Complaints are only investigatory in nature, as opposed to being adjudicatory in nature\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">We conclude that when a citizen complaint against a judge is brought to the attention of the judicial review council, the council has authority subsequently to charge that judge with a violation of \u00a7 51-5H based on any conduct of the judge revealed by its investigation into the complaint, whether or not the conduct forming the basis of the charge was contained specifically in the original complaint.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This conclusion is consistent with the conclusions reached in other jurisdictions. See <em>In re Petition to Inspect Grand Jury Materials, </em>supra, 576 F. Sup. 1284 (\u201csole duty at the investigatory stage of the Committee\u2019s work is to \u2018conduct an investigation as extensive as it considers necessary\u2019 \u201d); <em>In re Elliston, </em>supra, 789 S.W.2d 473 (state constitution should not be read \u201cas limiting the Commission\u2019s authority to take action against any possible judicial misconduct that might come to its attention\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Two interests must be accommodated injudicial disciplinary proceedings: (1) the review council must have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>broad authority to investigate the conduct of our judges in order to maintain public confidence in the judiciary; and (2) our judges must be afforded adequate process before discipline is imposed to ensure that discipline is not imposed on the basis of unfounded charges of misconduct. See <em>Kucej </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>239 Conn. 449, 462-63, 686 A.2d 110 (1996) (similar competing concerns in attorney discipline proceedings). We conclude that our statutory scheme, on its face and as applied here, adequately serves both of those interests. The review council cannot be constitutionally bound by the four comers of citizen complaints that may be incomplete or inaccurate. A judge is only entitled to reasonable notice of the charges upon which he may be disciplined after the review council has determined what those charges are. Discipline may not be imposed in the absence of a formal hearing preceded by reasonable notice of the charges. In this case, Flanagan was provided reasonable notice of the charges after the review council had completed its investigation and before the formal hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Flanagan next asserts that, as a matter of law, the lack of any expert testimony before the review council that a consensual sexual relationship with a married court reporter violates canons 1 and 2A of the Code of Judicial Conduct prevents the review council from finding a wilful violation of those canons in violation of \u00a7 51-5H (a) (2). Flanagan claims that our previous decisions in <em>In re Zoarski, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 793-94, and <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>211 Conn. 508, 525, 560 A.2d 403 (1989), require expert testimony in judicial review proceedings if a majority of the decisionmaking body is not composed of \u201cexperts,\u201d i.e., either judges or lawyers. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\"><em>Zoarski </em>addressed the need for expert testimony in judicial review proceedings in light of our statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>in <em>Levinson </em>that, \u201c[a]s long as the board hearing and deciding a [medical] licensing matter is composed of at least a majority of experts in the field involved in the case, the board may rely on its own expertise in evaluating charges against persons licensed by the board and the requisite standard of care by which to judge such cases.\u201d <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic </em>Examiners, supra, 211 Conn. 525. In <em>Zoarski, </em>we rejected the judge\u2019s claim under <em>Levinson </em>for two reasons: (1) at that time, the review council consisted of a \u201cmajority of experts\u201d in that its membership included three judges, three lawyers and only five laypersons; and (2) \u201c[i]n addition, this court\u2019s searching review of a finding of judicial misconduct assures the application of proper standards in any particular case.\u201d <em>In re Zoar-ski, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">This case differs from <em>Zoarski </em>in that, since <em>Zoarski, </em>the legislature has added an additional layperson to the review council so that the council is now composed of the same number of laypersons as judges and lawyers. Public Acts 1992, No. 92-160, \u00a7 2. Because of the present representational balance on the review council, we are now asked to determine whether the \u201cmajority of experts\u201d rule expressed in <em>Levinson </em>applies to this case. We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\"><em>Levinson </em>was drawn from and is part of a body of administrative law jurisprudence that addresses the issue of whether private actors can have their professional or trade competence judged by laypersons who ordinarily would not possess the specific professional or trade expertise necessary to make such a judgment without an expert\u2019s opinion. <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 525. Such concerns about professional or trade expertise are simply not present here. The issues before the review council were whether Flanagan, by engaging in a consensual sexual relationship with a married court reporter who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>regularly had been assigned to his courtroom, had failed: (1) \u201cto observe high standards of conduct so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary might be preserved\u201d; or (2) \u201cto act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary . ...\u201d In determining whether expert testimony was required in this case to support a finding of an ethical violation by Flanagan, we must consider whether \u201cthe determination of the standard of care requires knowledge that is beyond the experience of [the] fact finder,\u201d i.e., the review council. <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>239 Conn. 207, 226, 682 A.2d 106 (1996); see <em>Jaffe </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health, </em>135 Conn. 339, 349, 64 A.2d 330 (1949); <em>Sickmund </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>122 Conn. 375, 379, 189 A. 876 (1937); <em>Slimak </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>106 Conn. 366, 368, 138 A. 153 (1927); <em>Matyas </em>v. <em>Minck, </em>37 Conn. App. 321, 326, 655 A.2d 1155 (1995); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>McClary, </em>207 Conn. 233, 245, 541 A.2d 96 (1988) (expert testimony required because nature and cause of victim\u2019s injuries \u201cmanifestly beyond the ken of the average trier of fact, be it judge or jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Unlike <em>Santopietro, </em>this is not a case in which the claims to be decided \u201care akin to allegations of professional negligence or malpractice, which we have previously defined as the failure of one rendering professional services to exercise that degree of skill and learning commonly applied under all the circumstances in the community by the average prudent reputable member of the profession with the result of injury, loss, or damage to the recipient of those services. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Margolis, </em>215 Conn. 408, 415, 576 A.2d 489 (1990).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 226. The sole issue before the review council was whether a judge\u2019s consensual sexual relationship with a married court reporter who regularly had been assigned to his courtroom either compromises the integrity and independence of the judiciary or less<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>ens public confidence that such integrity and independence exists. These questions may be answered as competently by those without formal legal training as by those with such training. Although professional opinions may have been relevant to the review council\u2019s inquiry in this case and, therefore, admissible,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> such opinions are unnecessary to a determination of whether certain conduct has the effect of reducing public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary, irrespective of whether the review council is composed of a \u201cmajority of experts.\u201d Indeed, to create a rule of law requiring expert testimony in judicial discipline cases focusing on the public\u2019s perception of the judiciary would contravene the legislature\u2019s desire to have an equal \u201clay\u201d voice on the council as articulated in Public Acts 1992, No. 92-160.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Flanagan next argues that in order for a judge to be disciplined for a <em>\u201cwilful </em>violation of . . . any canon of judicial ethics\u201d under \u00a7 51-Sli (a) (2), the judge must have known \u201cthat his alleged conduct was forbidden under the Canons and that he acted with the specific intent to violate said Canons.\u201d The review council, on the contrary, contends that, in order to be disciplined under \u00a7 51-5H (a) (2), the judge need only have intended to engage in the acts for which he is disciplined without necessarily having specific knowledge that such conduct amounts to a violation of one of the canons. We agree with the review council.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Our inquiry is one of statutory construction. In the context of the statutes pertaining to the discipline of probate judges, which provide for discipline for conduct that \u201cviolate [s] any . . . canon of ethics applicable to judges of probate\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 45a-63 (formerly General Statutes \u00a7 45-1 le); we have stated that \u201c[s]cien-ter is not essential for the occurrence of an ethical violation. Judges no less than lawyers are chargeable for deviations from the codes governing their conduct, even though the application of the canons to particular circumstances may not be readily apparent.\u201d <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Council on Probate Judicial Conduct, </em>215 Conn. 553, 567, 577 A.2d 701 (1990). We have since repeated this same language from <em>Patterson, </em>eschewing the necessity for scienter when inteipreting \u00a7 51-51i (a) (1), which makes sanctionable \u201cconduct prejudicial to the impartial and effective administration of justice which brings the judicial office [into] disrepute.\u201d See <em>In re Zoarski, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 791. Flanagan claims, however, that in <em>Zoarski, </em>we limited the applicability of <em>Patterson </em>to cases involving \u00a7 51-5H (a) (1), by stating that \u201c[i]n contrast to \u00a7 51-5 li (a) (2), prejudicial judicial conduct under \u00a7 51-5H (a) (1) does not require proof of a wilful violation of the canons of judicial ethics.\u201d Id. We disagree with Flanagan\u2019s interpretation of the dictum in <em>Zoarski. </em>We conclude that specific intent to violate the canons is not required by \u00a7 51-51\u00cd (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\u201c \u2018[Wjillful\u2019 \u201d is a word \u201c \u2018of many meanings, its construction often being influenced by its context.\u2019 \u201d <em>Screws </em>v. <em>United States, </em>325 U.S. 91, 101, 65 S. Ct. 1031, 89 L. Ed. 1495 (1943). In the context of the subsection of our judicial discipline statute that codifies the canons of the Code of Judicial Ethics, the term \u201cwilful\u201d cannot reasonably be read to require a specific intent to violate the canons given the necessarily broad and flexible nature of those canons. <em>In the Matter of Young, </em>522 N.E.2d 386, 388 (Ind. 1988) (canons 1 and 2 notunconsti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>tutionally vague); <em>In re Gillard, </em>271 N.W.2d 785, 809 n.7 (Minn. 1978) (\u201cconstitutionality of necessarily broad standards of professional conduct has long been recognized\u201d); <em>In the Matter of Seraphim, </em>97 Wis. 2d 485, 497, 294 N. W.2d 485 (1980) (\u201cgreater degree of flexibility and breadth is permitted with respect to judicial disciplinary rules and statutes than is allowed in criminal statutes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">We are persuaded by an opinion of the Supreme Court of Oregon construing a constitutional provision authorizing judicial discipline for a \u201c \u2018[w]ilful violation of any rule of judicial conduct as shall be established by the Supreme Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Gustafson, </em>305 Or. 655, 657, 756 P.2d 21 (1988). In response to the sanctioned judge\u2019s argument that the term \u201cwilful\u201d required a specific intent to violate a given rule, the Oregon court stated that \u201cignorance of the governing standards of conduct themselves no more excuses judges than those whom they judge.\u201d Id., 660. A judge may be sanctioned for a wilful violation of one of the canons of judicial conduct if he intended to engage in the conduct for which he is sanctioned \u201cwhether or not [he] knows that he violates the rule.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Any other rule would violate the canon of statutory construction that we will avoid constructions that lead to absurd, unworkable or bizarre results. <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 187, 592 A.2d 912 (1991). To require that a judge subjectively have known that his conduct was in violation of the canons of judicial conduct would make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to discipline a judge pursuant to \u00a7 51-51\u00cd (a) (2) for violating those canons. Given the broad and flexible nature of the canons, particularly canons 1 and 2A at issue here, competent proof of a judge\u2019s specific intent to violate those canons would be nearly impossible to obtain in the absence of a previous authoritative interpretation of the canons, presumably from this court, that certain specific conduct was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>violation. Consequently, the first judge to engage in a given conduct that lessens public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary would not be subject to discipline because he would not have been on specific notice that his conduct was prohibited, and he therefore could not be said to have intended to violate the canons. Thereafter, only those judges who engage in the precise conduct of the first judge would be on notice and subject to discipline under \u00a7 51-51i (a) (2). We decline to adopt such an unworkable interpretation of \u00a7 51-5H (a) (2). We conclude, therefore, that a judge is subject to discipline for a \u201cwilful violation of . . . any canon of judicial ethics\u201d as long as he or she intends to engage in the conduct for which he or she is disciplined, whether or not he or she has the specific intent to violate the canon.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Flanagan next contends that the judicial review council should have dismissed the charges against him because, he argues, Ross violated the confidentiality provision of \u00a7 51-517 (a)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> when she disclosed information to two newspaper reporters during the probable cause investigation. At the probable cause hearing, Ross testified that sometime in January, 1996, approximately two months after she filed her complaint with the judicial review council and one month prior to the probable cause hearing, she acted as the second source for a Hartford Courant story concerning the investigation of Flanagan and his alleged acts of impropriety. Ross testified that the reporter had already been aware of the review council\u2019s investigation and that she merely had confirmed elements of the story, which was published in the Hartford Courant on January 20, 1996. After her testimony at the probable cause hearing on February 15, Ross twice was reminded by the chairperson of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>review council that the probable cause proceedings were confidential. Thereafter, on February 21,1996, the New Haven Register reported on a February 20, 1996 interview with Ross, given at a time when the probable cause hearing was being conducted, in which she was quoted detailing aspects of her allegations against Flanagan. Flanagan argues that Ross\u2019 actions in speaking with the press concerning the allegations in her complaint to the review council amounted to a breach of the confidentiality provision of \u00a7 51-51/ (a). He argues that her breach undermined the fairness of the review council\u2019s investigation and required that the review council dismiss all charges against him. He alleges that Ross\u2019 public disclosures to the media \u201cirrevocably tainted\u201d the review council\u2019s deliberations. See <em>In re Zoarski </em>supra, 227 Conn. 794. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Section 51-51/ provides that probable cause hearings shall be confidential and that persons called by the review council for the purpose of providing information shall not disclose their \u201cknowledge of such investigation\u201d to third parties prior to the review council\u2019s probable cause decision. In <em>In re Zoarski, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 794-95, we stated that violations of the confidentiality provision of \u00a7 51-51/ (a) do not require dismissal of the charges lodged against a judge \u201c[i]n the absence of allegation or proof that [the] . . . public disclosures had any impact whatsoever on the fairness of the council\u2019s deliberations . . . .\u201d We found the judge\u2019s argument in <em>Zoarski </em>unpersuasive because he had not proved, or even alleged, that the confidentiality breaches in that case had affected the fairness of the review council\u2019s deliberations in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Flanagan seeks to distinguish the present case from <em>Zoarski </em>on the simple basis that, in the present case, he at least alleges that the confidentiality breaches affected the fairness of the review council\u2019s deliberations. We conclude that the mere allegation that a \u00a7 51-51/ confi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>dentiality breach has affected the fairness of the review council\u2019s deliberations is insufficient, however, to require the dismissal of misconduct charges that have been leveled against a judge. <em>Zoarski </em>dictates that such claims of unfairness need to be supported by something more than mere conclusory assertions before dismissal of the charges is required. The only \u201cproof\u2019 set forth by Flanagan is his unsupported allegation that the deliberative process of the review council was affected by the media publicity concerning Ross\u2019 allegations. While we strongly condemn any effort to influence a decision of the review council through violations of \u00a7 51-51Z, the fact remains that Flanagan stipulated before the review council that he had had an extended sexual relationship with a married court employee. That stipulation contains the only facts necessary to the review council\u2019s censure and are the facts upon which we base our independent review. Even if we assume that Ross violated \u00a7 51-51Z when she spoke with the two newspaper reporters, Flanagan has failed to prove that her violation had any impact \u201con the fairness of the council\u2019s deliberations . . . .\u201d <em>In re </em>Zoarski, supra, 227 Conn. 795. Therefore, his claim that the review council should have dismissed the charges against him is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Flanagan next asserts that the review council improperly considered evidence of a coerced or forced sexual relationship at the formal hearing where, he argues, the testimony should have been limited to testimony pertaining to a consensual sexual relationship. While we agree with Flanagan that any evidence of a forced or coerced sexual relationship should have been excluded from the formal hearing, Flanagan has failed to meet his burden of proving that he was harmed by the admission of any such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The following facts are relevant to this issue. Prior to the formal hearing, Flanagan filed a motion in limine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>seeking to exclude all evidence of a nonconsensual sexual relationship. By an eleven to one vote, the review council denied the motion in limine but noted that Flanagan\u2019s counsel would be free to object to specific testimony as the need arose. After Ross testified that she had been \u201craped\u201d and that her relationship with Flanagan had been \u201cnonconsensual,\u201d Flanagan moved to strike any testimony about nonconsensual sex. After meeting in executive session, the review council granted the motion to strike all previous testimony about nonconsensual sexual relations. To avoid further testimony about nonconsensual sexual relations, the chairperson of the review council stated: \u201cI would consider this a continuing objection and I will continually grant it. The Council will not consider evidence of sexual acts other than as described in the charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Thereafter, Ross again attempted to testify that her relationship with Flanagan had been nonconsensual. Her testimony in that vein consistently was stricken from the record. In response to questions about whether she had had a consensual sexual relationship with Flanagan, Ross twice responded that she had not. Last, Flanagan points to testimony where, before being interrupted by Flanagan\u2019s counsel, Ross twice began to testily that Flanagan had \u201cdemanded\u201d that she go to his house. In response, the chairperson of the review council instructed counsel to wait until the response had been completed before objecting. Ross then amended her response and did not include any allegation that Flanagan had \u201cdemanded\u201d her attendance at his house. Flanagan then objected and was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Even if we were to assume that there was improper testimony before the review council regarding noncon-sensual sexual relations, Flanagan bear's the burden of proving that he was \u201csubstantial [ly] . . . prejudiced\u201d by the testimony. <em>Tomlin </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal </em>Board, 177 Conn. 344, 348, 416 A.2d 1205 (1979). He cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>meet this burden. The same review council that conducted the formal hearing had already heard and rejected extensive testimony from Ross at the probable cause hearing regarding her claims of rape and coercion. The brief, fragmentary, additional testimony from Ross at the formal hearing concerning nonconsensual sexual relations could not conceivably have resulted in substantial prejudice to Flanagan.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Ross was simply not credible on this aspect of her complaint and it is obvious that the review council so found.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">We turn finally to Flanagan\u2019s substantive claim. He argues that, as a matter of law, it is not a violation of either canon 1 or 2A for a judge to have had a three and one-half year consensual affair with a married court reporter regularly assigned to his courtroom over the course of the affair. We disagree. We conclude that his conduct was in violation of canons 1 and 2A, and that public censure, the least severe of the possible sanctions, is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Canon 1 provides that \u201c[a]n independent and honorable judiciary is indispensable to justice in our society. A judge should participate in establishing, maintaining, and enforcing, and should observe, high standards of conduct so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary may be preserved. The provisions of this Code should be construed and applied to further that objective.\u201d Canon 2A provides that \u201c[a] judge should respect and comply with the law and should act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d The official <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>commentary to canon 2, approved and adopted by the judges of the Superior Court, provides in relevant part: \u201cPublic confidence in the judiciary is eroded by irresponsible or improper conduct by judges. A judge must avoid all impropriety and appearance of impropriety. The judge must expect to be the subject of constant public scrutiny. The judge must therefore accept restrictions on his or her conduct that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen and should do so freely and willingly. . . .\u201d When examining a judge\u2019s conduct, we must consider \u201cthe impact it might reasonably have upon knowledgeable observers.\u201d <em>In re Zoar-ski, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 792. We are persuaded that a judge\u2019s three and one-half year affair with a married court reporter who regularly had been assigned to his courtroom is conduct properly prohibited by canons 1 and 2A because it reasonably could lead a knowledgeable observer to question the integrity of the judiciary and to lose confidence therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u201cMembers of the judiciary should be acutely aware that any action they take, whether on or off the bench, must be measured against exacting standards of scrutiny to the end that public perception of the integrity of the judiciary will be preserved .... There must also be a recognition that any actions undertaken in the public sphere reflect, whether designedly or not, upon the prestige of the judiciary. . . . Judges must assiduously avoid those contacts which might create even the appearance of impropriety.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>In the Matter of Lonschein, </em>50 N.Y.2d 569, 572, 408 N.E.2d 901, 430 N.Y.S.2d 571 (1980). \u201cThe duty to avoid creating an appearance of impropriety is one of taking \u2018reasonable precautions\u2019 to avoid having \u2018a negative effect on the confidence of the thinking public in the administration of justice.\u2019 <em>In the Matter of Bonin, </em>375 Mass. 680 [706-707, 378 N.E.2d 669] (1978).\u201d <em>In re Inquiry Concerning a Judge, </em>supra, 788 P.2d 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>In concluding that Flanagan\u2019s relationship with Ross constituted a violation of canons 1 and 2A, we rely on the combination of elements present in this case: (1) Ross was a subordinate of Flanagan\u2019s working regularly in his courtroom and appearing on many occasions in his chambers under circumstances in which one would not normally expect the court reporter to be present; and (2) she was a married woman. Flanagan has emphasized to this court that adultery is no longer a crime in Connecticut and therefore it is not conduct for which a judge may be censured. While it is true that adultery is no longer a criminal offense, the mere fact that conduct is less than criminal does not mean that, if a judge engages in it, he may not diminish public confidence in the judiciary. A judge\u2019s conduct is held to a higher standard than that of the average citizen, and must be beyond reproach, at least when that conduct is directly connected to his professional office and functions. Although it may be difficult to assess the degree to which the public at large now may condone or disapprove of one having a sexual affair with a married person, we are persuaded that, in general, such conduct is regarded as improper when it involves a subordinate in a professional, highly sensitive public context. Moreover, we think it is fair to say that a member of the public, aware of the aforementioned combination of factors, would reasonably conclude that the integrity of the judiciary was likely to be impaired.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We conclude that public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary is compromised by extended sexual relationships between judges and married court reporters assigned to their courtrooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Flanagan notes that in 1991, a proposal was made to amend the official commentary to read, in part, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>\u201c[t]he prohibition against behaving with impropriety or the appearance of impropriety applies to both the professional <em>and personal </em>conduct of ajudge.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Proposed New Code of Judicial Conduct, Connecticut Law Journal, Vol. 52, No. 44 (April 30, 1991). He argues that because the judges failed to adopt that proposal, personal conduct may never form the basis for a violation of canon 2A. Without deciding the merits of that claim, we note that the conduct in this case involved a relationship with a subordinate employed daily in his courtroom. Therefore, this was not purely personal conduct, because it took place with a person with whom Flanagan had an ongoing, daily professional relationship. Indeed, as the review council\u2019s findings indicate, Ross not only served as the court reporter in Flanagan\u2019s courtroom, but \u201con many occasions [she] was present in [Flanagan\u2019s] chambers before the opening of court, during pretrial conferences with counsel present and during recesses,\u201d occasions when one would not normally expect that the court reporter would be present. Thus, the risk of injury to public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary is substantially heightened in this instance as opposed to a case where the affair was with a person unconnected with his daily activities as ajudge of the Superior Court. See <em>In re Miera, </em>supra, 426 N.W.2d 855-56 (distinguishing between sexual advances toward personal friend as opposed to court reporter).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">In fairness to Flanagan, we must emphasize that there was absolutely no evidence in this case that any matter before him was ever actually compromised or mishandled in any way. Rather, the evidence adduced at both the probable cause hearing and at the formal hearing indicates that Flanagan was a conscientious, fair minded and widely respected judge in the eyes of his peers as well as those who appeared before him. While such an otherwise exemplary record is certainly rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>vant to the determination of the appropriate sanction to be imposed, it is not a defense to a violation of the canons of the Code of Judicial Ethics. <em>In the Matter of Greenfield, </em>supra, 76 N.Y.2d 297.
