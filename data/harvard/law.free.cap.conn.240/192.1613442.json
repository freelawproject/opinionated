J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFZ\">The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the trial court properly dismissed the plaintiff Xerox Corporation\u2019s appeal from personal property tax assessments for the tax years 1990 through 1994 on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to provide the Hartford tax assessor (assessor) with sufficient information when it filed its tax lists. We conclude that the plaintiff provided the assessor with sufficient information, and, therefore, that the trial court should have conducted a de novo review to determine the value of the plaintiffs property for assessment puiposes. Because it failed to do so, we reverse the court\u2019s judgment and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">The relevant facts and procedural history are as follows. The plaintiff manufactures office equipment and distributes its products in the city of Hartford and throughout the country through both outright sales and leasing. Because the plaintiff retains ownership of the equipment that it leases in Hartford, it is required to file a list of its personal property for assessment pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>poses with the assessor pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-43<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 12-42.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 12-62a (b) requires each municipality to \u201cassess all property . . . at a uniform rate of seventy per cent of present true and actual value, as determined under section 12-63.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-63<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides that the present true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>and actual value of property is its fair market value.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">In 1978, the plaintiff argued in <em>Xerox Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>175 Conn. 301, 303, 397 A.2d 1367 (1978), that the income capitalization method of valuation was the proper method for determining the fair market value of its leased equipment in Hartford.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At that time, the assessor\u2019s method of determining the fair market value of the plaintiffs leased equipment involved applying a fixed rate of depreciation, depending on the age of the equipment, to the published list price for each type and model of the plaintiffs equipment. Id., 303. The trial court in that case found as a fact that during the tax years then at issue the plaintiff never sold any of its products within the state of Connecticut for less than the published list price, which was fixed and maintained by the plaintiff. Id., 305. After noting that the fair market value of property is the price that would result from fair negotiations between a willing seller and a willing buyer, we concluded that, under the circumstances, the assessor\u2019s method of valuing the plaintiffs equipment was proper. Id., 305-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Since our decision in <em>Xerox Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 175 Conn. 301, the plaintiff and the assessor have agreed on the methodology for determining the fair market value of the plaintiffs leased equipment in Hartford \u2014 specifically, a fixed rate of depreciation, depending on the age of the equipment, is applied to the actual retail selling price of the plaintiffs equipment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>when new.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That is, the starting point for the determination of the value of each piece of the plaintiffs leased equipment is the price that a buyer would have to pay in the market to purchase the same piece of equipment. The plaintiff and the assessor disagree, however, on how to determine the actual retail selling price of the plaintiffs products from 1990 through 1994. The plaintiff claims that the marketplace has changed dramatically since the decision in <em>Xerox Corp. </em>because of competition, and that currently it never sells its equipment for the published list price but always for a price significantly below the list price.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a result of this change in the marketplace, the plaintiff claims that the assessor\u2019s use of the plaintiffs published list prices as the starting point for the determination of the value of the plaintiffs leased equipment overvalues the equipment, which naturally results in an overassessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The record reveals that in 1982 the plaintiff began to study data collected from its financial records to determine the actual retail selling prices of its equipment. In its initial phases, the study accounted for only actual cash discounts given off the list prices to determine the actual selling prices. The plaintiff calculated the average discount on its products by totaling the actual selling prices of the equipment it sold, and dividing that figure by the total list prices for the same equipment. The result was a weighted average discount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>accounting for every sale of the plaintiffs equipment in the United States.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiff compiled the market data every twelve months. In the late 1980s, the plaintiff began adding noncash discounts into the computation of the national average discount on its products.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The data reflecting noncash discounts were retrieved from the same financial records that contained the list prices and actual retail selling prices of the plaintiffs equipment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The results of this study were compiled in an \u201ceffective price study\u201d that totaled cash discounts and noncash discounts to determine an average weighted annual discount based on sales in the United States of all the plaintiffs equipment for the preceding twelve month period.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">For the 1990 tax year, the plaintiff submitted a personal property tax list to the assessor in which it deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>mined the actual market value, or \u201cfull value,\u201d of its equipment when new by applying the total average weighted discount from the \u201ceffective price study\u201d to the published list prices of its leased equipment in Hartford. On its 1990 list, the plaintiff asserted that the \u201cfull value\u201d of its leased equipment in Hartford was $16,742,737, and that the \u201cnet value\u201d of its equipment, after the depreciation schedule was applied, was $10,274,058. Along with the 1990 list, the plaintiff submitted a letter, addressed to all Connecticut assessors, summarizing and explaining the \u201ceffective price study\u201d and the meaning of the terms \u201cfull value\u201d and \u201cnet value.\u201d The plaintiff also submitted charts that compared the list price for equipment models with the \u201ceffective price,\u201d which was the actual cash price paid by customers, for the same models. The charts accounted for the percentage discount, or difference, between the list price and actual sales price, weighted by activity. According to the charts, the average cash discount from the list price on the plaintiffs equipment sold in the United States was 17 percent. In addition, the plaintiff submitted a description of the noncash discounts given on the equipment it sold in the United States.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The plaintiff submitted a chart that summarized the noncash discounts given throughout the year and calculated the total average noncash discount on its equipment to be 14 percent. The plaintiff applied a total 31 percent discount to the list prices of its leased equipment in Hartford, arriving at what it considered the fair market value of that equipment when new, by adding together the 17 percent national average cash discount and the 14 percent national average noncash discount.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>The assessor did not accept the plaintiffs valuation of its equipment for 1990. After learning that the plaintiff had applied a 31 percent discount to its list prices to obtain what it termed the \u201cfull value\u201d of its equipment, the assessor added the 31 percent discount back into the \u201cnet value\u201d figure asserted by the plaintiff, thus restoring the list prices, to obtain a total fair market valuation of the plaintiffs equipment, less depreciation, of $14,670,768, some $4,396,710 more than the \u201cnet value\u201d placed on the equipment by the plaintiff.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plaintiff appealed the 1990 assessment, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-111,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to the defendant board of tax review for the city of Hartford (board), which refused to change the assessments. The plaintiff then appealed to the Superior Court, pursuant to General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-118<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and 12-117a.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The plaintiff later amended its complaint to include in its appeal its personal property tax assessments for the years 1991 through 1994.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>On June 8 and 9, 1995, the Superior Court heard evidence pertaining to the plaintiffs appeal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The plaintiff presented several witnesses whose testimony explained the nature of the plaintiffs business and the methodologies and processes that the plaintiff used in compiling its personal property tax lists for the tax years at issue. The plaintiff also presented two expert witnesses who testified to the validity among appraisal experts of the valuation methodologies used by the plaintiff in its effective price study and in calculating fair market value on its tax lists. Finally, the plaintiff submitted various items of documentary evidence to support its valuation claim, and the deposition of one of its employees, Rosemary Ciaschi, who testified that she never sold the plaintiffs products to a commercial customer for the published list price. Ciaschi testified in her deposition that the typical discount given to commercial customers on the plaintiffs products ranged from 10 to 40 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In response, the defendant presented two witnesses, Richard K. Wandy and Joseph Dakers, Sr., respectively the former and present chief assessment technicians responsible for the city of Hartford\u2019s personal property tax list. The bulk of the testimony provided by Wandy and Dakers concerned the quantum of information that the plaintiff had provided or had failed to provide to the assessor to support its claimed valuation of the property. The thrust of their testimony was that the assessor had not accepted the plaintiffs estimates of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>fair market value because the plaintiff had not provided the assessor with the raw data \u2014 for example, sales invoices and other documentation \u2014 used in the effective price study to determine the national average cash and noncash discounts. Although they acknowledged that the effective price study was a national study that reflected sales of approximately $1,084,120,683, they testified that the plaintiff should have provided the assessor with sales documentation for sales within the city of Hartford, or within the state of Connecticut. Although they asserted that such information would have aided them in substantiating the plaintiffs estimates of fair market value, they testified that during their respective tenures, the assessor had never made a formal written request that the plaintiff provide such information.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">In addition, both Wandy and Dakers testified that the plaintiff had failed to provide the assessor with certain information requested on the back of the assessment form sent to the plaintiff, specifically the start and end dates of the leases and the monthly contract rent on the plaintiffs equipment in Hartford.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Wandy testified that he had sent a letter to the plaintiff in 1992 requesting that the plaintiff supply the lease information requested on the back of the form.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> He testified that he had sought this information in order to double check the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>estimates of fair market value.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In a letter sent to the assessor in response to the assessor\u2019s 1992 letter, the plaintiff stated that the lease start and end dates and monthly contract rent information was not \u201cavailable in the normal course of business\u201d because it was not contained in the plaintiffs \u201cheadquarters equipment control database.\u201d Oscar Holloway, the plaintiff\u2019s manager of compliance and audit,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> testified that, in order to retrieve this information, the plaintiff would have had to go to each separate lessee\u2019s customer file to obtain information from the individual leases. The plaintiffs 1992 letter further stated: \u201cIt is Xerox\u2019 understanding this information is not used by the Assessor for valuation purposes and therefore would not impact the Assessor\u2019s valuation process.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The record does not reveal a response to the plaintiffs letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">After trial, the court dismissed the plaintiffs appeal, concluding that \u201cthe plaintiff did not provide the assessor with sufficient information to support its claimed discount.\u201d The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred its appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">This appeal raises the issue of how much information a taxpayer must provide to an assessor in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>obtain a de novo judicial review of an assessment in the Superior Court. See <em>Newbury Commons Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>226 Conn. 92, 103-104, 626 A.2d 1292 (1993) (taxpayer entitled to de novo review of assessment by Superior Court). We conclude that the plaintiff provided the assessor with sufficient information to entitle it to a de novo judicial review of the assessor\u2019s valuation and resulting tax assessment, and that the trial court improperly dismissed the plaintiffs appeal without performing the required review.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">It is undisputed that, in an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 12-117a,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the trial court \u201ctries the matter de novo and the ultimate question is the ascertainment of the true and actual value of the [taxpayer\u2019s] property.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Newbury Commons Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 104; <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>169 Conn. 129, 130-31, 362 A.2d 914 (1975). At the de novo proceeding, the taxpayer bears the burden of establishing that the assessor has overassessed its property. <em>New Haven Water Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>166 Conn. 232, 234, 348 A.2d 641 (1974); see also <em>Stamford Apartments Co. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>203 Conn. 586, 590, 525 A.2d 1327 (1987); <em>Burritt Mutual Savings Bank </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>146 Conn. 669, 675, 154 A.2d 608 (1959). The trier of fact must arrive \u201cat his own conclusions as to the value of [the taxpayer\u2019s property] by weighing the opinion of the appraisers, the claims of the parties in light of all the circumstances in evidence bearing on value, and his own general knowledge of the elements going to establish value . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Newbury Commons Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 105; <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">It is also undisputed, however, that the taxpayer bears the burden of supplying certain information to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>assessor before the taxpayer is entitled to a de novo judicial review of a tax assessment. We have formulated that duty as follows: \u201cIt is the duty of each taxpayer, as a personal obligation, to file with the assessors a list of his taxable property and <em>furnish the facts upon which valuations may be based. . . </em>. If he fails to do so, the assessors are only required to act upon the best information [they] can obtain . . . and the taxpayer cannot justly complain if the assessors, acting in good faith, make an error in judgment in listing and valuing his property.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Northeast Datacom, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wallingford, </em>212 Conn. 639, 649, 563 A.2d 688 (1989), quoting <em>Cooley Chevrolet Co. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>146 Conn. 165, 169, 148 A.2d 327 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">On occasion, we have affirmed decisions dismissing taxpayer appeals because the taxpayer failed to provide the assessor with sufficient information. See <em>IBM Credit Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>227 Conn. 826, 829, 633 A.2d 294 (1993) (taxpayer cannot contest, in Superior Court, assessor\u2019s use of certain depreciation schedule for property valuation where taxpayer never provided assessor with alternative depreciation schedule); <em>Northeast Datacom, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wallingford, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 647-49 (taxpayer cannot contest assessment in Superior Court where taxpayer failed to file list of taxable property). The defendant argues, primarily on the basis of <em>IBM Credit Corp. </em>and <em>Northeast Datacom, Inc., </em>that the trial court properly dismissed the plaintiffs appeal without deciding the valuation issue because the plaintiff failed to satisfy its burden of furnishing \u201cthe facts upon which valuations may be based\u201d when it failed to provide the assessor with the lease start and end dates, monthly contract rent, and a sampling of the raw data used in the effective price study. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>In our view, the plaintiff satisfied its burden of providing \u201cthe facts upon which valuations may be based,\u201d thereby triggering its right to a de novo judicial review of the valuation and tax assessment, by submitting to the assessor a list of its taxable personal property with estimates of the fair market value of that property computed according to the plaintiffs valuation methodology.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The plaintiffs only statutory obligation, pursuant to \u00a7 12-43, was to file a list of its personal property containing its post office and street addresses. See footnote 1. In addition, we believe <em>IBM Credit Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 827-29, requires the taxpayer to submit to the assessor its own estimate of fair market value, computed according to the valuation methodology the taxpayer believes appropriate, in order to secure de novo review in the Superior Court of the assessor\u2019s valuation and resulting assessment. In <em>IBM Credit Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 827, the taxpayer filed a list of its personal property, with estimates of the fair market value of that property, utilizing the depreciation schedule on the back of the assessment form. The assessor accepted the taxpayer\u2019s estimates of fair market value and assessed the taxpayer\u2019s property on the basis of those estimates. Id., 827. The taxpayer later argued, however, that the depreciation schedule on the back of the assessment form did not accurately reflect the fair market value of two pieces of equipment, resulting in an overassessment. Id., 828. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the taxpayer\u2019s appeal because the taxpayer had failed to alert the assessor, when it filed its tax list, of its view that the depreciation schedule on the back of the form was inappropriate for certain pieces of its equipment. Id., 828-29. We concluded that the taxpayer could not challenge the assessor\u2019s valuation and assessment in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Superior Court because the assessor had accepted the estimates of fair market value that the taxpayer had provided. Id., 827-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In the present case, the plaintiff satisfied its statutory obligations, as well as its obligations under <em>IBM Credit Corp. </em>and <em>Northeast Datacom, Inc., </em>by submitting to the assessor a list of its taxable personal property with estimates of the fair market value of that property computed according to what it believed to be the appropriate valuation methodology. In addition, the plaintiff provided the assessor with a summary of its effective price study, describing the methodology it used to compute the values on its list, as well as charts that listed and totaled the national average cash and noncash discounts given on each different equipment model throughout the year. The distinguishing feature between the present case and <em>IBM Credit Corp. </em>is that, in the present case, the assessor did not accept the estimates of fair market value provided by the taxpayer. The assessor\u2019s decision not to accept the plaintiffs estimates of fair market value does not, however, affect the plaintiffs right to a de novo judicial review of the valuation and assessment. The plaintiff, in effect, avoided the pitfall of <em>IBM Credit Corp. </em>by providing the assessor, in the first instance, with an estimate of fair market value computed according to its methodology, rather than waiting until after the assessment to challenge the assessor\u2019s methodology and assert its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The defendant argues that, by failing to provide the assessor with the lease start and end dates, monthly contract rent, and raw data used in the effective price study, the plaintiff was able \u201cto establish its own tax burden without a real possibility of contradiction.\u201d We disagree. The assessor possessed statutory authority to compel the plaintiff to produce such information if it was deemed necessary, but failed to use that authority. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 12-53<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> requires taxpayers, upon written notice by the assessor, to appear at a hearing before the assessor \u201cwith books of account, papers, documents and other records for examination under oath relative to\u201d the valuation of any property, whenever \u201cthe assessor . . . [is] unable to determine the value of any property without the assistance of the owner . . . .\u201d The assessor, however, never made a request for information, pursuant to \u00a7 12-53, or provided the plaintiff with the notice required thereby.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> See footnote 26. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>ingly, we need not decide what effect a taxpayer\u2019s refusal to comply with a request pursuant to \u00a7 12-53 might have on the scope of the Superior Court\u2019s review of an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In addition, we note that, before the board may reduce a taxpayer\u2019s list, General Statutes \u00a7 12-113<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> requires the taxpayer to appear before the board and \u201coffer or consent to be sworn before it and answer all questions touching his taxable property situated in the town.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Moreover, once the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court, the board was afforded all the traditional discoveiy rights and document production lights possessed by civil litigants. In our view, the assessor had an opportunity to challenge the plaintiff\u2019s methodologies and computations and to require the plaintiff to produce information relative to value at each stage of the assessment process. The assessor\u2019s failure to take advantage of those opportunities does not foil the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>tiffs right to a de novo judicial review of the valuation and assessment, given the quantum of information the plaintiff did present.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Because the plaintiff provided the assessor with sufficient information to obtain a de novo review of the assessor\u2019s valuation, the trial court should have determined, on the basis of the evidence before it, whether the plaintiff had met its burden of proving that the assessor had overvalued the plaintiffs property. See <em>Newbury Commons Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 104; <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 169 Conn. 130-31; <em>Hutensky </em>v. <em>Avon, </em>163 Conn. 433, 436, 311 A.2d 92 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-43 provides in relevant part: \u201cProperty of nonresidents. <em>All owners of real estate, or of tangible personal property located in any town </em>for three months or more during the assessment year immediately preceding any assessment day, who are nonresidents of such town, <em>shall file lists of such real estate and personal property with the assessors of the town </em>in which the same is located on such assessment day, if located in such town for three months or more in such year, otherwise, in the town in which such property is located for the three months or more in such year nearest to such assessment day, under the same provisions as apply to residents, and such personal property shall not be liable to taxation in any other town in this state. <em>The list of each nonresident taxpayer shall contain his post-office and street address.

Accordingly, the plaintiff now permits its sales representatives to give customers discounts from its published list prices. On the basis of costs, history, competition, and preset target and minimum prices, the plaintiffs sales representatives negotiate the price to meet the market conditions. The plaintiffs sales information is reported nationally, via a computer database, and a discount range, commonly 20 to 30 percent below the list price, is set throughout the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b219-6\"> For example, if the plaintiff sold two pieces of equipment nationwide \u2014 the first piece of equipment, with a list price of $1000, sold for $700, after accounting for cash and noncash discounts, and the second piece of equipment, with a list price of 8100,000, sold for $90,000, after accounting for cash and noncash discounts \u2014 the computation of the national weighted average discount would be as follows: First, the list prices of the two pieces of equipment would be added to arrive at a total list price of $101,000 (8100,000 + S1000 = $101,000). Next, the actual selling prices of the two pieces of equipment would be added to arrive at a total actual selling pxice of $90,700 ($90,000 + S700 = $90,700). Finally, the total actual retail selling price would be divided by the total list price to arrive at a percentage of 89.8 percent ($90,700 $101,000 = .898 percent), which is equivalent to a weighted average percentage of the list price for which the equipment sold. In other words, the weighted <em>average </em>discount on the two pieces of equipment was 10.2 percent (100 percent - 89.8 percent = 10.2 percent). The $100,000 piece of equipment receives more weight through this method of computing averages because it constitutes more of the total list price and total actual retail selling price than the $1000 piece of equipment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\"> Noncash discounts were discounts given to the customer in a form other than cash, such as below market financing, free services, prepayment of monthly invoice charges, free training classes, and bonus goods.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b219-9\"> The plaintiff claimed that its financial division assigned to noncash discounts values based on published list prices and other factors. For example, if the published list price for one month of free service was $400, and a sales representative struck a deal with a customer whereby the customer would receive one month of free service, the value of $400 was assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>as a noncash discount on that particular sale. In determining the actual retail selling price of the plaintiffs equipment, the engineers of the effective price study subtracted the $400 value for the free service from the actual cash amount paid for the equipment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b220-6\"> See footnote 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b220-7\"> Each of these averages was a weighted average that accounted for every sale of the plaintiffs equipment in the United States. See footnote 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b221-5\"> In addition, the assessor made additions and subtractions to the \u2018Tull value\u201d and \u201cnet value\u201d figures asserted by the plaintiff to account for equipment that the plaintiff should have, but did not, include in its property list, and equipment that the plaintiff incorrectly included in its list. The plaintiff never disputed the additions and subtractions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b221-9\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 12-111 provides in relevant part: \u201cAppeals to board of tax review.
