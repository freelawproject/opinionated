In an action for a declaratory judgment to quiet title against the named defendant, Donna E. HiUebrand,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the plaintiff, Richard E. Stein, sought judicial invalidation of a mortgage on a one-half interest in a parcel of real property that he and his brother, David Stein, had owned as tenants in common. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the defendant. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">The trial court, <em>Tobin, J., </em>found the following facts, which are largely undisputed. In December, 1982, the defendant was granted a decree of dissolution of marriage from David Stein, her husband. As part of the dissolution award, the dissolution court, <em>Ryan, J., </em>ordered David Stein to pay the defendant $1400 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>month as unallocated alimony and support until March, 1998, at which time these monetary obligations would be reviewed. Exercising the authority conferred by General Statutes \u00a7 \u00a7 46b-82 and 46b-84,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the dissolution court further ordered David Stein, as security for his obligations, to mortgage to the defendant his one-half interest in certain real property located in Westport that he then owned as a tenant in common with the plaintiff. The plaintiff was present as a courtroom observer on December 1, 1982, when Judge Ryan orally issued this order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge Tobin expressly found: \u201c[Judge Ryan], in open court, asked Richard [Stein] if he consented to the mortgage being placed on the Westport property and he responded affirmatively.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">In accordance with Judge Ryan\u2019s order, David Stein executed, in favor of the defendant, a mortgage deed that was promptly recorded in the Westport land records. The deed explicitly referenced the case num<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>ber of the dissolution decree and the court where it could be located. The deed further authorized the defendant to foreclose on the mortgage in the event of a default in David Stein\u2019s alimony and support payments. In June, 1987, David Stein quitclaimed his one-half interest in the Westport property to the plaintiff for its fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The plaintiff subsequently filed the present action, seeking to invalidate the defendant\u2019s mortgage on two principal grounds. He alleged that the dissolution court had no authority to order the execution of any mortgage because the postjudgment procedure statutes; General Statutes, c. 906; do not authorize the use of a mortgage to secure future alimony and support payments. In the alternative, he also argued that the particular mortgage ordered by the dissolution court in this case was unenforceable because its terms are too indefinite. The trial court, <em>Tobin, J., </em>rejected both claims. It concluded that the postjudgment remedies statutes do not govern court-ordered security for alimony and support, and it construed existing case law to validate a mortgage deed, such as the one here at issue, that affords a title searcher adequate information to discover the terms of the underlying obligation. See <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>210 Conn. 221, 228, 554 A.2d 735 (1989). Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">On appeal, the plaintiff has elaborated on the arguments presented at trial. He first claims that the defendant\u2019s mortgage was invalid, ab initio, because: (1) \u00a7 46b-82 does not authorize a dissolution court to secure future alimony payments through the use of a mortgage; or, alternatively, (2) the postjudgment lien statutes preclude the exercise of any such authority under \u00a7 46b-82. He also claims that, even if the dissolution court had the authority to order the execution of a mortgage, the terms of the mortgage in this case are too uncertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>to be enforceable, because the mortgage does not state either the amount of the indebtedness or the final due date thereof. Finally, he claims that the trial court improperly found that he had consented to the encumbrance of the Westport property. We are unpersuaded by these arguments and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">We begin our review of the plaintiffs claims by considering his two attacks on the authority of a dissolution court to order one former spouse to execute a mortgage to secure an alimony and support obligation to the other former spouse. These jurisdictional challenges put into question the extent to which \u00a7 46b~82 authorizes an order for such security and the extent to which chapter 906 precludes such an order. We read these statutes to support the action of the dissolution court in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">The plaintiffs first argument is that \u00a7 46b-82 does not authorize a dissolution court to order a real property mortgage as security for future alimony payments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a matter of statutory construction, the plaintiff advances the view that the legislature did not intend to permit dissolution judgments \u201cto facilitate a lifetime encumbrance on real estate.\u201d We disagree with this restrictive interpretation of \u00a7 46b-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">In accordance with established principles of statutory construction, our paramount objective is \u201cto ascertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vaillancourt </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>224 Conn. 382, 390, 618 A.2d 1340 (1993). If the words of a statute are unambiguous, we assume that they express the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 193, 530 A.2d 171 (1987). In the event of textual ambiguity, we discern such intent by also looking to legislative history, legislative policy and the relationship of the statute at issue to existing legislation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>McVeigh, </em>224 Conn. 593, 607, 620 A.2d 133 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Section 46b-82 provides that \u201cthe superior court may order either of the parties [to a marriage dissolution action] to pay alimony to the other .... The order may direct that security be given therefor on such terms as the court may deem desirable . . . .\u201d This statute was enacted in 1973 as part of a comprehensive modernization of divorce laws in this state.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Public Acts 1973, No. 73-373; see 16 H.R. Proc., Pt. 5, 1973 Sess., pp. 1929-30, remarks of Representative John N. DeMerell. The predecessor to \u00a7 46b-82 did not contain a similar security provision. See General Statutes (1958 Rev.) \u00a7 46-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In our view, the plain language of \u00a7 46b-82 evinces the legislature\u2019s intent to include real property within the scope of property interests that may serve as security for the payment of alimony. Nothing in the text of the statute supports a more limited definition of the word \u201csecurity.\u201d Had the legislature meant this term to exclude real property, it easily could have so provided. We will not impute to the legislature an intent to limit this term where such intent does not otherwise appear in the language of the statute. <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>235 Conn. 185, 195, 663 A.2d 1001 (1995); see also <em>Dos Santos </em>v. <em>F.D. Rich Construction Co., </em>233 Conn. 14, 20, 658 A.2d 83 (1995) (reviewing courts are confined to language actually used in statute). Moreover, the statutory language authorizing security \u201con such terms as the court may deem desirable\u201d underlines the legislature\u2019s intent to confer \u201cbroad judicial discretion\u201d on a dissolution court to frame a remedial order that takes account of all the resources available to the parties. <em>Holley </em>v. <em>Holley, </em>194 Conn. 25, 34, 478 A.2d 1000 (1984) (recognizing broad judicial discretion under \u00a7 46b-82). This statutory language is, on its face, inconsistent with a legislative intent to limit the forms of property to which a court; may look as security for the obligations it imposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">If we were to venture beyond the words of the statute, <em>nothing </em>in the history of the divorce reform legislation indicates that the legislature intended a more limited reading of the security provisions in \u00a7 46b-82. \u201cAlthough we have on occasion relied in part on legislative history to narrow what might otherwise be regarded as broad statutory language . . . the legislative history is not compelling enough to persuade us to do so in the present case.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Stratford </em>v. <em>State Board of Mediation &amp; Arbitration, </em>239 Conn. 32, 42-43, 681 A.2d 281 (1996). In fact, the legislative history reveals that these provisions were adopted in response to concerns that former spouses were frequently avoiding their alimony and support obligations. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 1, 1973 Sess., pp. 233-37, remarks of Barbara Lifton. To interpret the security language in \u00a7 46b-82 to exclude real property would, therefore, defeat the remedial purpose of this legislation by removing a stationary, valuable, and ascertainable form of property from the class of available security. This we decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>We conclude, accordingly, that the dissolution court had the authority under \u00a7 46b-82 to order David Stein to execute a real property mortgage in favor of the defendant as security for his alimony obligations. See <em>Devlin </em>v. <em>Wiener, </em>232 Conn. 550, 557, 656 A.2d 664 (1995) (mortgage can secure performance as well as payment on debt).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court\u2019s authority to order a mortgage as security for family obligations is limited by the statutes pertaining to postjudgment procedures. See General Statutes c. 906, \u00a7\u00a7 52-350a through 52-400f. He claims that the determination of an arrearage of alimony and support \u201ccan only occur postjudgment\u201d and he infers therefrom that collection of an arrearage must be governed by the postjudgment procedures specified in chapter 906. Chapter 906 permits the execution and foreclosure of a lien against a judgment debtor\u2019s property only in the event ajudgment creditor obtains an unsatisfied \u201cmoney judgment.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 52-350a (15). Section 52-350a (13), which defines \u201cmoney judgment,\u201d excludes from this definition a \u201cfamily support judgment.\u201d Section 52-350a (7), in turn, defines \u201cfamily support judgment\u201d to include \u201ca judgment, order or decree of the superior court for payment of a legal obligation for support or alimony to a spouse . . . .\u201d The plaintiff contends that, because these statutes do not allow a party to obtain a postjudgment lien to secure alimony or support payments, the dissolution court violated chapter 906 by ordering David Stein to mortgage his property to secure these payments. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">In construing these statutes, in addition to the principles referred to above; see part I A; <em>Vaillancourt </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 390-91; we rely on the proposition that \u201c[t]he legislature is pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>sumed to be aware and to have knowledge of all existing statutes and the effect which its own action or nonaction may have on them.\u201d <em>Windham First Taxing District </em>v. <em>Windham, </em>208 Conn. 543, 554, 546 A.2d 226 (1988). \u201cWhere, as here, more than one statute is involved, we [also] presume that the legislature intended them to be read together to create a harmonious body of law . . . .\u201d <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Tonken, </em>192 Conn. 581, 589, 473 A.2d 782 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">The plaintiffs argument mistakenly assumes that the defendant\u2019s rights under her mortgage are governed by the postjudgment procedure statutes. Section 52-350a (15) specifies, in relevant part, that a \u201cpostjudgment procedure\u201d involves \u201ca placing of a <em>lien </em>on property [or] a modification or discharge of a <em>lien </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Neither that section nor any other section in chapter 906 indicates that the postjudgment procedures serve to limit the creation or the enforcement of a prejudgment mortgage. Chapter 906, therefore, does not address a dissolution court\u2019s authority to order a <em>mortgage </em>to secure alimony and support obligations or a trial court\u2019s authority to conduct a <em>mortgage </em>foreclosure proceeding in satisfaction of those obligations. We presume that the legislature uses the terms \u201cmortgage\u201d and \u201clien\u201d to connote their different legal meanings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>See, e.g., General Statutes c. 846 (mortgages) and General Statutes c. 847 (liens).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Chapter 906, moreover, applies only in the context of <em>postjudgment </em>procedures. In contrast, the order directing David Stein to mortgage his property as security for future obligations occurred <em>prior </em>to any judgment of amounts owing. The plaintiff claims that, for the defendant to \u201clevy\u201d on the Westport property, the trial court will eventually have to reduce the amount of any arrearage to a \u201cmoney judgment,\u201d which would then bring \u201cthis matter squarely within the ambit\u201d of the exclusions in chapter 906. Again, the plaintiff fails to recognize that, in the event David Stein fails to satisfy his obligations, the defendant, as the mortgagee of the Westport property, would not have to obtain a \u201cmoney judgment\u201d but could instead immediately institute/o?-e-<em>closure proceedings </em>on the property. These foreclosure proceedings would not take place \u201cpostjudgment\u201d as that term is used in chapter 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">We conclude, accordingly, that the provisions of chapter 906 relating to postjudgment procedures are not applicable to this case and, therefore, did not serve to limit the authority of the dissolution court to order David Stein to mortgage the Westport property as security for alimony and support obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">The plaintiffs second claim is that, even if the mortgage was valid as between David Stein and the defendant, it is not valid as to a third party purchaser of the mortgaged property like himself. He contends, as a matter of law, that the terms of the mortgage deed are too indefinite to be enforceable. He further contends, as a matter of fact, that the trial court improperly found that he had consented to be bound by the mortgage. We disagree with both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">In his argument regarding the impermissible vagueness of the mortgage deed executed by David Stein, the plaintiff reminds us that the underlying debt secured by the mortgage ultimately depends upon both David Stein\u2019s ability to meet his alimony and support obligations and the trial court\u2019s future willingness or unwillingness to modify those obligations. In light of these uncertainties, he contends that no degree of \u201c[p]rudence and diligence\u201d would have enabled him to determine the maximum amount or maximum duration of the underlying debt. Such a mortgage, he claims, must be invalid. We are unpersuaded. We conclude that the plaintiff, having knowingly acquiesced to the terms of the mortgage, is not merely a third party to that mortgage. As a result, he is bound by its terms, regardless of their alleged vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Under our common law, a valid mortgage deed must provide \u201c \u2018reasonable notice\u2019 to <em>third parlies </em>of the obligation that is secured.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 227. We have defined \u201creasonable notice\u201d as \u201cnotice of the nature and amount of the encumbrance which the mortgagor intends to place upon the land.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dart &amp; Bogue Co. </em>v. <em>Slosberg, </em>202 Conn. 566, 579, 522 A.2d 763 (1987). \u201cThe purpose of such \u2018reasonable notice\u2019 is to prevent parties <em>that are not privy to the transaction </em>from being defrauded or misled.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The plaintiff contends that the mortgage deed in this case could never provide a third party with reasonable notice of the debt obligation because that obligation, as referenced in the mortgage deed, remains uncertain until a court reduces David Stein\u2019s arrearages to a fixed sum. This argument is unavailing to the plaintiff because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>he is not a stranger to the mortgage. The trial court, <em>Tobin, J., </em>found that the plaintiff was present in court on the day Judge Ryan orally rendered his dissolution decree and that Judge Ryan explicitly asked the plaintiff whether he consented to the use of a mortgage to secure David Stein\u2019s alimony and support obligations. At this point, the plaintiff could have objected to the mortgage or to the perceived indefiniteness of the underlying debt. He did not. It would be speculative to assume that, without the plaintiffs consent, Judge Ryan would have ordered David Stein to mortgage the Westport property that the two brothers owned as tenants in common. A person who participates in the structuring of a mortgage, ab initio, is not an innocent third party and is not entitled to the protection of the reasonable notice requirements. See <em>Burt\u2019s Spirit Shop, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ridgway, </em>215 Conn. 355, 366, 576 A.2d 1267 (1990); <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">It follows from this conclusion that the plaintiff is bound by the terms of the mortgage, regardless of their potential uncertainties. As a form of contractual arrangement, a mortgage may secure indefinite obligations that, although potentially invalid as to third party encumbrancers without notice, are nevertheless valid as to the original parties. See <em>Devlin </em>v. <em>Wiener, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 557 (mortgage can secure performance obligations between original parties); see also <em>Augeri </em>v. <em>C. F. Wooding Co., </em>173 Conn. 426, 430, 378 A.2d 538 (1977) (courts reluctant to reject contract for uncertainty). Those who are intimately connected with the negotia-. tion and execution of a mortgage risk being assimilated to the rights and obligations of the original encum-brancer. This is one such instance. Just as David Stein could not challenge the validity of the mortgage as it applied to him, so too the plaintiff cannot now attack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>the mortgage on the basis of terms to which he, himself, agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Our holding in this case is necessarily limited to circumstances in which a purchaser of mortgaged property participates, in some critical way, in the original mortgage transaction. Accordingly, we express no opinion on whether the defendant\u2019s mortgage would have been valid as to an innocent third party.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Finally, we address the plaintiffs claim that the trial court made an erroneous finding of fact with respect to his participation in the dissolution proceedings on December 1, 1982. The plaintiff does not deny that he was in the courtroom on that day, or that Judge Ryan inquired whether he would consent to the mortgage. He argues, instead, that his consent was not knowingly given because he did not understand the implications of the question that he answered and was not afforded the opportunity to consult counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">It is axiomatic that a trial court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed only for clear error. \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>24 Leggett Street Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Beacon Industries, Inc., </em>239 Conn. 284, 301, 685 A.2d 305 (1996). The plaintiff, as the appellant, has the responsibility to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>assist us in this review by ensuring that the rationale underlying the trial court\u2019s findings adequately appears in the appellate record.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Steve Viglione Sheet Metal Co. </em>v. <em>Sakonchick, </em>190 Conn. 707, 714, 462 A.2d 1037 (1983); see also Practice Book \u00a7 4051 (appellant may seek articulation from trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The trial court, <em>Tobin, J., </em>acknowledged that the plaintiff claimed that he had been \u201ctotally unaware of the circumstances and effect of the mortgage.\u201d Nonetheless, the court found that the plaintiff had consented to the granting of the mortgage and that he had taken the quitclaim deed from his brother \u201cknowing full well the terms of the mortgage.\u201d The plaintiff did not ask the trial court to articulate further the basis on which the court made this finding. See Practice Book \u00a7 4051. On this state of the record, we cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Steve Viglione Sheet Metal Co. </em>v. <em>Sakonchick, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-9\"> David Stein was also named as a defendant. He was defaulted, however, for failure to appear and has not participated in this appeal. We will, therefore, refer to HiUebrand as the sole defendant in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 provides in relevant part: \u201cAlimony.

This conclusion is buttressed by the legislature\u2019s enactment, in 1989, of \u00a7 46b-84 (e) (now subsection [f]), which explicitly authorizes a trial court to order an obligor to secure child support payments by \u201cexecut[ing] a bond or postpng] other security sufficient to perform such order for support . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b62-8\"> This section was originally enacted as General Statutes \u00a7 46-52 and was subsequently transferred to \u00a7 46b-82.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b65-5\"> Although these terms are frequently conflated, the distinction between a mortgage and a judgment lien is more than semantic. A mortgage is a form of contract and, under Connecticut law, immediately vests legal title in the mortgagee and equitable title in the mortgagor. See <em>Red Rooster Construction Co. </em>v. <em>River </em>Associates, <em>Inc., </em>224 Conn. 563, 569, 620 A.2d 118 (1993). Foreclosure on a mortgage, moreover, is an equitable action that \u201cprecludes further proceedings on the underlying debt\u201d and requires an unsatisfied mortgagee to pursue his rights through a deficiency judgment. <em>Fairfield Plumbing &amp; Heating Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>Kosa, </em>220 Conn. 643, 649, 600 A.2d 1 (1991). A judgment lien, on the other hand, results from the unilateral act of a creditor and does not vest him with legal title to the subjectproperty. <em>Cf. First Constitution Bank v. Harbor Village Ltd. Partnership, </em>230 Conn. 807, 821, 646 A.2d 812 (1994). Foreclosure of a judgment lien is an action at law that does not extinguish the underlying debt. See <em>Fairfield Plumbing &amp; Heating Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>Kosa, </em>supra, 649.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b69-8\"> In the future, a dissolution court considering an order for the execution of a mortgage to secure family obligations may be well advised to include provisions to ensure that the mortgage deed specifies (or references other documents that specify), to the extent possible, the maximum potential amount of alimony or support arrearage and the maximum possible duration of the alimony or support obligations. In this way, a subsequent title searcher can become fully apprised of the extent to which mortgaged property is encumbered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b70-9\"> The fact that the transcript of the original divorce proceedings no longer exists; see footnote 4; does not relieve the plaintiff of this responsibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b70-10\"> The plaintiff claims that the two month lapse between Judge Ryan\u2019s oral announcement of the dissolution decree and the subsequent issuance of his memorandum of decision suggests that he never actually delivered the exact terms of this decree orally. Yet, the plaintiff never presented this argument in his trial court brief and never requested an articulation from the trial court on this issue. Accordingly, we decline to address it now.
