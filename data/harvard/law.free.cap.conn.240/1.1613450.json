The dispute in this administrative appeal arises out of a request for corporate documents by the defendant Ellen Andrews (complainant) from the plaintiff, Domestic Violence Services of Greater New Haven, Inc. The plaintiff denied the complainant\u2019s request for the documents on the ground that it was not a public agency within the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 1-18a<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Freedom of Information Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>(FOIA). Although the documents were voluntarily furnished to the complainant, the FOIC nonetheless proceeded with a contested hearing to determine whether the plaintiff was a public agency.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After deciding that the plaintiff was a public agency, the FOIC then found that the plaintiffs voluntary disclosure had been untimely and ordered the plaintiff, in the future, to comply promptly with other disclosure requests. The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court, which sustained the plaintiffs appeal. The FOIC then appealed the reversal of its decision to the Appellate Court, which, sua sponte, raised the issue of whether the FOIC was seeking an advisory opinion because the issue was moot. After a hearing, the Appellate Court dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>the defendant\u2019s appeal. We granted the FOIC\u2019s petition for certification to appeal from the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">The undisputed facts are as follows. On December 10,1993, the complainant made a written request to the plaintiff for certain corporate documents, including its annual report, budget and bylaws. On December 15, 1993, the plaintiffs executive director refused to provide the complainant with the requested documents. On December 20, 1993, the complainant filed a complaint with the FOIC that requested it to order the disclosure. The FOIC sent a notice to the parties scheduling a hearing to be conducted on March 3, 1994. On February 28, 1994, the plaintiff voluntarily delivered the requested documents to the complainant. In a cover letter, the plaintiffs attorney stated that \u201cthis disclosure is not an admission that [the plaintiff] is a public agency, as that term is used in the [FOIA]. Rather, we freely disclose the documents requested in the hopes of avoiding a costly legal battle over this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Notwithstanding the voluntary disclosure, the FOIC proceeded with a contested hearing on March 31,1994.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the hearing, it determined that the plaintiff was a public agency pursuant to the FOIA and that, although the documents had been furnished to the complainant prior to the hearing, the documents had not been provided <em>promptly.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>6The FOIC ordered the plaintiff to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>ply strictly with the provisions of the FOIA in the future. The plaintiff appealed from the decision of the FOIC to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-21i (d)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 4-183<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on the ground that the FOIC had improperly found that the plaintiff was a public agency. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The Superior Court found that the plaintiff was not a public agency and, therefore, reversed the decision of the FOIC. Thereafter, the FOIC, pursuant to \u00a7 l-21i (d),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> appealed the reversal of its decision to the Appellate Court, which dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The plaintiff argues that the Appellate Court properly dismissed the FOIC\u2019s appeal as an attempt to secure an advisory opinion because the documents had already been turned over to the complainant and, therefore, no practical relief could be granted on appeal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The decision of the Appellate Court to dismiss this appeal as seeking an advisory opinion is predicated on mootness. \u201cSince mootness implicates subject matter jurisdiction; <em>Sadlowski </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>206 Conn. 579, 583, 538 A.2d 1052 (1988); it can be raised at any stage of the proceedings. See <em>Sobocinski </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>213 Conn. 126, 134-35, 566 A.2d 703 (1989). We have consistently held that we do not render advisory opinions. If there is no longer an actual controversy in which we can afford practical relief to the parties, we must dismiss the appeal. <em>Sadlowski </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>[supra, 583].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>221 Conn. 214, 216, 602 A.2d 1018 (1992). \u201cBecause courts are established to resolve actual controversies, before a claimed controversy is entitled to a resolution on the merits it must be justiciable. Justiciability requires . . . that there be an actual controversy between or among the parties to the dispute: Courts exist for determination of actual and existing controversies, and under the law of this state the courts may not be used as a vehicle to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>obtain judicial opinions on points of law. . . . [Wjhere the question presented is purely academic, we must refuse to entertain the appeal. . . . <em>Hallas </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>212 Conn. 338, 347, 562 A.2d 499 (1989). A case becomes moot when due to intervening circumstances a controversy between the parties no longer exists.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Crest Pontiac Cadillac, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hadley, </em>239 Conn. 437, 439 n.3, 685 A.2d 670 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-15 and 1-19 (a) both provide in pertinent part that requested public records must be provided promptly. Section 1-19 (a) provides that \u201call records maintained or kept on file by any public agency . . . shall be public records and every person shall have the right to <em>inspect such records promptly </em>during regular office or business hours or to receive a copy of such records in accordance with the provisions of section 1-15. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 1-15 (a), the provision that is applicable to the complainant\u2019s request, provides that \u201c[a]ny person applying in writing shall receive, <em>promptly upon request, </em>a plain or certified copy of any public record. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 1-2 li (b) (1) provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a]ny person denied the right to inspect or copy records under section 1-19 or wrongfully denied the right to attend any meeting of a public agency or denied any other right conferred by sections 1-15 [or] . . . 1-19 . . . may appeal therefrom to the [FOIC] by filing a notice of appeal with said commission. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Because the complainant, at the hearing, claimed that the documents were not provided to her within a \u201creasonable time,\u201d and the evidence supported her claim, the FOIC found that the plaintiff \u201cviolated \u00a7\u00a7 1-15 and 1-19 (a) . . . when it failed to promptly provide the complainant with a copy of the [requested] records . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, the documents were not provided to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>the complainant until almost three months after her initial request and only three days before the scheduled FOIC hearing. Accordingly, the plaintiff was found to have violated the FOIA by failing to make available the requested documents in a prompt manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Furthermore, the order issued by the FOIC was prospective in nature and impacts the obligations of the plaintiff in the future with respect to disclosure requests from members of the public. The FOIC\u2019s order in this case stated: \u201cHenceforth, [the plaintiff] shall strictly comply with the provisions of the FOIA.\u201d Regarding this type of order, <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>227 Conn. 641, 649 n.9, 631 A.2d 252 (1993), is instructive. <em>Gifford </em>involved the issue of whether a chief of police had to provide a copy of an arrest report to a newspaper reporter pursuant to the FOIA. This court noted that \u201c[t]he commission concluded in its final decision . . . that, during the pen-dency of a criminal prosecution, an arrest report must be disclosed upon request to the public pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-15 and 1-19 (a) of the act. The commission stated that, except for the names and addresses of witnesses, such arrest reports were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>exempt from disclosure and ordered [the Windsor Locks chief of police] to \u2018comply with the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 1-19 (a).\u2019 The commission also \u2018cautioned] [the chief of police] to take care to comply with the law in the future or [he] may risk further consequences for [his] continuing disregard of the law.\u2019 \u201d Id., 648-49. In <em>Gifford, </em>even though the requested document was released to the public before the FOIC\u2019s final decision was released, we agreed with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the appeal was not moot. We stated that \u201c[t]he order issued by the commission is prospective in nature and impacts the discovery obligations of the state\u2019s attorneys in pending criminal matters.\u201d Id., 649 n.9; see <em>Glastonbury Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>234 Conn. 704, 707 n.3, 663 A.2d 349 (1995) (\u201c[e]ven though the proceedings at issue here long since have concluded, and hence there is nothing to which a remand could be directed, the appeal is not moot because of the continuing order to the plaintiffs to conduct future negotiations in accordance with the FOIC order under challenge in this appeal\u201d); see also <em>Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>210 Conn. 646, 650, 556 A.2d 1020 (1989) (board members risk criminal sanctions because noncompliance with FOIC order is class B misdemeanor). The present appeal presents the same prospective order. For this reason, and because the FOIC determined that the plaintiff had not provided the documents promptly, the controversy before the FOIC was not moot. Consequently, the appeal before the Appellate Court was not moot.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b24-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a provides in pertinent part: \u201cDefinitions.

In determining whether an entity is the functional equivalent of a public agency, we consider the following criteria: (1) whether the entity performs a governmental function; (2) the level of government funding; (3) the extent of government involvement or regulation; and (4) whether the entity was created by the government. Id., 554; see also <em>Hallas </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>18 Conn.
