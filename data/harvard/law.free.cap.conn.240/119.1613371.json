The plaintiff, Nancy Sekor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>a tenured teacher, filed an administrative appeal in the trial court, pursuant to subsection (f) of General Statutes \u00a7 10-151,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to challenge the validity of the action of the defendant, the Ridgefield board of education (board), terminating her contract of employment. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff and directed her reinstatement. The board appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The following facts are not in dispute. From 1981 to the time of her dismissal in 1993, the plaintiff was employed as a teacher in the Ridgefield public school system and had obtained tenure there. She was certified by the Connecticut state board of education as a secondary school teacher with a subject area endorsement in business education. During the 1989-90 school year, because of declining enrollments in business classes, she obtained a subject area endorsement in social studies and took a voluntary leave of absence to receive necessary training in order to obtain an additional subject area endorsement in English.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">During the 1990-91 school year, the plaintiffs teaching assignment consisted of four business classes and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>one social studies class. Thus, in that school year, the plaintiffs teaching assignment consisted of 80 percent business classes and 20 percent social studies classes. In response to difficulties she experienced in the social studies class, she was placed on the school administration\u2019s \u201cInstructional Improvement Plan/Intensive Assistance Plan\u201d (intensive assistance plan). Although the plaintiffs teaching of social studies improved somewhat during the 1990-91 school year, her supervisors recommended that she continue on the intensive assistance plan during the following school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">For the 1991-92 school year, the plaintiff taught two business classes and three English classes. Thus, in that school year, the plaintiffs teaching assignment consisted of 40 percent business classes and 60 percent English classes. Despite continued administrative efforts, as prescribed by the intensive assistance plan, the principal of the school to which the plaintiff had been assigned concluded that the plaintiff was unable to teach her English classes satisfactorily. The principal, therefore, recommended termination of the plaintiffs employment. Viewed together, the plaintiffs teaching assignments in the 1990-91 and 1991-92 school years consisted of 60 percent business classes (six classes) and 40 percent social studies and English classes (four classes).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">On March 23,1992, the board voted to consider termination of the plaintiffs contract pursuant to subsection (d) of \u00a7 10-151.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Exercising her rights under that statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>the plaintiff requested, and received, a statement of reasons and a hearing before an impartial hearing panel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After extensive hearings, a majority of the hearing panel found that the plaintiff was competent to teach business classes but incompetent and inefficient as a teacher of social studies and English. On the basis of this and subsidiary findings, the majority of the panel recommended to the board that it terminate the plaintiffs employment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On October 6,1993, the board voted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>to terminate the plaintiffs employment on the grounds of incompetence and inefficiency, and the plaintiff was so notified the following day. Further facts will be provided where relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">In the plaintiffs appeal of the board\u2019s decision to the trial court, she raised numerous procedural and evidentiary challenges to the validity of her termination, none of which the trial court found persuasive. The court concluded, however, that, in light of the protected property interests and due process rights associated with the concept of tenure, it was improper to find the plaintiff incompetent, despite her failings in English and social studies, as long as she was competent as a business teacher. The court determined, therefore, that the plaintiffs employment had been wrongfully terminated and ordered her reinstated to a full-time business position that had become available during the course of the termination proceedings. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">In its appeal, the board claims that the trial court was mistaken both in its construction of \u00a7 10-151 (d) and in its remedial order. The board claims that \u00a7 10-151 (d) permits the termination of a tenured teacher\u2019s contract for general incompetence despite a finding that the teacher is competent to teach in one endorsed subject area. The board further claims that the trial court lacked a sufficient factual basis for its finding that a full-time business position had become available during the pendency of these termination proceedings. We agree with both of the board\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">Section 10-151, the Teacher Tenure Act, prescribes the manner in which teachers acquire tenure. To become tenured, a teacher must hold a certificate issued by the state board of education and must com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>p\u00edete a designated period of full-time continuous employment for the same board of education. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 10-151 (a) (6) (A) and 10-145 (teaching certificate requirement). The certificate indicates the particular grade level at which the teacher may be employed. See General Statutes \u00a7 10-145b (c) (1). In addition, the certificate has one or more endorsements that indicate the subjects in which the teacher is accredited to teach. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 10-145b and 10-145d (empowering board to adopt requirements related to subject area endorsements).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In this case, the plaintiff had tenure, was certified to teach at the secondary school level and had a certificate that was \u201cendorsed\u201d in business, social studies and English. Having attained tenure, the plaintiff was entitled to continuous employment, unless her contract was terminated for one of the reasons specified in \u00a7 10-151 (d). \u201cInefficiency or incompetence\u201d is one of these specified reasons. General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 (d) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\u201cWhen considering termination of a tenured teacher\u2019s employment contract, a school board acts, like an administrative agency, in a quasi-judicial capacity.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Barnett </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>232 Conn. 198, 206, 654 A.2d 720 (1995); see also <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>226 Conn. 704, 712, 629 A.2d 333 (1993). \u201cA school board has discretion to accept or reject a recommendation from an impartial hearing panel, though it is bound by the panel\u2019s findings of fact unless unsupported by the evidence. . . . The board is bound by the panel\u2019s findings of fact, but not by its legal conclusions or by its recommendations.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Barnett </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 206; see also <em>Rado </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>216 Conn. 541, 555, 583 A.2d 102 (1990); <em>Petrino </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>179 Conn. 428, 430, 426 A.2d 795 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Judicial review of the school board\u2019s administrative decision follows established principles of administrative law. \u201cThe court\u2019s ultimate duty is only to decide whether, in light of the evidence, the [board] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Conclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically flow from such facts.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Barnett </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 207-208; see also <em>Ottoch-ian </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 393, 397, 604 A.2d 351 (1992); <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>205 Conn. 767, 774, 535 A.2d 1297 (1988); <em>Griffin Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 489, 496, 512 A.2d 199, appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 1023, 107 S. Ct. 781, 93 L. Ed. 2d 819 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The issue of law presented by this case is the proper measure of a teacher\u2019s professional competence pursuant to \u00a7 10-151 (d) (1). A teacher who elects to obtain numerous endorsements on his or her teacher\u2019s certificate necessarily represents his or her ability to teach in the subject area of any and all of these endorsements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The question thus posed is the extent to which multiple endorsements affect the scope of proper administrative scrutiny of the teacher\u2019s overall competence. The board contends that a conclusion of \u201cgeneral incompetence\u201d is proper whenever a teacher manifests incompetence in two of the three subject areas in which the teacher holds endorsements. The trial court concluded, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>contrary, that a teacher cannot be held to lack professional competence in any case in which the teacher is competent to teach in any one of his or her endorsed subjects.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">We address this issue within the confines of the circumstances of this case. The salient circumstances are that: (1) the plaintiff decided to obtain additional endorsements in English and in social studies as a result of declining enrollments in business classes, without any pressure or inducements on the part of school administrators; (2) the plaintiff has not challenged the school administrators\u2019 good faith in assigning her to teach classes in English and in social studies; (3) the plaintiff has not challenged the finding of the hearing panel that the school administrators acted in good faith in evaluating her performance in English and in social studies;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (4) in her English and social studies classes, which constituted 40 percent of her overall teaching obligations for the two years in question, the plaintiffs performance has been found incompetent both with respect to her instructional assignments and with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>respect to her fulfillment of her administrative responsibilities; and (5) as the hearing panel recommended, the board determined that the plaintiffs employment contract be terminated on the basis of overall incompetence and inefficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">In light of these circumstances, we conclude that the board properly terminated the plaintiffs contract of employment. Pursuant to \u00a7 10-151 (d), the board was obligated to provide the plaintiff, as a tenured teacher, with a continuous contract within the areas of her endorsed subject areas, but it was not obligated to assign her only to those classes in which she was competent to teach. The board\u2019s plenary administrative authority over the plaintiffs assignments follows from <em>Delagorges </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>176 Conn. 630, 410 A.2d 461 (1979), in which we rejected the claim that teachers who had been employed as administrators for more than three continuous years under individual administrative contracts had achieved administrative tenure and could not be reassigned to positions as teachers. We construed the continuous employment contract contemplated by \u00a7 10-151 (d) to afford a tenured teacher the right only to a generic position as a teacher, rather than to a specific position as an administrator. Id., 636-37. It follows that, having properly assigned the plaintiff to teach English and social studies classes, as well as business classes, the board properly could evaluate the plaintiffs competence to teach in all these subject areas. Just as \u00a7 10-151 (a) speaks to acquiring tenure geneiically, so \u00a7 10-151 (d) speaks to incompetence or inefficiency generically. See <em>Garovoy </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>178 Conn. 618, 623, 424 A.2d 297 (1979) (extent of tenured teacher\u2019s rights upon layoff determined by express provisions of \u00a7 10-151). Any other construction of the statute would seriously undermine a school board\u2019s authority to assure proper instruction of the students for whose education the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>board bears primary responsibility. See <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>143 Conn. 488, 497, 123 A.2d 747 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the essential inquiry, when a board decides to terminate a teacher for incompetence under \u00a7 10-151, is whether the teacher\u2019s overall performance falls below the requisite standard. This conclusion does not diminish the constitutional rights properly associated with tenure. Established constitutional principles recognize that the property interest of a tenured teacher entitles the teacher \u201cto continued employment except upon a showing of cause for termination or a bona fide elimination of the teaching position. . . . [The right to continued employment] is a property right protected under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1972); <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>181 Conn. 69, 72, 434 A.2d 333 (1980).\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>199 Conn. 231, 234, 506 A.2d 139, appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 802, 107 S. Ct. 42, 93 L. Ed. 2d 5 (1986). The protection constitutionally afforded to a tenured teacher is a right to \u201csome form of hearing\u201d; <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>supra, 570-71 n.8; and to other procedural safeguards such as \u201ca written statement of the [employment] decision reached, the reasons for the determination, and a fair summary of the evidence relied upon.\u201d <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 79. However, \u201c[t]he Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not a guarantee against incorrect or ill-advised personnel decisions.\u201d <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 350, 96 S. Ct. 2074, 48 L. Ed. 2d 684 (1976). It follows that a tenured teacher\u2019s constitutional rights do not include an entitlement to a particular teaching assignment of the teacher\u2019s own choosing.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">In her appeal, the plaintiff purports to agree with this description of the proper scope of her rights as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>tenured teacher, both under \u00a7 10-151 (d) and under applicable constitutional law, but she contends, nonetheless, that the termination of her employment contract was unlawful. She claims that the trial court properly concluded that the board had never made a finding of general incompetence and that the trial court itself properly determined, upon an examination of the administrative record as a whole, that no such finding could be sustained. These arguments misread the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">First, the trial court found no fault with the eviden-tiary or procedural basis upon which the board relied in deciding to terminate the plaintiffs contract. The court held, instead, that the board\u2019s decision was untenable, as a matter of law, because, in the court\u2019s view, \u00a7 10-151 (d) must be construed to forbid the termination of the employment contract \u201cof a competent, tenured business teacher on the grounds of general incompetency and inefficiency.\u201d It is this construction of the statute that, in our view, is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Second, the court did not purport to exercise equitable powers that, according to the plaintiff, were conferred upon the court by the provisions of \u00a7 10-151 (f). That subsection, at the time of these proceedings,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> instructed the trial court to \u201callow any party to such appeal to introduce evidence in addition to the [administrative record], if it appears to the court that additional testimony is necessary for the equitable disposition of the appeal.\u201d Because the trial court heard evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>about alleged procedural irregularities and evidentiary deficiencies with respect to the proceedings before the hearing panel, the plaintiff argues that the trial court had plenary authority to enlist equitable principles in her behalf and, in fact, did so. We disagree. The trial court could not have invoked such general equitable principles, in light of the limited scope of appellate review of an administrative decision under our established case law. See <em>Barnett </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 207-208, and cases cited therein. Additional evidence may properly enlighten matters, such as possible prejudice, in order to facilitate an equitable appraisal of latent irregularities in an administrative record, but courts have no general equitable jurisdiction to oversee the decisions of school hearing panels and school boards. See <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 713-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">In view of our disagreement with the trial court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 10-151 (d), we need not consider at length the merits of the trial court\u2019s decision to reinstate the plaintiff to a position as a business teacher. Presumably, the trial court would not have ordered reinstatement had the court upheld the board\u2019s decision to terminate the plaintiffs contract of employment on the ground of general incompetence. Even if we had come to a different conclusion about the scope of \u00a7 10-151 (d), however, we would disapprove of the trial court\u2019s remedial order. The trial court premised this order on its finding that, during the pendency of the termination proceedings, a teaching position in the area of business education had become available. That finding is not supported by the evidence in the record because the testimony on which the trial court relied establishes only that another business teacher retired six months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number><em>after </em>the plaintiffs employment had been terminated.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Judicial review of the merits of termination proceedings must take the facts as they existed at the time the board acted. See <em>Barnett </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 207-208.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The plaintiff urges us to affirm the judgment of the trial court on a number of alternate grounds unrelated to the trial court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 10-151 (d). The plaintiff claims that: (1) the hearing panel lacked jurisdiction to consider her alleged incompetence and inefficiency because that was not the basis of the original charge against her; (2) the hearing panel\u2019s report was invalid because the plaintiffs representative on the panel had not been allowed to participate in its preparation; (3) the hearing panel\u2019s finding of the plaintiffs incompetence in social studies was an ex post facto determination that violated her constitutional rights;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (4) the hearing panel\u2019s finding that the plaintiff had received the intensive assistance to which she was entitled pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 10-151b (b) was arbitrary, speculative and not supported by substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>evidence; and (5) the board conducted the October 6, 1993 proceedings in violation of the plaintiffs statutory and constitutional rights. The trial court fully considered and rejected each of these claims of administrative misconduct. We agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The plaintiffs jurisdictional claim focuses on the fact that, when the board first considered the termination of her employment, the stated reason was \u201celimination of position\u201d and that this was the only ground for termination stated in the initial notice to her. Under \u00a7 10-151 (d), however, the only initial obligation imposed upon a board is to notify a teacher that \u201ctermination of [her] contract is under consideration\u201d; the statute demands no greater specificity. Once this initial notice is sent out, however, \u00a7 10-151 (d) empowers a teacher to request a more complete statement of reasons. As the trial court found, the plaintiff was fully apprised, in timely fashion, that \u201cinefficiency and incompetence\u201d would be argued by the board, and she had ample opportunity before the hearing panel to address and rebut the board\u2019s charges. Our law requires nothing more to confer jurisdiction on the hearing panel. See <em>Petrovich </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>189 Conn. 585, 588, 457 A.2d 315 (1983); <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>177 Conn. 572, 578 n.5, 418 A.2d 933 (1979); <em>Mauriello </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>176 Conn. 466, 472, 408 A.2d 247 (1979); <em>Joanou </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>165 Conn. 671, 673-74, 345 A.2d 46 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The plaintiffs other claims of deficiencies in the report of the hearing panel involve findings of fact that do not require elaboration on appeal. The trial court found that the panel member appointed by the plaintiff had not been prevented from deliberating or participating in the panel\u2019s decision-making process. This finding is not clearly erroneous, particularly in view of the presumption of regularity that attaches to administrative proceedings. <em>Metropolitan District Commission </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number><em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 184, </em>237 Conn. 114, 122, 676 A.2d 825 (1996). Similarly, the trial court properly determined that the administrative record contained substantial evidence; <em>Barnett </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 211; to support the hearing panel\u2019s findings regarding the plaintiffs teaching incompetence in social studies and regarding the school administration\u2019s substantial compliance with the requirements of the intensive assistance plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The plaintiff also challenges the legality of the board\u2019s proceedings on October 6, 1993, when the board voted to terminate the plaintiffs contract of employment. The plaintiff claims that the board violated her statutory and constitutional rights: (1) by refusing to hear her claims of alleged procedural irregularities not evident on the face of the record of the hearing panel; and (2) by permitting an attorney to act as the board\u2019s procedural advisor despite the fact that a partner in the attorney\u2019s law firm was defending the board in a federal age discrimination action filed by the plaintiff. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The procedural irregularities that the board refused to consider relate to questions raised by the plaintiff about the full participation of her representative in the deliberations and in the drafting of the report of the hearing panel, and about the timeliness of the report issued by the hearing panel. Although the plaintiff argues that \u00a7 10-151 (d) requires the board to hear evidence and to consider the merits of such alleged latent defects in the report of a hearing panel, she has pointed to no statutory language to this effect, and we have found none. Pursuant to \u00a7 10-151 (d), the only statutory obligation of the board is to \u201cgive the teacher concerned its written decision within fifteen days of receipt of the written recommendation of the impartial hearing panel, subcommittee or hearing officer.\u201d The board has complied fully with this statutory mandate. Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>plaintiffs constitutional rights to due process were adequately protected by her right to raise these issues in her appeal to the trial court pursuant to \u00a7 10-151 (f).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>179 Conn. 111, 119-20, 425 A.2d 576 (1979); see also <em>Laurel Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>194 Conn. 677, 686-87, 485 A.2d 1272 (1984) (trial court may hear additional evidence if administrative record is unclear).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The plaintiffs final claim is that the board improperly failed to disqualify, for conflict of interest, an attorney who was acting as the board\u2019s counsel at the same time that a law firm partner of the attorney was representing the board in a federal court age discrimination action filed by the plaintiff. Because the board acts in an administrative capacity, the plaintiff can succeed on such a claim only by proving actual bias.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Rado </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 556. A determination of the existence or absence of actual bias is a finding of fact. <em>Transportation General, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Ins., </em>236 Conn. 75, 77, 670 A.2d 1302 (1996).

In the event of a layoff, the plaintiff would be entitled, pursuant to \u00a7 10-151 (d) (5), to displace any nontenured teacher in any of the endorsed subject areas. The plaintiff has not challenged the conclusion of the hearing panel \u201cthat it has no power to require [the plaintiff] to give up rights she would have under the collective bargaining agreement, certification statutes, and her bumping rights under [\u00a7] 10-151 ... if her employment contract were to be continued.\u201d Thus, the plaintiffs contention has no effect on the result we reach today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b149-8\"> The finding of good faith, as the board appropriately observes, rebuts the plaintiffs interstitial claim that the termination of her employment contract was motivated by the board\u2019s desire to hire a less expensive replacement.

The plaintiff, Nancy Sekor, as the majority observes, was found competent to teach business courses by an impartial hearing panel. While the majority must focus on the hearing panel\u2019s finding of the plaintiffs \u201cgeneral\u201d incompetence, it fails to consider the hearing panel\u2019s qualification of that finding, which I set out verbatim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The hearing panel recommended termination of the plaintiffs employment while again referring to the plaintiffs competence to teach business courses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the majority recognizes, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>defendant, the Ridgefield board of education (board), was required to accept the hearing panel\u2019s factual finding of the plaintiffs general incompetence <em>if teaching nonbusiness courses. </em>I submit that the board was also equally required to accept the hearing panel\u2019s finding that the plaintiff was competent if teaching business courses.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">When the board voted to terminate the plaintiffs employment, the issue of hiring a teacher with multiple endorsements to teach in one certification area, and the board\u2019s legal right to terminate that teacher\u2019s employment because of declining student enrollment in that particular area, was discussed. The board\u2019s attorney advised the board that termination of employment in those circumstances, for elimination of the position, could lead to future litigation over that teacher\u2019s displacement, or \u201cbumping,\u201d and recall rights in other endorsement areas. The board\u2019s attorney stated that \u201c[t]enure is tenure.\u201d Thereafter, the board voted to terminate the plaintiffs employment and advised her that it did so because she was \u201cnot competent and efficient to teach in the areas of English 7-12 and social studies 7-12.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">To find a standard of general incompetence, the majority cites to <em>Delagorges </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>176 Conn. 630, 410 A.2d 461 (1979), upholding the right of boards of education to assign tenured teachers to either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>teaching or administrative duties. <em>Delagorges </em>does not give a board power to assign a teacher to a field in which the teacher is incompetent when there are openings in a field for which the teacher is competent. That would strain common sense and violate a board\u2019s ultimate responsibility to educate. A board should have no more power to do so than a teacher should have to insist on teaching courses for which the teacher is incompetent. Both scenarios are patently unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The law should be reasonable, if it is to be the law. As Sir Edward Coke wrote: \u201cReason is the life of the law, nay, the common law is nothing else but reason.\u201d E. Coke, First Institute (1628). The early English cases in the development of common law put it in this manner: \u201cLet us consider the reason of the case. For nothing is law that is not reason.\u201d <em>Coggs </em>v. <em>Bernard, </em>2 Ld. Raym. Rep. 909, 911 (1703).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">In essence, the board failed to take the appropriate action, which would have been to restrict the plaintiffs teaching responsibilities to business courses. Instead, fearing that, if her position were to be eliminated because of declining business enrollments, the plaintiff would exercise her displacement or recall rights for nonbusiness courses, and fearing further litigation, the board simply fired her.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this manner, two wrongs made a right. This was contrary to the old American proverb, which is still true today: \u201cTwo wrongs don\u2019t make a right.\u201d I cannot agree with this reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">I also dissent on procedural and due process grounds regarding the role of the board\u2019s attorney and the circumstances of the board\u2019s meeting at which it voted to terminate the plaintiffs employment. At that meeting, the plaintiff appeared with her attorney and asked to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>be heard about the termination and about the participation of the board\u2019s attorney. The plaintiff had brought an action against the board for age discrimination and the board had hired the attorney\u2019s firm to defend it in federal court. The plaintiff suggested that the attorney had a conflict of interest because of that employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The board\u2019s attorney advised the board that the plaintiff did not have any right to be heard about any matter at the meeting. He stated that if any board member had a question about his advice, then the member should make a motion to consider that issue, and, if seconded, the issue could be subject to board action. No such motion was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">During the discussion, the plaintiffs counsel asked that a letter be marked for identification, and the board\u2019s counsel stated that it would not be marked as \u201c[tjhis is not a hearing.\u201d He further instructed the board that it could not hear any additional facts, explained the nature of the motion that he be disqualified and discussed the board\u2019s right to have counsel. The board\u2019s counsel then stated to the plaintiffs counsel: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get a hearing. This is a meeting, not a hearing.\u201d Thereafter, under the direction of its counsel, the board proceeded to accept the hearing panel\u2019s report and to terminate the plaintiffs employment without hearing her counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">This court has consistently found a property interest in a teacher\u2019s contract of employment. The act of taking away such a property right requires due process which equates to a fair hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>199 Conn. 231, 234-35, 506 A.2d 139, appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 802, 107 S. Ct. 42, 93 L. Ed. 2d 5 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>The trial court discussed the participation of the board\u2019s counsel. The court remarked that it could be argued \u201cfor the sake of appearances [that the board\u2019s attorney] should have refrained from advising the [b]oard\u201d and the board should have obtained \u201cindependent counsel,\u201d but concluded, however, that the record did not show the board and its attorney to be \u201c \u2018allies in the same cause\u2019 \u201d and that no evidence of actual bias or prejudice was presented. See <em>Zanavich </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>8 Conn. App. 508, 512, 513 A.2d 198, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 809, 515 A.2d 381 (1986) (counsel and board regarded themselves as \u201callies in the same cause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\"><em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 231, concerned attorneys who were members of the defendant\u2019s board of trustees that terminated a teacher\u2019s tenure and who were also the attorneys for the board of trustees in some unrelated matters. The court held the attorneys\u2019 relationship as public officials to the teacher was not such as to call into question whether the members\u2019 personal interest reasonably might conflict. Id., 241; <em>Low </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>135 Conn. 1, 8, 60 A.2d 774 (1948). The court was careful to point out there that the attorneys\u2019 representation of the board of trustees on unrelated matters was too remote and tenuous. <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>supra, 240. The court specifically referred to the fact that the matters handled by the attorneys were \u201cwholly unrelated to the controversy they were to consider.\u201d Id., 243. The court went on to state that there was \u201cno showing of any connection between their law firm and the school officials or other persons who were advocating the termination of the plaintiff[\u2019s employment].\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">In this case, in advising the board, the attorney gave the instructions that led to the termination of the plaintiffs employment. It is not disputed that his firm also represented the board in an age discrimination lawsuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>brought against it by the plaintiff related to the termination proceedings. It cannot be said that the attorney\u2019s personal interest in defeating the plaintiffs age discrimination claim by establishing other bona fide grounds for termination might not reasonably conflict with his duties to ensure a fair hearing before a fair tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">I find that both the basis of the board\u2019s action and its procedures were improper and prejudicial to the plaintiff. The board did have the right, and indeed the duty, to terminate the employment of an incompetent teacher, but it had to do so reasonably and fairly. It did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-7\"> The hearing panel qualified its findings as follows: \u201c[The plaintiffs] performance as a teacher in 1991-92 was instructionally incompetent and inefficient in English and her general administrative performance also was incompetent and inefficient. The latter alone (administrative performance) was sufficient to reasonably conclude that [the plaintiff] was incompetent and inefficient within the meaning of [General Statutes \u00a7] 10-151. Where the panel differs with the Administration, and it perhaps is a point upon which reasonable minds could differ, is <em>we believe that if [the plaintiff] had an assignment limited to her business 7-12 certification, she would not be incompetent and inefficient. </em>In other words, we believe that these kinds of problems are situational for [the plaintiff], i.e., they only rise to the level of incompetence and inefficiency when [the plaintiff] is assigned to teach in areas outside of her business certification (i.e., social studies or English).\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-8\"> The hearing panel stated that because of the plaintiffs competence to teach business courses, \u201cthe panel gave serious consideration to recommending that [the plaintiffs] employment contract not be terminated and that her employment contract be continued with the limitation that she would have no right to any assignments outside the area of her business 7-12 certification. Upon reflection, however, the panel concluded that it has no power to require [the plaintiff] to give up rights she would have under the collective bargaining agreement, certification statutes, and her bumping rights under [\u00a7] 10-151 (in the event of future layoffs, if her position were eliminated she would have a statutory right to bump non-tenured teachers in any area in which she is certified) if her employment contract were to be continued. Additionally, if we were to have recommended continuation of [the plaintiffs] employment contract with the above stated limitations and there were no business positions open for 1993-94 (and at the time of the hearings it appeared highly doubtful that there would be), we would have intended that she be placed on the recall list with recall rights to only business positions. This intention created another problem, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>according to the express language of Article XXIV Section B, Recall of the collective bargaining contract, access to the recall list is limited to teachers \u2018whose contract is terminated as a direct result of the elimination of his or her position . . . If we recommend that [the plaintiffs] employment contract <em>not </em>be terminated, and if she in fact were not terminated, she could not logically have immediate access to the recall list. Thus while this panel might have made such a recommendation if we had the clear authority to do so and if we were certain our recommendation could be implemented without legal disputes, we are convinced that such a recommendation would throw the parties into a legal morass which would rival the one that led to the instant dispute.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b160-9\"> Since the board abandoned its initial claim of elimination of a teaching position as a basis for termination, it may not rely upon that circumstance as a possibility in the future.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b161-9\"> I do not assume that the plaintiff had a right to a full evidentiary hearing before the board, only a fair proceeding leading to the termination of her employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
