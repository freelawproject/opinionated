J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOS\">The sole issue in this appeal is whether a child<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who has been transferred, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 46b-127,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>docket for juvenile matters to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court on a charge of murder must be returned to the docket for juvenile matters if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>he is acquitted of murder but convicted of the lesser included- offense of manslaughter in the first degree. The defendant, David Morales, contends that allowing a child acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter to remain on the regular criminal docket for sentencing is contrary to both the language of \u00a7 46b-127 and the equal protection and due process provisions of the federal constitution. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s statutory and constitutional arguments and affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court, which affirmed the trial court\u2019s sentencing of the defendant for manslaughter as an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. When the defendant was fifteen years old, he was the driver of a vehicle involved in a gang related drive-by shooting in New Haven that resulted in the death of a sixteen year old male. As a result of the defendant\u2019s involvement in the shooting, he was arrested by warrant and, in a petition of delinquency, charged with murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 and 53a-54a.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On June 12, 1991, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>state filed a motion to transfer the defendant to the regular criminal docket pursuant to \u00a7 46b-127. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court transferred the defendant on the basis of its finding of probable cause to believe that the defendant had committed murder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Following the transfer of the defendant to the regular criminal docket, another probable cause hearing was held pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That court also found probable cause to believe that the defendant had committed murder in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 and 53a-54a. The state then filed an amended two count information charging the defendant with murder and with conspiracy to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 (a)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 53a-54a.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>In August, 1994, the defendant was tried by a jury. At the defendant\u2019s request, the trial court instructed the jury as to the lesser included offenses of manslaughter in the first and second degrees. The jury convicted the defendant of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 and 53a-55 (a) (l),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and acquitted him of the charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Thereafter, the defendant moved to have his case returned to the juvenile docket for further proceedings. The trial court denied the motion and sentenced the defendant to a term of incarceration of eighteen years, suspended after fourteen years, with five years probation. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court in a per curiam opinion based upon its decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Cuffee, </em>32 Conn. App. 759, 630 A.2d 621 (1993). <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>40 Conn. App. 935, 671 A.2d 867 (1996). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to determine: (1) whether, as a matter of statutory construction, a child who is transferred to the regular criminal docket pursuant to \u00a7 46b-127, on the basis of a finding of probable cause to believe that he has committed murder, must be transferred back to the juvenile docket if he is found guilty of the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree; and (2) whether the statute, if construed not to require such a retransfer, violates the child\u2019s constitutional rights to equal protection and due process. <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>237 Conn. 907, 674 A.2d 1333 (1996). We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Section 46b-127 provides that the juvenile court must transfer to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court all cases in which there has been a finding of probable cause that a child has committed murder in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a through 53a-54d and the alleged crime occurred after the child had attained fourteen years of age. Section 46b-127 (d) also provides that \u201c[u]pon the effectuation of the transfer, [the] child shall stand trial and be sentenced, if convicted, as if he were sixteen years of age .... Any child transferred to the regular criminal docket who pleads guilty to a lesser offense shall not resume his status as a juvenile regarding said offense. If the action is dismissed or nolled or if such child is found not guilty of the charge for which he was transferred, the child shall resume his status as a juvenile until he attains the age of sixteen years.\u201d We are asked to determine how the legislature intended this language to be applied where, as here, a child is properly transferred to the regular criminal docket on the basis of a finding of probable cause to believe that he has committed murder, but is later acquitted of murder by a jury and convicted of the lesser included offense of manslaughter. As noted above, in 1993, the Appellate Court concluded that a child transferred to the regular criminal docket on a murder charge could be sentenced as an adult if that child was convicted of a lesser included offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cuffee, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 764-65. Since <em>Cuffee, </em>the legislature has made significant changes to the juvenile transfer statutes but has not enacted legislation to overrule that decision. See Public Acts 1995, No. 95-225, \u00a7 13; Public Acts, Spec. Sess., July, 1994, No. 94-2, \u00a7 6. While we are aware that legislative inaction is not necessarily legislative affirmation; see <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>238 Conn. 653, 662, 680 A.2d 242 (1996); we also \u201cpresume that the legislature is aware of [the Appellate Court\u2019s] inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>pretation of a statute, and that its subsequent nonaction may be understood as a validation of that interpretation.\u201d <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>203 Conn. 425, 439, 525 A.2d 91 (1987). The defendant has failed to articulate a convincing rationale to alter the Appellate Court\u2019s 1993 interpretation of \u00a7 46b-127, and we see no reason to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">We first consider the language of \u00a7 46b-127 (d), which provides that, \u201c[u]pon the effectuation of the transfer, [the] child shall stand trial and be sentenced, if convicted, as if he were sixteen years of age . . . .\u201d That language, which has not changed since the time of the decision in <em>Cuffee, </em>dictates that children who are validly transferred from the juvenile docket to the regular criminal docket are to be prosecuted in all respects, including sentencing, as though they were adults.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is undisputed that an adult tried for murder may be convicted of any lesser included form of homicide. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382, 398-408, 429 A.2d 919 (1980). General Statutes \u00a7 53a-45 (c) provides that \u201c[t]he court or jury before which <em>any person . . . held to answer for murder </em>after a hearing conducted in accordance with the provisions of section 54-46a is tried may find such person guilty of homicide in a lesser degree than that charged.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant in this case certainly falls within the category of \u201cany person . . . held to answer for murder\u201d and \u00a7 53a-45 (c) therefore would apply to the charges against him unless the legislature has carved out a specific exception to \u00a7 53a-45 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">The defendant asks us to find such an exception in the last sentence of \u00a7 46b-127 (d), which provides that \u201c[i]f the action is dismissed or nolled or if such child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>is found not guilty of the charge for which he was transferred, the child shall resume his status as a juvenile until he attains the age of sixteen years.\u201d The defendant argues that murder is the only \u201ccharge for which he was transferred\u201d and that, when the jury found him not guilty of that charge, the court was obligated to send his case back to the juvenile docket. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 46b-127 would, within the context of cases transferred from the juvenile docket to the regular criminal docket, require a departure from our well established rules pertaining to lesser included offenses. Under the defendant\u2019s interpretation, in a transferred case a jury would never deliberate regarding a lesser included offense because the jury is routinely instructed, as the jury was in this case, that it may not begin to deliberate regarding any lesser included offense until it has concluded that the defendant is not guilty of the greater offense. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>227 Conn. 566, 587, 630 A.2d 1064 (1993). Before it ever reached the lesser included offense, the jury would have had to conclude that the defendant was not guilty of the greater offense. Further deliberations regarding lesser included offenses would be meaningless under the defendant\u2019s construction of the statute and, therefore, trial courts presumably would be precluded from giving lesser included offense instructions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Forcing the jury to choose between murder and acquittal in a case where there is evidence of a less culpable state of mind \u201cwould limit the jury\u2019s function of determining questions of fact and undermine a defendant\u2019s right to a trial by jury.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 404. We are unable to find any indication that the legislature intended that the state and the child defendant engage in this version of Russian roulette.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Our interpretation finds further support in the provision of \u00a7 46b-127 (d) that \u201c[a]ny child transferred to the regular criminal docket who pleads guilty to a lesser offense shall not resume his status as a juvenile regarding said offense. . . .\u201d It is clear that had the defendant pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the first degree, his case would have remained on the regular criminal docket and he would have been sentenced as an adult and subject to a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. The defendant contends, however, that because he elected to go to trial and opted to request a lesser included offense instruction on manslaughter, he is subject to a maximum penalty in juvenile court, if it is assumed the court could penalize him at all, of only four years commitment to the department of children and families pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 46b-141 (a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This argument violates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>canon of construction requiring that we construe statutes as a whole in order to reconcile their separate parts; <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 337, 349, 680 A.2d 1261 (1996); and, more starkly, the canon that counsels us to avoid constructions of statutes that lead to absurd consequences or bizarre results. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>237 Conn. 81, 102, 675 A.2d 866 (1996). We do not believe that the legislature intended those child defendants who are transferred to the regular docket and subsequently are convicted of manslaughter in the first degree after a full trial to be afforded dramatically more lenient treatment than those juveniles who voluntarily plead guilty to manslaughter in the first degree. The defendant\u2019s proposed construction would provide transferred juvenile defendants with a significant disincentive to plead guilty. Such a construction is at odds with common sense and contradicts the policy encouraging plea bargaining. See <em>Copas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>234 Conn. 139, 153, 662 A.2d 718 (1995) (\u201cplea bargaining is an integral component of the criminal justice system and essential to the expeditious and fair administration of our courts\u201d). We conclude that \u00a7 46b-127 must be read to authorize the same sentences for those children convicted of lesser included offenses after a full trial as for those who plead guilty to lesser included offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Only by intexpreting the phrase \u201cthe charge for which he was transfeixed\u201d in the last sentence of \u00a7 46b-127 (d) to include not only the specific statutoxy offense for which the defendant was transferred but also any lesser included offenses, can we find internal haxmony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>between that last sentence and the preceding sentences providing that a transferred child shall be treated the same as an adult defendant \u201cif convicted\u201d or if he pleads guilty to any lesser included offense. Once probable cause was found by both the juvenile court and the adult court, the defendant was on notice that he could be prosecuted for murder and for applicable lesser included offenses. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 398-408. Otherwise, he would not be treated the same as a sixteen year old, as mandated by \u00a7 46b-127 (d). When a juvenile, after receiving all legislative safeguards, is transferred to the regular criminal docket and prosecuted for murder, the statute places him in the same position as an adult. This necessarily includes not only the possibility of conviction of appropriate lesser included offenses, but also the defendant\u2019s right to request instructions pertaining to such offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Having rejected the defendant\u2019s statutory claim, we consider the defendant\u2019s alternative argument that the statute, as we have construed it, violates his federal constitutional rights to equal protection and due process.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although unclear, the defendant\u2019s equal protection argument appears to be that he is similarly situated to those children who are adjudged delinquent on the basis of findings in juvenile court that they have committed manslaughter in the first degree, and that there is no rational basis for subjecting him to more severe penalties than are imposed on those who are prosecuted in the juvenile court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">In order to analyze the constitutionality of \u00a7 46b-127, we first must detail the principles applicable to equal protection analysis. \u201cTo implicate the equal protection clauses under the state and federal constitutions . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>it is necessary that the state statute in question, either on its face or in practice, treat persons standing in the same relation to it differently.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. </em>v. <em>EI Constructors, Inc., </em>239 Conn. 708, 755, 687 A.2d 506 (1997). \u201cThe equal protection clause \u2018does not require absolute equality or precisely equal advantages . . . .\u2019 <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Moffitt, </em>417 U.S. 600, 612, 94 S. Ct. 2437, 41 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1974); <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>[200 Conn. 562, 577-78, 512 A.2d 893 (1986)]. ... To determine whether a particular classification violates the guarantees of equal protection, the court must consider \u2018the character of the classification; the individual interests affected by the classification; and the governmental interests asserted in support of the classification.\u2019 <em>Dunn v. Blumstein, </em>405 U.S. 330, 335, 92 S. Ct. 995, 31 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1972).\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>211 Conn. 591, 595, 560 A.2d 444 (1989). Where, as here, \u201cthe classification at issue neither impinges upon a fundamental right nor affects a suspect group it \u2018will withstand constitutional attack if the distinction is founded on a rational basis.\u2019 <em>Laden </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>[169 Conn. 540, 543, 363 A.2d 1063 (1975)]; see also <em>McGinnis </em>v. <em>Royster, </em>410 U.S. 263, 270, 93 S. Ct. 1055, 35 L. Ed. 2d 282 (1972); <em>Dandridge </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 485, 90 S. Ct. 1153, 25 L. Ed. 2d 491 (1970).\u201d <em>Franklin v. Berger, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 595. Rational basis review \u201cis satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>225 Conn. 528, 536, 626 A.2d 244 (1993). \u201c[I]t is irrelevant whether the conceivable basis for the challenged distinction actually motivated the legislature.\u201d <em>D.A. Pincus &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>235 Conn. 865, 877, 670 A.2d 1278 (1996). We conclude that there is a conceivable rational basis for treating differently those juveniles who are convicted by a jury of manslaughter after being trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>ferred to the regular criminal docket to stand trial for murder and those who are adjudged delinquent on the basis of a court\u2019s initial finding that the juvenile has engaged in conduct amounting only to manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument appears to be that distinctions in sentencing of juvenile offenders cannot constitutionally be based upon a determination, in advance of trial, that there is probable cause to believe that a juvenile defendant has committed murder. We conclude, however, that even if we assume that the two categories of offender identified by the defendant, i.e., children charged with murder and those charged only with manslaughter, are similarly situated with respect to the statute, there is more than an adequate rational basis for treating them differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Our analysis of this claim is essentially the same as that in which we engage today in <em>State </em>v. Matos, 240 Conn. 743, 694 A.2d 775 (1997). As with the youthful offender scheme at issue in <em>Matos, </em>the legislature has provided a variety of benefits to juvenile defendants. Some of the benefits exist before and during trial, while others exist after the merits of a defendant\u2019s case have been decided by a court. Regardless of the timing of the benefits, however, the legislature has chosen to bestow or withhold these benefits as a whole, rather than on a piecemeal basis. It is entirely possible that the legislature decided that, in the best interests of our open public court system, any defendant tried as an adult and exposed to the public for trial should be sentenced as an adult, regardless of the crimes of which he or she ultimately is convicted. The legislature could have reasoned that conferring postverdict benefits, such as more lenient sentencing and erasure of records, on a defendant who, in open court, had been tried as an adult and convicted of a serious crime would damage society\u2019s perception of the fair administration of justice. See id. Because there exists a rational basis for this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>legislative scheme, we conclude that the legislature\u2019s decision to preclude a defendant from seeking the post-verdict benefits of the juvenile statutes once validly transferred to the regular criminal docket does not violate the defendant\u2019s right to the equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Under the due process analysis in his brief, the defendant asserts that he \u201cis entitled to the full protection of the statutory scheme governing the treatment of juvenile delinquents as set forth in [General Statutes] \u00a7\u00a7 46b-126 and 46b-127. Pursuant to that scheme, he would not have been subject to punishment as an adult for the crime of manslaughter in the first degree under \u00a7 46b-127 [a] (1). . . .To sentence the defendant as an adult for conviction of a class B felony, manslaughter in the first degree, in violation of this statutory scheme violates his right to due process of law.\u201d Although we confess some confusion about the nature of the defendant\u2019s claim, to the extent that his claim is that his right to due process was violated because the court failed to follow the relevant statutes, we reject it based upon our prior conclusion that the trial court\u2019s rulings were in accordance with those statutes. Moreover, as a matter of procedural due process, we determined in <em>In re Ralph M., </em>211 Conn. 289, 310, 559 A.2d 179 (1989), that the two statutorily required probable cause hearings as to the murder charge were adequate process for the purpose of subjecting the defendant to the possibility of pxmishment on that charge. We are at a loss as to why that same process would be constitutionally inadequate for the lesser included offense of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 (1) defines \u201cchild\u201d as \u201cany person under sixteen years of age . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b750-11\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 46b-127 provides: \u201cMandatory transfer of child charged with certain felonies to regular criminal docket, (a) The court shall transfer to the regular criminal docket of the superior court from the docket for juvenile matters: (1) Any child referred for the commission of a murder under sections 53a-54a to 53a-54d, inclusive, provided any such murder was committed after such child attained the age of fourteen years; (2) any child referred for (A) the violation of section 53a-55a, 53a-56a, 53a-60a, 53a-60c, 53a-72b, 53a-92a, 53a-94a, 53a-102a, 53a-103a or subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 53a-135, (B) the violation of section 53a-59, 53a-70a, 53a-101 or 53a-134 committed with a firearm or (C) the commission in the course of a single transaction of any felony that is a serious juvenile offense, as defined in section 46b-120, other than murder under sections 53a-54a to 53a-54d, inclusive, and of a violation of subsection (a) of section 29-35, provided such offense was committed after such child attained the age of fourteen years and provided further the prosecuting authority for juvenile matters, after consultation with the state\u2019s attorney, has moved for such transfer; (3) any child referred for the violation of any provision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>title 53a which is designated as a class A felony, other than murder or any such provision specified in subdivision (2) of this subsection, if such violation was committed after such child attained the age of fourteen years, provided such child has previously been adjudicated a delinquent at any age for a violation of any provision of title 53a, which at the time of such violation was designated a class A felony; or (4) any child referred for the violation of any provision of title 53a which is designated as a class B felony, other than any such provision specified in subdivision (2) of this subsection, provided such violation was committed after such child attained the age of fourteen years, and further provided such child has previously been adjudicated delinquent for two violations of any provision of title 53a, which at the time of such violations were designated a class A or B felony.

The defendant claims that if a jury found him to be guilty of a lesser included offense, he could at that point be sent back to the juvenile docket \u201cfor proceedings consistent with the jury\u2019s finding that the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that [the defendant] committed manslaughter in the first degree.\u201d Aside from the potential double jeopardy problems arising from such a proceeding, which we need not address; see <em>Breed </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>421 U.S. 519, 531-41, 95 S. Ct. 1779, 44 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1975) (violation of double jeopardy to prosecute in Superior Court after delin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>quency abdication in juvenile court); the defendant\u2019s argument for this sort of criminal collateral estoppel is unsupported by the relevant statutory scheme pertaining to delinquency abdications in juvenile court. There is no suggestion that the state may bypass the traditional methods of adjudicating a child as a juvenile delinquent merely by submitting to the court a jury\u2019s finding that the defendant committed manslaughter in the first degree. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-120 through 46b-141. If the legislature had intended to create such a novel procedural mechanism, the legislature would have provided for it. We are unwilling to create such a mechanism by judicial fiat.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b758-6\"> The defendant curiously argues in his brief that the state\u2019s construction of the statute would \u201cimpermissibly [burden] the common-law right to consideration of lesser included offenses . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b758-7\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 46b-141 provides in relevant part: \u201cCommitments to be indeterminate.

I agree with and join the majority opinion. I write separately only with regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>the defendant\u2019s equal protection claim. In my view, it is not necessary to engage in the inquiry of whether the particular classification at issue has a rational basis<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the defendant cannot surmount the threshold of equal protection analysis, namely, that he is similarly situated to the person with whom he is to be compared.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">It is axiomatic that the equal protection clause applies only where the litigant before the court first establishes that he is similarly situated, with respect to the statutory scheme claimed to violate the clause, to someone else who is treated differently from him under the statutory scheme. <em>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. </em>v. <em>EI Constructors, Inc., </em>239 Conn. 708, 755, 687 A.2d 506 (1997). If he is so similarly situated, the court must then determine whether the classification effectuated by the statutory scheme survives the applicable level of scrutiny. Id., 755-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">As the majority opinion makes clear, the defendant seeks to compare himself with those juveniles who are adjudged delinquent based on a finding in the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters that they have committed manslaughter in the first degree. The defendant, however, is not similarly situated, with respect to the juvenile statutes regarding the penal code homicide offenses, to those juveniles.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">The appropriate time for this inquiry is not, as the defendant assumes, at the end of the process, when he was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter. The appropriate time is at the beginning of the process because that is when the classification between him and the other juveniles was made. At that time, the state had evidence establishing probable cause that the defendant had committed not only manslaughter, but murder. A juvenile against whom there is sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>evidence for a charge of murder is not, in my view, similarly situated to a juvenile against whom there is only sufficient evidence for a charge of manslaughter. The defendant\u2019s equal protection claim founders, therefore, at this threshold stage.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-9\"> By joining the majority opinion, I also agree with and join its rational basis analysis. The purpose of this concurrence is simply to underscore my conclusion that it is not necessary to engage in that analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
