The plaintiff, Pacific Indemnity Insurance Company (Pacific), appeals from a judgment of the trial court in which the court concluded that the boarding of horses by Pacific\u2019s insureds constituted a business pursuit as defined in an exclusion to the homeowner\u2019s insurance policy issued by the defendant, Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (Aetna). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The following undisputed facts are relevant to this appeal. In 1985, Carol and Charles Popp, Pacific\u2019s insureds, began boarding horses at their farm, which is known as Hidden Bridge Farm. Aetna\u2019s insureds, Susan and Harold Dale, boarded their horse at Hidden Bridge Farm, paying $480 per month. The Popps hired Karen Deutsch as an independent contractor to care for the horses boarded at the farm, including the Dales\u2019 horse. In December, 1989, Deutsch was injured when she was kicked by the Dales\u2019 horse. At the time that Deutsch was injured, the Popps were insured by Pacific. Thereafter, Deutsch brought an action against the Popps seeking damages for her injuries. Pacific and the Popps subsequently made a demand on Aetna to defend the Popps and to provide coverage<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the homeowner\u2019s insurance policy issued to the Dales by Aetna included, as an additional insured, \u201cany person or organization legally responsible for\u201d their horse. Aetna refused to defend them or to provide coverage, claiming that the Popps were engaged in a business pursuit within the meaning of an exclusion in its policy. Specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>cally, the exclusion provided: \u201cA person or organization using or having custody of these animals ... in the course of any business, or without permission of the owner is not an insured . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">At the time of the accident, the Popps were both employed full-time in pursuits other than the boarding of horses at Hidden Bridge Farm. The Popps began to board horses at the farm in an attempt to defray the expenses of Carol Popp\u2019s own riding activities. The number of horses that they boarded ranged at various times from three to six. In addition to boarding horses, the Popps offered training and riding lessons. During the period from 1987 to 1990, the Popps reported profits and claimed losses from their horse-related activities as a farm business on their federal income tax returns.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Popps did not report their farm income under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 183, the so-called \u201chobby rules,\u201d which pertain to activities \u201cnot engaged in for profit.\u201d The \u201chobby rules\u201d preclude taxpayers from using hobby expenditures that exceed income as deductions to offset income from taxpayers\u2019 business activities. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 183 (a) (1994). Indeed, the Popps deducted expenses from their gross income that included depreciation from a portion of their farm property, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 167 (a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which provides for the allowance of deprecia-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>lion deductions on business property only.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">Pacific then brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment that Aetna is required to indemnify and defend the Popps in the action brought by Deutsch. The parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted Aetna\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that the Popps\u2019 boarding of horses constituted a business pursuit that was excluded from coverage under the Aetna policy. Pacific appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">On appeal, Pacific argues that the trial court incorrectly interpreted the majority rule with respect to the definition of a business pursuit. Specifically, Pacific contends that the trial court improperly concluded that the Popps were boarding horses with a profit motive when, in <em>fact, </em>it was not their means of earning a livelihood. In response, Aetna argues that a business pursuit need not constitute the insured\u2019s sole or principal source of income, but, rather, that a business pursuit denotes any continuous activity that an insured carries out for the purpose of earning a profit. We agree with Aetna.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">We begin our analysis with the general principles governing the construction of insurance policies. \u201cAn insurance policy is to be interpreted by the same general rules that govern the construction of any written contract and enforced in accordance with the real intent of the parties as expressed in the language employed in the policy. . . . The policy words must be accorded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>their natural and ordinary meaning. . . . Under well established rules of construction, any ambiguity in the terms of an insurance policy must be construed in favor of the insured because the insurance company drafted the policy. . . . This rule of construction may not be applied, however, unless the policy terms are indeed ambiguous. . . . Moreover, the mere fact that the parties advance different interpretations of the language in question does not necessitate a conclusion that the language is ambiguous. . . . [Construction of a contract of insurance presents a question of law for the court which this court reviews de novo.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., </em>239 Conn. 537, 542-43, 687 A.2d 1262 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The threshold question in our inquiry is the meaning of the term \u201cbusiness pursuits.\u201d Although this court has not previously addressed the construction of insurance policies with respect to the definition of business pursuits, we find guidance in the decisions of other jurisdictions. The seminal case in this regard is <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aurigemma, </em>45 Misc. 2d 875, 879, 257 N.Y.S.2d 980 (1965), in which the New York Supreme Court concluded that the term business pursuits encompassed two elements, continuity and profit motive. \u201cAs to the first, there must be a \u2018customary engagement\u2019 or a \u2018stated occupation\u2019; as to the latter, there must be shown to be such activity as a \u2018means of livelihood\u2019; \u2018gainful employment\u2019; \u2018means of earning a living\u2019; \u2018procuring subsistence or profit\u2019; \u2018commercial transactions or engagements. \u2019 \u201d Id. In a subsequent New York Appellate Court decision, <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Glens Falls Ins. Co., </em>47 App. Div. 2d 856, 365 N.Y.S.2d 892 (1975), aff'd, 39 N.Y.2d 204, 347 N.E.2d 624, 383 N.Y.S.2d 263 (1976), the court clarified that \u201cfor purposes of the \u2018business pursuits\u2019 exclusion, the \u2018business\u2019 engaged in by [the insured] need not necessarily be limited to his <em>sole </em>occupation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>or employment (Citation omitted; emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The majority of jurisdictions that have considered this issue have followed <em>Aurigemma, </em>holding that the term business pursuits means a continued or regular activity that is conducted for the purpose of profit, such as a trade, profession or occupation. See, e.g., <em>Pullen </em>v. <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>400 So. 2d 393, 402 (Ala. 1981); <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Goettl, </em>138 Ariz. 315, 318-19, 674 P.2d 869 (App. 1983); <em>Saha </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>427 So. 2d 316, 318 (Fla. App. 1983); <em>Heggen </em>v. <em>Mountain West Farm Bureau Mutual Ins. Co., </em>220 Mont. 398, 401-402, 715 P.2d 1060 (1986); <em>Fadden </em>v. <em>Cambridge Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </em>51 Misc. 2d 858, 862, 274 N.Y.S.2d 235 (1966), aff'd, 27 App. Div. 2d 487, 280 N.Y.S.2d 209 (1967); see annot., 48 A.L.R.3d 1096, 1099 (1973) (\u201ccourts have generally taken the restrictive view that this phrase denotes a continuous or regular activity for the purpose of earning a livelihood, such as a trade, profession, or occupation, or a commercial enterprise\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">We conclude that the majority interpretation of the term business pursuits for the purposes of an exclusionary clause in a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy is consistent with the terms of the Aetna policy in this case. The definition of \u201cbusiness\u201d in the Aetna policy <em>\u201cincludes </em>trade, profession or occupation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See footnote 2. It is well settled that in construing insurance policies, \u201cwords must be accorded their natural and ordinary meaning.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Ha<em>nsen </em>v. <em>Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 542. Because the word \u201cincludes\u201d is a term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>expansion, \u201cbusiness includes, but is not limited to, the \u2018trade, profession or occupation\u2019 of the insured.\u201d <em>Gaynor </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>366 So. 2d 1243, 1244 (Fla. App. 1979). Consequently, we find the approach adopted by the New York courts and the majority jurisdictions to be accurate and to reflect the ordinary meaning of business pursuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Pacific, in its brief, also argues that the majority view defines \u201cbusiness pursuit\u201d only to include an activity that \u201cis predominantly engaged in as a <em>means of livelihood, </em>and that at the very least it is one\u2019s principal occupation, not a secondary activity engaged in during one\u2019s leisure time.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) We disagree with such a narrow interpretation. Several courts have rejected the argument that part-time or supplemental income activities do not constitute business pursuits. See <em>Automobile Underwriters, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hitch, </em>169 Ind. App. 453, 457-58, 349 N.E.2d 271 (1976); <em>Krings </em>v. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America, </em>6 Kan. App. 2d 391, 394-95, 628 P.2d 1071 (1981); <em>Wiley </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>534 P.2d 1293, 1295 (Okla. 1974). Moreover, use of the plural term \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d in the Aetna policy, as opposed to the singular term \u201cbusiness pursuit,\u201d undermines the inference that only the insured\u2019s sole or principal occupation or trade is excluded under the policy. <em>Krings </em>v. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America, </em>supra, 395 n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Pacific further argues in its brief that under the trial court\u2019s rationale, <em>\u201cany activity where profit is a motive constitutes a business, </em>regardless of whether the facts of the case show that the activity is not engaged in for the purpose of earning a livelihood.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Pacific, therefore, contends that the trial court effectively adopted the minority rule.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Again, we are unpersuaded. Pacific ignores the first element of the majority approach \u2014 continuity of the activity. Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>other jurisdictions have noted that \u201c[n]ot every activity undertaken for profit is necessarily a business pursuit . . . .\u201d <em>O\u2019Conner </em>v. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of North America, </em>352 So. 2d 1244, 1246 (Fla. App. 1977); <em>Camden Fire Ins. Assn. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>170 W. Va. 313, 315, 294 S.E.2d 116 (1982). Further, as this court has pointed out in the context of unemployment compensation, a business activity must be undertaken \u201cnot as an isolated instance but as a regular or continuous practice <em>. . . .\u201d Maltatuck Museum-Maltatuck Historical Society </em>v. <em>Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>238 Conn. 273, 280, 679 A.2d 347 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">We conclude that the term \u201cbusiness pursuits,\u201d for the purposes of the exclusionary clause in the Aetna policy, contemplates a continuous or regular activity engaged in by the insured for the purpose of earning a profit or a livelihood. The determination of whether a particular activity constitutes a business pursuit is to be made by a flexible fact-specific inquiry. <em>Asbury </em>v. <em>Indiana Union Mutual Ins. Co., </em>441 N.E.2d 232, 239 (Ind. App. 1982); 7A J. Appleman &amp; J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice (1979) \u00a7 4501.10, p. 273.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the undisputed facts of this case. As Pacific points out in its brief, \u201c[tjhere is no question in this case that the Popps\u2019 activities involving the Hidden Bridge Farm were \u2018continuous.\u2019 \u201d Our inquiry, therefore, focuses on whether the second element \u2014 profit motive \u2014 has been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Although the Popps did not board horses as then-sole means of livelihood, they nevertheless conducted the activity for the purpose of earning a profit. It is of no moment that, during two of the years in question, 1988 and 1990, the Popps incurred net losses from this activity. As the Supreme Court of Oklahoma pointed out in <em>Wiley </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>supra, 534 P.2d 1295: \u201cIn a business pursuit the profit motive, or purpose of profit, is important. Whether there is or is not actual profit is immaterial. Does apursuithave to be successful from a profit standpoint before it is a business pursuit? If a business suffers a loss, was it not a business? The answers are obvious. Profit motive, not actual profit, makes a pursuit a business pursuit.\u201d Furthermore, by boarding horses at a fee of $480 per month per horse, Carol Popp was able to offset expenses for her own riding activities. Our conclusion that the boarding of horses in this case constitutes a business pursuit is further bolstered by the fact that, for every year in question, the Popps filed farm business federal income tax returns and claimed substantial annual depreciation of their property under Internal Revenue Code provisions that relate only to businesses. See <em>Saha </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 427 So. 2d 318 (concluding absence of profit does not negate existence of business pursuit where insured claimed substantial expenses and depreciation); <em>Heggen </em>v. <em>Mountain West Farm Bureau Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 220 Mont. 402 (finding deduction of expenses showed profit motive notwithstanding lack of actual profit). Accordingly, we conclude that, the trial court was correct in its determination that under the facts of this case, the boarding of horses constituted a business pursuit excluded from coverage under the Aetna policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-7\"> Pacific claims that Aetna was the primary insurer, and that Pacific\u2019s liability under the policy issued to the Popps was secondary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b50-5\"> The Aetna policy also provided a similar exclusion for medical payments as follows: \u201cMedical Payments to Others do not apply to bodily ipjruy or property damage . . . arising out of business pursuits of any insured . . . .\u201d The policy\u2019s definition of business \u201cincludes trade, profession or occupation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b50-6\"> Specifically, the Popps reported gross and net income during those years as follows, with the figures in parentheses indicating a loss:</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">1987 \u2014gross: $43,241; net: $667</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">1988 \u2014gross: 55,188; net: (15,914)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">1989 \u2014 gross: 52,889; net: 951</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">1990 \u2014gross: 51,213; net: (15,442)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b50-11\"> Title 26 of the United States Code, \u00a7 167 (a) (1994), provides: \"There shall be allowed as a depreciation deduction a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear (including a reasonable allowance for obsolescence)\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\"(1) of property used in the trade or business, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuK\">\u201c(2) of property held for the production of income.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b51-9\"> The Popps claimed the following amounts as depreciation deductions: in 1987 - $10,142; in 1988 - $16,651; in 1989 - $13,525; and in 1990 - $10,000</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b53-8\"> A minority of courts have held that the term business pursuits should be interpreted as embracing all activities that a person undertakes in which profit is a motive.
