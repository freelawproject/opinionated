The defendant, Jamison Martin Waz, entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere, under General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a and Practice Book \u00a7 4003 (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>more than four ounces of marijuana in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-279 (b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> following the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress marijuana found in a parcel seized from his automobile. The trial court accepted the plea and rendered judgment thereon.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The relevant facts, as set forth in the trial court\u2019s decision on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, are undisputed. \u201cOn March 24, 1994, Postal Inspector Thomas Lambert identified an Express Mail<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> package addressed to Down Deep, Inc., 34-3 Shunpike Road, #104, Cromwell, CT. 06416 as fitting characteristics of the \u2018drug package profile.\u2019 This profile consists of the following characteristics: [1] [s]ize and shape of the package; [2] [wjhether the package is taped to close or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>seal all openings; [3] [h]andwritten or printed labels; [4] [n] ature and destination of the package; [5] [t]he absence or presence of odors; [6] [w]hether the zip code of the sender matches that put on by the postal clerk; [7] [w]hether it contains a fictitious return address; [8] [o]rigin of the package; and [9] [t]he outward appearance of the package.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u201cAt a suppression hearing held on September 22 and October 27,1994, Lambert testified that the Down Deep, Inc. package fit a number of characteristics relative to the drug package profile. Such characteristics included: [1] [t]he fact that the edges were taped to seal all openings; [2] [t]he package contained a fictitious return address; [3] [t]he package contained handwritten labels; [4] [i]t came from a source state, i.e., California; and [5] [t]he size and shape of the package. He further stated that the package was sent via Express Mail which, based on his seven years of training and experience as a Postal Inspector and four years experience in narcotic[s] investigations, is primarily the exclusive carrier used by individuals to transport controlled substances through the United States mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">\u201cIt was a combination of each of these profile characteristics as well as the use of Express Mail which gave rise to Lambert\u2019s suspicions that the parcel contained a controlled substance. He then removed the package from the mail stream and obtained a narcotics trained dog named \u2018Zak\u2019<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to externally examine the parcel. The parcel was placed among eight other similar sized parcels. Zak, however, twice alerted to the Down Deep, Inc. parcel while it was placed in different positions on the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">\u201cLambert then applied for and obtained a federal search warrant to open the package. When the search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>warrant was executed, it was discovered that the package contained approximately one-half pound of suspected marijuana. A field test revealed a positive reaction for the presence of marijuana. The package was then resealed for the purpose of conducting a controlled delivery. Later that day on March 24,1994, members of the mid-state narcotics unit and Postal Inspectors Lambert and Terry Loftus began surveillance of the mail drop addressed to Down Deep, Inc. At approximately 2:28 p.m. on March 24,1994, the defendant picked up the Down Deep, Inc. package from the mail drop. Shortly thereafter, he was stopped and taken into custody. The parcel containing marijuana was seized from the right front floorboard of the vehicle the defendant was operating.\u201d The defendant was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana and possession of marijuana with intent to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The defendant moved to suppress the marijuana on the ground that the canine sniff of the parcel was a warrantless search in violation of the fourth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution. The trial court concluded that although the canine sniff was not a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment, the brief seizure of the parcel for the purpose of conducting the canine sniff required a showing of reasonable and articulable suspicion. The trial court further concluded that because the state had established that Lambert had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the parcel contained illegal drugs, the defendant\u2019s federal constitutional claim was without merit. The trial court declined to address the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>because he had failed to provide an adequate analysis of that claim. Accordingly, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s suppression motion. The defendant then entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere to a substitute information charging him with possession of more than four ounces of marijuana,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and this appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">On appeal, the defendant does not challenge the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Lambert possessed a reasonable and articulable suspicion concerning the contents of the parcel. Nor does he claim that the investigation of his parcel caused any delay in its delivery or that its brief removal from the mail stream constituted an unreasonable seizure in violation of article first, \u00a7 7, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Rather, the defendant\u2019s sole contention is that the canine sniff of the parcel constituted a search for purposes of article first, \u00a7 7, and, therefore, that the state was required to obtain a search warrant based upon probable cause before subjecting the mail to the canine sniff.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The state claims that the canine sniff was not a search within the meaning of article first, \u00a7 7, and, consequently, that the use of that investigative technique does not implicate the state constitutional prohibition against unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>searches.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The state further maintains that even if the canine sniff was a search within the meaning of article first, \u00a7 7, it was constitutionally permissible because Lambert had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the parcel contained contraband.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We need not decide whether the canine sniff of the parcel constituted a search under article first, \u00a7 7, because we conclude that even if it did, the state constitution requires no more than a showing that the investigating officers had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the parcel contained contraband.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>As we have indicated, the defendant concedes that Lambert had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the parcel contained illegal drugs, and the state concedes that Lambert did not have probable cause to believe that the parcel contained contraband prior to the canine alert. Because we assume, without deciding, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>that the canine sniff of the mail constituted a search for purposes of the state constitution, we must determine whether Lambert was required to obtain a search warrant based upon probable cause before subjecting the parcel to the canine sniff, as the defendant claims, or whether Lambert\u2019s reasonable and articulable suspicion that the parcel contained contraband provided a sufficient constitutional basis for the use of that technique, as the state contends.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u201cWhen evaluating the rights afforded to Connecticut citizens under the state constitution, we consider, to the extent applicable, six factors: (1) the text of the relevant constitutional provisions; (2) related Connecticut precedents; (3) persuasive federal precedents; (4) persuasive precedents of other state courts; (5) historical insights into the intent of our constitutional forebears; and (6) contemporary understandings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>applicable economic and sociological norms. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 249, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>[222 Conn. 672, 684-86, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>236 Conn. 216, 230 n.12, 673 A.2d 1098 (1996). In this case, our adjudication of the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim is informed principally by those federal and sister state cases involving the use of a trained narcotics detection dog.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Our review of those precedents persuades us that the canine sniff in this case did not violate article first, \u00a7 7, of the state constitution.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>The seminal federal case involving the use of a trained narcotics detection dog is <em>United States </em>v. <em>Place, </em>462 U.S. 696, 707, 103 S. Ct, 2637, 77 L. Ed. 2d 110 (1983), wherein the United States Supreme Court concluded that a canine sniff of luggage briefly detained upon reasonable suspicion in a public airport \u201c[does] not constitute a \u2018search\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>466 U.S. 109, 123-24, 104 S. Ct. 1652, 80 L. Ed. 2d 85 (1984).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In concluding that the use of the canine sniff technique in those circumstances did not constitute a search requiring probable cause, the <em>Place </em>court stated that \u201c[a] \u2018canine sniff by a well-trained narcotics detection dog . . . does not require opening the luggage. It does not expose noncontraband items that otherwise would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>remain hidden from public view, as does, for example, an officer\u2019s rummaging through the contents of the luggage. Thus, the manner in which information is obtained through this investigative technique is much less intrusive than a typical search. Moreover, the sniff discloses only the presence or absence of narcotics, a contraband item. Thus, despite the fact that the sniff tells the authorities something about the contents of the luggage, the information obtained is limited. This limited disclosure also ensures that the owner of the property is not subjected to the embarrassment and inconvenience entailed in less discriminate and more intrusive investigative methods. . . . We are aware of no other investigative procedure that is so limited both in the manner in which the information is obtained and in the content of the information revealed by the procedure.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Place, </em>supra, 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">For the reasons enumerated in <em>Place, </em>federal courts are unanimous in concluding that the fourth amendment is not violated when police briefly detain a piece of mail suspected of containing illegal drugs for the purpose of subjecting it to an examination by a trained narcotics detection dog. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>3 F.3d 399, 402 (11th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1129, 114 S. Ct. 1097, 127 L.

Ed. 2d 975 (1991) (package sent via United States mail using express delivery); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lux, </em>905 F.2d 1379, 1381-82 (10th Cir. 1990) (package sent via Express Mail); <em>United States </em>v. <em>LaFrance, </em>879 F.2d 18 (1st Cir. 1989) (package sent via Federal Express); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mayomi, </em>873 F.2d 1049, 1053-54 (7th Cir. 1989) (mail received at private mail box); <em>Garmon </em>v. <em>Foust, </em>741 F.2d 1069, 1072-73 (8th Cir. 1984) (mailed package received at dormitory); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>869 F.

Kan. 1991) (package sent via Express Mail); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sklar, </em>721 F. Sup. 7, 14 (D. Mass. 1989) (package sent via Express Mail), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 920 F.2d 107 (1st Cir. 1990) ; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Holden, </em>Docket No. 88-20105-01, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1144, *5 (D. Kan. Jan. 9, 1989) (package sent via Express Mail); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mena, </em>Docket No. 86-CR-524, slip. op. (N.D. Ill. Oct. 20, 1986) (package shipped via United Parcel Service).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">State courts are similarly in accord, under their respective state constitutions, that the police need no more than a reasonable and articulable suspicion to justify the use of the canine sniff technique on an object that has been briefly detained for that purpose. A number of state courts have concluded that a canine sniff is not a search for state constitutional purposes and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>consequently, that a judicial determination of probable cause prior to subjecting the item to an examination by a trained narcotics detection dog is unnecessary. See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Mayberry, </em>31 Cal. 3d 335, 337, 644 P.2d 810, 182 Cal. Rptr. 617 (1982) (luggage in airport); <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Cochrane, </em>654 So. 2d 609, 612-13 (Fla. App. 1995) (package sent via Federal Express); <em>O\u2019Keefe </em>v. <em>State, </em>189 Ga. App. 519, 526, 376 S.E.2d 406 (1988) (automobile); <em>State </em>v. <em>Snitkin, </em>67 Haw. 168, 173, 681 P.2d 980 (1984) (package at Federal Express office); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cancel, </em>256 N.J. Super. 430, 436-37, 607 A.2d 199 (1992), cert. denied, 134 N.J. 484, 634 A.2d 530 (1993) (routine use of dogs to detect narcotics at public airports); <em>State </em>v. <em>Villanueva, </em>110 N.M. 359, 362-63, 796 P.2d 252 (N.M. App.), cert. denied, 110 N.M. 260, 794 P.2d 734 (1990) (luggage at border checkpoint); <em>State </em>v. <em>Waldroup, </em>100 Ohio App. 3d 508, 514, 654 N.E.2d 390 (1995) (automobile); <em>State </em>v. <em>Palicki, </em>97 Ohio App. 3d 175, 181-82, 646 N.E.2d 494 (1994) (automobile); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stanphill, </em>53 Wash.

Moreover, the vast majority of state courts that have determined that the use of a trained narcotics detection dog constitutes a search for state constitutional purposes have also concluded that, because of the search\u2019s relatively unintrusive, contraband-specific nature, no more than a reasonable and articulable suspicion is required to justify the search. See, e.g., <em>McGahan </em>v. <em>State, </em>807 P.2d 506, 510-11 (Alaska App. 1991) (exterior of warehouse); <em>Pooley </em>v. <em>State, </em>705 P.2d 1293, 1311 (Alaska App. 1985) (luggage checked with airline); <em>People </em>v. <em>May, </em>886 P.2d 280, 281 (Colo. 1994) (package sent via Express Mail); <em>People </em>v. <em>Boylan, </em>854 P.2d 807, 811 (Colo. 1993) (package sent via Federal Express); <em>People </em>v. <em>Unruh, </em>713 P.2d 370, 377-78 (Colo.), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1171, 106 S.

Ed. 2d 981 (1986) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>(safe in police custody); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pellicci, </em>133 N.H. 523, 534-35, 580 A.2d 710 (1990) (automobile); <em>People </em>v. Dunn, 77 N.Y.2d 19, 25-26, 564 N.E.2d 1054, 563 N.Y.S.2d 388 (1990), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1219, 111 S. Ct. 2830, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1000 (1991) (common hallway outside defendant\u2019s apartment door); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>515 Pa. 454, 462-64, 530 A.2d 74 (1987) (rented storage locker); cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Offen, </em>78 N.Y.2d 1089, 1091, 585 N.E.2d 370, 578 N.Y.S.2d 121 (1991) (even if canine sniff of package shipped by United Parcel Service was search, it was justified by reasonable and articulable suspicion); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kosta, </em>75 Or. App. 713, 719, 708 P.2d 365 (1985) (even if canine sniff of package sent via Federal Express was search, it was justified by reasonable and articulable suspicion), aff'd on other grounds, 304 Or. 549, 748 P.2d 72 (1987); but see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>534 Pa. 136, 143, 626 A.2d 556 (1993) (probable cause required for canine sniff of satchel being carried by suspect). Thus, the overwhelming weight of federal and sister state authority supports the state\u2019s contention that a canine sniff examination of a mail parcel briefly detained upon reasonable and articulable suspicion does not run afoul of constitutionally protected privacy rights.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>The defendant relies primarily on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>757 F.2d 1359 (2d Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 819, 106 S. Ct. 66, 88 L. Ed. 2d 54 (1985), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 534 Pa. 136, to support his claim that the canine sniff of his parcel required a search warrant based upon probable cause. In <em>Thomas, </em>the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit concluded that a canine sniff conducted outside the defendant\u2019s apartment constituted an unreasonable search in violation of the fourth amendment and, therefore, that the warrant authorizing the search of the apartment was defective because it was predicated upon the fact that the dog had alerted to the presence of drugs. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>supra, 1366-67. The court distinguished the case before it from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Place, </em>supra, 462 U.S. 696, concluding that because an individual has a heightened privacy interest in his or her dwelling place, the canine sniff technique is more intrusive of a person\u2019s privacy rights when it is employed at one\u2019s home than when it is used in a public airport.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>supra, 1366.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Martin, </em>the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania concluded that probable cause was required under the Pennsylvania constitution before the police could conduct a canine sniff of a satchel being carried by a suspected drug dealer. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 534 Pa. 143. Previously, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>supra, 515 Pa. 465-66, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had concluded that a canine sniff for the presence of drugs in a storage locker was a search for state constitutional purposes requiring reasonable and articulable suspicion. In <em>Martin, </em>the court distinguished <em>Johnston </em>as involving the use of a canine sniff to search a place rather than a person. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 142-43. Relying on the fact that the defendant had been carrying the satchel when the police detained him and seized the bag for the purpose of subjecting it to the canine sniff, the court in <em>Martin, </em>noting that \u201can invasion of one\u2019s person is, in the usual case, [a] more severe intrusion on one\u2019s privacy interest than an invasion of one\u2019s property,\u201d concluded that the search was subject to the higher standard of probable cause. Id. Because both <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Martin </em>are based on the heightened privacy interests that pertain to one\u2019s house or person, neither case advances the defendant\u2019s claim that a prior judicial determination of probable cause is required for a canine sniff of a parcel placed in the mail.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sklar, </em>supra, 721 F. Sup. 14 (\u201cthe [cjourtis convinced that the privacy interest asserted by [the defendant in his Express Mail package] is more akin to that suggested by the [United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>States] Supreme Court in <em>Place </em>[luggage] [rather] than that discussed by the Second Circuit in <em>Thomas </em>[apartment]\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Phaneuf, </em>597 A.2d 55, 58 (Me. 1991) (\u201c[w]e reject [the defendant\u2019s] contention that the fourth amendment creates a <em>heightened </em>expectation of privacy in the mail akin to that in one\u2019s domicile\u201d [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">The defendant also maintains that his claim finds support in a number of United States Supreme Court and United States Court of Appeals cases recognizing a right to privacy in letters or parcels sent through the mail.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We agree with the defendant that he retained a legitimate expectation of privacy, under both the state and the federal constitutions, in the parcel of mail that Lambert caused to be subjected to the canine sniff.

Although the defendant did fail to engage in the analysis called for by <em>Golding, </em>the state, at oral argument, acknowledged that the factual record is sufficient for review of the defendant\u2019s claim under <em>Golding. </em>Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>233 Conn. 211, 212, 658 A.2d 566 (1995) (appellate review appropriate despite defendant\u2019s failure to invoke <em>Golding </em>regarding unpreserved claim of constitutional error).

Accordingly, the state does not challenge the defendant\u2019s claim that the marijuana seized pursuant to the federal search warrant must be suppressed as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d if the canine sniff was constitutionally impermissible. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>228 Conn. 62, 67, 634 A.2d 879 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b393-9\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>230 Conn. 372, 645 A.2d 529 (1994), we recently considered a constitutional challenge to the use of a trained narcotics detection dog. In <em>Torres, </em>the defendant claimed that the canine sniff of his automobile was an unconstitutional search under both the federal and the state constitutions because it was not supported by a reasonable and articulable suspicion. Id., 380. We concluded that the police, who had relied upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>highly accurate anonymous tip in stopping and conducting a canine sniff of the defendant\u2019s vehicle, possessed a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the vehicle contained contraband. Id., 384. We declined, however, to reach the issue of whether the canine sniff at issue constituted a search under either the federal or the state constitution \u201cbecause: (1) we have found no case that has held such a sniff of an automobile, properly stopped by the police, to a standard more demanding than reasonable and articulable suspicion ... (2) the defendant in oral argument in this court conceded that standard to be applicable to the facts of this case; and (3) the canine sniff of the defendant\u2019s automobile at issue here was based on reasonable and articulable suspicion.\u201d Id., 381-82; see also <em>State </em>v. Smith, 38 Conn. App. 29, 40-41, 658 A.2d 156 (1995) (even if canine sniff of luggage left unclaimed at airport baggage counter for over five hours constituted search for purposes of fourth amendment, federal constitutional requirements were met since police had reasonable and articulable suspicion regarding contents of luggage).</p>\n<p id=\"A8O\">The present case differs from <em>Torres </em>in three material respects. First, the defendant in this case contends that probable cause, rather than reasonable and articulable suspicion, is the standard to be applied to the canine sniff. Second, this case does not involve the search of an automobile, which is an established exception to the warrant requirement under both the fourth amendment; see <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 90 S. Ct. 1975, 26 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1970); <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 45 S. Ct. 280, 69 L. Ed. 543 (1925); and article first, \u00a7 7. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Delossantos, </em>211 Conn. 258, 559 A.2d 164, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 866, 110 S. Ct. 188, 107 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>209 Conn. 98, 547 A.2d 10 (1988); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>227 Conn. 363, 630 A.2d 1315 (1993). Finally, the defendant in the present case does not dispute that the postal inspector had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the parcel contained contraband. As in <em>Torres, </em>however, we need not, and therefore do not, decide whether, or in what circumstances, a canine sniff constitutes a search for purposes of the state constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 382 (we generally will not consider constitutional question unless its resolution is absolutely necessary to case). We note, however, that \u201c[f]ederal courts that have addressed the issue of whether a canine sniff is a search have come to different results depending on the circumstances of the search and to what extent the search infringes on reasonable expectations of privacy. . . . State courts also have reached varied conclusions under their state constitutions.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 381-82 n.5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b395-7\"> Before embarking upon an analysis of these competing claims, we first note the similarities and distinctions between the two tests. Both are objective standards to be applied from the perspective of a reasonable police officer in light of the totality of the known circumstances. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>236 Conn. 216, 224-25, 673 A.2d 1098 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>226 Conn. 514, 541, 628 A.2d 567 (1993). The two standards differ, however, with respect to the nature and amount of information available to the police. \u201cProbable cause, broadly defined, [comprises] such facts as would reasonably persuade an impartial and reasonable mind not merely to suspect or conjecture, but to believe that criminal activity has occurred.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>supra, 541. In contrast, reasonable and articulable suspicion requires that the investigating officer \u201cbe able to point to specific and [identifiable] facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts,\u201d provide \u201ca particularized and objective basis\u201d for suspecting that criminal activity is afoot. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofield, </em>220 Conn. 38, 45, 595 A.2d 1349 (1991). Consequently, although reasonable and articulable suspicion is more than mere speculation or conjecture; id.; it \u201cis a less demanding standard than probable cause not only in the sense that reasonable suspicion can be established with information that is different in quantity or content than that required to establish probable cause, but also in the sense that reasonable suspicion can arise from information that is less reliable to show probable cause. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Groomes, </em>232 Conn. 455, 468, 656 A.2d 646 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b396-6\"> To the extent the other factors bear even marginal relevance to the issue before us, they do not provide support for the defendant\u2019s claim. First, the text of article first, \u00a7 7, is similar to the language of the fourth amendment; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>227 Conn. 363, 381, 630 A.2d 1315 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 159, 579 A.2d 58 (1990); and, as we discuss more fully hereinafter, the overwhelming weight of authority interpreting the fourth amendment is contrary to the state constitutional argument espoused by the defendant. Second, the history of article first, \u00a7 7, sheds no light on the appropriate standard to be applied to a canine sniff because that investigative technique was unknown at the time our constitution was adopted in 1818. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 381-82; cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>supra, 167 n.12 (article first, \u00a7 7, enacted to prohibit general warrants and writs of assistance). Third, the holdings and dicta of this court and the Appellate Court lend no support to the claim advanced by the defendant. See footnote 13. Finally, the defendant suggests no contemporary economic or sociological considerations that militate in favor of his state constitutional argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\"> Of course, our analysis is guided by the well established principle that a search or seizure conducted without a warrant issued upon probable cause is presumptively unreasonable. See <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>220 Conn. 602, 609, 600 A.2d 1330 (1991). \u201cOur constitutional preference for warrants is overcome only in specific and limited circumstances. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>supra, [222 Conn.] 691 (recognizing emergency exception as matter of state constitutional law); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delossantos, </em>211 Conn. 258, 266-67, 559 A.2d 164, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 866, 110 S. Ct. 188, 107 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1989) (recognizing exception for search incident to arrest as matter of state constitutional law); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>[209 Conn. 98, 126, 547 A.2d 10 (1988)] (recognizing automobile exception on the highway as a matter of state constitutional law).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>227 Conn. 363, 383, 630 A.2d 1315 (1993). Among the other recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the state constitution is the brief detention of an individual for investigative puiposes if the investigating officer has a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the individual has commit! ed or is about to commit a crime. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 223. This exception to the warrant requirement, first recognized under the federal constitution in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968), also permits the officer to conduct a limited weapons search of the detained individual if the officer reasonably believes that the individual might be armed and dangerous. <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>supra, 223-24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\"> In determining that the initial seizure of the luggage for the purpose of subjecting it to a canine sniff was justified upon a showing of reasonable and articulable suspicion, the court balanced \u201cthe nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests against the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion\u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Place, </em>supra, 462 U.S. 703; and concluded that the principles underlying the exception to the probable cause requirement for limited seizures of the person recognized in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968), and its progeny were equally applicable to the detention of the luggage in that. case. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Place, </em>supra, 705-706. The court went on to conclude, however, that the length of the detention of the defendant\u2019s luggage \u201cexceeded the permissible limits of a Terry-type investigative stop.\u201d Id., 709. As previously noted, the defendant in this case challenges only the examination of the parcel by the trained narcotics detection dog, and not the seizure of the parcel or the length of its detention by the investigating officers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b397-8\"> In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 123-24, the United States Supreme Court expressly adopt ed it s conclusion in <em>Place </em>as a holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b399-7\"> State courts considering the question have also concluded that a canine sniff examination of a piece of mail is not a search requiring probable cause for purposes of the fourth amendment.

Sup. 1012 (N.D. Ind. 1979), aff'd in part, 631 F.2d 91 (7th Cir. 1980), is profoundly misplaced. In that, case, local school officials, acting only on a generalized suspicion of drug use in the school, subjected every student at the school to an examination by a trained narcotics detection dog. The dog erroneously alerted to several students, including Doe, who was then compelled to remove her clolhing and subjected to a warrantless body search.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">The facts of this case bear no resemblance whatsoever to the facts in <em>Doe. </em>In the present case, the canine sniff was conducted not on a person \u2014 much less a grade school student \u2014 but on a mail parcel in the possession of the United States Postal Service. In addition, the canine sniff conducted in this case, in contrast to the use of the narcotics detection dog in Doe, was predicated upon a reasonable and particularized suspicion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>the defendant\u2019s parcel contained illegal drugs. Furthermore, the postal inspector in the present case, unlike the school officials in <em>Doe, </em>obtained a search warrant issued upon probable cause prior to conducting a full-blown, invasive search of the mail parcel\u2019s contents. Finally, the defendant has never challenged the accuracy of the canine sniff technique, either in the trial court or in this court. In light of the vast and obvious differences between this case and <em>Doe, </em>we firmly reject the dissent\u2019s suggestion that <em>Doe </em>has any relevance to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b402-7\"> The validity of the <em>Thomas </em>decision has been challenged in light of <em>Place </em>and its progeny.

Ed. 2d 270 (1991) (warrantless search of homeless defendant\u2019s duffel bag and cardboard box that defendant both regarded and utilized as home violated fourth amendment), are also inapposite to this case because neither involved the use of a trained narcotics detection dog to examine the outside of a package lawfully seized for that limited purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Moreover, we disagree with the dissent\u2019s equation of the canine sniff in this ease with the use of the \u201cvapor machine designed to detect the chemical composition of odors\u201d in <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 10. Indeed, in <em>Joyce, </em>we expressly distinguished the chemical analysis conducted in that ease from the canine sniff employed in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Place, </em>supra, 462 U.S. 696, stating that <em>Place </em>\u201cturn[s] on the fact that the [canine sniff] employed detects] only the presence of contraband narcotics, [while] . . . the gas chromatograph test is not designed to detect the presence of contraband, and in fact detects the presence and identity of many organic substances.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>supra, 24 n.17. Although we agree that the use of the canine sniff technique, like most other investigative methods, is not infallible, we disagree with the dissent\u2019s unsupported assertion that \u201ca dog\u2019s sniff can detect many other private facts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b406-9\"> The dissent incorrectly states that our decision \u201cstands the holding in <em>Terry </em>[v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 392 U.S. 1,] on its head.\u201d A canine sniff of the air surrounding a piece of mail reasonably suspected of containing contraband is less an invasion of the defendant\u2019s privacy interest in his parcel than is the brief investigatory detention and weapons patdown of an individual who the police reasonably suspect of engaging in criminal activity, a police practice that is permitted under both the federal and the state constitutions. See footnote 16. Although the canine sniff of a mail parcel in the possession of the United States Postal Service does not involve the exigencies inherent in a <em>Terry </em>stop, the unintrusive nature of the canine sniff, coupled with the state\u2019s legitimate law enforcement objectives, leads us inexorably to the conclusion that any reasonable expectation of privacy that the defendant may have in the area to be examined, namely, the air surrounding his parcel, is satisfied by a showing of reasonable and articulable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Finally, the dissent also characterizes our decision as \u201creach[ing] an absurd result.\u201d Though such an assertion hardly merits a response, we simply reiterate that the conclusion reached by the dissent has been rejected by each and every federal and state court that has considered the use of the canine sniff technique on a parcel of mail.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b406-8\">BERDON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"aab-dedup-0\">dissenting. The majority\u2019s decision today, which allows the police to conduct a search of a person\u2019s personal effects for contraband by way of the sniff of a dog, dangerously leads us down a path that undermines the foundation of article first, \u00a7 7, of our state constitution prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizures. The court concludes that the police, under our state constitution, are entitled to invade the privacy of a person by conducting a search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>without probable cause when they have merely a reasonable and articulable suspicion that a parcel of mail contains contraband. In reaching that conclusion, the majority fails to provide any significant analysis under our state constitution and stands the holding in Terry<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on its head. The majority\u2019s perfunctory application of our state constitutional guarantee loses sight of the fundamental purpose of the protection \u2014 the right of privacy. Like the fourth amendment to our federal constitution, article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution marks that right \u201cas one of the unique values of our civilization . . . <em>McDonald v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 451, 453, 69 S. Ct. 191, 93 L. Ed. 153 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The facts of this case are not in dispute. The postal inspector testified at the suppression hearing that the parcel in question in this case exhibited a number of characteristics of a drug package profile. The characteristics that the postal inspector considered to support his reasonable and articulable suspicion that it contained narcotics were: (1) the edges of the package were taped to seal all openings; (2) the return address was fictitious; (3) the address labels of the package were handwritten; (4) it came from a source state, i.e., California; (5) the size and shape of the package were consistent with one that contained marijuana; and (6) the package was sent via Express Mail through the United States postal service.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These characteristics, plus the sniff by Zak, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>police dog, were the basis upon which the postal inspector determined that he had probable cause to believe that the parcel contained marijuana and upon which he secured a search warrant from a federal magistrate in order to open the parcel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parcel, addressed to the defendant, Jamison Martin Waz, when opened pursuant to the search warrant, contained one half pound of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">This court has previously made clear that our state constitution may provide rights greater than those established by the federal constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>232 Conn. 707, 716-17, 657 A.2d 585 (1995). Nevertheless, in giving independent meaning to the state constitution, we not only rely upon our own precedent and that of our sister states; <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 685, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992); but our analysis may also build upon federal precedent \u201cthat appropriately illuminate[s] open textured provisions in our own organic document . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>216 Conn. 172, 184, 579 A.2d 484 (1990). Whether we apply our own precedent or view the state\u2019s search and seizure clause through the lens of federal precedent, the search by a canine sniff of the parcel addressed to the defendant, and sent by Express Mail, violated the defendant\u2019s state constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">In order to avoid determining whether a dog sniff is a search under our state constitution, the majority assumes for purposes of its decision that it is a search. Notwithstanding this assumption in which the majority purports generously to indulge us, a dog sniff of the defendant\u2019s sealed parcel sent via Express Mail is a search to no lesser extent than the \u201csniff\u2019 by a vapor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>machine designed to detect the chemical composition of odors, which we recently held constituted a search in <em>States. Joyce, </em>229 Conn. 10, 23-24, 639 A.2d 1007 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In making this determination, it must first be determined whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his sealed parcel being sent through the mail. Although the majority seems to minimize the importance of the privacy interests involved in this case, the United States Supreme Court has equated those interests to those that a person has in his or her home. \u201cLetters and sealed packages of this kind in the mail are as fully guarded from examination and inspection, except as to their outward form and weight, <em>as if they were retained by the parties forwarding them in their own domiciles. </em>The constitutional guaranty of the right of the people to be secure in their papers against unreasonable searches and seizures extends to their papers, thus closed against inspection, <em>wherever they may be. </em>Whilst in the mail, they can only be opened and examined under like warrant, issued upon similar oath or affirmation, particularly describing the thing to be seized, as is required when papers are subjected to search in one\u2019s own household. No law of Congress can place in the hands of officials connected with the postal service any authority to invade the secrecy of letters and such sealed packages in the mail; and all regulations adopted as to mail matter of this kind must be in subordination to the great principle embodied in the fourth amendment of the Constitution.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Ex parte Jackson, </em>96 U.S. 727, 733, 24 L. Ed. 877 (1877); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Van Leeuwen, </em>397 U.S. 249, 251, 90 S. Ct. 1029, 25 L. Ed. 2d 282 (1970) (citing <em>Ex parte Jackson </em>and stating that \u201c[i]t has long been held that first-class mail such as letters and sealed packages subject to letter postage \u2014 as distinguished from newspapers, magazines, pamphlets, and other printed matter \u2014 is free from inspection by postal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>authorities, except in the manner provided by the Fourth Amendment\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Huie, </em>593 F.2d 14, 15 (5th Cir. 1979) (implicitly recognizing reasonable expectation of privacy in contents of sealed mailing); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Choate, </em>576 F.2d 165, 174 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 953, 99 S. Ct. 350, 58 L. Ed. 2d 344 (1978) (citing <em>Ex parte Jackson </em>for proposition that fourth amendment\u2019s \u201cprotection against \u2018unreasonable searches and seizures\u2019 protects a citizen against the warrantless opening of sealed letters and packages addressed to him in order to examine the contents\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed, this court recognized this right of privacy with respect to sealed mail in <em>State </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>218 Conn. 85, 103, 588 A.2d 145, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 919, 112 S. Ct. 330, 116 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1991). Clearly, the state constitution embodies this right of privacy \u2014 ranking private mail high on the list of important privacy rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">In <em>Joyce, </em>we stated, with respect to the \u201csniff\u2019 of odors by a vapor detection machine (a chemical analysis of clothing through gas chromatography), that a determination of whether the police action constituted a search was largely answered by the defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy in the object. <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 18-19. Because there is such an expectation of privacy in a person\u2019s parcels sent by mail, an expectation that is heightened and equivalent to that of the home, it is clear, that, like the vapor detection machine in <em>Joyce, </em>a trained dog\u2019s sniff of the odors emitted from a parcel (that cannot be detected by a human being\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>sense of smell) is a search. Indeed, just as in <em>Joyce, </em>it is clear that a dog\u2019s sniff can detect many other private facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nevertheless, I need not dwell on this because, at least for the purposes of this case, the majority concedes that the canine sniff was such a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Once it has been determined that the dog sniff constituted a search, under either the state or federal constitution, this case should end because the postal inspector did not have probable cause based upon the characteristics of the package to conduct that search. The probable cause that the postal inspector relied upon in order to secure the federal search warrant was not based on a reasonable and articulable suspicion, but, rather, was based on what the majority concedes is the search in this case \u2014 that is, the dog sniff. I know of no Connecticut case under the state constitution, and indeed, the majority is unable to point to any federal cases under the United States constitution, that has allowed a search for <em>contraband </em>without probable cause, but merely based upon a reasonable and articulable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">It is also clear that, under our state constitution, a warrant to search is required under the circumstances of this case. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 24-25, the majority of an en banc court rejected the argument that if a search is \u201creasonable,\u201d it passes state constitutional muster. The majority in <em>Joyce </em>held that under \u201cthe state constitution, all warrantless searches, whether or not the police have <em>probable cause </em>to believe that a crime was committed, are per se unreasonable, unless they fall within one of a few specifically established and well delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. Indeed, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>227 Conn. 363, 382-83, 630 A.2d 1315 (1993), former Chief Justice Peters, writing for a majority of the court, stated: \u201cOur [state] constitutional preference for warrants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>reflects a goal of protecting citizens from unjustified police intrusions by interposing a neutral decisionmaker between the police and the object of the proposed search. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>[226 Conn. 514, 546-47, 627 A.2d 567 (1993)]; cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>162 Conn. 440, 444, 294 A.2d 517, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 870, 93 S. Ct. 198, 34 L. Ed. 2d 121 (1972) (purpose of fourth amendment is to require neutral and detached magistrate to make probable cause determination). Accordingly, a search is invalid if the police, without a justification rooted in a valid exception to the warrant requirement, have relied upon only their own probable cause evaluation, even if later found to be correct, before searching. We thus read the two clauses of article first, \u00a7 7, in conjunction \u2014 a warrantless search is per se unreasonable, justified only by limited exceptions \u2014 rather than in disjunction \u2014 a search is valid if it is reasonable, and the presence of a warrant is just one factor in the determination of reasonableness. Cf., e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 423, 512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 423, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986) (construing fourth amendment to bar warrantless searches as per se unreasonable); see generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Larocco, </em>794 P.2d 460, 467-69 (Utah 1990) (extensive discussion of consequences of reading two clauses of fourth amendment in conjunction and in disfunction); R. Bloom, \u2018Warrant Requirement\u2014The Burger Court Approach,\u2019 53 U. Colo. L. Rev. 691 (1982).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In <em>Miller, </em>we delineated those limited exceptions under the state constitution. \u201cOur constitutional preference for warrants is overcome only in specific and limited circumstances. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>supra, [222 Conn.] 691 (recognizing emergency exception as matter of state constitutional law); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delossantos, </em>211 Conn. 258, 266-67, 559 A.2d 164, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 866, 110 S. Ct. 188, 107 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1989) (recognizing exception for search incident to arrest as matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>of state constitutional law); <em>State </em>v. Dukes, [209 Conn. 98, 126, 547 A.2d 10 (1988)] (recognizing .automobile exception on highway as matter of state constitutional law). These recognized exceptions derive primarily from acknowledged interests in protecting the safety of the police and the public and in preserving evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Miller, supra, 227 Conn. 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Specifically, within the context of the fourth amendment, this court made it absolutely clear that a search warrant is required for a search of sealed mail: \u201c \u2018Letters and other sealed packages are in the general class of effects in which the public at large has a legitimate expectation of privacy; <em>warrantless searches of such effects are presumptively unreasonable. </em>Even when government agents may lawfully seize such a package to prevent loss or destruction of suspected contraband, the Fourth Amendment requires that they obtain a warrant before examining the contents of such a package.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 103, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>466 U.S. 109, 114, 104 S. Ct. 1652, 80 L. Ed. 2d 85 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">In my view, <em>Joyce </em>is also dispositive of this case. In <em>Joyce, </em>the police took legal possession of the defendant\u2019s clothing left at the scene of the fire, which was removed from the defendant because he was severely burned. <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 12-13. The state sent the clothing to its laboratory to determine whether they contained odors of an accelerant. Id., 14. This was accomplished merely by a noninvasive method of heating the clothing to vaporize any organic matters. Id., 14-15. The vapors were then run through a machine in order to identify their substance. Id., 15. In suppressing the results of the machine sniffing test under our state constitution, we concluded: First, such a \u201cchemical test [of the vapors by the machine], capable of determining a multitude of private facts about an individual, constituted a search under article first, \u00a7 7, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>of the state constitution.\u201d Id., 24. Second, we stated that \u201cthe state is unable to identify any exception to the warrant requirement that could encompass the war-rantless search of the defendant\u2019s clothes.\u201d Id., 27. The only difference between a dog sniff and a vapor sniff in the chemical laboratory is that in all probability the chemical detection machine is substantially more accurate than the canine nose.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">There is nothing in the record in this case that even comes close to a recognized exception to the warrant requirement. Furthermore, there is nothing in the record that would support probable cause even if that was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Notwithstanding <em>Miller, Mooney </em>and <em>Joyce, </em>the majority relies on other jurisdictions that have concluded under their own state constitutions that even if the canine sniff is a search, it passes state constitutional muster \u201cbecause [1] it was minimally, if at all, intrusive of the defendant\u2019s legitimate privacy rights, and [2] the officer conducting the canine sniff had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the parcel contained illegal drugs.\u201d In essence, the majority opinion and those jurisdictions that are cited in the opinion rely on <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Under our state constitution, we have adopted <em>Terry</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 that; is, \u201ca police officer may briefly detain an individual for investigative purposes if the officer has a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the individual has committed or is about to commit a crime. ... If, during the course of a lawful investigatory detention, the officer reasonably believes that the detained individual might be armed and dangerous, the officer may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>undertake a patdown search of the individual to discover weapons.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>236 Conn. 216, 223-24, 673 A.2d 1098 (1996), citing <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 392 U.S. 21, 24. <em>Terry, </em>however, does not give authority to search for contraband.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It merely authorizes a patdown search in order for the police officer to protect himself and others. Indeed, in <em>Terry, </em>the court carefully stated that \u201c[w]e merely hold today that where a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot and that the persons with whom he is dealing may be armed and presently dangerous, where in the course of investigating this behavior he identifies himself as a policeman and makes reasonable inquiries, and where nothing in the initial stages of the encounter serves to dispel his reasonable fear from his own or others\u2019 safety, he is entitled for the protection of himself and others in the area to conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing of such persons in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to assault him.\u201d <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In the present case, no police officer or any other person was at risk. But even if that were not the case, the search conducted by the police through the dog sniff was not performed to protect the safety of anyone. Rather, the search was to detect marijuana. The search simply cannot pass muster under our state constitution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>If it is assumed that the sniff is a search for federal constitutional analysis, it would then also be invalid under the federal constitution. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Place, </em>462 U.S. 696, 706, 103 S. Ct. 2637, 77 L. Ed. 2d 110 (1983) (\u201c[o]bviously, if [the] investigative procedure is itself a search requiring probable cause, the initial seizure of [the] luggage for the purpose of subjecting it to the sniff test \u2014 no matter how brief \u2014 could not be justified on less than probable cause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">The majority, by applying the principles of a <em>Terry </em>search to a search for contraband, reaches an absurd result that undermines the state\u2019s constitutional search and seizure jurisprudence that this court has developed over the last ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Accordingly, I would reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand the case with direction to suppress the evidence illegally obtained from the parcel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-9\"> <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.

Surely, the size, shape and outward appearance of the package \u2014 that it was heavily taped, that the labels were handwritten, that it originated from California, and that it was sent via Express Mail \u2014 are all innocuous factors whether singularly or collectively considered. Millions of packages meet these criteria. In this case, the only feature noticed by the postal inspector that could give rise to a question would be the fictitious return address, and that alone should not constitute a reasonable and articulable suspicion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b408-9\"> For the purposes of the analysis of this case, the warrant obtained by the postal inspector is irrelevant because the majority, for the purposes of this case, concedes that the dog sniff was the search.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b410-7\"> I can understand why the federal government turned this case over for state prosecution, notwithstanding that the investigation was conducted by federal postal inspectors and a federal warrant was secured to search the package that was in the mail.

Ed. 2d 54 (1985), where the Second Circuit Court of Appeals found that the canine sniff of the exterior of a home constituted an unconstitutional search, it is questionable whether the canine sniff of mail for contraband would pass Second Circuit muster.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b411-6\"> It is obvious to me that the majority\u2019s confusion emanates from its reliance on dicta in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Place, </em>462 U.S. 696, 706-707, 103 S. Ct. 2637, 77 L. Ed. 2d 110 (1983). The dicta in <em>Place </em>indicated that the dog sniff of the luggage located in a public place was permissible because, under the circumstances of that case, it was not a search under the federal constitution. Id. The majority, in its reliance on <em>Place, </em>overlooks its concession in this case that the dog sniff of the parcel was a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">In <em>Place, </em>the court, relied primarily upon the unique nature of the dog sniff, which only discloses narcotics. Id., 707. These dog sniffs, however, do not always disclose the presence or absence of narcotics. One commentator has stated that \u201c[t]his is because these dogs are not fool-proof and thus their use sometimes leads to serious intrusions upon the privacy of innocent people. The classic example is <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Renfrow, </em>[475 F. Sup. 1012 (N.D. Ind. 1979), aff'd in part, 631 F.2d 91 (7th Cir. 1980)] where such a dog \u2018alerted\u2019 to a 13-year-old girl during a school-wide \u2018sniff of all students. This dog continued to \u2018alert\u2019 even after she emptied her pockets, so she was then subjected to a nude search by two women; no drugs were found, but <em>it was later discovered that she had been playing that morning with her dog, who was in heat. </em>This was not an isolated instance of error. The dogs used in this undertaking alerted to some fifty students, only 17 of whom were found to be in possession of drugs.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure (3d Ed. 1996) \u00a7 2.2 (f), p. 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The outrageous indignity that the thirteen year old girl was put through was not only as a result of the complete body search, but also the initial sniff search of her person. Although not raised in this case, it clearly demonstrates the unreliability of the dog sniff. I take it from footnote 20 of the majority opinion in this case that the majority would at least conclude that a dog sniff search of the person, under our state constitution, would be unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">In addition, although the majority in <em>Joyce </em>did not decide whether a dog sniff was a search under the state constitution, the court pointed out what it thought was a distinction between the dog sniff and the vapor analysis of the clothing. <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 24 n.17. The court stated that the dog sniff detected \"only the presence of contraband narcotics, and the possession of narcotics is not a \u2018private fact\u2019 under the fourth amendment.\u201d Id. In <em>Joyce, </em>we were obviously wrong with respect to the dog sniff. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Renfrow, </em>supra, 475 F. Sup. 1012; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>$639,558.00 in United States Currency, </em>955 F.2d 712, 714 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (indicating that dog alerted to traces of cocaine adhering to currency in traveler\u2019s luggage, but no cocaine was found, and noting estimates that 75 to 97 percent of all currency contains sufficient traces of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>cocaine to alert trained dogs); 1 W. LaFave, supra, \u00a7 2.2 (f), p. 450 n.239 (\u201cit sometimes happens in practice that a drug dog alert will lead to nothing but currency\u201d). \u201c[A] court considering whether a dog sniff provides probable cause . . . may have to take into account the possibility that the dog signalled only the presence of money, not drugs.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>$639,558.00 in United States Currency, </em>supra, 714 n.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b415-10\"> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>223 Conn. 635, 654, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>216 Conn. 172, 184, 579 A.2d 484 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b416-7\"> The majority in this case seems to justify the search on the basis that it is not as intrusive as the <em>Terry </em>search. See footnote 25 of the majority opinion. The majority fails to understand that we have tolerated the <em>Terry search </em>not as an aid for the investigative purposes of law enforcement, but solely to protect the police officer and others while the police are performing those duties. A <em>Terry </em>search would never pass federal or state constitutional muster if the police use it as a pretext to get in through the back door what it could not get through the front door under the constitutional protections. If this were so, the <em>Terry </em>search could easily be expanded to become the weapon of a police state.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
