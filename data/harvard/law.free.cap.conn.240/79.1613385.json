Because we conclude that the trial court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> stated that it had considered the criteria enumerated in the relevant statutes and that the trial court need not have referred specifically to such statutes, we reverse the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The following facts are relevant. The plaintiff, Rimiko Caffe, commenced an action against the defendant, Benedict Caffe, for the dissolution of marriage, alimony, custody and support of the parties\u2019 minor child, and allocation of the marital home and other property. After a trial lasting fourteen days, the trial court issued a lengthy memorandum of decision granting a dissolution of the marriage, resolving the various financial matters, and determining custody and visitation of the couple\u2019s minor child. The defendant appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>quently filed a motion for articulation asking the trial court whether it had considered, among other things, the parties\u2019 financial affidavits when calculating its award. The trial court responded that it had considered these affidavits, which detailed the parties\u2019 income, expenses, assets and liabilities. In its original memorandum of decision, the trial court had discussed the length of the marriage, the plaintiffs health problems and employability, and the defendant\u2019s fault in the breakup of the marriage, and referred, in detail, to the defendant\u2019s income and assets. Specifically, the trial court discussed child support, alimony, communications between the parties regarding the upbringing of then-child, the parties\u2019 incomes, school tuition, health and life insurance, allocation of the marital property, allocation of the minor child\u2019s tax deduction eligibility for puiposes of claiming income tax dependency, and payment of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The Appellate Court directed a new trial on the financial matters, concluding that the trial court should \u201cmake some reference to the statute or statutes involved so that appellate courts will have guidance as to whether a court\u2019s discretion is being exercised properly.\u201d <em>Caffe </em>v. <em>Caffe, </em>40 Conn. App. 178, 179, 669 A.2d 629 (1996). We granted the plaintiffs petition for certification for review of the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the trial court\u2019s judgment should not have been reversed because the court was not required to cite the statutory criteria upon which its decision was based. Conversely, the defendant argues that the trial court was required to cite the statutory criteria it had considered and to make explicit findings as to each criteria. We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81, 46b-82 and 46b-84<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> set forth the criteria that a trial court must consider when resolving property and alimony disputes in a dissolution of marriage action. The court must consider <em>all </em>of these criteria. <em>Siracusa </em>v. <em>Siracusa, </em>30 Conn. App. 560, 566, 621 A.2d 309 (1993). It need not, however, make explicit reference to the statutory criteria that it considered in making its decision or make express findings as to each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>statutory factor. \u201cA ritualistic rendition of each and every statutory element would serve no useful purpose.\u201d <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>188 Conn. 736, 740, 453 A.2d 1151 (1982). Further, the trial court is vested with wide discretion and broad powers in resolving such matters. <em>Rostain </em>v. <em>Rostain, </em>213 Conn. 686, 689, 569 A.2d 1126 (1990). Therefore, the \u201ctrial court is free to weigh the relevant statutory criteria without having to detail what importance it has assigned to the various statutory factors.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Collucci </em>v. <em>Collucci, </em>33 Conn. App. 536, 539, 636 A.2d 1364 (1994); see also <em>Rummel </em>v. <em>Rummel, </em>33 Conn. App. 214, 222, 635 A.2d 295 (1993); <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>25 Conn. App. 693, 701, 596 A.2d 23 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Appellate courts look at the record, and determine whether \u201cthe [trial] court either incorrectly applied the law or could not reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d <em>Weiman </em>v. <em>Weiman, </em>188 Conn. 232, 234-35, 449 A.2d 151 (1982). Our review of the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision and its articulation convinces us that the trial court made sufficient reference, perhaps not in form but in substance, to the factors it considered so that an appellate court would have guidance as to whether the trial court\u2019s discretion was properly exercised. Accordingly, the fact that the trial court did not explicitly refer to the statutes governing its analysis in no way suggests that its analysis was incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court with direction to consider the defendant\u2019s remaining claims on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\"> Unfortunately, the judge trial referee, <em>Hon.

O\u2019Sullivan, </em>died during the pendency of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b102-8\"> The defendant raised the following issues before the Appellate Court: (1) \u201cDid the court fail to consider the appropriate statutory criteria and grant an unreasonable distribution of assets and inequitable awards of alimony and child support, thereby abusing its discretion?\u201d (2) \u201cWas the trial court\u2019s inference of adultery based on erroneous findings of fact that are contradicted by the testimony of witnesses and statements made by the court during the trial?\u201d and (3) \u201cWas the defendant denied a fair trial when the court continuously allowed [the] plaintiffs counsel to coach her witnesses through the use of leading questions and improper objections despite defense counsel\u2019s repeated objections and motions for mistrial?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b104-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 provides in relevant part: \u201cAssignment of property and transfer of title ....</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\u201c(c) In fixing the nature and value of the property, if any, to be assigned, the court, after hearing the witnesses, if any, of each party . . . shall consider the length of the marriage, the causes for the annulment, dissolution of the marriage or legal separation, the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties and the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income.

It is within the Appellate Court\u2019s discretion to dismiss the defendant\u2019s appeal under such circumstances. <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>191 Conn. 309, 313, 464 A.2d 771 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b106-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>BORDEN, J., with whom KATZ, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Anc\">joins, concurring. I agree with the majority and join its opinion. I write separately to elaborate on several points that are implicit in the majority\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">We granted the plaintiffs petition for certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court, limited to the following issue: \u201cUnder the circumstances of this dissolution of marriage case, did the Appellate Court properly reverse the judgment of the trial court as to financial matters on the ground that the trial court did not refer to the statutes governing such matters?\u201d <em>Caffe </em>v. <em>Caffe, </em>236 Conn. 917, 673 A.2d 1144 (1996). The Appellate Court had reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment on the basis of the following rationale: \u201cThe [trial] court\u2019s only relevant conclusion was that the fault for the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage was that of the defendant. Although a court need not make express findings on each of the statutory criteria, or give equal weight to each of them, <em>it should, at least, make some reference to the statute or statutes involved so that appellate courts will have guidance as to whether a court\u2019s discretion is being exercised properly.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Caffe </em>v. <em>Caffe, </em>40 Conn. App. 178, 179, 669 A.2d 629 (1996). In my view, this misreads the record, and is inconsistent with the usual role of an appellate court in reviewing a trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">This statement by the Appellate Court misreads the record in this case because the reason for the breakdown of the marriage was not the only statutory factor that the trial court specifically mentioned in its memorandum of decision. It also specifically referred to the plaintiffs health and employability. The trial court specifically stated: \u201cThe court notes that the plaintiff claims she has limitations in her ability to find work. She shall forthwith apply for social security disability benefits.\u201d Furthermore, the trial court, in its articulation filed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>response to the Appellate Court\u2019s order,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> specifically stated that the parties\u2019 financial affidavits \u201cwere in fact reviewed by the court and used in making the rulings on the financial matters as set out in its memorandum of decision.\u201d This statement clearly indicates that the trial court considered the statutory criteria of the parties\u2019 income, expenses, assets and liabilities, because those are the factors disclosed by their affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The rationale of the Appellate Court is inconsistent with our jurisprudence regarding the role of an appellate court in reviewing a trial court\u2019s judgment because the usual rule is that the trial court is presumed to have applied the law correctly, and it is the burden of the appellant to show to the contrary. See <em>DiBerardino </em>v. DiBerardino, 213 Conn. 373, 385, 568 A.2d 431 (1990). Indeed, even if the trial court record is ambiguous, we read the record to support, rather than to undermine, the judgment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Crumpton, </em>202 Conn. 224, 232, 520 A.2d 226 (1987). Reversing the trial court solely because, in issuing its decision, it did not specifically \u201cmake some reference to the statute or statutes involved,\u201d is inconsistent with that body of jurisprudence, and elevates the form of what the trial court did over its substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">In this case, the trial court heard evidence for fourteen days, during which time it took seventy-seven pages of notes. The court issued an eleven page written memorandum of decision detailing its findings as to the cause of the marital breakdown, as well as its orders on the following items: alimony; custody and visitation; child support; consultation between the parties regarding the upbringing of the minor child; allocation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>assets and liabilities; the plaintiffs health and ability to work; health and life insurance; school tuition for the child; attorney\u2019s fees; and allocation of the child for purposes of claiming an income tax dependency. There is no reason to believe, and the defendant did not establish, that in undertaking this task the trial court did so without taking into account the applicable law. Although it is preferable that the trial court refer to the relevant statutes, the fact that the court did not refer to the statutes that governed its task does not establish that it disregarded them.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Finally, the reason given by the Appellate Court for its apparent requirement that the trial court refer to the applicable statutes \u2014 \u201cso that appellate courts will have guidance as to whether a court\u2019s discretion is being exercised properly\u201d \u2014 is unpersuasive. Appellate courts routinely decide cases involving the exercise of discretion by trial courts without the benefit of the trial court having specifically cited the statute, case law or legal criteria governing that exercise. There is no reason to impose a greater burden of appellate review in cases involving marital dissolution. Our task is to examine the record and to determine whether \u201cthe court either incorrectly applied the law or could not reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d <em>Weiman </em>v. <em>Weiman, </em>188 Conn. 232, 234-35, 449 A.2d 151 (1982).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-8\"> The trial court was asked by the defendant, in his motion for articulation, to respond to the following question: \u201cCan the Court articulate the proper statutory and common law criteria applied in its decision after weighing the evidence presented?\u201d The court declined to do so because it considered the question \u201ctoo vague and general.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
