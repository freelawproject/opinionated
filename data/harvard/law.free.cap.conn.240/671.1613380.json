We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">In June, 1993, misconduct charges against the plaintiff were brought to the attention of the committee. When the committee failed to act within the statutory period, the plaintiff brought this action for injunctive relief in the Superior Court. Determining that the committee\u2019s failure to render a decision on a grievance complaint within the prescribed time period was not cause to dismiss the complaint, the trial court rendered judgment denying the plaintiffs request 1\u2019or a permanent injunction against any further action by the committee. The Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court, concluding that the committee\u2019s failure to comply with the statutory time period required dismissal of the underlying complaint. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>41 Conn. App. 671, 677 A.2d 960 (1996). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude the failure of the statewide grievance committee to comply with the timing requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 51-90g (g) and Practice Book \u00a7 27J (i) deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction over a complaint for attorney misconduct?\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>239 Conn. 905, 682 A.2d 999 (1996). We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">As the Appellate Court stated, \u201c[t]here is no dispute about the essential facts. The plaintiff, referred to anonymously in his verified complaint as John Doe,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>attorney licensed to practice law in the state of Connecticut. On June 18,1993, the grievance panel of the judicial district of New Haven, geographical area number six (local grievance panel), commenced grievance proceedings against the plaintiff by filing a complaint<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> with the committee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On August 31, 1993, the local grievance panel determined that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of probable cause that the plaintiff was guilty of misconduct. The local grievance panel filed its determination of no probable cause with the committee on September 2, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">\u201cOn December 16, 1993, the committee informed the plaintiff that, contrary to the determination of the local grievance panel, there was sufficient probable cause to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>hold a hearing to determine whether the plaintiff was guilty of misconduct. The committee took no further action until February 8,1994, when it assigned the matter to a subcommittee and scheduled a March 9, 1994 healing. As of February 8, 1994, more than 120 days had elapsed since the local grievance panel filed its determination of no probable cause. On March 9, 1994, the plaintiff appeared before the subcommittee and filed a motion to dismiss the grievance proceedings on jurisdictional grounds. The subcommittee denied the plaintiffs motion. Thereafter, on March 10, 1994, the plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the grievance proceedings with the committee based on the same jurisdictional grounds. The committee denied the plaintiffs motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">\u201cThe plaintiff commenced this action seeking to enjoin the committee from taking any further action on the underlying grievance complaint. The plaintiffs complaint alleges that the committee is without jurisdiction to take further action in this matter and its failure to render a decision within the statutory time period deprived the plaintiff of his due process rights. On October 25, 1994, the trial court rendered judgment denying the plaintiffs request for a permanent injunction.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 672-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">On appeal, the Appellate Court, principally relying upon this court\u2019s decision in <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Rozbicki, </em>211 Conn. 232, 558 A.2d 986 (1989), concluded that the legislature, with the acquiescence of the judicial branch as demonstrated by Practice Book \u00a7 27J, intended \u00a7 51-90g (g) to preclude the trial court from exercising its inherent authority over attorney conduct in cases in which the committee has failed to comply with the time limitations. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Statewide </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number><em>Grievance Committee, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 678.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion was based upon its determinations that \u00a7 51-90g (g) is mandatory in nature and contains no language similar to that in \u00a7 51-90g (c) \u2014 the provision at issue in <em>Rozbicki </em>\u2014 authorizing the committee to take discretionary action in the event of a delay. Although we agree that this case is necessarily influenced by <em>Rozbicki, </em>we conclude that there is no legislative intent that the failure to comply with the timing requirements of \u00a7 51-90g (g) should deprive either the defendant or the court of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">We begin with this court\u2019s decision in <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Rozbicki, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 232, wherein we held that the defendant\u2019s failure to act within the time constraints of General Statutes (Rev. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>to 1987) \u00a7 51-90g (c),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> did not require dismissal of the complaint absent a showing of prejudice. Our decision was premised largely upon the broad supervisory role of the judiciary in governing attorney conduct. We emphasized that \u201cthe rules regulating attorney grievance procedures exist within the broader framework of the relationship between attorneys and the judiciary. The practice of law is ... a profession the main purpose of which is to aid in the doing of justice .... An attorney as an officer of the court in the administration of justice, is continually accountable to it for the manner in which he exercises the privilege which has been accorded him. . . . This unique position as officers and commissioners of the court . . . casts attorneys in a special relationship with the judiciary and subjects them to its discipline.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 237-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">We further stated that \u201c[bjecause of this special relationship, [w]e have a continuing duty to make it entirely clear that the standards of conduct ... of the mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>bers of the profession of the law in Connecticut have not changed, and that those standards will be applied under our rules of law, in the exercise of a reasonable discretion . . . [and t]his court will neither neglect nor attempt to avoid that responsibility.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Consequently, our review of \u00a7 51-90g (c) was \u201cinformed by the judiciary\u2019s responsibility for governing attorney conduct. Disciplinary proceedings are for the purpose of preserving the courts from the official ministration of persons unfit to practise in them. . . . The proceeding to disbar [or suspend] an attorney is neither a civil action nor a criminal proceeding, but is aproceed-ing sui generis, the object of which is not the punishment of the offender, but the protection of the court. . . . Once the complaint is made, the court controls the situation and procedure, in its discretion, as the interests of justice may seem to it to require. . . . [T]he power of the courts is left unfettered to act as situations, as they may arise, may seem to require, for efficient discipline of misconduct and the purging of the bar from the taint of unfit membership. Such statutes as ours are not restrictive of the inherent powers which reside in courts to inquire into the conduct of their own officers, and to discipline them for misconduct. . . . In proceedings such as those at issue, therefore, the attorney\u2019s relations to the tribunal and the character and purpose of the inquiry are such that unless it clearly appears that his rights have in some substantial way been denied him, the action of the court will not be set aside upon review. . . . Consequently, ministerial delays do not ordinarily warrant judicial abstention from dealing with the important issues raised by allegations of attorney misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">\u201cThe regulation of attorney conduct is, therefore, within the court\u2019s inherent authority. Section 51-90g and the parallel Practice Book rules authorized the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>grievance committee to act as an arm of the court in fulfilling this responsibility. Requiring the grievance committee to dismiss a complaint whenever the . . . subcommittee has failed to act in a timely manner, with no discretion to pursue another course of action if appropriate, would frustrate the purposes of attorney grievance procedures and run counter to the special supervisory role of the courts in regulating attorney conduct. We will, therefore, require such action only if specifically so directed by \u00a7 51-90g (c).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 238-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In <em>Rozbicki, </em>we thereafter examined \u00a7 51-90g (c) in order to decide whether its time requirements were mandatory and, if so, whether the statutory mandates had been violated and what effect such a violation has on the jurisdiction of the Superior Court. We held that the provision\u2019s use of the word \u201cshall\u201d was mandatory, but concluded nevertheless that its violation did not require a dismissal of the complaint.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cBoth the broader context of the supervisory role of the judiciary in governing attorney conduct, as discussed above, and the language of \u00a7 51-90g (c) support the conclusion that the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction was not affected by the delay. The operative language on which we focus is . . . the [final] phrase of \u00a7 51-90g (c) requiring the grievance committee after subcommittee delay to \u2018determine the appropriate course of action.\u2019 . . . We will not, therefore, construe \u00a7 51-90g (c) to require that if the subcommittee has failed to act within the prescribed time, and there is no showing of prejudice, the complaint must be dismissed. Such a construction would impermissibly render the final phrase in \u00a7 51-90g (c) a nullity.\u201d (Cita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>tions omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 242-43. Accordingly, we concluded that the subcommittee\u2019s failure to act within the prescribed time, although a violation of \u00a7 51-90g (c), did not mandate dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">We agree with the Appellate Court that the issue in this case is informed by <em>Rozbicki. </em>We also conclude, however, that it would be inconsistent with the concerns expressed in <em>Rozbicki </em>regarding the supervisory role of the court, and the purposes of attorney grievance procedures, to interpret \u00a7 51-90g (g) in such a way as to decide this case based solely upon the omission of the discretionary language contained in \u00a7 51-90g (c). Rather, in light of those concerns, we conclude that the time limits in issue are directory, and that in the absence of any language expressly denying the committee the authority to review alleged attorney misconduct and stripping the court of its subject matter jurisdiction over attorney misconduct due to the committee\u2019s failure to comply with the time requirements of \u00a7 51-90g (g), the legislature did not intend such a result.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">\u201cWell established principles of statutory construction govern our determination of whether a statutory time period is mandatory or directory. Our fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . The test to be applied in determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>ing whether a statute is mandatory or directory is whether the prescribed mode of action is the essence of the thing to be accomplished, or in other words, whether it relates to a matter of substance or a matter of convenience. . . . If it is a matter of substance, the statutory provision is mandatory. If, however, the legislative provision is designed to secure order, system and dispatch in the proceedings, it is generally held to be directory, especially where the requirement is stated in affirmative terms unaccompanied by negative words.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Tunxis Service Center, </em>237 Conn. 71, 76-77, 676 A.2d 819 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Looking solely at the words of \u00a7 51-90g (g), it would appear that the language requires that the committee \u201crender its decision not later than four months from the date of the panel\u2019s determination of probable cause or no probable cause was filed with the state-wide grievance committee.\u201d Definitive words, such as \u201cmust\u201d or \u201cshall,\u201d ordinarily express legislative mandates of anon-directory nature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 410, 645 A.2d 965 (1994); <em>Lo Sacco </em>v. <em>Young, </em>210 Conn. 503, 507, 555 A.2d 986 (1989); <em>Caulkins </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>200 Conn. 713, 717, 513 A.2d 43 (1986); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </em>174 Conn. 229, 233, 384 A.2d 384 (1978). \u201cWe have noted, however, that the use of the word \u2018shall,\u2019 though significant, does not invariably establish a mandatory duty. <em>Hall Manor Owner\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>212 Conn. 147, 152, 561 A.2d 1373 (1989); see, e.g., <em>Fidelity Trust Co. </em>v. <em>BVD Associates, </em>196 Conn. 270, 278, 492 A.2d 180 (1985).\u201d <em>Angelsea Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>236 Conn. 681, 690, 674 A.2d 1300 (1996). Therefore, we turn to the other aforementioned considerations in deciding whether \u00a7 51-90g (g) is directory or mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">\u201cOne . . . reliable guide in determining whether a statutory provision is directory or mandatory is whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>the failure of the state to comply with its provisions results in either a penalty or a requirement that the state seek an extension of time. <em>Caron </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Commission, </em>222 Conn. 269, 273-74, 610 A.2d 584 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>169 Conn. 223, 238, 363 A.2d 143, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1025, 96 S. Ct. 469, 46 L. Ed. 2d 399 (1975).\u201d <em>Angelsea Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 695. It is noteworthy that the legislature elected not to include either option in the language of \u00a7 51-90g (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Another guide to interpreting subsection (g) of \u00a7 51-90g is to look to other provisions governing the powers and duties of the committee. See <em>Murchison </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>234 Conn. 35, 45, 660 A.2d 850 (1995) (\u201c[i]n order to determine the meaning of a statute, we must consider the statute as a whole when reconciling its separate parts in order to render a reasonable overall interpretation\u201d); <em>University of Connecticut Chapter, AAUP </em>v. <em>Governor, </em>200 Conn. 386, 399, 512 A.2d 152 (1986) (statute to be read \u201cas a whole, with a view toward reconciling its separate parts in order to render a reasonable overall interpretation\u201d). As we held in <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Rozbicki, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 239, the failure to comply with the time constraints of \u00a7 51-90g (c) does not deprive the court of jurisdiction. Therefore, were we to agree with the plaintiffs interpretation of \u00a7 51-90g (g), we would in essence be stating that the committee, in cases in which the subcommittee conducts the hearing, would, after 120 days, have more power in its review of subcommittee delay to assess appropriate action than the Superior Court, in those cases in which the committee has failed, after essentially the same period of time, to assign the complaint for a hearing, would have over such committee delay. Such a pronounced dichotomy between, on the one hand, <em>allowing </em>the committee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>authority to review delay, and, on the other hand, <em>denying </em>the court any authority to review delay would be problematic at best. We should not construe statutory language to mandate such a curious result.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Additionally, we note that General Statutes \u00a7 51-90h (b) provides that within sixty days after the fourteen day period for the filing of statements in support of or in opposition to the subcommittee\u2019s proposed decision, the committee is required to issue a decision. That same subsection also provides, however, that the committee may instead refer the complaint to the same or a different subcommittee for further investigation and a proposed decision, in which event there are no additional time constraints imposed. To interpret \u00a7 51-90g (g) as mandatory and as imposing a jurisdictional constraint, when neither \u00a7 51-90g (c) nor \u00a7 51-90h have time constraints that have jurisdictional implications, would be inconsistent and indeed unreasonable. Because we read statutes \u201c \u2018with common sense so as to accomplish a reasonable result\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Chiarizio, </em>8 Conn. App. 673, 682, 514 A.2d 370, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 809, 515 A.2d 379 (1986); we are inclined, in the face of these other provisions, to reject the plaintiffs invitation to interpret \u00a7 51-90g (g) as mandatory in nature and as establishing a jurisdictional constraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">This inclination is buttressed by the legislative history relative to \u00a7 51-90g (g). That history indicates that the revision of attorney discipline procedures in 1986 was influenced by a concern for the public and for expediency in the disciplinary process for the benefit of the public as well as for those facing charges. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 683 <em>(Schaller, J., </em>concurring). It does not, however, reflect an intent to limit judicial branch involvement over attorney grievance complaints. Indeed, not only is there no indication of an intent to limit the jurisdiction of the court, but, to the contrary, the legislators <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>expressed deference to the judiciary. See 28 H.R. Proc., Pt. 23, 1985 Sess., pp. 8538-45, 8547-48, 8554-55. Indeed, the legislature in the primary debate recognized that the court is \u201cthe ultimate authority as to attorneys, in how they are disciplined.\u201d Id., p. 8542, remarks of Representative Richard T. Tulisano. The debate in the House of Representatives reflects concern with judicial independence and the rule-making authority of the court relative to the attorney disciplinary process, not jurisdictional considerations. Id., pp. 8542-55. Nothing in the legislative history specifically supports a mandatory linguistic interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">It is well settled that statutes are to be read as favoring subject matter jurisdiction, absent a clear indication of legislative intent to limit it. <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 757, 765, 628 A.2d 1303 (1993). There is no such clear indication here. We therefore are brought full circle to the puipose of the comprehensive disciplinary scheme before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">\u201cAn attorney as an officer of the court in the administration of justice, is <em>continually </em>accountable to it for the manner in which he exercises the privilege which has been accorded him. His admission is upon the implied condition that his continued enjoyment of the right conferred is dependent upon his remaining a fit and safe person to exercise it, so that when he, by misconduct in any capacity, discloses that he has become or is an unfit or unsafe person to be entrusted with the responsibilities and obligations of an attorney, his right to continue in the enjoyment of his professional privilege may and ought to be declared forfeited. . . . Therefore, [i]f a court disciplines an attorney, it does so not to mete out punishment to an offender, but [so] that the administration of justice may be safeguarded and the courts and the public protected from the misconduct or unfitness of those who are licensed to perform the important functions of the legal profession.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>(Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Massameno </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>234 Conn. 539, 554-55, 663 A.2d 317 (1995). In light of these very strong public policy concerns for attorney accountability, and the need for public confidence in the justice system, it would be improper to interpret \u00a7 51-90g (g) to create mandatory jurisdictional limitations that would ultimately undermine the long-standing law regarding the inherent authority of the court to regulate attorney conduct.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">In this opinion BORDEN, PALMER and PETERS, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-11\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 51-90g (g), now \u00a7 51-90g (h), provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen the committee conducts the hearing or hearings under this section, it shall render its decision not later than four months from the date the panel\u2019s determination of probable cause or no probable cause was filed with the state-wide grievance committee. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">Number 93-370, \u00a7 2, of the 1993 Public Acts amended \u00a7 51-90g by inserting a new subsection (g) and redesignating the former subsection (g) as subsection (h).

Examining the legislative history of \u00a7 51-90g (g), and challenging the majority\u2019s reliance on that history, Judge Schaller remarked that the purpose of expediting the process was at least as much for the benefit of the public as for those facing charges of misconduct and that \u201c[t]he result that [they] are compelled to reach in this case seriously diminishes any benefit to the public.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>supra, 41 Conn.

As we explain in this opinion, we disagree with the plaintiffs interpretation of the language of \u00a7 51-90g (g) and its jurisdictional implications. In cases of alleged attorney misconduct, the jurisdiction of the committee and the jurisdiction of the court are necessarily intertwined and \u00a7 51-90g (g) must be interpreted in light of the broad framework of that relationship. Furthermore, as a matter of common sense, we note that it is neither expected nor necessary that language giving the committee control over its own delay would appear in the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b699-7\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 51-90g (e) provided: \u201cThe subcommittee shall conclude any hearing or hearings and shall render its proposed decision not later than ninety days from the dat e the panel\u2019s determination of probable cause or no probable cause was filed with the state-wide grievance committee.

Rozbicki, </em>211 Conn. 232, 237-38, 558 A.2d 986 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">I begin by setting forth the procedural framework for complaints filed under the statewide grievance system.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Essentially, this system provides three tiers of review. First, a local grievance panel reviews a grievance complaint to determine whether probable cause exists to warrant further investigation. General Statutes \u00a7 51-90f (a); Practice Book \u00a7 27F (c). Second, the committee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>or at its designation, a subcommittee, reviews the local panel\u2019s determination. General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 51-90g (a); Practice Book \u00a7 27J (c). Finally, if a subcommittee performs the review, it must issue a proposed decision to the committee, or if the committee itself conducts the review, it renders a final decision. General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 51-90g (a), (c), (f) and (g); Practice Book \u00a7 27J (c), (e), (h) and (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Our focus in this case is the procedural requirements with respect to the committee once the local panel has made a determination of probable cause or no probable cause. Under \u00a7 51-90g (a), the committee or a subcommittee may review the local panel\u2019s determination. If the committee refers the matter to a subcommittee, the subcommittee is required to render a proposed decision within ninety days of the local panel\u2019s determination, unless the subcommittee moves for an extension of thirty days, which shall only be granted for good cause. General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 51-90g (c). If the committee itself conducts the review, then it must render a final decision within four months of the local panel\u2019s determination. General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 51-90g (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The time limit on subcommittee action in subsection (c) contains a savings clause, which provides that the subcommittee\u2019s failure to complete its action within the prescribed time period is not necessarily cause for dismissal. In such circumstances, the committee can, on its own initiative or on motion of the complainant or respondent, inquire into the delay and \u201cdetermine the appropriate course of action.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 51-90g (c). In contrast to the provisions relating to subcommittee action, the General Assembly and the judges of the Superior Court did not provide a savings clause for the committee itself when it fails to abide by the four month time limit to review the local panel\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>In reaching its conclusion, the majority today ignores the mandate in \u00a7 51-90g (g), the statute\u2019s legislative history and our own rules of practice, and stands the precedent of <em>Rozbicki </em>on its head. In other words, according to the majority, \u201cshall\u201d means shall when the court wants it to mean shall, but \u201cshall\u201d does not mean shall when the court is of another mind.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">My analysis starts, as the Appellate Court\u2019s did, with the plain language of the statute. General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 51-90g (g) provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen the committee conducts the hearing or hearings under this section, <em>it shall render its decision not later than four months </em>from the date the panel\u2019s determination of probable cause or no probable cause was filed with the state-wide grievance committee. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is undisputed that more than four months elapsed from the time that the local grievance panel filed its determination of no probable cause to the time that the committee referred the matter to a subcommittee. I, like the Appellate Court, conclude that \u201cthis language clearly and unambiguously mandates that the committee complete its action within four months. \u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance </em>Committee, 41 Conn. App. 671, 676, 677 A.2d 960 (1996). \u201cWhere the meaning of a statute ... is plain and unambiguous, the enactment speaks for itself and there is no occasion to construe it. Its unequivocal meaning is not subject to modification by way of construction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>omitted.) <em>Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Trantolo, </em>192 Conn. 15, 22, 470 A.2d 228 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Furthermore, even if \u00a7 51-90g (g) were ambiguous, the legislative history supports the conclusion that the legislature intended the time limits in \u00a7 51-90g (g) to be mandatory. In 1986, the legislature revised the statute to include the requirement that the committee render its decision within four months of the local panel\u2019s determination. Public Acts 1986, No. 86-276, \u00a7 8 (P.A. 86-276). In enacting this amendment, the legislature emphasized the importance of the newly-added four month time frame for committee action. \u201cThe amendment maintains . . . that if you\u2019re going to have a hearing with probable cause, that must be held within four months . . . .\u201d 28 H.R. Proc., Pt. 23, 1985 Sess., p. 8562, remarks of Representative Richard D. Tulisano. As another legislator stated: \u201cOnce the determination is made that there is probable cause to continue to a full hearing, at that point within the four months, the hearing would have to take place. . . . One of the complaints of the community has been that it takes too long for this grievance procedure to take place. It is hoped that this would tighten that up.\u201d Id., pp. 8529-30, remarks of Representative William L. Wollenberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Indeed, the legislature underscored the need to establish rigid guidelines for the investigation of complaints of misconduct in order to bolster public confidence in the process as well as to protect the rights of attorneys who are involved. \u201c[I]t is extremely important at this point that the public know how the system works, that it have some assurance that the standards are going to be laid down and observed consistently, and I think this advances [the statute] by . . . eliminating some of the abuses without itself becoming abusive to those whose professional integrity may be at stake.\u201d Id., p. 8561, remarks of Representative Richard Blumenthal. Accordingly, the legislative history reflects that the leg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>islature intended that the committee must render a decision within four months of the filing of a complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Furthermore, when the judiciary acquiesced in the time limitation imposed by P.A. 86-276, \u00a7 8, in 1986, we used the identical language in Practice Book \u00a7 27J (i): \u201c[The committee] shall have one hundred and twenty days from the date the panel\u2019s determination concerning probable cause was filed with it to render a decision . . . .\u201d Surely, when the rule was adopted by the then 143 judges of the Superior Court, we certainly knew what \u201cshall\u201d meant.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Finally, even if the language of \u00a7 51-90g (g), the legislative history and our own rules of practice are not clear, the precedent of <em>Rozbicki </em>governs this case. Although the majority cites extensively to <em>Rozbicki, </em>it totally ignores the fundamental tenets of construction that solely led the court to conclude that the time limitation in \u00a7 51-90g (c) was directory, rather than mandatory, and the reasoning of which, if applied to this case, would compel the conclusion that the time limitation in \u00a7 51-90g (g) was mandatory. As Judge Schaller of the Appellate Court stated in his concurrence in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 682, \u201c[although the court also emphasized the broader context of the supervisory role of the judiciary in governing attorney conduct, our Supreme Court in <em>Roz-bicki </em>based its decision primarily on the impact of the \u00a7 51-90g (c) savings clause. In the case before us, concerning the mandatory time limit of \u00a7 51-90g (g), the absence of a comparable savings clause together with the acquiescence of the judiciary in adopting the time limits in \u00a7 27J compels our result. When the committee is proceeding under \u00a7 51-90g (g), neither the statute nor the rule of practice authorizes discretionary action in the event of delay beyond the time limit. By adopting the statutory language in the rule of practice, the judiciary has bound the committee to the statutory stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>dard, without allowing discretion as it carries out its supervisory role over attorney conduct. This court is bound by the analysis in the <em>Rozbicki </em>decision to reach that result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Furthermore, it is reasonable to conclude that in order to achieve public confidence in the grievance process and fairness to the attorneys subject to the process, the legislature had good reason to establish mandatory time limits for the committee and a more flexible approach for the subcommittee. With respect to subcommittee action, it is entirely logical that the time limits imposed on the subcommittee are not mandatory, because the committee, on motion of the respondent, the claimant or on its own, may inquire into the subcommittee\u2019s delay in rendering a proposed decision. General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 51-90g (c). Importantly, the committee has the authority under that same subsection to \u201cdetermine the appropriate course of action\u201d when there has been subcommittee delay. In other words, the committee has the statutory authority to oversee all subcommittee action and to compel the subcommittee to act when it has failed to do so in a timely fashion. In contrast, the committee is self-governing \u2014 there are no provisions in \u00a7 51-90g (g) that provide an avenue for the respondent, or any other party, to move that the committee inquire into its own delay or, for that matter, determine the appropriate course of action. In other words, there is no check on the committee when the committee itself has failed to abide by the statutory guidelines, unless this court were to construe the provisions of \u00a7 51-90g (g) as mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Although attorneys occupy a special place in our system of justice, that does not mean that we should ignore their rights. The plain language of \u00a7 51-90g (g), its legislative history, the rules of this court, and, indeed, our own precedent dictate that the committee must act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>within four months.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There are practical reasons that the legislature obviously considered in circumscribing the committee\u2019s jurisdiction by requiring it to act within this short time frame. First, the public has the right to a prompt determination of whether an attorney has committed unethical conduct. Second, anyone who has practiced law not only knows the. devastating effect that a grievance complaint may have on an ethical attorney, but also its practical consequences. Just the pendency of the complaint, regardless of whether it is provable, can, for example, have an effect on the renewal of an attorney\u2019s legal malpractice insurance or on an application for a judgeship.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is absolutely clear that it is essential that the professional conduct must stand the test of strict scrutiny, but in doing so we must also refrain from trampling on the rights of the members of the legal profession.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-10\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 51-90g (g), now \u00a7 51-90g (h), provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen the committee conducts the hearing or hearings under this section, it shall render its decision not later than four months from the date the panel\u2019s determination of probable cause or no probable cause was filed with the state-wide grievance committee. . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b707-11\"> Practice Book \u00a7 27J (i) provides in relevant part: \u201cIf the statewide grievance committee does not assign a complaint to a reviewing committee, it shall have one hundred and twenty days from the date the panel\u2019s determination concerning probable cause was filed with it to render a decision dismissing the complaint, imposing sanctions and conditions as authorized by Sec. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>27M.1 or directing the statewide bar counsel to file a presentment against the respondent. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b708-11\"> The judges of the Superior Court have adopted rules that are substantially identical to the General Statutes with respect to the committee.

Nevertheless, these concerns are appropriate to consider in ascertaining the legislative intent. As I have pointed out in this dissent, one of the public concerns expressed by Representative Wollenberg in the legislative debates with respect to adopting the mandatory four month time limit was the length of time that the grievance process took and the need to provide finality to the process.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
