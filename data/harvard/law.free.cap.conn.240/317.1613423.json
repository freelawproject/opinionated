We conclude that \u00a7 53a-40 (d) requires a sequence of conviction and punishment for each prior offense and, therefore, does not apply to the present case. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court, but on the basis of a statutoiy analysis that differs from that of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">In the first part of a two part information (part A), the defendant, Terrell Ledbetter, was charged with the crimes of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> larceny in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-123 (a) (3),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and carrying a dangerous weapon in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-206 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the second part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>the information (part B), he was charged with being a persistent felony offender pursuant to \u00a7 53a-40 (d). See footnote 1. On November 16,1993, after a jury trial, the defendant was found guilty of the offenses charged in part A. Thereafter, the defendant elected a court trial on part B. After the state presented evidence that on May 15,1987, in a single court proceeding, the defendant had pleaded guilty to two felony charges, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal because those prior convictions had not occurred \u201cat separate times\u201d as required by \u00a7 53a-40 (d) (2). In a thoughtful and well reasoned memorandum of decision, the trial court, <em>Hartmere, </em>J., granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal as to the persistent felony offender charge. The trial court concluded that the purpose of \u00a7 53a-40 (d) was to combat recidivism by enhancing the penalty for those defendants who have demonstrated a pattern of resistance to rehabilitation. The trial court reasoned that the only way to effectuate that purpose would be to require a strict sequence of offense, conviction and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>punishment for each prior felony before the prior convictions could be considered as a basis for the enhanced penalty. With the permission of the trial court; see General Statutes \u00a7 54-96; the state subsequently appealed from that court\u2019s judgment of acquittal to the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The Appellate Court, in affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment, did not address the issue of sequentiality but, rather, concluded that under the plain language of \u00a7 53a-40 (d), a defendant could not be deemed a persistent felony offender unless the predicate convictions had been rendered on separate occasions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>41 Conn. App. 391, 406, 676 A.2d 409 (1996). We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following question: \u201cDoes the persistent felony offender statute, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40 (d), apply when a defendant pleads guilty to two separate charges in the same proceeding?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>238 Conn. 902, 677 A.2d 1377 (1996).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because we interpret the language of \u00a7 53a-40 (d) and its legislative purpose to require a sequence of offense, conviction and punishment for each prior felony before a defendant may be subject to an enhanced penalty as a persistent offender, we conclude that the statute does not apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">Before we reach the issue of the proper interpretation of \u00a7 53a-40 (d) as applied to the present case, we must address a threshold issue that was first raised at oral argument: whether the state\u2019s appeal of the trial court\u2019s judgment should have been barred by the doctrine of double jeopardy and, if so, whether the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>waived the right to raise that bar by not raising it at the first opportunity. The double jeopardy issue was raised, sua sponte, by this court at oral argument. The parties were then asked to submit supplemental briefs addressing both the issues of double jeopardy and waiver. Following oral argument before this court, the defendant filed a separate motion to dismiss addressing the double jeopardy claim, to which the state filed a memorandum in opposition. That motion is resolved in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Because the doctrine of double jeopardy raises questions as to the propriety of the state\u2019s appeal; see <em>Smalis </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>476 U.S. 140, 145, 106 S. Ct. 1745, 90 L. Ed. 2d 116 (1986) (\u201cWhen a successful postacquittal appeal by the prosecution would lead to proceedings that violate the Double Jeopardy Clause, the appeal itself has no proper purpose. Allowing such an appeal would frustrate the interest of the accused in having an end to the proceedings against him.\u201d); we choose to resolve the issue before we reach the merits of this case. <em>Galland </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>204 Conn. 330, 333, 527 A.2d 1192 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\u201cThe constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy serves three separate functions: (1) It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. [2] It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. [3] And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense [in a single trial]. <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969). . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Chicano, </em>216 Conn. 699, 706, 584 A.2d 425 (1990), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1254, 111 S. Ct. 2898, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1062 (1991).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>237 Conn. 81, 99, 675 A.2d 866 (1996).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>A double jeopardy claim \u201cimplicates the very power of the state to bring [a defendant] into court, and thus \u2018is collateral to, and separable from . . . whether . . . the accused is guilty of the offense charged.\u2019 <em>Abney </em>v. <em>United States, </em>431 U.S. 651, 659, 97 S. Ct. 2034, 52 L. Ed. 2d 651 (1977).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Price, </em>208 Conn. 387, 389 n.2, 544 A.2d 184 (1988). \u201cUnder the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution, the state may not subject to retrial a defendant who has been acquitted of the crime charged. <em>Bullington </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>451 U.S. 430, 437-38, 101 S. Ct. 1852, 68 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Southard, </em>191 Conn. 506, 510-11, 467 A.2d 920 (1983).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>207 Conn. 374, 397, 542 A.2d 306 (1988). Necessarily related to this first prong of protection against double jeopardy is the general rule that, under most circumstances, the state may not appeal from a judgment of acquittal, even when that judgment may have been the result of a misconstruction of the law. Id., 399; see also <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Rumsey, </em>467 U.S. 203, 211, 104 S. Ct. 2305, 81 L. Ed. 2d 164 (1984); <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 317 n.10, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560, reh. denied, 444 U.S. 890, 100 S. Ct. 195, 62 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1979). It is this aspect of protection that is at issue here. The defendant argues that double jeopardy prevents the state from appealing the trial court\u2019s judgment of acquittal following the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 53a-40 (d) sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Certain sentencing proceedings have been deemed sufficiently trial-like to implicate double jeopardy protections. See <em>Bullington </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>supra, 451 U.S. 438-46 (capital sentencing proceeding sufficiently trial-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>like to invoke double jeopardy protections). This court has not yet had occasion to decide whether the proceeding at which a convicted felon is determined to be a persistent felony offender is sufficiently trial-like as to prevent the state from appealing a judgment of acquittal on a persistent felony offender charge. The defendant argues, and the state concedes, that a \u00a7 53a-40 (d) proceeding meets the <em>Bullington </em>criteria.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This court is not, however, bound by these concessions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Putnoki, </em>200 Conn. 208, 219 n.6, 510 A.2d 1329 (1986).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although we note that Connecticut\u2019s persistent felony offender scheme requires a proceeding that does, indeed, have many trial-like attributes \u2014 the defendant is charged under a specific criminal statute, the defendant must stand trial or plead guilty to the charge, and the state bears the burden of producing evidence that establishes the defendant\u2019s status as a persistent felony offender beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 we need not decide at this time whether double jeopardy is implicated by the state\u2019s appeal because we conclude that even if such a claim could have been made, the defendant has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>waived the right to make that claim by failing to assert it in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\u201cThe most basic rights of criminal defendants are . . . subject to waiver. See, e. g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>[470 U.S. 522, 528, 105 S. Ct. 1482, 84 L. Ed. 2d 486 (1985)] (absence of objection constitutes waiver of right to be present at all stages of criminal trial); <em>Levine </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[362 U.S. 610, 619, 80 S. Ct. 1038, 4 L. Ed. 2d 989 (1960)] (failure to object to closing of courtroom is waiver of right to public trial); <em>Segurold </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[275 U.S. 106, 111, 48 S. Ct. 77, 72 L. Ed. 186 (1927)] (failure to object constitutes waiver of fourth amendment right against unlawful search and seizure); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>818 F.2d 1020, 1025 [1st Cir. 1987] (failure to object results in forfeiture of claim of unlawful postarrest delay); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bascaro, </em>742 F.2d 1335, 1365 [11th Cir. 1984] (absence of objection is waiver of double jeopardy defense), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Hobson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[472 U.S. 1017, 105 S. Ct. 3476, 87 L.

Ct. 171, 78 L. Ed. 2d 154 (1983)]. See generally <em>Yakus </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[321 U.S. 414, 444, 64 S. Ct. 660, 88 L. Ed. 834 (1944)] (\u2018[n]o procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional right may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right\u2019).\u201d <em>Peretz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>501 U.S. 923, 936-37, 111 S. Ct. 2661, 115 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\u201cWhether a defendant may raise a defense of double jeopardy on appeal, when that issue was not raised [below], is a question that this court addressed, and resolved against the defendant, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>166 Conn. 620, 353 A.2d 764 (1974). There ... the defendant \u2018proceeded to trial, verdict and judgment without raising [a double jeopardy] claim.\u2019 Id., 630. We held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\u2018in so doing he impliedly waived the defense of double jeopardy, and, therefore, that issue [was] not before us for determination on the merits.\u2019 Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u201cOur resolution of the issue of waiver in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, [166 Conn. 630] is in accord with the treatment of that issue in other jurisdictions. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has repeatedly held that \u2018[t]he constitutional immunity from double jeopardy is a personal right which, if not affirmatively pleaded by the defendant at the [appropriate time], will be regarded as waived.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>565 F.2d 1227, 1232 (2d Cir. 1977); see also <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>698 F.2d 589, 592 (2d Cir. 1983). Other federal courts have expressed the same opinion. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Herzog, </em>644 F.2d 713, 716 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 1018, 101 S. Ct. 3008, 69 L. Ed. 2d 390 (1981); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>464 F.2d 832, 833 (D.C. Cir. 1972); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Buonomo, </em>441 F.2d 922, 924-25 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 845, 92 S. Ct. 146, 30 L. Ed. 2d 81 (1971).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Price, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 390; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lorenzo, </em>995 F.2d 1448, 1457 (9th Cir. 1993) (\u201c[fjailure to present a double jeopardy challenge constitutes a waiver of that claim\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bascaro, </em>supra, 742 F.2d 1365 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">In this case, the state appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment of acquittal as to part B of the information rendered in response to the defendant\u2019s motion. The defendant did not raise the issue of double jeopardy at any time before we raised the question at oral argument in this court. The defendant did not object on double jeopardy grounds to the state\u2019s request for permission to appeal. Furthermore, the defendant did not move to dismiss the state\u2019s appeal to the Appellate Court, did not raise the claim in opposition to the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal to this court, nor did he raise the issue in his brief or oral argument to this court. Because this court has previously held that similar inac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>tion on a defendant\u2019s part effectively waives any double jeopardy claim; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 166 Conn. 630; we conclude that the defendant is barred from raising that claim here.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Having determined that this court has the authority to consider the state\u2019s appeal, we now proceed to the merits of its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The state claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the plain language of \u00a7 53a-40 (d) required the defendant\u2019s prior convictions to have occurred at separate times. Specifically, the state argues that, contrary to the conclusion of the Appellate Court, the language of the statute is not unambiguous and that a plain reading of the statute, strictly construed, would lead to bizarre and unworkable results. The state contends that we must consider the punitive puipose of the statute and conclude that the enhanced penalty it provides is triggered by the number of prior convictions only, and not by the timing of those convictions. The defendant responds that the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous, so much so that it is impossible to paraphrase the statute without returning to the statute\u2019s own words. The defendant argues that the plain meaning of those words requires that the predicate convictions must have occurred on separate occasions. In the alternative, the defendant urges this court to adopt the reasoning of the trial court and conclude that \u00a7 53a-40 (d) requires a sequence of offense, conviction and punishment for each prior felony. We agree with this alternative reading of \u00a7 53a-40 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">\u201c[I]t is axiomatic that the process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>tive history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . <em>Izzo </em>v. <em>Meriden-Wallingford Hospital, </em>237 Conn. 259, 266, 676 A.2d 857 (1996).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stratford </em>v. <em>State Board of Mediation &amp; Arbitration, </em>239 Conn. 32, 40-41, 681 A.2d 281 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Although we agree with the state that, in some ways, an analysis of the language of the statute raises more questions than it answers, we conclude that the legislative history behind that statutory language precludes the use of two felony convictions rendered simultaneously as the basis for a conviction as a persistent felony offender. We further conclude that, in order to advance the legislative intent that \u00a7 53a-40 (d) be a solution to the problem of recidivism, its enhanced penalty appropriately applies only to those offenders who, despite having been given an opportunity to reform through a sequence of conviction and punishment for each prior offense, nevertheless continue a life of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">\u201cAs with any issue of statutory inteipretation, our initial guide is the language of the statute itself. . . . <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners </em>v. <em>CFG Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>236 Conn. 750, 756, 674 A.2d 1313 (1996).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Peabody, N.E., Inc., </em>239 Conn. 93, 102, 680 A.2d 1321 (1996). Section 53a-40 (d) provides: \u201cA persistent felony offender is a person who (1) stands convicted of a felony other than a class D felony, and (2) has been, at separate times prior to the commission of the present felony, twice convicted of a felony other than a class D felony.\u201d The state, relying in great part on Judge Schaller\u2019s dissent to the Appellate Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>majority opinion in this case, argues that the statutory language \u201cat separate times . . . twice convicted\u201d is ambiguous because the statute gives no indication as to the meaning of \u201cseparate times.\u201d The state attempts to bypass this ambiguity by arguing that the operative words of the statute are \u201ctwice convicted,\u201d and that the \u201cat separate times\u201d language refers not to the convictions but merely to the commission of the underlying felonies. Thus, the state urges this court to conclude that the sole effect of the statute is to exact further punishment on those felons who have committed multiple crimes, without regard to the timing of the offenses. Furthermore, the state points out that the number of prior convictions a defendant may have is often determined not by the number of crimes the defendant may have committed, but, rather, by the mechanics of plea bargaining. The state further argues that an affirmance of the Appellate Court\u2019s decision could ultimately penalize defendants by affecting prosecutors\u2019 decisions in charging those defendants.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">In response, the defendant argues that the Appellate Court correctly found that, in order to qualify as a persistent felony offender, the defendant must have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>convicted of two prior felonies at \u201c \u2018two unconnected, distinct, or unique times.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 406, quoting <em>Lett </em>v. <em>State, </em>51 Md. App. 668, 679, 445 A.2d 1050 (1982). Specifically, the defendant argues that: (1) the statute\u2019s punitive purpose requires that it be strictly construed; (2) the state\u2019s interpretation, relying as it does on the number of convictions rather than the timing of those convictions, would render the phrase \u201cat separate times\u201d meaningless; and (3) the rule of lenity requires that any possible ambiguities be resolved in favor of the defendant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We find that even though the language of \u00a7 53a-40 (d) is not as ambiguous as the state contends, certain questions are left unanswered by a strict reading of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Section 53a-40 addresses the issue of recidivism and does so in a manner that is clearly punitive. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>203 Conn. 506, 523, 525 A.2d 509 (1987). Because it is a punitive statute, the generally recognized rules of statutory construction normally would require the strictest of interpretations; 3 J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th Ed. Singer 1992) \u00a7 59.03, p. 102; limiting any application of the statute to the words used. Id., \u00a7 58.02, p. 72. However, \u201c[although we recognize the fundamental principle that [penal] statutes are to be construed strictly, it is equally fundamental that the rule of strict construction does not require an interpretation which frustrates an evident legislative intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>236 Conn. 18, 26-27, 670 A.2d 851 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">When we look to the words of \u00a7 53a-40 (d), it is clear on its face that the phrase \u201ctwice convicted\u201d is qualified by the phrase \u201cat separate times,\u201d and that the state misinterprets this qualifying effect. To hold otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>would render the phrase \u201cat separate times\u201d meaningless, because all that would be required to trigger the statute would be two prior convictions. In a strict construction, not only are we limited to the words of the statute, but we must also take into account <em>all </em>the words of the statute. \u201c[I]n construing statutes, we presume that there is a puipose behind every sentence, clause, or phrase used in an act and that no part of a statute is superfluous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 58, 480 A.2d 425 (1984). As Judge Schaller points out in his dissent to the Appellate Court\u2019s decision, however, to limit our interpretation to this construction is unsatisfying because there remains doubt as to the intent of the legislature in incorporating the phrase \u201cat separate times.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 408. Although we disagree with Judge Schaller\u2019s ultimate conclusion, we agree that in order to effectuate the legislature\u2019s intent, we must look beyond the plain language of \u00a7 53a-40 (d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Although the defendant argues that the Appellate Court was correct in rejecting the state\u2019s appeal on the basis of the plain language of \u00a7 53a-40 (d), he proposes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>as alternative grounds for affirmance,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that we adopt the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the legislative purpose of the statute requires sequentiality. Specifically, the defendant argues that: (1) \u00a7 53a-40 (d) requires sequen-tiality of offense, conviction and punishment in order to be consistent with the rest of \u00a7 53a-40; (2) the intent of the legislature was to punish those offenders who failed to reform after their previous convictions and opportunities to rehabilitate; and (3) similar statutes in other jurisdictions require sequentiality. We agree with the defendant that the legislative purpose of \u00a7 53a-40 (d) is fulfilled only by requiring a sequence of offense, conviction and punishment, thus allowing a felon the opportunity to reform prior to being labeled a persistent felony offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The defendant first contends that, when placed within its statutory context, \u00a7 53a-40 (d) implicitly requires that the prior convictions upon which a finding of persistent offender status is based must have been separated by a period either of imprisonment or probation. The state responds that it is clear from the context of \u00a7 53a-40 (d) that, had the legislature so intended, the legislature could have added explicit language requiring sequentiality. In order to place the parties\u2019 arguments in the proper context, we must first review the history of the persistent offender statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Section 53a-40 (d) is merely one part of a statutory scheme that defines, and provides sentencing guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>lines for, the habitual offender categories recognized in Connecticut.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There are four types of habitual offend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ers covered by \u00a7 53a-40: persistent dangerous felony offender as set forth in \u00a7 53a-40 (a); persistent serious felony offender as set forth in \u00a7 53a-40 (b); persistent larceny offender as set forth in \u00a7 53a-40 (c); and persistent felony offender as set forth in. \u00a7 53a-40 (d). When first enacted as No. 828, \u00a7 40, of the 1969 Public Acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>(P.A. 828), as part of the Connecticut Penal Code,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the persistent offender statute contained only three categories: persistent dangerous felony offender; persistent felony offender; and persistent larceny offender.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> All three categories required that the defendant have had at least two prior convictions, rendered at separate times prior to the commission of the present felony. Significantly, the first two categories required that, for each of those prior convictions, the defendant had to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>have been \u201csentenced and imprisoned to a term of more than one year or of death.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See P.A. 828, \u00a7 40. Thus, this original enactment clearly required a sequence of a \u201cfirst felony, conviction, imprisonment; second felony, conviction, imprisonment; third felony\u201d before a defendant could be labeled a persistent dangerous felony offender or a persistent felony offender. The persistent larceny offender statute did not require a term of imprisonment because the prior theft offenses would not have been punishable in state prison; see Report of the Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes (1967) p. 65; but otherwise paralleled the first two persistent offender provisions. We therefore infer that this larceny provision also required the aforementioned sequence. \u201cAssuredly, we are guided by the principle that the legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law . . . .Indeed, this tenet of statutory construction requiring us to read statutes together is particularly applicable when the statutes relate to the same subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 337, 347, 680 A.2d 1261 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Prior to the penal code\u2019s effective date of October 1, 1971, the persistent offender statute was amended by No. 871, \u00a7 15, of the 1971 Public Acts, so that both the persistent dangerous felony offender and the persistent felony offender provisions required only one previous conviction and term of imprisonment; the persistent larceny offender provision remained unchanged. See General Statutes (Noncum. Sup. 1971) \u00a7 53a-40 (a) through (c). Because the persistent dangerous felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>offender and persistent felony offender provisions then required only one previous conviction, the language as to \u201cseparate times\u201d was necessarily deleted, and the issue of sequentiality became irrelevant. This remained the case until 1980, when the General Assembly undertook a revision of the state\u2019s sentencing laws. At that time, the statute was again amended by adding the provision for a persistent serious felony offender and by revising the elements of the persistent felony offender provision to their current form. See Public Acts 1980, No. 80-442, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">There is very little in the way of legislative history for the 1980 revisions, and what little exists is primarily in the form of testimony before the judiciary committee. That testimony, however, is illuminating. \u201c[I]n recent years we have repeatedly approved references to testimony before legislative committees in order to shed light on legislative intent. See, e.g., <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gode, </em>187 Conn. 386, 392 n.6, 395-96, 446 A.2d 1059 (1982); <em>Tax Commissioner </em>v. <em>Estate of Bissell, </em>173 Conn. 232, 245, 377 A.2d 305 (1977); <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>169 Conn. 267, 290-91, 363 A.2d 1 (1975), appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 1041, 96 S. Ct. 763, 46 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1976); see also <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Education Assn., </em>9 Conn. App. 199, 204 n.3, 518 A.2d 394 (1986), cert. denied, 202 Conn. 802, 519 A.2d 1206 (1987). This is fully consistent with the general principle of statutory construction that we look, in part, to the problem or issue that the legislature sought to resolve, and the purpose it sought to serve, in enacting a statute. <em>Verrastro </em>v. <em>Sivertsen, </em>188 Conn. 213, 221, 448 A.2d 1344 (1982). Often that problem, issue or purpose is disclosed by reference to the testimony before a legislative committee.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>204 Conn. 259, 273-74 n.8, 528 A.2d 760 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The testimony before the committee and the comments of the committee members themselves indicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>that the legislative purpose of \u00a7 53a-40 (d) was to deal with the problem of the repeat felony offender who had not been reformed or rehabilitated by his or her prior convictions. Donald Browne, state\u2019s attorney for the judicial district of Fairfield, testified that the purpose of the new persistent felony offender provision was to punish the \u201cchronic crook.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 5,1980 Sess., p. 1143. In his testimony, Browne stated: \u201c[I]f an individual is before the court [a] third time convicted of a felony, it is time that the court consider no longer his rehabilitation. He is there a three time loser . . . let\u2019s not put him back out on probation, he\u2019s been there twice before. This is his third fall . . . .\u201d Id., p. 1144.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The state argues that this testimony supports its position that \u00a7 53a-40 (d) was designed to punish more severely those who commit multiple crimes, regardless of the timing of the prior convictions. We disagree. Browne\u2019s testimony makes sense only if the legislation is viewed as a response to a defendant\u2019s repeated failure to reform after a sequence of convictions. If there were no requirement of sequentiality, the defendant would have had no opportunity to <em>avoid </em>three time loser status. This implicit understanding that there be a requirement of sequentiality is further supported by Representative Alfred J. Onorato\u2019s question to a witness during the judiciary committee hearings: \u201cYou don\u2019t believe that a person who\u2019s been twice convicted of a felony and he\u2019s been placed on probation after probation should do any time?\u201d Id., p. 1148.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We are con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>vinced that the most reliable conclusion that can be drawn from this legislative history is that \u00a7 53a-40 (d) was designed to attack recidivism. Furthermore, we conclude that because \u00a7 53a~40 (d) is a recidivism statute, a sequence of \u201cfirst felony; conviction; punishment; second felony; conviction; punishment\u201d must precede the commission of the third felony before the enhanced penalty may be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Other jurisdictions that have interpreted legislation similar to \u00a7 53a-40 (d) have concluded that those statutes required sequentiality. See <em>Hall </em>v. <em>State, </em>473 A.2d 352, 356-57 (Del. 1984) (law only applies when second conviction takes place after sentencing has been imposed for first offense); <em>State </em>v. <em>Metoyer, </em>612 So. 2d 755, 759 (La. App. 1992) (multiple convictions based on guilty pleas entered on same day constitute single conviction for purpose of habitual offender sentencing); <em>Lett </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 51 Md. App. 679 (convictions must occur at \u201cunconnected, distinct, or unique times\u201d); see also annot., 7 A.L.R.5th 289 (1992) (\u201cThe prevalent view is that enhanced punishment cannot be imposed unless all of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions preceded commission of the principal offense, and each prior offense and conviction occurred in chronological sequence. Thus, each offense, following the first, must have been committed after the defendant\u2019s conviction of the immediately preceding offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">After analyzing both the language and the history of \u00a7 53a-40 (d), we conclude that the words of this statute, together with its legislative history, make clear that the legislature intended this section to apply only to those repeat offenders who, despite having been given the opportunity to reform, not once but twice, nevertheless persist in a career of crime. In order to ensure that the statute apply only to this targeted group of recidivists, it must be read to require a strict sequence of \u201coffense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>conviction, punishment\u201d for each prior felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40 (d) provides: \u201cA persistent felony offender is a person who (1) stands convicted of a felony other than a class D felony, and (2) has been, at separate times prior to the commission of the present felony, twice convicted of a felony other than a class D felony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime of robbery as defined in section 53a-133 or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime ...

As we make clear in this opinion, the application of \u00a7 53a-40 (d) does not hinge exclusively on a defendant\u2019s court dates, but, rather, takes into account that defendant\u2019s criminal history. As for the argument that the statute may require four prior convictions, that is simply a misreading of the statute. The phrase \u201cat separate times\u201d is part of the complete appositive phrase \u201cat separate times prior to the commission of the present felony\u201d and must be read as qualifying the phrase \u201chas been twice convicted\u201d into which it has been inserted.

I believe that the state\u2019s appeal of the judgment of acquittal in favor of the defendant is barred by the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution. The majority concludes that the defendant waived his right not to be placed in double jeopardy by failing to raise this defense at an earlier stage of the proceedings. This presents a difficult issue on which we have found no cases directly on point. I respectfully disagree with the majority in this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Here, this court itself raised the issue of double jeopardy at oral argument and requested that the parties file supplemental briefs on the issue. The defendant then filed a motion to dismiss the state\u2019s appeal. Implicit in the\u2019 majority\u2019s opinion is the proposition that the defendant should have realized he had a double jeopardy defense and, therefore, his failure to raise the defense earlier constituted a waiver of that right. I do not believe that such inaction, perhaps based upon inadvertence or inattention, would constitute a valid waiver of such an important right at this stage of the proceedings. \u201c \u2018Waiver\u2019 is a vague term used for a great variety of purposes, good and bad, in the law. In any normal sense, however, it connotes some kind of voluntary knowing relinquishment of a right.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 355 U.S. 184, 191, 78 S. Ct. 221, 2 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1957), citing <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">There is a statement in <em>State </em>v. <em>Price, </em>208 Conn. 387, 390-91, 544 A.2d 184 (1988), that the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Supreme Court implied in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 609-10 n.11, 96 S. Ct. 1075, 47 L. Ed. 2d 267 (1976), that a waiver of a double jeopardy defense does not require the knowing, intelligent and voluntary standard of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>supra, 304 U.S. 458. That implication, however, is restricted <em>in Dinitz </em>to the case where there may be a second trial of a defendant following the granting of a motion for a mistrial or the reversal of a conviction on appeal. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dinitz, </em>supra, 609-10 n.11. Those circumstances do not apply in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">What is clear is that, in this case, as soon as the defendant was questioned about his right under the double jeopardy clause, he sought to exercise it. I cannot find a waiver by the defendant under these circumstances. This is particularly so because we have not previously decided whether a retrial of a defendant under the persistent felony offender statute; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40 (d); would be barred by the defendant\u2019s previous acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>166 Conn. 620, 630, 353 A.2d 764 (1974), this court concluded that the defendant had waived the defense of double jeopardy by not raising it at his second trial on the same charges. \u201cInstead [the defendant] proceeded to trial, verdict and judgment without raising such a claim.\u201d Id. This case does not help us resolve the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Here, the defendant cannot yet have waived a defense that he is entitled to raise at the start of a second trial, which is when he would actually undergo double jeopardy. \u201cThe protections afforded by the [c] lause are implicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>only when the accused has actually been placed in jeopardy. . . . This state of jeopardy attaches when a jury is empaneled and sworn or, in a bench trial, when the judge begins to receive evidence.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 569, 97 S. Ct. 1349, 51 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">As the United States Supreme Court explained: \u201cWhen a successful postacquittal appeal by the prosecution <em>would lead to proceedings that violate the Double Jeopardy Clause, </em>the appeal itself has no proper purpose. Allowing such an appeal would frustrate the interest of the accused in having an end to the proceedings against him.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Smalis </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>476 U.S. 140, 145, 106 S. Ct. 1745, 90 L. Ed. 2d 116 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>207 Conn. 374, 398, 542 A.2d 306 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">We should decide whether the double jeopardy clause bars a retrial of the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 54a-40 (d), and if it does, then this court should dismiss the state\u2019s appeal. The state agrees that a proceeding under \u00a7 53a-40 (d) has several characteristics comparable to criminal trials on the question of guilt or innocence such that it would be subject to the double jeopardy clause. See <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Rumsey, </em>467 U.S. 203, 211-12, 104 S. Ct. 2305, 81 L. Ed. 2d 164 (1984); <em>Bullington v. Missouri, </em>451 U.S. 430, 438, 101 S. Ct. 1852, 68 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1981). A persistent felony offender charge must be adjudicated in a proceeding separate from that involving the principal crime charged. The state has the burden of proving the elements of a persistent felony offender charge beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>184 Conn. 215, 216-17, 439 A.2d 945 (1981). Where the jury is not given unfettered discretion to choose an appropriate punishment, but instead, must decide between two alternatives, it has been held that the proceeding is subject to the double jeopardy clause. <em>Bullington </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>supra, 438; <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>supra, 207 Conn. 398-99 (double jeopardy principles apply to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The state argues, however, that the trial court\u2019s disposition of the persistent felony offender charge was not an \u201cacquittal\u201d because on remand the trial court could render judgment on the facts that it had previously found. Decisions of the United States Supreme Court demonstrate otherwise: \u201c[W]hen a defendant has been acquitted at trial he may not be retried on the same offense, even if the legal rulings underlying the acquittal were erroneous.\u201d <em>Sanabria </em>v. <em>United States, </em>437 U.S. 54, 64, 98 S. Ct. 2170, 57 L. Ed. 2d 43 (1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>supra, 430 U.S. 571; <em>Fong Foo </em>v. <em>United States, </em>369 U.S. 141, 143, 82 S. Ct. 671, 7 L. Ed. 2d 629 (1962); <em>State </em>v. <em>Paolella, </em>210 Conn. 110, 130, 554 A.2d 702 (1989). In <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Rumsey, </em>supra, 467 U.S. 211, the court stated: \u201cIn making its findings, the trial court relied on a misconstruction of the statute. . . . Reliance on an error of law, however, does not change the double jeopardy effects of a judgment that amounts to an acquittal on the merits. . . . Thus, this [c]ourt\u2019s cases hold that an acquittal on the merits bars retrial even if based on legal error.\u201d (Citation omitted.) I therefore disagree with the state that the defendant has not been acquitted of \u00a7 53a-40 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Although I concur in the result, I conclude that the state\u2019s appeal would have no proper purpose and should be dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\"> The implied waiver found from a failure to raise the issue \u201cat the first opportunity\u201d in <em>Levin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>5 F.2d 598, 600-601 (9th Cir. 1925), applied to a failure to raise the issue of a duplicitous indictment at the trial before a verdict was returned. It could not thereafter be raised for the first time in a motion for arrest of judgment. These circumstances, as well, do not exist here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
