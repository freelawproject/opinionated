(M&amp;B), by different insurers, from 1949 through 1985. M&amp;B seeks coverage under those policies for costs incurred in investigating and correcting environmental contamination that resulted from its operations in California and Oregon. The trial court concluded that the policies did not cover M&amp;B for that environmental damage and granted the insurers\u2019 motions for summary judgment. The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment of the trial court. <em>St. Paul Fire v. McCormick &amp; Baxter Creosoting, </em>126 Or App 689, 707, 870 P2d 260, <em>modified on recons </em>128 Or App 234, 238, 875 P2d 537 (1994). For the following reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">This case comes to us on review of the trial court\u2019s grant of the insurers\u2019 motions for summary judgment. Accordingly, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from it in the light most favorable to M&amp;B, the nonmoving party. ORCP 47 C; <em>Fields v. Jantec, </em>Inc., 317 Or 432, 437, 857 P2d 95 (1993). On review, we determine whether there is a genuine issue as to any material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. ORCP 47 C; <em>Fields, </em>317 Or at 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">M&amp;B has owned and operated wood treatment plants since 1942 in Stockton, California, and since 1945 in Portland, Oregon. At those plants, during the relevant period (1949-85), M&amp;B treated a variety of wood products. The treatment processes included the use of pentachlorophenol (PCP), creosote (a coal tar derivative, which usually is mixed with fuel oil before application), and heavy metal salts such as arsenic, chromium, and copper. As a result of M&amp;B\u2019s operations at both facilities, chemicals leached into the soil and contaminated the soil and groundwater. At the Portland plant, surface water also was contaminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">The contamination at both plants is attributable, in part, to leaching from \u201csurface impoundments.\u201d \u201cSurface <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>impoundments\u201d were uncovered pits that M&amp;B used to store the waste water produced during the wood treatment processes. M&amp;B used surface impoundments from 1967 to 1971 in Portland, and from 1942 to 1978 in Stockton. During those periods, surface impoundments were standard in the wood treatment industry. They were believed to hold the waste and to permit liquids to evaporate over time.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">In the late 1970s, however, M&amp;B learned that contaminants placed in the surface impoundments leached through layers of soil into the subsurface soil and groundwater. That leaching began within a year after the initial use of the surface impoundments.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Additional damage was caused by overflow from storage tanks, by equipment failures, and by storm-water runoff from treated products and equipment, which were coated with preservatives. Preservatives also dripped and spilled onto unprotected soil.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">M&amp;B also presented evidence that, during a labor dispute at the Portland plant in 1949 or 1950, someone opened a flange bolt on a storage tank, causing nearly 50,000 gallons of creosote to spill onto the soil.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That contamination reached the groundwater within a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">In 1974, M&amp;B began working with the California Regional Water Quality Control Board to develop a plan for treatment of waste water at the Stockton site. In 1978, M&amp;B agreed to a consent decree requiring clean-up and abatement. In 1983, after an inspection of the Stockton site, the California Department of Health Services found that M&amp;B had violated the California Hazardous Waste Control Act. Cal Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 25100 <em>et seq. </em>M&amp;B faced civil and criminal penalties if it did not clean up the contaminated soil and groundwater. M&amp;B agreed to do so in a consent decree that it entered into with those agencies in July 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">In 1983, M&amp;B notified the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) that there was soil and groundwater contamination at the Portland site. DEQ and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>M&amp;B entered into a consent decree in 1987, under which M&amp;B was to clean up the contamination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">In 1987, M&amp;B demanded that its insurers defend and indemnify it with respect to the investigation and cleanup costs for the Stockton and Portland sites. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company, Inc., and St. Paul Mercury Insurance Company, Inc. (collectively referred to as St. Paul), insurers that had sold a GCL policy to M&amp;B, then filed this declaratory judgment action. St. Paul seeks a declaration that it is not obligated to defend or indemnify M&amp;B for any of the investigation or clean-up costs relating to either site. In addition to naming M&amp;B as a defendant, St. Paul named as defendants other insurance companies that had issued liability policies to M&amp;B. St. Paul seeks a declaration that, if coverage exists under its policy with M&amp;B, then coverage exists under those other insurers\u2019 policies as well. M&amp;B filed an answer to St. Paul\u2019s complaint and cross-claims against all other insurer defendants, seeking damages for breach of contract and a declaration that the insurers have a duty to defend M&amp;B in environmental administrative proceedings and to indemnify M&amp;B for its investigative and environmental clean-up costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">On motions for summary judgment, the trial court held that M&amp;B did not have coverage under any of the insurance policies issued by the insurers between 1949 and 1985. The court granted summary judgment to several insurers that had issued policies before 1970, on the theory that the damage at issue in this case had not been triggered until after the coverages had expired (the \u201ctrigger-of-coverage\u201d issue). The trial court granted summary judgment to several insurers that had issued policies that covered damage \u201ccaused by accident,\u201d on the theory that no \u201caccident\u201d had occurred under the terms of those policies (the \u201ccaused-by-accident\u201d issue). The trial court granted summary judgment to several insurers that had issued policies in the 1970s and 1980s, on the theory that those policies contained \u201cpollution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>exclusions\u201d that excluded coverage for the damage sustained in this case (the \u201cpollution-exclusion\u201d issue). The trial court entered a judgment, ORCP 67 A, for the insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">M&amp;B appealed. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court on the trigger-of-coverage issue. 126 Or App at 697-99. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s holdings as to the caused-by-accident and pollution-exclusion issues. <em>Id. </em>at 702-07. It also held that an affidavit on which M&amp;B relied was inadmissible. <em>Id. </em>at 705-06. On reconsideration, the Court of Appeals modified one of its factual conclusions as to the coverage issued by one insurer. 128 Or App at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Both M&amp;B and the insurers petitioned this court for review. We allowed both petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">II. INTERPRETATION OF INSURANCE POLICIES GENERALLY</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Although the insurance policies at issue contain different terms and, therefore, must be considered individually, certain rules of construction apply to all such policies. <em>See generally Hoffman Construction Co. v. Fred S. James &amp; Co., </em>313 Or 464, 469-71, 836 P2d 703 (1992) (delineating the factors used by Oregon courts in determining the meaning of a provision in an insurance policy). Accordingly, before turning to the terms of the individual policies, we begin by stating those rules of construction that affect all the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The interpretation of the terms of an insurance policy is a question of law. <em>Id. </em>at 469. In interpreting a policy, a court\u2019s goal is to ascertain the intent of the parties, based on the terms and conditions of the policy. <em>Ibid. </em>Ambiguous terms in an insurance policy are \u201cconstrued against the insurer, who drafted the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470. In <em>Hoffman, </em>this court explained when a term is ambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-9\">\u201cFor a term to be ambiguous in a sense that justifies resort to the foregoing rule, however, there needs to be more than a showing of two plausible interpretations; given the breadth and flexibility of the English language, the task of suggesting plausible alternative meanings is no challenge to capable counsel. Competing plausible interpretations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>simply establish ambiguity that will require some interpretive act by the court. This triggers a series of analytical steps, any one of which may resolve the ambiguity. The rule on which plaintiffs rely is the last of these steps. In other words, a term is ambiguous in a sense that justifies application of the rule of construction against the insurer <em>only </em>if two or more plausible interpretations of that term withstand scrutiny, <em>i.e., </em>continue to be reasonable, after the interpretations are examined in the light of, among other things, the particular context in which that term is used in the policy and the broader context of the policy as a whole. Ambiguity requires resort ultimately to the rule [of construction against the drafter] because, when two or more competing, plausible interpretations survive the kind of scrutiny described, the term still must \u2018reasonably be given a broader or a narrower meaning, depending upon the intention of the parties in the context in which such words are used by them.\u2019 That is, when two or more competing, plausible interpretations prove to be reasonable after all other methods for resolving the dispute over the meaning of particular words fail, <em>then </em>the rule of interpretation against the drafter of the language becomes applicable, because the ambiguity cannot be permitted to survive. It must be resolved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470-71 (emphasis in original; citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">With the foregoing principles in mind, we will examine the specific policies at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">III. THE INSURANCE POLICIES</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">M&amp;B bought numerous insurance policies from different insurers between 1949 and 1985. As now relevant, those policies contained three kinds of terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">A. <em>Policies Providing Coverage for Property Damage \u201cCaused by Accident\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">From September 1949 to September 1953, M&amp;B had a series of third-party GCL policies with Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Company (Hartford). Those policies contained the following \u201ccaused-by-accident\u201d clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\u201c[Hartford agrees t]o Pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon him by law, or assumed by him under contract as defined in the policy for damages because of injuries to or destruction of property, including loss of use thereof, <em>caused by accident </em>* * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The policy also contained the following trigger-of-coverage clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">\u201cThis policy applies only to accidents which <em>occur during the policy period </em>* * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The term \u201caccident\u201d was not defined in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">From September 1953 to September 1956, M&amp;B had a third-party GCL insurance agreement with National Fire Insurance Company of Hartford (National Fire). That policy was identical to the Hartford policies in all material respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">From September 1956 to September 1959, M&amp;B had a third-party GCL insurance agreement with St. Paul Mercury Insurance Company; and, from September 1959 to September 1962, M&amp;B had a third-party GCL policy with St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company. Those policies were identical to the National Fire and Hartford policies in all material respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">B. <em>Policies Providing Coverage for \u201cOccurrences\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">From September 1962 to September 1965, M&amp;B had a third-party GCL policy with St. Paul. That policy contained the following \u201ccaused-by-accident\u201d clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">\u201c[St. Paul agrees t]o pay on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of injury to or destruction of property, including the loss of use thereof, caused by accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">The policy also contained this endorsement, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-13\">\u201cIT IS UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED THAT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-14\">\u201c1. With respect to [coverage for property damage] the words \u2018caused by accident\u2019 are deleted and the words \u2018resulting from an occurrence\u2019 are substituted in Lieu thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\u201cWhere ever used in the policy with respect to the foregoing coverages the word \u2018accident\u2019 shall be construed to mean \u2018occurrence.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\">\u201cThe word \u2018occurrence\u2019 means an unexpected event or happening which results in injury to or destruction of tangible property during the policy period, or a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which result in direct injury to or destruction of tangible property during the policy period, provided the insured did not intend or anticipate that injury to or destruction of property would result. All damages arising out of such exposure to substantially the same general conditions shall be considered as arising out of one occurrence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The St. Paul policy contained the following trigger-of-coverage clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">\u201cThis Policy applies * * * to occurrences or accidents taking place within the United States of America, its territories or possessions and Canada during the Policy Period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">After the St. Paul policy expired, M&amp;B continued to purchase GCL policies from other insurers. In addition, for almost 12 years, M&amp;B had excess liability policies, which gave M&amp;B coverage beyond that provided in the underlying GCL policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">From May 1965 to May 1968, M&amp;B had a third-party GCL policy with National Continental Insurance Company (National Continental).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The National Continental policy contained the same caused-by-accident and trigger-of-coverage clauses as the St. Paul (1962-65) policy. The National Continental policy contained an endorsement that provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">\u201cIn consideration of the premium charged, it is agreed that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">\u201c1. The words \u2018caused by accident\u2019 as used in [reference to coverage for property damage] are deleted. The word \u2018accident\u2019 wherever used in this policy with respect to \u2018Property Damage Liability \u2014 Except Automobile\u2019 shall be construed to mean \u2018occurrence.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u201c2. \u2018Occurrence\u2019 means a happening or a continuous or repeated exposure to the same general conditions, which, unexpected by the insured, causes injury to or destruction of corporeal property during the policy period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">From September 1968 to September 1971, M&amp;B had a third-party GCL agreement with National Continental. Under that contract, National Continental agreed to \u201cpay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of * * * damage to or destruction of property of others.\u201d (Boldface deleted.) That policy covered damages for an \u201coccurrence,\u201d but the term \u201coccurrence\u201d was not defined in the policy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That policy contained the following trigger-of-coverage clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">\u201cAll of the coverages afforded by this policy are LIMITED to bodily injury or property damage which is ACTUALLY SUSTAINED during the policy period:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">\u201c1. in the United States of America, its territories or possessions, or Canada.\u201d (Boldface deleted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">From 1964 through 1969, M&amp;B had a series of excess third-party property damage GCL insurance agreements with Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London (Lloyd\u2019s). The Lloyd\u2019s policies covered \u201cdamage to or destruction of property of others * * * <em>caused by accident </em>occurring during the period mentioned [in the policy].\u201d (Emphasis added.) The policies issued before 1967 contained the following endorsement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">\u201cThe words \u2018caused by accident\u2019 in the Insuring Clause in this Insurance and the definition of the word \u2018accident\u2019 in this Insurance shall be deemed to be deleted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">\u201cThe words \u2018accident\u2019 or \u2018accidents\u2019 wherever appearing elsewhere in this Insurance shall be deemed to read \u2018occurrence\u2019 or \u2018occurrences\u2019 respectively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">\u201cThe words \u2018occurrence\u2019 or \u2018occurrences\u2019 shall be deemed to have the same meaning in this insurance as is attributed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>to them in the policy(ies) of the Primary Insurers but, notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purposes of this Insurance all occurrences arising out of one event shall be treated as one occurrence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">In 1967, the definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d in the Lloyd\u2019s policy was amended to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">\u201cFor the purpose of determining the limit of Underwriters\u2019 liability, all * * * Property Damage arising out of either,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">\u201ci) one event or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">\u201cii) a continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">\u201cshall be considered as arising out of one occurrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">\u201cUnder \u2018DEFINITIONS\u2019 (a) Accident is deleted and replaced by the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">\u201c(a) OCCURRENCE. The word \u2018occurrence\u2019 means an accident, including injurious exposure to conditions, which results, during the period of insurance mentioned in the Schedule, in * * * Property Damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the Assured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">The Lloyd\u2019s policy issued in 1968 was identical in all material respects to the Lloyd\u2019s policy issued in 1966. The 1968 policy did not make reference to the amended definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d contained in the 1967 policy, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">From 1967 to 1970, M&amp;B also had an excess third-party property damage GCL policy with Continental Casualty Company (Continental Casualty). Under that policy, Continental Casualty agreed to indemnify M&amp;B for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-14\">\u201call sums * * * imposed upon the Insured by law, or * * * assumed by the Insured under contract or agreement * * * for damages, direct or consequential, and expenses * * * on account of * * * Property Damage * * * caused by or arising out of each occurrence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">The policy defined \u201coccurrence\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-16\">\u201can event or continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which unexpectedly causes * * * Property Damage * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>during the policy period. All such exposure to substantially the same general conditions existing at or emanating from each premises location shall be deemed one occurrence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">That policy contained the following trigger-of-coverage clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">\u201cThis policy applies only to occurrences happening during the policy period anywhere in the world.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">C. <em>Policies Containing Pollution Exclusions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">After the 1968 to 1971 National Continental policy expired, M&amp;B and National Continental entered into two more third-party GCL policies. The first ran from September 1971 to September 1974; the second ran from September 1974 to September 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">When the September 1975 policy expired, M&amp;B entered into a series of third-party GCL insurance agreements with Consolidated American Insurance Company (Consolidated American). M&amp;B was covered by Consolidated American from September 1975 to September 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">In addition, M&amp;B had an excess policy with United States Fire Insurance Company (US Fire) from May 1970 to May 1973. From May 1973 to May 1976, M&amp;B had an excess policy with Gulf Insurance Company (Gulf).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">All the third-party liability and excess policies entered into between M&amp;B and the foregoing insurers contained \u201cpollution exclusions.\u201d In addition, in 1970, a pollution exclusion was added by endorsement to the National Continental (1968-71) policy. That endorsement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-11\">\u201cIt is agreed that this insurance does not apply to bodily injury or property damage arising out of the discharge, dispersal, release or escape of smoke, vapors, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, toxic chemicals, liquids or gases, waste materials or other irritants, contaminants or pollutants into or upon land, the atmosphere or any watercourse or body of water; <em>but this exclusion does not apply if such discharge, dispersal, release or escape is sudden and accidental.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">The pollution exclusions in the Consolidated American, Gulf, and later National Continental policies were identical to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>pollution exclusion contained in the 1970 endorsement to the National Continental (1968-71) policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The US Fire policy covered \u201cdamages because of injury to or destruction of tangible property including consequential loss resulting therefrom caused by an occurrence.\u201d The pollution exclusion in that policy provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">\u201cThis policy shall not apply * * * to liability for contamination or pollution of land, water, air or real or personal property or any injuries or damages resulting therefrom caused by an occurrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">\u201cFor the purpose of this endorsement * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">\u201c \u2018Occurrence\u2019 means a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which unexpectedly and unintentionally causes injury to persons or tangible property during the policy period. All damages arising out of such exposure to substantially the same general conditions shall be considered as arising out of one occurrence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">After 1985, M&amp;B purchased third-party GCL policies that contained \u201cabsolute\u201d pollution exclusions, which were more complete than the quoted pre-1985 pollution exclusions. M&amp;B does not claim coverage under the post-1985 policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">IV. INTERPRETATION OF THE APPLICABLE POLICIES</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">As the foregoing discussion shows, the insurance policies issued to M&amp;B fall into three categories for the purposes of our analysis here: \u201ccaused-by-accident\u201d policies, \u201coccurrence-based\u201d policies, and policies containing \u201cpollution exclusions.\u201d The insurers that issued the caused-by-accident policies and the policies with pollution exclusions argue that those policies do not provide any coverage to M&amp;B.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, M&amp;B\u2019s pre-1970 insurers \u2014 both those that issued caused-by-accident policies and those that issued occurrence-based policies \u2014 argue that, because the contamination at the Stockton and Portland plants was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>discovered </em>until after those policies had expired, coverage was not \u201ctriggered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">We begin with the \u201ctrigger-of-coverage\u201d issue. We then address the \u201ccaused-by-accident\u201d and \u201cpollution-exclusion\u201d issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">A. <em>Trigger of Coverage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Each pre-1970 policy contained a trigger clause that limited coverage for \u201caccidents\u201d or \u201coccurrences.\u201d The trial court ruled that coverage under those policies is triggered \u201cwhen the injury manifests itself. Since the injury here did not manifest itself until many years after the policy period, there was no coverage.\u201d The Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that the clear wording of the policies is contrary to the trial court\u2019s application of a \u201cmanifestation trigger.\u201d 126 Or App at 697-700.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The trigger-of-coverage clauses of the pre-1970 policies are similar in all relevant respects. The Hartford (1949-53) and National Fire (1953-56) policies provided in part: \u201cThis policy applies only to accidents which <em>occur during the policy </em>period[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) The St. Paul (1956-65) policy provided in part: \u201cThis policy applies * * * to occurrences or accidents <em>taking place </em>* * * <em>during the policy period.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The National Continental (1965-68) policy provided in part: \u201cThis policy applies only to accidents or occurrences which <em>occur during the policy periodic\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The National Continental (1968-71) policy provided in part: \u201cAll of the coverages afforded by this policy are LIMITED to * * * property damage which is <em>ACTUALLY SUSTAINED during the policy period.\u201d </em>(Boldface deleted; emphasis added.) The Lloyd\u2019s policies (1964-69) covered \u201cdamage to or destruction of property of others * * * caused by accident occurring <em>during the [policy] period.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The Continental Casualty policy provided: \u201cThis policy applies only to occurrences <em>happening during the policy period.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">The insurers argue that, under the quoted clauses, \u201cinsurance is not triggered unless an occurrence [or accident] results in covered property damage which is <em>discovered, </em>or <em>becomes manifest, </em>during the policy period.\u201d (Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>added.) M&amp;B argues that the trigger clauses of the pre-1970 policies contain no such limitation. The clear words of the trigger clauses at issue support M&amp;B\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The operative phrase in the trigger clauses contained in the caused-by-accident policies is \u201cduring the policy period.\u201d The common meaning of \u201cduring\u201d is \u201cat some point in the course of.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>703 (unabridged ed 1993). The trigger clause states that, if an insurable <em>event </em>\u2014 i.e., an accident \u2014 happens at some point in the course of the policy period, then that event is covered. There is no wording in the pertinent policies that would support the insurers\u2019 reading, and the insurers that issued the caused-by-accident policies point to none.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The insurers that issued occurrence-based policies rely on the definitions of \u201coccurrence\u201d to argue that \u201cthe time of an \u2018occurrence\u2019 * * * within the meaning of a [third-party] liability insurance policy is not the time the wrongful act was committed, but the time when the complaining third party was actually damaged.\u201d The insurers argue that the \u201cdamages\u201d in this case (and, thus, the covered \u201coccurrences\u201d) are the costs of investigating and remedying the environmental harm that resulted from M&amp;B\u2019s operations. Because those \u201cdamages\u201d were not incurred by M&amp;B until after the occurrence-based policies had expired, the insurers argue that there was no covered \u201coccurrence.\u201d That argument is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The policies do not make an \u201coccurrence\u201d depend on the fixing of financial responsibility, or damages. Instead, the St. Paul (1962-65), National Continental (1965-68), and Lloyd\u2019s (1964-67) policies contain definitions of \u201coccurrence\u201d that provide that an occurrence has taken place if there is <em>\u201cdirect injury to or destruction of tangible property </em>during the policy period.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Those words are unambiguous. <em>Ifproperty </em>is injured during the policy period, there has been an \u201coccurrence,\u201d and coverage under the policy is triggered. Nothing in the policies provides that M&amp;B\u2019s <em>liability </em>for that injury must be established during the policy period in order for coverage to be triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>To the contrary, the St. Paul (1962-65), National Continental (1965-68), and Lloyd\u2019s (1964-67) policies all provided that the insurer would pay on behalf of the insured \u201call sums which the insured <em>shall become </em>legally obligated to pay as damages.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In other words, those policies, by their own terms, spoke of damages as sums that may be assessed against the insured in the <em>future. </em>Thus, M&amp;B is covered for damages that it becomes legally obligated to pay even <em>after </em>the policy period, so long as an \u201coccurrence\u201d took place <em>during </em>the policy period.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The Continental Casualty (1967-70) and Lloyd\u2019s (1967-69) excess liability policies contain definitions of \u201coccurrence\u201d that are different from the definitions in the other three occurrence-based policies. Both policies define an \u201coccurrence\u201d as something that causes \u201cproperty damage\u201d during the policy period. Those policies also provide coverage for \u201call sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay,\u201d without a temporal limitation of when those obligations must arise for coverage to be triggered. Again, the contrast between the scope of coverage and the definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d demonstrates the flaw in those insurers\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">In summary, all the pre-1970 policies provide coverage for either accidents or occurrences that took place during the policy period. The policies do not make coverage contingent on the time when the property damage was discovered or on the time when the insured\u2019s liability became fixed. Therefore, the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of National Fire, St. Paul, Lloyd\u2019s, National Continental, and Continental Casualty on the trigger-of-coverage issue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals correctly reversed the trial court in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">B. <em>The \u201cCaused-by-Accident\u201dPolicies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">1. <em>The Meaning of \u2018Accident\u201d and Evidence of \u201cAccidents\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">As discussed above, the Hartford (1949-53), National Fire (1953-56), and St. Paul (1956-62) policies covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>third-party property damage \u201ccaused by accident.\u201d The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Hartford, National Fire, and St. Paul, ruling that M&amp;B had failed to present any evidence to establish that there had been any \u201caccident\u201d when those policies were in effect. The Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-4\">\u201c[T]here is no \u2018accident\u2019 if an intentional act brings an unexpected result. That rule applies here to the pollution that resulted from the routine business practices of M&amp;B.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">* * * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">\u201c[The] evidence shows intentional practices in the regular course of business, not an \u2018accident.\u2019 * * * M&amp;B failed to show that there were issues of fact as to whether there were \u2018accidental spills\u2019 at either site. The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment * * * on the issue of \u2018accident.\u2019 \u201d 126 Or App at 705-06.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">For the following reasons, we reverse that holding of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">The relevant provisions of the Hartford, National Fire, and St. Paul policies provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">\u201c[The insurer agrees t]o Pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon him by law, or assumed by him under contract as defined in the policy for damages because of injuries to or destruction of property, including loss of use thereof, <em>caused by accident </em>* * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">The insurers urge this court to adopt the \u201cregular-course-of-business\u201d test articulated by the Court of Appeals or, alternatively, a test that places a temporal limitation on the definition of the word \u201caccident.\u201d They argue that the term \u201caccident\u201d as it is used in those policies \u201cmeans a sudden happening, not only unexpected, but one referable to a definite time.\u201d The insurers assert that events that result from \u201cthe regular course of business\u201d cannot be accidents, because the means that produced those events were deliberate and continuous business practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">M&amp;B contends that the term \u201caccident\u201d as used in those policies contains neither a temporal element nor a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u201cmeans\u201d-based limitation. M&amp;B asserts that an \u201caccident\u201d is any event that results in unexpected, or unforeseen, consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Our analysis begins with the wording of the policies. The word \u201caccident\u201d is not defined in the policies, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Hartford argues that an endorsement to the 1950-51 policy provides some insight as to the meaning of the word \u201caccident\u201d in that policy. That endorsement reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">\u201cThe words \u2018caused by accident\u2019 are deleted from Insuring Agreement 1 \u2014 Coverages A and B \u2014 Bodily Injury Liability of the policy. Insofar as concerns bodily injury liability only, the word \u2018occurrence\u2019 is substituted for the word \u2018accident\u2019 wherever the latter appears in the policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u201cOccurrence\u201d was not defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Hartford argues that that endorsement draws a distinction between an \u201caccident\u201d and an \u201coccurrence\u201d that supports its reading of the pertinent part of the policy. However, the endorsement, by its own terms, is limited to those portions of the policy that cover \u201cbodily injury.\u201d That coverage is not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">We conclude that the wording of the policies does not resolve the issue. We next consider the ordinary meaning of \u201caccident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">The word \u201caccident\u201d commonly means, as pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-11\">\u201cla : an event or condition occurring by chance or arising from unknown or remote causes * * * b : lack of intention * * * 2a : a * * * sudden event or change occurring without intent or volition through carelessness, unawareness, ignorance, or a combination of causes and producing an unfortunate result * * * c : an unexpected happening causing loss or injury which is not due to any fault or misconduct on the part of the person injured but from the consequences of which he may be entitled to some legal relief.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 11.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">That definition is broad enough to cover the proposed definitions of both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">However, prior cases from this court provide guidance as to the meaning of \u201caccident.\u201d In <em>Finley v. Prudential </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number><em>Ins. Co., </em>236 Or 235, 238, 388 P2d 21 (1963), this court was required to interpret the word \u201caccident\u201d as it applied to an insurance claim for \u201caccidental bodily injury.\u201d The court stated that \u201cthe word \u2018accident\u2019 denotes an incident or occurrence that happened by chance, without design and contrary to intention and expectation.\u201d Id. at 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">In <em>Ramco, Inc. v. Pacific Ins., </em>249 Or 666, 667, 439 P2d 1002 (1968), the insured sought to recover for property damage on a third-party GCL policy. The insured had made defective heaters and had sold them to a motel. The heaters caused extensive damage to the motel. The insured\u2019s policy contained a caused-by-accident clause that is identical to the clause in the Hartford, National Fire, and St. Paul policies. <em>Id. </em>at 668 n 1. This court held that the policy provided coverage to the insured. <em>Id. </em>at 674. Although the court\u2019s holding in <em>Rameo </em>was limited to interpreting the clause with reference to a products liability claim, the court stated that the definition of \u201caccident\u201d given in <em>Finley </em>generally would apply. <em>See Ramco, </em>249 Or at 669 (\u201cGenerally, the definition of the word \u2018accident\u2019 in our decision in <em>Finley v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>would include the events described in this action.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In the present case, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u201cthere is no \u2018accident\u2019 if an intentional act brings an unexpected result.\u201d 126 Or App at 705. The court reached that conclusion by relying on a portion of the <em>Finley </em>opinion that drew a distinction between unintentional <em>results </em>and unintentional <em>means. Ibid. See Finley, </em>236 Or at 245 (defining an \u201caccident\u201d as something that is unintended, and then stating that the \u201ccourt is committed by <em>Buckles v. Continental Casualty Co., </em>[197 Or 128, 251 P2d 476, 252 P2d 184 (1953),] to the rule which distinguishes between accidental means and accidental results from intended means\u201d). Under that rule, unintended events that result from intentional acts \u201cwhere no mischance, slip, or mishap occurs\u201d are not accidental, whereas unintended events that result from unintentional acts are accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The Court of Appeals\u2019 reliance on the means/results distinction was error. In <em>Botts v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>284 Or 95, 100, 585 P2d 657 (1978), this court decided to \u201clay the distinction to rest.\u201d The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\">\u201cWe interpret insurance policies according to what we perceive to be the understanding of the ordinary purchaser of insurance. We have previously expressed doubts as to whether the ordinary purchaser would expect the concept of \u2018accident\u2019 to have a different meaning depending upon whether the policy purports to require accidental means or accidental results. We are convinced that no distinction would be expected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">\u201c* * * The insurance company may, of course, insert in its policy any definition of \u2018accident\u2019 it chooses but in the absence of doing so, it must accept the common understanding of the term by the ordinary member of the purchasing public.\u201d Id. at 100-01 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">In <em>Finley, </em>this court defined accident, as that word is understood by an ordinary purchaser of insurance. In <em>Rameo, </em>the court applied the <em>Finley </em>definition of \u201caccident\u201d to a third-party GCL policy for property damage. In <em>Botts, </em>the court eliminated the means/results distinction, but did not modify the court\u2019s prior discussion of the common meaning of \u201caccident\u201d nor the applicability of that common meaning to a third-party GCL caused-by-accident policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">We recognize that <em>Finley, Rameo, </em>and <em>Botts </em>all were decided after the expiration of the policies under discussion (1949-62). Nonetheless, the court intended those cases to portray the common understanding of the term \u201caccident\u201d by an ordinary purchaser of insurance. For that reason, we rely on them here. Based on our precedents, an \u201caccident\u201d is an \u201cincident or occurrence that happened by chance, without design and contrary to intention and expectation.\u201d <em>Finley, </em>236 Or at 245. We so interpret the term \u201caccident\u201d in the caused-by-accident policies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">M&amp;B seeks indemnification for investigation and remediation of soil, ground water, and surface water contamination that caused damage to the property of others. M&amp;B presented evidence of the following damage at the Portland plant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>\u2022 Between 1949 and 1962, contaminants were spilled as a result of \u201cequipment failures such as ruptured pipes, lines and broken or leaky valves.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-4\">\u2022 As part of M&amp;B\u2019s operations, preservatives leaked or spilled onto the ground, although M&amp;B tried to avoid such leaks and spills \u201cto assur[e] that product was not wasted and that there was a clean and safe work place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">\u2022 Between 1949 and 1985, there were at least 25 spills of preservatives, ranging from a few gallons to 3,000 gallons, \u201cthat occurred when a storage tank overflowed as a result of preservatives being accidentally pumped back to a tank that did not contain sufficient capacity for the solution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">\u2022 On July 11,1956, 3,657 gallons of creosote spilled onto the ground because of a defective loading valve on a tank car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">\u2022 During a labor dispute in 1949 or 1950, someone deliberately opened a flange bolt on a large storage tank, and 47,000 gallons of creosote spilled out as a result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">M&amp;B presented evidence that contamination from the 1950 and 1956 spills reached the groundwater within a year after the spills occurred.

M&amp;B also presented evidence that surface impoundments were in use at the Stockton site when the Hartford, National Fire, and St. Paul policies were in effect. M&amp;B presented evidence that contaminants reached the groundwater at the Stockton site within a year after M&amp;B began to use the impoundments and that those contaminants \u201cremain [] a part of the existing plume of groundwater contamination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">The above-described events all were \u201ccaused by accident\u201d as that term is used in the pertinent policies. Evidence in the summary judgment record supports M&amp;B\u2019s argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>that the spills, ruptures, and leaks were unintentional. The same holds true for the environmental harm that resulted from the spills, leaks, and ruptures, as well as for the use of the surface impoundments. M&amp;B presented evidence that it was unaware that leaching of contaminants into the groundwater would occur. Accordingly, there is evidence that the groundwater and soil contaminations were unintended events.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">2. <em>The Hickman Affidavit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The insurers argue that certain facts contained in an affidavit are inadmissible under ORCP 47 D.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> From that premise, the insurers conclude that there is no issue of fact as to whether a 47,000-gallon creosote spill occurred in 1949 or 1950. The Court of Appeals agreed with that argument and conclusion. 126 Or App at 705-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The affidavit at issue was made by Doane Hickman, superintendent of the Portland plant when the spill occurred. Hickman avers that he was the superintendent of the Portland plant from 1946 to 1958 and that he \u201chad the opportunity to oversee all operations in the wood treating process.\u201d The affidavit also states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">\u201cDuring a labor dispute in the early 1950\u2019s at the Portland plant, someone deliberately opened a flange bolt on a large storage tank. This resulted in a spill of many thousands of gallons of preservative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The insurers argue that those statements are insufficient to establish that Hickman had personal knowledge of such a spill.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">We need not decide whether Hickman\u2019s statements about the spill are admissible, because there is other evidence in the record that would establish that the creosote spill did occur. For example, M&amp;B submitted an interoffice memorandum and a proof- of-loss claim form discussing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>same creosote spill. The insurers did not object to the admission of those documents in the trial court, and they do not now argue that the documents are inadmissible. The Court of Appeals erred when it concluded that there was no triable issue of fact as to whether the creosote spill occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">C. <em>The \u201cPollution-Exclusion\u201dPolicies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">As discussed above, after 1970 M&amp;B purchased a series of GCL policies and excess liability policies with \u201cpollution exclusions.\u201d The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of those insurers with policies containing \u201cpollution exclusions,\u201d and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 126 Or App at 706-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">1. <em>The US Fire Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The pollution exclusion in the US Fire (1970-73) excess liability policy differs from the pollution exclusions in the other policies. As previously noted, the US Fire policy covered \u201cdamages because of injury to or destruction of tangible property including consequential loss resulting therefrom caused by an occurrence.\u201d The pollution exclusion in that policy provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">\u201cThis policy shall not apply * * * to liability for contamination or pollution of land, water, air or real or personal property or any injuries or damages resulting therefrom caused by an occurrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">\u201cFor the purpose of this endorsement * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-10\">\u201c \u2018Occurrence\u2019 means a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which unexpectedly and unintentionally causes injury to persons or tangible property during the policy period. All damages arising out of such exposure to substantially the same general conditions shall be considered as arising out of one occurrence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">The US Fire policy thus exempts from coverage contamination or pollution that damages property, if the damage is \u201ccaused by an occurrence.\u201d As a preliminary matter, for the exclusion to apply here, there must be <em>property damage </em>that <em>resulted </em>from <em>contamination or pollution </em>of land or water. That fact is not at issue in this case. M&amp;B and US Fire agree that third-party <em>property damage </em>took place and that it is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number><em>result </em>of the leaching of <em>contaminants </em>into the groundwater and subsurface soil \u2014 \u201ccontamination\u201d or \u201cpollution\u201d of land or water as those words are used in the exclusion. The remaining issue is whether that damage was \u201ccaused by an occurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">In the US Fire policy\u2019s pollution exclusion, an \u201coccurrence\u201d means \u201ca continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which unexpectedly and unintentionally cause[ ] injury to * * * property during the policy period.\u201d Accordingly, the exemption applies if there is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">(1) a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">(2) which unexpectedly and unintentionally causes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">(3) injury to property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">(4) during the policy period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">M&amp;B has pleaded and argued that there was property damage during the policy period. At this stage in the proceedings, US Fire accepts those arguments. Thus, the third and fourth factors in the definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d in this pollution exclusion are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">From the record on summary judgment, there can be no dispute that the first element also has been satisfied. By the terms of the policy, for the first element to be met, the property damage must result from \u201cconditions\u201d that are maintained or reproduced over time. During the policy period, most of the damage caused at the M&amp;B facilities resulted from leaching at the \u201csurface impoundments.\u201d The evidence in the summary judgment record shows that, at both sites, contaminants were continuously and repeatedly placed in those impoundments. Thus, the harm caused by leaching from the surface impoundments was the result of a continuous or repeated exposure to the conditions present in the surface impoundments.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">M&amp;B also presented evidence that, at both facilities, there were spills that resulted from repeated equipment failures. M&amp;B also presented evidence that there were at least 25 spills that occurred when storage tanks were overfilled. Thus, any groundwater or subsurface soil contamination that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>resulted from those spills also resulted from \u201crepeated exposure to conditions.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Finally, as to the remaining element, M&amp;B argues that the leaching of contaminants into the groundwater was unexpected and unintended. US Fire accepts that characterization.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">As our discussion shows, the \u201ccontamination or pollution of land, water, air or real or personal property * * * or damages resulting therefrom\u201d for which M&amp;B seeks coverage was an \u201coccurrence\u201d as that term is defined in the US Fire pollution exclusion. Therefore, the exclusion applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">M&amp;B does not dispute any of the foregoing analysis. Rather, M&amp;B argues that the pollution exclusion is confusing, because it contains a definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d that is different than the definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d contained in the body of the policy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> M&amp;B then asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">\u201cWhile it is the insurer\u2019s burden to draft exclusions that are clear, the use of conflicting definitions of \u2018occurrence\u2019 renders the provisions virtually unintelligible. The ordinary purchaser of insurance would have considerable difficulty in discerning what risks are covered and what are excluded. The insurer should not be permitted to invoke this inherently ambiguous exclusion to deny coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">We disagree with that argument. The policy, by its own terms, contains two different definitions of \u201coccurrence.\u201d The first definition applies to the policy generally. The second, different definition applies only \u201cto liability for contamination or pollution of land, water, air or real or personal property or any injuries or damages resulting therefrom.\u201d M&amp;B does not assert that the scope of that phrase is unclear, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>and we do not find it so. The pollution exclusion is a self-contained, complete unit. An ordinary purchaser of insurance would understand that the addition to an insurance policy, by endorsement, of an \u201cexclusion\u201d that explicitly defines the class of events covered, under specified circumstances, affects coverage. M&amp;B\u2019s argument to the contrary is unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The trial court did not err when it granted summary judgment to US Fire. For the reasons stated above, the Court of Appeals did not err when it affirmed that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">2. <em>The National Continental, Consolidated American, and Gulf Policies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The National Continental (1968-75), Consolidated American (1975-85), and Gulf (1973-76) policies all contained identical \u201cpollution exclusions.\u201d Those policies provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">\u201c[T]his insurance does not apply to bodily injury or property damage arising out of the discharge, dispersal, release or escape of smoke, vapors, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, toxic chemicals, liquids or gases, waste materials or other irritants, contaminants or pollutants into or upon land, the atmosphere or any watercourse or body of water; <em>but this exclusion does not apply if such discharge, dispersal, release or escape is sudden and accidental.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Under the terms of those exclusions, only a \u201csudden and accidental\u201d \u201cdischarge, dispersal, release or escape\u201d is covered under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">We note, first, that the emphasized clause of the \u201cpollution exclusion\u201d refers only to \u201cdischarge[s], dispersal[s], release[s] or escape[s]\u201d that are \u201csudden and accidental.\u201d No \u201csudden and accidental\u201d limitation is placed on the property damage \u201carising out of\u2019 such events. In other words, under the exclusion, if a \u201cdischarge, dispersal, release or escape\u201d is \u201csudden and accidental,\u201d the resulting property damage need not be \u201csudden and accidental\u201d for the exception to the exclusion to apply and for coverage to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">The insurers argue that the phrase \u201csudden and accidental\u201d is unambiguous. Under their reading of the policies, \u201csudden\u201d has \u201ca temporal meaning, connoting an abruptness and short duration that precludes coverage for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the ongoing, repeated, long term activities that caused innumerable discharges.\u201d Moreover, an \u201caccidental\u201d event must be an <em>event </em>that is unintended; an accidental event cannot be something that is \u201callowed to occur as part of [M&amp;B]\u2019s regular business practices for more than four decades.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">M&amp;B argues that the phrase \u201csudden and accidental\u201d means simply \u201cunintended and unexpected.\u201d In support of that argument, M&amp;B relies on decisions from other jurisdictions interpreting the same pollution exclusion, on treatises, on law review articles, and on statements made by insurance lobbyists in other jurisdictions concerning the phrase \u201csudden and accidental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">As stated above, our goal in interpreting an insurance policy is to ascertain the intent of the parties when they contracted. We start with the words of the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u201cSudden\u201d is not defined in the policies. \u201cSudden\u201d commonly means, as pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">\u201cla : happening without previous notice or with very brief notice : coming or occurring unexpectedly : not foreseen or prepared for * * * b : changing angle or character all at once : PRECIPITOUS * * * : ABRUPT * * * c : come upon or met with unexpectedly 2a : characterized by or manifesting hastiness : RASH, HEADLONG.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 2284.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Thus, \u201csudden\u201d <em>may </em>have, but <em>need not </em>always have, a temporal element.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">M&amp;B argues that \u201csudden\u201d commonly is understood to <em>lack </em>a temporal element. <em>See, e.g., Plasker v. Fazio, </em>259 Or 171, 180, 485 P2d 1075 (1971) (interpreting the word \u201csuddenly\u201d as used in a statute to mean \u201cunexpectedly\u201d). M&amp;B argues that, because the insurers did not anticipate the groundwater and soil contamination at the Portland and Stockton plants, that damage was sudden.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">M&amp;B also argues that that contamination was \u201caccidental.\u201d \u201cAccidental\u201d was not defined in the policies, either. It commonly means, as pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-11\">\u201c2 : occurring sometimes with unfortunate results by chance alone : a: UNPREDICTABLE : proceeding from an unrecognized principle, from an uncommon operation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>known principle, or from a deviation from normal.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 11.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The dictionary goes on to state that, \u201cwhen it is used in reference to events, ACCIDENTAL may stress lack of intent.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In other words, an accidental event may be an unintentional, or chance, event.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">If the foregoing readings of the words \u201csudden\u201d and \u201caccidental\u201d are given effect, the phrase \u201csudden and accidental\u201d could be synonymous with the phrase \u201cunintended and unexpected.\u201d The insurers argue that such a reading of the phrase \u201csudden and accidental\u201d renders that phrase redundant, because an unintended event always is an unexpected event. That is not necessarily so. Not every unintended event (or result) necessarily is unexpected.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">M&amp;B\u2019s argument that the phrase \u201csudden and accidental\u201d does not contain a temporal element, or at least is ambiguous as to whether it contains a temporal element, is strengthened by another factor. At the time that M&amp;B purchased the policies with the pollution exclusions, courts had interpreted the word \u201csudden\u201d to mean \u201cunexpected\u201d in the business insurance context. Before the phrase \u201csudden and accidental\u201d was incorporated into pollution exclusions, that phrase had been used in numerous \u201cmachinery and boiler\u201d policies. It had been interpreted routinely to mean \u201cunintended and unexpected.\u201d <em>See, e.g., New England Gas &amp; E. Ass\u2019n v. Ocean Acc. &amp; Guar. Corp., </em>330 Mass 640, 116 NE2d 671, 680 (1953) (interpreting the word \u201csudden\u201d as used in the phrase \u201csudden and accidental\u201d in a machine and boiler policy and \u201cgiv[ing] to the term sudden its primary meaning according to the lexicographers as a happening without previous notice or with very brief notice, or as something coming or occurring unexpectedly, unforeseen, or unprepared for\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number><em>Anderson &amp; Middleton Lbr. Co. v. Lumbermen\u2019s M.C. Co., </em>53 Wash 2d 404, 333 P2d 938, 941 (1959) (interpreting the word \u201csudden\u201d as used in the phrase \u201csudden and accidental\u201d in a machine and boiler policy and stating that the \u201cprimary meaning\u201d of \u201csudden,\u201d \u201cin common usage, is not \u2018instantaneous\u2019 but rather \u2018unforeseen and unexpected\u2019 \u201d). <em>See also </em>George J. Couch, et al., 11 <em>Couch Cyclopedia of Insurance Law, </em>\u00a7 42:383 (2d ed 1963) (\u201c \u2018sudden\u2019 should be given its primary meaning as a happening without previous notice, or as something coming or occurring unexpectedly, as unforeseen or unprepared for * * *; \u2018sudden\u2019 is not to be construed as synonymous with instantaneous\u201d (footnotes omitted)).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In those policies, \u201csudden\u201d was understood as <em>lacking </em>a temporal element. When the insurers placed the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d clause in the pollution exclusions, that term already had been interpreted to mean \u201cunintended and unexpected.\u201d <em>See </em>John Alan Appleman and Jean Appleman, 13 <em>Insurance Law and Practice, </em>\u00a7 7404 (1976) (\u201c[I]f an insurance company continues to employ clauses which have been construed unfavorably to its contention by the courts, it may well be considered to have issued the policy with that construction placed on it and cannot be heard to insist that the loss is not covered. The very fact that a number of courts have reached conflicting conclusions as to the interpretation of a certain provision is frequently considered evidence of ambiguity.\u201d (footnotes omitted)). <em>See also Jones v. Ins. Co. of North America, </em>264 Or 276, 282 n 1, 504 P2d 130 (1972) (\u201cconflicting judicial decisions as to the proper construction of a clause in an insurance policy are evidence, although not necessarily conclusive, that the clause is ambiguous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">As our foregoing discussion shows, the word \u201csudden\u201d as it is used in the pollution exclusions is susceptible to differing interpretations. This court\u2019s prior case law and contemporaneous understandings of the phrase \u201csudden and accidental\u201d lend support to M&amp;B\u2019s reading of that phrase. The policies themselves do not resolve the ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>M&amp;B, the insurers, and numerous <em>amici curiae </em>point to two additional types of materials to support their competing interpretations of the pollution exclusion: (1) case law from other jurisdictions, interpreting the same pollution exclusion; and (2) statements by representatives of the insurance industry to agencies in various states, concerning the meaning of the pollution exclusion. Assuming that those materials are relevant and admissible, they lend support to <em>both </em>sides\u2019 arguments as to the meaning of the pollution exclusion and thereby illustrate that the pollution exclusion is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation. Accordingly, they simply help to demonstrate that the exclusion is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Under the methodology described above, 324 Or at 192-93, we conclude that the pollution exclusion is ambiguous. Accordingly, we construe the policy against the drafter. We hold that the pollution exclusions contained in the National Continental (1968-75), Consolidated American (1975-85), and Gulf (1973-76) policies do not apply to discharges, dispersals, releases, or escapes that are \u201cunintended and unexpected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">M&amp;B presented evidence that contaminants from the surface impoundments leached into the groundwater and subsurface soil during the effective periods of the pertinent policies. M&amp;B presented additional evidence that leaks, ruptures, and spills at the plant occurred during that time and that those events also affected the groundwater and subsurface soils. M&amp;B presented evidence that the contamination that resulted from those events \u2014 the discharge, dispersal, release or escape of the contaminants \u2014 was unexpected and unintended.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The trial court erred when it granted summaryjudgment in favor of National Continental, Continental Casualty, and Gulf on the \u201cpollution-exclusion\u201d issue. The Court of Appeals erred when it affirmed that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">V.
