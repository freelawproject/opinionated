J.</author>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">This case involves three original ballot title proceedings, which we consolidated for argument and opinion. In each proceeding, a separate petitioner or group of petitioners challenges the ballot title for House Bill 3480, which the 1996 legislature passed during a special session. Or Laws 1996, ch 14 (Spec Sess). The bill has been referred to the voters pursuant to Article IV, section l(3)(b), of the Oregon Constitution. Each petitioner is an elector who submitted written comments about the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title in a timely manner. ORS 250.067(1). Consequently, each petitioner is entitled to seek a different title in this court. ORS 250.085(2). We have considered each of petitioners\u2019 arguments concerning the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title and have concluded that all segments of the ballot title require modification. Accordingly, we modify the ballot title, in order to substantially comply with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2). <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(5) (establishing this court\u2019s standard of review of ballot titles).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">We first summarize the significant parts of House Bill 3480. The bill establishes and provides for the funding of two new transportation-related accounts, the \u201cSouth North Construction Fund\u201d and the \u201cTransportation Equity Account.\u201d Or Laws 1996, ch 14, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 12 (Spec Sess). The purpose of the South North Construction Fund is to provide the state\u2019s portion of the funding for the first construction segment of the \u201cSouth North Line,\u201d a light rail project in the Portland Tri-Met region.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The purpose of the Transportation Equity Account is to provide funding for future \u201cessential transportation projects\u201d throughout the state, in all counties other than the three Tri-Met counties. The bill provides that each of those remaining 33 counties, as well as cities in those counties, will receive a proportional distribution from the Transportation Equity Account.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Or Laws 1996, ch 14, \u00a7 17 (Spec Sess).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>According to House Bill 3480, the South North Construction Fund and the Transportation Equity Account will be funded to a level of $375 million each. Or Laws 1996, ch 14, \u00a7\u00a7 3(2) and 13(4) (Spec Sess). In order to fund the accounts, the bill first provides that the state may issue lottery revenue bonds in an aggregate amount not to exceed $490 million, plus issuing and administrative costs, necessary reserves, and the cost of bond insurance or other credit-related devices. Or Laws 1996, ch 14, \u00a7 7(1) (Spec Sess). Of that $490 million, the bill allocates $375 million to the South North Construction Fund and $115 million to the Transportation Equity Account. Or Laws 1996, ch 14, \u00a7\u00a7 3(2), 6(2)(c), 6(3), and 12(3) (Spec Sess).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">As a result of that allocation, the sale of lottery bonds will fully fund the South North Construction Fund. However, the bonds will fund the Transportation Equity Account only partially at $115 million. Consequently, House Bill 3480 further provides that the remaining balance of the Transportation Equity Account, $260 million, will be funded by the following sources: (1) estimated state income tax revenues to be collected from income generated by the South North line, which will be appropriated from the state\u2019s general fund, Or Laws 1996, ch 14, \u00a7\u00a7 13(1) and (3) (Spec Sess); (2) federal transportation funds that otherwise would be distributed to the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon (Tri-Met), Or Laws 1996, ch 14, \u00a7 14(l)(a) (Spec Sess); (3) lottery funds redistributed from local governments, Or Laws 1996, ch 14, \u00a7 14(l)(b) (Spec Sess); (4) other funds potentially to be paid to Tri-Met, subject to future legislation, Or Laws 1996, ch 14, \u00a7 16(4) (Spec Sess); and (5) the general fund, if necessary, Or Laws 1996, ch 14, \u00a7 13(4) (Spec Sess).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">House Bill 3480 also provides that the lottery bonds shall not be issued \u201cunless, on or before the date of issuance of the bonds, federal matching funds have been made available for the first construction segment of the South North Line light rail project.\u201d Or Laws 1996, ch 14, \u00a7 8 (Spec Sess). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>addition, the bill provides that the state shall repay the lottery bonds, if issued, using \u201cunobligated net lottery proceeds\u201d and other appropriated and invested funds. Or Laws 1996, ch 14, \u00a7\u00a7 5,6, and 7(5) (Spec Sess). \u201cUnobligated net lottery proceeds\u201d generally include all lottery proceeds that are not already obligated, by other statutory or constitutional provisions, to some other state fund or expense. Or Laws 1996, ch 14, \u00a7 2(14) (Spec Sess).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">Finally, House Bill 3480 also contains several additional provisions, including legislative findings, definitions, and provisions to establish a Light Rail Oversight Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">As noted, the 1996 legislature passed House Bill 3480 during a special session. The Governor approved the bill on March 4,1996, and the bill would have become effective on May 3, 1996. However, before that effective date, several electors filed a referendum petition with the Secretary of State that contained the number of signatures required to refer the bill to the voters at the next general election. Or Const, Art IV, \u00a7 l(3)(b). Because House Bill 3480 is now the subject of a referendum, the Attorney General prepared a proposed ballot title. ORS 250.065(4). After receiving and considering several comments, pursuant to ORS 250.067(1), the Attorney General revised the draft ballot title and certified the following ballot title for House Bill 3480:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">\u201cAUTHORIZES BONDS FOR PORTLAND AREA LIGHT RAIL, TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS ELSEWHERE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">\u201cRESULT OF YES\u2019 VOTE: Yes\u2019 vote authorizes lottery bonds for Portland area light rail, transportation projects outside Portland area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">\u201cRESULT OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: \u2018No\u2019 vote rejects lottery bonds for Portland area light rail, transportation projects outside Portland area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">\u201cSUMMARY: Measure permits state to issue lottery revenue bonds to fund $375 million of state\u2019s share of cost to build Tri-Met Portland area \u2018South North light rail,\u2019 and to fund $115 million of $375 million \u2018Transportation Equity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Account.\u2019 Establishes \u2018Transportation Equity Account,\u2019payable to cities and counties for transportation projects outside Portland region, funded by lottery bonds, general fund, and other sources. Unobligated net revenues from lottery repay bonds. Bonds cannot be sold unless federal light rail matching funds become available. Other provisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">We now turn to the specific challenges to the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title raised by petitioners. We first address the objections of petitioners Brummell and Kane and petitioner Mclntire,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> followed by the objections of petitioners Bogue and Burton.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Petitioners Brummell and Kane are electors who made timely objections to the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title. Petitioner Mclntire is one of the chief petitioners who filed the referendum petition for House Bill 3480; he also made timely objections to the draft ballot title. All three petitioners challenge all segments of the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title. We address their objections in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Petitioners Brummell and Kane first object to the caption of the certified ballot title because it does not state that House Bill 3480 authorizes a minimum bond issue of $490 million and also does not state that more than $490 million in bonds may be issued under the bill, to cover administrative costs and reserves.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As we shall explain, we conclude that that objection is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>The caption of a ballot title is limited to 10 words and must \u201creasonably identif[y] the subject of the measure.\u201d ORS 250.035(2)(\u00e1). The subject of House Bill 3480 is the establishment of a funding program for the South North Line and other essential transportation projects outside the Portland Tri-Met region. The minimum amount of the bond issue, $490 million, and the authorization of additional amounts exceeding $490 million are details that are not essential to a 10-word summary of the subject of the bill. Consequently, the caption need not include those items.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">Petitioners Brummell and Kane next contend that the caption is misleading when it refers to \u201ctransportation projects elsewhere\u201d and, instead, should specifically state the location of those projects. We disagree for the same reasons stated above: It is not necessary to mention the location of the other transportation projects in order to summarize the subject of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Finally, petitioners Brummell and Kane contend that the caption is defective because it does not state that, in order to fund the Transportation Equity Account, House Bill 3480 authorizes the spending of other funds, including potential distributions from the general fund, in addition to authorizing the $490 million minimum bond issue. Petitioner Mclntire also makes that argument and further contends that the caption is grossly misleading because it fails to state that a substantial portion of the Transportation Equity Account will be funded using income tax revenues, not lottery proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Petitioners are correct that, of the $750 million in transportation funding authorized by House Bill 3480, approximately one-third of that total \u2014 $260 million in the Transportation Equity Account \u2014 will come not from the lottery bonds, but from other sources, such as estimated state income tax revenues generated by the South North Line, federal transportation funds and other future funds appropriated from Tri-Met, lottery funds redistributed from local governments, and, if necessary, the general fund. Consequently, by providing that the bill \u201cauthorizes bonds for Portland area light rail, transportation projects elsewhere,\u201d the Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>General\u2019s caption fails to mention that additional authorized spending.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">However, it is significant to note that, in drafting House Bill 3480, the legislature specifically provided that \u201cthe purpose of [the substantive portions] of this Act is to establish a state revenue bond program to provide the state\u2019s share of the cost of the South North Line.\u201d Or Laws 1996, ch 14, \u00a7 1(2) (Spec Sess). In view of that statement of legislative purpose, and given the constraints of ORS 250.035(2)(a), we conclude that the Attorney General\u2019s caption substantially complies with the requirement that the caption reasonably identify the subject of the measure, despite the caption\u2019s failure to mention the additional authorized spending of $260 million in the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Petitioners Brummell and Kane and petitioner Mclntire next challenge both the \u201c \u2018yes\u2019 vote\u201d and \u201c \u2018no\u2019 vote\u201d result statements in the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title. The result statements serve to describe the result if the measure is approved or rejected by the voters. ORS <em>250.035(2)(b) </em>and (c). All three petitioners again argue that the result statements are misleading because those statements do not specify that House Bill 3480 authorizes $260 million in spending, in addition to the $490 million minimum bond issue, some of which may come from the state\u2019s general fund. We reject that argument for the same reasons discussed above and need not elaborate further.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Petitioners Brummell and Kane and petitioner Mclntire also challenge the summary in the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title. According to ORS 250.035(2)(d), a ballot title must contain \u201c[a] concise and impartial statement of not more than 85 words summarizing the measure and its major effect.\u201d As we shall explain, we conclude that two of the arguments presented by petitioners Brummell and Kane are well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Petitioners Brummell and Kane first contend, as they did in challenging the caption, that the first sentence of the summary is misleading because it fails to state that House Bill 3480 provides that more than $490 million in bonds may be issued, in order to cover various administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>costs and reserves. <em>See </em>324 Or at 48 and n 4 (discussing petitioners\u2019 objection to the caption and quoting the bond issue provisions in the bill). Although we have concluded that the caption need not mention the details of the bond issue, we agree with petitioners Brummell and Kane that the summary should advise the voters that House Bill 3480 authorizes the issuance of bonds exceeding $490 million. Consequently, we shall modify the summary to reflect that provision of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Petitioners Brummell and Kane also contend that the first sentence of the summary is misleading because it fails to include the total principle amount of the bond issue, $490 million. They further contend that the summary is vague and confusing when it states that the lottery bonds will fund \u201c$115 million of $375 million \u2018Transportation Equity Account.\u2019 \u201d We agree that the first sentence of the summary should more clearly state that the lottery bonds will provide funding for <em>both </em>the South North Construction Fund <em>and </em>the Transportation Equity Account, and that $260 million of the Transportation Equity Account will be funded by sources other than the lottery bonds. Accordingly, we shall modify the summary in order to make those clarifications. We reject petitioners\u2019 other challenges to the first sentence of the summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Turning to the second sentence of the summary, petitioners Brummell and Kane next contend that that sentence <em>specifically </em>should identify the funding sources for the Transportation Equity Account. Petitioner Mclntire also challenges the summary for that reason and further contends that the term \u201cgeneral fund\u201d is improperly \u201cburied in the text\u201d of the second sentence. We disagree with the three petitioners that, within the constraints imposed by ORS 250.035(2)(d), the summary inadequately identifies the funding sources for the Transportation Equity Account. <em>See </em>324 Or at 46 (discussing those funding sources). We also reject petitioner Mclntire\u2019s argument that the term \u201cgeneral fund\u201d should be moved to a more prominent place in the summary. When compared to the creation in House Bill 3480 of the lottery bond program, the provision concerning the potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>but presently uncertain requirements for general fund contributions to the Transportation Equity Account is of secondary importance, and, accordingly, its placement in the summary is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Petitioners Brummell and Kane next contend that the summary is repetitious because it uses the term \u201cTransportation Equity Account\u201d twice, \u201cpreventing] inclusion of important information within the 85-word summary limit.\u201d In our view, in order to best convey sufficient information concerning the Transportation Equity Account, use of that term twice in the summary is most informative. Accordingly, we reject petitioners\u2019 contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Finally, petitioners Brummell and Kane contend that the summary is incomplete and misleading \u201cbecause it does not disclose that the state\u2019s General Fund faces exposure to bond repayment if lottery revenue proves insufficient.\u201d We acknowledge that two of the sections of House Bill 3480 cited by petitioners provide that the lottery bonds may be repaid from sources other than unobligated net lottery proceeds, which may include contributions from the general fund.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, it is clear upon reviewing the entire bill that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>the state lottery will provide the primary source of revenue to repay the bonds and that potential contributions from the general fund will be minor in comparison. Consequently, we conclude that the summary sufficiently describes the effect of the bill without discussing potential bond repayment from the general fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">We now turn to the challenges to the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title brought by petitioners Bogue and Burton. Both petitioners are proponents of House Bill 3480 and also are electors who made certain timely objections to the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">At the outset, we note that, in their petition to this court, petitioners Bogue and Burton challenge all segments of the certified ballot title for House Bill 3480. However, in their earlier written comments to the Attorney General, offered during the statutory comment period, both petitioners limited their challenges to the summary of the draft ballot title only and essentially conceded that the caption and result statements complied with the statutory requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(a), (b), and (c). Accordingly, we address only the objections to the summary presented by petitioners Bogue and Burton. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(6) (stating that, when reviewing a ballot title, \u201cthe court shall not consider arguments concerning the ballot title not presented in writing to the Secretary of State,\u201d with exceptions that do not apply here). As we shall explain, we conclude that only one of petitioners\u2019 contentions is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Petitioners Bogue and Burton first contend that the order of presentation in the summary is \u201cillogical and confusing\u201d because the summary \u201cfails to separate its description of the South North portion of the measure from its description of the Transportation Equity Account portion.\u201d We acknowledge that the length and complexity of House Bill 3480 does not necessarily lend itself to an easily understood, logical summary. In our view, however, the Attorney General\u2019s summary and the modifications previously discussed in this opinion sufficiently describe the most significant portions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>bill, in substantial compliance with the statutory requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Petitioners Bogue and Burton next object to the third sentence of the summary, which states that \u201cUnobligated net revenues from lottery repay bonds.\u201d According to petitioners, that sentence \u201cis meaningless to the average voter, is awkwardly worded, and is not needed to summarize the measure and its major effect.\u201d We reject petitioners\u2019 contention because House Bill 3480 specifically defines the term \u201cunobligated net lottery proceeds\u201d and uses that term repeatedly.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In our view, however, it is preferable for the summary to track the wording of the bill, and, consequently, we shall modify the summary by changing the term \u201cunobligated net revenues\u201d to \u201cunobligated net lottery proceeds.\u201d We decline to delete the third sentence of the summary, as petitioners suggest, because that sentence is necessary in order to explain to the voters how the state will repay the lottery bonds, if the sale of those bonds is approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Petitioners Bogue and Burton finally contend that the summary should include the following sentence: \u201cMeasure does not approve any new taxes.\u201d Petitioners assert that that statement \u201cis essential to the voter\u2019s understanding [of] the measure and its major effect.\u201d We disagree. Such a sentence would not advance the voters\u2019 understanding of the bill itself; rather, the sentence would tell the voters what the bill does <em>not </em>do. Similarly, the lack of new taxes is not an \u201ceffect\u201d of House Bill 3480. In short, the suggested addition is not relevant to a summary of the bill and its major effect, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>required by ORS 250.035(2)(d), and, consequently, we do not make that addition.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Finally, we also observe that, at oral argument, the parties noted that the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title uses both the words \u201carea\u201d and \u201cregion\u201d to describe the same geographical location. Because House Bill 3480 uses the term \u201cPortland metropolitan <em>region\u201d </em>(emphasis added) to describe the geographical location of the South North Line, we shall modify the caption, the result statements, and the summary, in order to change the word \u201carea\u201d to \u201cregion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">We modify the ballot title certified to the Secretary of State by the Attorney General, and we certify to the Secretary of State the following ballot title:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">AUTHORIZES BONDS FOR PORTLAND REGION LIGHT RAIL, TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS ELSEWHERE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">RESULT OF \u201cYES\u201d VOTE: Wes\u201d vote authorizes lottery bonds for Portland region light rail, transportation projects outside Portland region.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">RESULT OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote rejects lottery bonds for Portland region light rail, transportation projects outside Portland region.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">SUMMARY: Permits state to issue lottery revenue bonds to fund the following, plus costs and reserves: (1) $375 million of state\u2019s share of cost to build Portland region \u201cSouth North light rail\u201d; and (2) $115 million of separate $375 million \u201cTransportation Equity Account,\u201d payable to cities and counties for transportation projects outside Portland region. $260 million of Transportation Equity Account funded by general fund and other sources.
