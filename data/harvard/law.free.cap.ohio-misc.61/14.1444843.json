(Fairmont). He returned to Paulding to Dangler Mobile Homes, the trade name of the proprietorship of Gene N. Dangler (Dangler) the other defendant herein who has operated a mobile home business in Paulding for the last 9 years. Plaintiff did this because of past dealings with Dangler which convinced him that Dangler was an honorable and trustworthy businessman, an opinion he continues to hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-13\">After discussing various features of the Village Green model, plaintiff, on March 28,1974, confirmed an order for a particular model No. 6024-3B-SW with specified desired features among which were \u201celectric furnace\u201d and \u201cTotal Electric\u201d fixtures all to be delivered to Cecil, Ohio, without set-up or foundation for $13,900. Although Dangler had sold some Fairmont mobile home units previously this was the first \u201cdouble-wide\u201d Fairmont unit sold by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-14\">Plaintiff understood that said mobile home was to have the special insulation commonly provided for efficient electric heat in this area in the winter time. Pursuant to this confirmed order defendant Fairmont delivered the ordered unit and billed Dangler on itemized invoice No. 009076 dated 5-23-74 for a total price of $11,523.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Among the items appears one reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-4\">\u201cAll Electric Package 325.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-5\">\u201cSpecial Insulation \u201cElectric Range</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-6\">\u201c30 Gal. Electric Water Heater F210 \u201c307 Electric Furnace F013 \u201c200 AMP Service\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">Plaintiff is not in default for payments on the home. After having much difficulty with condensation, internal frost, and high electric bills the winter of 1974-75, plaintiff employed one Curtis W. Shafer, a regular employee of Johns Manville Fiberglass Corporation who had substantial experience in home insulation, to insulate plaintiffs mobile home. Shafer was assisted by plaintiff\u2019s next door neighbor, Lewis A. Mosier. Plaintiff paid Shafer at least $350 and Mosier $407 and paid $208 for wall insulation materials. About 15 percent of the wall area was found to be completely without any insulation and substantial additional areas to have quite thin insulation, about V2 of what plaintiff expected from having examined Fairmont sales literature at the Dangler agency. Although plaintiff is gainfully employed at a substantial salary he is able to read and write practically nothing except his name. Later, in the fall of 1975, plaintiff paid at least $300 for additional insulation in the ceiling of the mobile home.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">Peter Wilhelm, a man of long experience in home construction, who also operates a mobile home sales agency and rental park in early 1975 inspected plaintiff\u2019s mobile home and gave an estimate for properly insulating the home at $3,250.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">Plaintiff complained to Dangler in the 1974-75 winter period and Dangler relayed the complaints to Fairmont and requested service but same was not forthcoming. Dangler did visit plaintiff and suggest that he might possibly obtain an additional $200 for plaintiff in insulating material but plaintiff never indicated he would be satisfied with such adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-10\">Plaintiff did show Dangler several areas without insulation when they began reinsulation of their mobile home but neither Dangler or any representative of Fairmont was present at the time the siding was pried loose to see what insulation lay beneath.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>There has been substantial water damage to a number of interior panels and to the carpet. Twenty such panels worth $9 each should be replaced, and $300 is needed to replace the damaged carpet.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">Fairmont\u2019s director of service insists that the moisture problems of which plaintiff complains is caused by both under insulation and over insulation but he failed to give any scientific explanation of what the optimum insulation for plaintiff\u2019s mobile home should be. Moreover, he revealed no information as to what insulation definitely was or should have been built into the unit and why the same was adequate for the variety of winter weather typical of the weather history of any 21 year or greater period in Northwestern Ohio. Nor did either the seller or the manufacturer show that the provided \u201call electric package\u201d was or should have been adequate for at least 95 percent of the varying kinds of weather this community experiences over the years.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">The mobile home accepted by and paid for by plaintiff was not suitably fit for the purpose of human habitation in an ordinary manner in this vicinity, which is the purpose it was to serve as known to both the buyer and the seller and the manufacturer. The reason was lack of appropriate insulation, a defect not observable until freezing weather disclosed the fact. Notice of the inadequacy of the unit\u2019s insulation was given to the seller within a reasonable time after its discovery which was in turn relayed to the manufacturer. Defendant Dangler attempted to cause defendant Fairmont to correct the disclosed defect and /or replace the unit. The manufacturer failed to respond by either replacing the unit with a suitable like unit or to refund a portion of the purchase price agreeable to the purchaser by reason of the disclosed deficiency within 30 days of receiving the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">At the time of this transaction in early 1974, Ohio versions of \u201cThe Uniform Commercial Code-Sales\u201d \u2014 R. C. 1302.01 to 1302.98 \u2014 and \u201cThe Uniform Consumer Sales Practices Act\u201d \u2014 R. C. 1345.01 to 1345.13 \u2014 were in full force and effect, the former since July 1, 1962, and the latter since July 14, 1972. By January 1, 1977, the former of these acts had been adopted by the 48 other states and the District of Columbia; and the latter by two other states, Kansas and Utah. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Consequently, the Uniform Commercial Code governed all conduct of both defendants and the Uniform Consumer Sales Code governed the Ohio defendant certainly and the nonresident of Ohio defendant has failed to advance any reason why the law of this forum should not bind it in this action and it is, in the circumstances, charged with knowledge of the destination where this unit was to be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">R. C. 1301.06 (UCC 1-106) provides that its remedies are to be liberally administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">Both defendants are described in these acts as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">In Ohio\u2019s version of the Uniform Consumer Sales Practices Act, effective since July 14, 1972 (adopted by only two other states, Utah and Kansas), R. C. 1345.01 to 1345.13, we find, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">R. C. 1345.01 \u201c(C) \u2018Supplier\u2019 means a seller* **or other person engaged in the business of effecting or soliciting consumer transactions, whether or not he deals directly with the consumer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">R. C. 1345.02 \u201c(B) Without limiting the scope of division (A) of this section.

C. 1345.03 \u201c(A) No supplier shall commit an unconscionable act or practice in connection with a consumer transaction. Such an unconscionable act or practice by a supplier violates this section whether it occurs before, during, or after the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">\u201c(B) In determining whether an act or practice is unconscionable, the following circumstances shall be taken into consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-13\"><em>(i </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b26-14\">\u201c(6) Whether the supplier knowingly made a misleading statement of opinion on which the consumer was likely to rely to his detriment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-15\">R.

C. 1345.il \u201cIn any case arising under sections 1345.01 to 1345.13 of the Revised Code, if the supplier shows by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adopted to avoid the error, no liability is imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Ohio has also, as have all the states save Louisiana \u2014which did adopt four articles \u2014 The Uniform Commercial Code, effective July 1,1962, and the portion relating to Sales is found in R.

Clearly the statutes of Ohio require no less from sellers of mobile homes to those who expect to use them at an Ohio address known to the sellers as here. In construction of housing facilities Ohio has from the beginning required a high standard of performance and provided for adequate damages for failure to meet the same. See <em>Somerby </em>v. <em>Tappan </em>(1833-1834), Wright 229, 570. The Weather Bureau, U. S. Department of Commerce, has existed since 1870 and its records are not kept secret from any seller or any citizen. Any structure sold for purposes of human habitation, whether mobile home or ordinary house, needs as a minimum to provide those characteristics necessary to effectively meet the range or weather conditions found in the area of use over a significant period of years \u2014 probably 21 or more \u2014 or unsuitability may be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">From the facts established by the evidence it is clear that the mobile home purchased by the plaintiff was not, as received, reasonably fit for human habitation during a winter not characterized by any rare, quite unusual weather conditions of extreme severity. Over 10 percent of the wall space where insulation would be expected contained none. From the ordering of a special electric package this court takes judicial notice of the fact that in this community for well over 10 years it has been widely recognized that homes cannot be heated economically by electricity unless they are carefully and correctly insulated. Further, defendant Fairmont made no defense as provided by R. C. 1302.29 (UCC 2-316) or R. C. 1345.11, or other code provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">When plaintiff discovered that his mobile home was not suitable for winter habitation this fact was reported to the sellers, the defendants. Of these Dangler was the local merchant of mobile homes and Fairmont was the manufacturer of same. Both, as the Revised Code shows, are responsible to plaintiff for curing the existing defects which unless corrected in fact, or guaranteed in fact to be done within a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>reasonable time, within 30 days after complaint seasonably made in the circumstances, as here; are subject to his complaint and from them \u201che may recover as damages for any non-conformity of tender the loss resulting in the ordinary course of events from the seller\u2019s breach as determined in any manner which is reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Consequently, the court finds that plaintiff is entitled to damages as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">Wages paid Curtis W. Shafer $350</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">Wages paid Lewis A. Mosier 407</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-8\">Amounts paid for insulation material 508</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-9\">Value of his own time to correct trouble 700</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-10\">For panel replacement 180</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-11\">For carpet replacement 300</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-12\">For pain, suffering and discomfort 1,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-13\">$3,445</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-14\">And all this with interest from November 1, 1975, together with a reasonable attorney fee of $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-15\">In the circumstances shown by the evidence, however, the true proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury rests upon conduct of the seller manufacturer, Fairmont. Consequently, on old principles of indemnity which place, in protecting the deserving plaintiff, full responsibility on actual rather than nominal wrongdoers, judgment will be entered finding Fairmont primarily liable for damages and costs with Dangler secondarily liable. See <em>McMurray </em>v. <em>Vaughn\u2019s Seed Store </em>(1927), 117 Ohio St. 236, 157 N.E. 567. Although this court must conclude that defendant Dangler is made responsible by the terms of the code it cannot find him at fault for (1) having any prior knowledge of unsuitability or likelihood thereof, (2) not performing any common or accepted inspection, prior to delivery, for the conditions ultimately revealed; and (3) for doing or failing to do anything that an honorable retail merchant should or should not have done in the circumstances. As such conduct should be encouraged on the part of the person with knowledge of the subject who meets and deals with the general lay public this court has arrived at the conclusion that in the circumstances here, he should be held to be only secondarily liable to plaintiff unless some statute or rule positively prohibits such finding. This the court has not been able to find.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Defendant Fairmont may protest that the evidence is insufficient to fairly prove the facts found by the court. The court has considered this point and perceives nothing incredible in the evidence and testimony of plaintiff and his witnesses. Said defendant had full opportunity to inform the court of exactly how this complicated, expensive article of commerce was made and what precautions, if any, had been taken to prevent the trouble complained of and what action was taken to correct plaintiffs trouble within 30 days of receipt of its first report of same. It failed to respond in any matter of substance so there is no reason why the court should not accept plaintiffs proof at its face value as it has done.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
