Hood, deceased, against Mary and others, children and heirs at law of McClelland Hood, deceased, to recover the possession of a tract of land situated in Ohio township, Allegheny county, called \u201c.Safe Landing,\u201d containing 226 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-15\">The plaintiffs showed a regular chain of title from the Commonwealth to their testator, vesting the legal title in him on the 6th of February, 1808. His will gave his executors authority to sell and dispose of his real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-16\">The defendants resisted a recovery, on the ground that John had purchased the land for McClelland with' the money of the latter, and held the legal title in trust for him. 'Or, if not purchased with the money of McClelland, that John had made a free and voluntary gift of it to his brother, in pursuance of which McClelland had taken possession in 1808, and had made valuable improvements on it. And also that McClelland entered into the land, claiming it as his own, in 1807, or 1808, and so continued in the actual, exclusive, and adverse possession of it up to the time of his death, and that his title, or that of his heirs, had become perfect under the statute of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>From - the evidence,' it- appeared that John M. Hood and';' McClelland Plood were sons of David Hood, who resided in the; county Tyrone, Ireland.' Their father was possessed of some estate, the valne, of which did not appear. He, died in July,.. 1801, leaving, a,widow., and ten children, of whpm John and Robert had gone to the. United States, the; former in. 17,9$, the latter in 18Q1. After, the deaths of their; father and-mother. John-, went to Ireland, sold-whatever estate there was, and returned; to, Philadelphia, in 1802 with his brothers and sisters. Shortly after-wards he came to Crawford county with his-brothers and; sisters,, except David and Wallace, where he purchased a piece of land,; and, leaving the family in charge of McClelland and; Robert, he shortly afterwards returned to Philadelphia, and entered into business as a grocer. In 1807 he was informed by letter from Hugh Davis that the place now in controversy was for sale, and thereupon he wrote to McClelland to go down and look at the place; and, if it pleased him, to buy it, and to tell Davis to write to him at Philadelphia, and he would forward the money to pay. for the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-6\">McClelland Hood went down and looked at the premises, and the. purchase was made from Jonathan Richardson, who, with his wife, on the 6th February, 1808, conveyed them to John M. Hpod. The deed was, recorded on the same day, and the fees paid by Hugh Davis. Shortly after the purchase McClelland Hood moved on to the land, and continued in the occupancy of it till- his death in 1846, with the exception of two years, from 1821 to 1823, and his heirs since his death continued the possession to the, time of trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-7\">The plaintiffs alleged that there was no trust; that the evidence given to establish. it was too vague and indefinite. Also that McClelland\u2019s possession was not adverse and hostile, he , having recognised the right and title of John; but, even if it had. been adverse, that John by his agents had entered upon the land to survey it, and exercised other acts of ownership over it, before the. bar of the, statute was completed, and which would - toll its. operation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-8\">The testimony on these, matters was very voluminous and conflicting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-9\">The Court (Hampton, P. J.) instructed the jury, that there was not sufficient evidence of-either a.trust or gift to submit-to them.. Those parts of the charge which related- to-the alleged holding, under John, and entries, upon the land by the agents of John M. Hood, and which was.the principal matter reviewed in this Court;,, was as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-10\">\u201cDid McClelland Hood, the defendants\u2019 ancestor, enter upon the land in dispute, claiming the same as his own, adversely to all others; and did he hold notorious and hostile possession thereof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>for a period of twenty-one years, using, enjoying, and'occupying the same exclusively as his own; and adversely to the \u2022 holder of the legal title ? Or, if he entered in subserviency\u2019to the'legal title of John M.

Hood,\u201cthe real owner? If McClelland Hood entered-under an-adverse claim, or if he entered in' subserviency to-the title off his\u2019brother, and his possession afterwards- became adverse by open, notorious] and hostile acts, not rebutted or explained by-the recognition-or admission of his brother\u2019s'title, and if - he continued to\u2019hold'.stceh5 possession7 for a period of tWenty-one years, their the plaintiffs\u2019are n'ot entitled\u2019 to recover, unless you are satisfied from' the evidence'that John M.

And this is'a-qu'estioh'of fact for the1 determination\u20191 of the jury under the1 law] as'we'sh\u00e1ll'now lay it d'owfi.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-7\">\u201c In Altemus <em>v. </em>Campbell, 9 ' <em>Waits </em>30, Chief Justice \u25a0 Gibson says: \u2018 The office of an entry-is'not t\u00f3 claim title,'but'to regain a pedal possession; and it has been' said that to\u2019 make it good, the\u2019 former possessor and\u2019his servants must be removed- from the land \u2014an assertion qualified -by Lord Holt in an anonymous case in -l<em>Salk. 246, </em>who says,-that-an\u2019entry-without expulsion-, mdkes such\u2019 a seizure only, that th\u00f3\u2019law\u2019will adjudge him 'in \u2018possession\u2019 whb4 has the right, but that it will not work a disseisin or\u2019abatement?\u2019 And again he says: \u2018 The \u2019effect of an entry; it is agfe\u00e9d, depends on the intent of it, expressed by words, or - intimated by: an act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>equally significant. I would say, in a few words, that there must be an explicit declaration, or an act of notorious dominion, by which the claimant challenges the right of the occupant: or it cannot perhaps be better defined than by saying that the entry must bear on the face of it an unequivocal intent to resume the actual possession.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-6\">\u201c And, in Hoopes <em>et al. v. </em>Garver\u2019s Administrator, 3 <em>Harris </em>525, Mr. Justice Chambers says: \u2018 In the case of Holtzapple <em>v. </em>Phillebaum, 4 <em>W. C. C. R. </em>356, it <em>is </em>ruled that to constitute a legal entry on land to avoid the bar of the statute, the party must enter with intent to claim the possession, and must do some act to prove that such was his intention by acts amounting to a trespass on the land, or he\u2019 must declare that he enters for the purpose of claiming or taking possession. No particular form of words is prescribed by law, the substantial part is the taking or declaring the intention to take or claim possession.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-7\">\u201c The case of Altemus <em>v. </em>Campbell is here referred to with approbation, where the learned judge continues \u2014 \u2018 So, in the case of Miller <em>v. </em>Shaw, 7 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>129, it is said, where a person enters <em>animo elamandi, </em>as when he enters and surveys the land, it operates as a bar to the act: and where the intent with which the entries are made is doubtful, the question of intention was to be submitted to the jury.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-8\">\u201c In the case of Ingersoll <em>v. </em>Lewis, 1 <em>Jones </em>212, it is ruled that when the agent of the owner enters upon land with the avowed object of claiming it, making a survey thereof with the knowledge and assent of the person in possession, these acts operate to bar the running of the <em>statute; </em>and if <em>the proof of these is </em>satisfactory to the jury, the Court should give a binding direction to that effect. ^ '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-9\"><em>\u201c </em>Keeping these principles of law steadily in view as your guide on this part of the case, you will inquire whether at any time, during the running of the statute, John M. Hood himself, or by his agents, made such an entry upon the land, as would suspend its operation ? If he did, then the adverse possession of McClelland Hood would date only from the time of such entry, and would require the full period of twenty-one years from that time to complete his title. But, as we have before instructed you, if his title was completed under the statute, before the entry, or recognition of title, it could not be affected thereby.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-10\">\u201c If then you are satisfied from the evidence, that Hugh Davis, acting as the agent of John M. Hood, in 1828 \u2014 or at any other time, entered upon the land in dispute, with the avowed object of claiming it for his principal, and procured a survey to be made thereof, with the knowledge and assent of McClelland Hood; this was such an entry as would in law stop the running of the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-11\"><em>\u201c If yon </em>believe from the evidence that John M. Hood or his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>agent in 1830, entered upon the land in controversy, with the avowed object of claiming it for the said John, and surveyed, or marked off on the ground, eight acres, or any other quantity, for the exclusive use and possession of David Hood, with the knowledge and assent of McClelland Hood, and that the same was surveyed to David by John; this was such an entry as would, in law, bar the running of the statute of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-6\">\u201c If the evidence satisfies your minds that, in 1835, Hugh Davis, Nathaniel Patterson, or any other person, acting as the agent of John M. Hood, entered upon this land, with the avowed intention or object of claiming it for his principal, John M. Hood, and made, or procured to be made, a survey thereof with the knowledge and assent of McClelland Hood, this was such an entry as would in law suspend the running of the statute. So, also, of the survey made by Colonel Gibson, at the instance of George R. Riddle, in 1850.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-7\"><em>\u201c </em>The whole case, then, is narrowed down to this single proposition, viz.: Whether McClelland Hood himself, or himself and his heirs together, held such adverse possession of this land, as the law requires to give title, for any period of twenty-one years together, before the institution of this suit, without recognising the title of John M. Hood, or without any entry by him or his agents. If you find such to be the fact, then the defendants will be entitled to your verdict; but if not, then the plaintiffs are entitled to recover. You will take into consideration all the evidence submitted to you by the Court, and give to each portion thereof such weight as the importance of the interests involved demand; and after applying the law, as laid down by the Court, to the facts as you find them to be, render such a verdict as is warranted by the evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-8\">The jury found for the defendants. The plaintiffs below sued out this writ, and assigned the foregoing instructions, and the manner of submitting the facts, for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b421-9\"><em>G.

The evidence upon the subject is clear, and there was no change in the nature of the tenure.

Nor is there :any complaint that-the Court withdrew the facts from the jury, but the errors assigned were all founded on the manner of their <em>submission. It is </em>especially objected that\u2019in answering vital points submitted on the part of the plaintiffs, the Court recited to the jury lengthy extracts of apparently conflicting opinions and dicta of the Supreme Court, leaving it to the jury to extract the rule of law from the authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">The record shows that there is some ground for this complaint. The numerous quotations from judicial opinions, predicated of a state of facts peculiar to each case, were not the most satisfactory and skilful mode of answering the points. A brief and comprer hensive statement of the <em>result </em>of the authorities is always better for a jury than the -authorities themselves. Judicial opinions are written to guide judges, no.t juries, apd the judge who presides a.t th,e trial is .expected to deduce the rules of law applicable t.o the case from all that has been recorded for his instruction, and to deliver them to the jury relieved, as much as possible, from the verbiage in which they are found clothed. The law is often like particles of shining ore niixed in a mass of epude rubbish, from which the intellect of the judge, operating like a magnet, should extract it for the service of the jury. But when, instead of doing this, he hands over the mass itself to the jury, how are we to say they did not find the ore ? Told that it was there, .and taught how to use it, it was quite possible for them to .extract it for themselves, and wp are bound to presume that they performed the possible duty which was laid upon them. There is no standard but the discretion of the judge himself to determine how much help he shall render a jury in weighing facts, and applying the law to them. Perhaps the least amount of aid is rendered where the law is delivered in the form of copious extracts from judicial opinions in other cases, but nevertheless we cannot say the Court erred in matter of law, when they answered legal propositions in the very terms in which similar propositions had been answered in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Court. Take, for example, the answer most complained of in this record \u2014 that which the Court -gave to the points relative to the entry of John M. Hood, or his agent, to toll the statute \u2014 it \u2022cannot when taken altogether (the only .fair way.of .estimating any charge) be- said to be erroneous in point of law. After quoting Judge Gibson\u2019s clear exposition of the laWJ\u00f3f entry in Altemus <em>v. </em>Campbell, 9' <em>Watts </em>30, and the language of- this Court in Ing\u00e9rsoll\u00bb. Lewis, 1 <em>Jones </em>212, the learned judge put it to the jury to say whether the agent cf John M. Hood-entered upon the land with the <em>\u201c </em>avowed\u201d object of claiming it for his -principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Now counsel suppose the jury were misled by this word avowed \u2014that they understood an entry to survey off 8 acres for David \u25a0Hood was not sufficient to stop the running of the statute^ unless accompanied with some verbal declaration that such was the effect i\u00f1tended. But they had just been instructed, in the language of Judge Gibson, that the effect of an entry depends on the intent of it expressed in words, or <em>intimated by an act equally significant </em>\u2014that there must he an explicit declaration, or <em>ap act </em>of notorious dominion; and can it be doubted they would .understand from <em>all this that </em>the intention could be <em>avowed </em>as well by d\u00e9\u00e9ds as by Words ? An entry to toll the statute must not be accidental \u2014 nor by invitation of him in possession, nor for any equivocal purpos\u00e9 whatever, but to regain a pedal possession of the land for purposes inconsistent with the title of the occupier. Ah entry to measure off 8 acres for another would be such a purpose, and how could it be more distinctly avowed than by the act itself? A jury of common intelligence could not fail, we think, to get the very law of entry from all that the Court placed before them. We are not then to reverse the judgment on a mere suggestion that they may have misunderstood the word avowed- If they were satisfied that it was the btother in possession who was parting with the 8 acre's t'o. David, of that the survey was intended as an adjustment \u2018of boundaries betw\u00e9eh McClelland and \u00e1 neighbour, 'they had good ground f\u00f3r hot giving effect to the entry. On this point, as on \u2018every other in the cause, the jury were the disposing power, and We cannot perceive any satisfactory evidence' in 'the record that they w'ere misguided by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">W'e hav\u00e9 looked through all the matters assigned for error, and discovering no adequate grounds for reversing the judgment, it is affirmed. \u00ab</p>\n<judges id=\"b423-6\">Lewis, C.
