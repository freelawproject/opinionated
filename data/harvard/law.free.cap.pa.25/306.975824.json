Maloney, Sr., the land was divided, and the several parts of these parties designated by marked boundaries. Michael C. Maloney entered into and took possession of his part; and he and Jeremiah farmed their parts (being contiguous) together. He also paid annually the stipulated sum of $12.50 to M. Maloney the elder. Michael C. Maloney died in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>the year 1852, unmarried and without issue, but leaving a mother and sister surviving him, who are the plaintiffs in this action, and on whose hehalf, in the years 1853 and 1854, the yearly payments due from Michael 0. under the agreement were tendered, but refused on the part of M. Maloney the elder, he refusing to carry out the arrangement with Michael C. This action was then brought to recover the possession of the 60 acres allotted to Michael C. Maloney under the arrangement stated. M- Maloney, Sr., and his wife were still living at the time of trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-6\">Michael C. Maloney was a grandson of Michael Maloney, Sr., had lived with him until he was 22 years of age, and had then left; and, upon being sent for by the .elder, refused to return until the foregoing arrangement in reference to. the land was agreed to by his grandfather.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-7\">The Court (Agnew, P. J.) charged the jury as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-8\">\u201c The will of Michael Maloney and written agreement of Michael C. Maloney, bearing even date May 28., 1849, constitute together such a contract in writing, not within the statute of frauds, as can be enforced in equity, if the conditions, be complied with.: Brinker <em>v. </em>Brinker, 7 <em>Barr </em>53. But the construction of .the contract is, that it is an agreement to convey by devise at the death of the devisor, on condition of the payment of the annual \u00a1sum of $12.50 during his and his wife\u2019s lifetime. Now the nature of the instrument, by which the estate is to be conveyed (to wit a will), necessarily imports an agreement ,to vest the title at the death of the testator, and not before; .and consequently specific execution cannot be decreed until that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-9\">\u201c In point of fact, so far as the instrument by which the conveyance is to take place is involved, it is an executed contract, on condition to take effect at the time specified. A devise transfers the legal estate, and not an equity fo b.e perfected -by another instrument. It is the same as if a deed had b.een executed to take effect <em>in futuro, </em>only that the common law incident of a feoffment forbids the freehold remaining in abeyance, -and a resort must therefore be had to a devise or.a conveyance under the statute of uses. The scrivener no doubt knew but little of these things, and therefore adopted the form of a will, .which would convey the esfate by its own operation at the proper moment, and at -the .same time leave \u25a0the testator free to change it, in case of forfeiture by non-payment of the annual reservation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-10\">\"There is nothing upon -the face of the will and agreement, or in their effect, which.carried to Michael C. Maloney either the title or possession during the lifetime of old Michael Maloney, nor, as a <em>part </em>of the <em>original .contract, </em>can we allow of \u00a1the existence of an agreement, for possession, in old Mr. Maloney\u2019s lifetime, as <em>omitted </em>out of the will and accompanying writing, without evidence either of fraud or mistake. There is not a particle of evidence that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the drawing of the writings, such a portion of the agreement was either fraudulently or mistakingly omitted. The scrivener was not examined for this purpose, though present at the bar. The evidence, as to even the existence of any such agreement, is anything but clear and satisfactory; a matter necessary in proving fraud or mistake to reform a writing. Jeremiah Maloney, the only witness present at the consummation of the contract between old Mr. Maloney and Michael C. Maloney, says not a word about such an agreement on part of the old man; and James Forquer, who gives the most clear and direct evidence of a rehearsal of the bargain by the old man, says expressly, \u2018 he said he had given each 60 acres; each to pay $ 12.50 a year during his and his wife\u2019s lifetime, and <em>at their death </em>the land was to be theirs.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-6\">\u201c There is no principle better settled than that all the previous agreements and negotiations are merged in the conveyance or final instrument by which the contract is to be executed. The will, we have seen, was the instrument adopted by the parties to cany their agreement into final execution. This case comes, therefore, directly within the decision in the case of Blakeslee <em>v. </em>Blakeslee, 10 <em>Harris </em>237.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-7\">\u201c The question is then narrowed to this, whether there is sufficient evidence of an independent parol contract for the possession of the land during the lifetime of old Michael Maloney, or-in other words, was there a parol sale or gift of it during his lifetime \u2014 an estate <em>per auter vie, </em>which is a freehold ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-8\">\u201c Michael C. Maloney was the grandson, raised in the family of his grandfather from infancy, and supported by him. The same rules of evidence and principles of construction which apply between father and son govern this case. The evidence of the sale or gift in consideration of service must be direct, positive, clear, and satisfactory: Bash <em>v. </em>Bash, 9 <em>Barr </em>260; Candor\u2019s Appeal, 5 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>515; Sanders <em>v. </em>Waggenseller, 7 <em>Harris </em>248; Lantz <em>v. </em>Fry, <em>Id. </em>366.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-9\"><em>\u201c </em>There is no <em>direct </em>evidence of a contract between the parties, except the testimony of Jeremiah Maloney. He is the only witness who was <em>present </em>at any interview between Michael and Michael C. Maloney. The testimony of James Forquer and the other witnesses, of <em>ex parte </em>declarations, as the law now stands, can be used only as corroborative evidence: opinion of Knox, J., in an unreported case; also, Rankin <em>v. </em>Simpson, 7 <em>Harris </em>475. So far from the testimony of Jeremiah Maloney, corroborated and supported as it may be by that of James Forquer and others, being positive, clear, and satisfactory evidence of an independent and separate parol sale or gift of an estate to Michael C. Maloney during his grandfather\u2019s lifetime, it seems clearly to have relation to the arrangement as contained in the will and agreement of 28th May, 1849.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\u201c What was the consideration of such independent sale or gift ? The annual payment of the $12.50 was indubitably the consideration of the written contract evidenced by the will and accompanying agreement. The inducement to the written contract was also the past labour and services of the grandson, his relationship, and the benefits of their arrangement, which secured to the testator himself a living, as testified by James Forquer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Was there a contract for present possession in consideration of prospective services, or of partly these and partly past services ? Surely there is nothing like a clear and distinct statement of such an agreement by the old man to be found in Jeremiah Maloney\u2019s testimony. If it be not there, it is in vain to look for it elsewhere, and find it at the same time directly and positively proved. Perhaps we might conjecture, from the loose general expressions- of old Michael Maloney to others, that something of this kind may have taken- place outside of the written contract. But this would be to reverse the rule of evidence, and give to these <em>ex parte </em>declarations a higher place than to the direct evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-7\">\u201c Performing, therefore, the duty assigned to us as chancellors, we are bound to declare that the evidence is insufficient to establish a parol gift or sale of the premises to Michael C. Maloney, during his grandfather\u2019s lifetime, such as can be enforced in equity, and consequently that the plaintiffs cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-8\">\u201c To which opinion and instructions of the Court the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel excepted before verdict, and requested the Court to seal this bill of exceptions, which is done accordingly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-9\">Errors assigned: 1. The Court erred in refusing to carry into effect the written agreement of the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-10\">2. The Court erred in charging that there was no evidence of plaintiffs\u2019 right to possession under the written agreement, and in giving to said agreement the construction which they did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-11\">3. The Court erred in saying the evidence was \u201c insufficient to establish a parol gift or sale of the premises to Michael.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b309-12\"><em>Purvianee, Thompson, </em>and <em>Sullivan, </em>for plaintiff in error.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abl\">Michael had faithfully served his grandfather until he was 22 years of age, and left, and refused to return unless he got the land.' Would he have paid an annual sum if he were not to have possession during the life of th\u00e9 grantor? He took possession with the acquiescence of the old man. This is sufficient to repel such a construction, and our position is fortified by the repeated declarations of defendant that the land belonged to Michael.
