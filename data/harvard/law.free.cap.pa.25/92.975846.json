When the appraisers came to this note,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-6\">\u201cBorrowed and received of John Bell $661, payable sixty days after date with interest from date. April 1, 1845. John Bell, junior,\u201d he-called out the date and amount, as he had done with the other notes, and the appraisers, in his presence, and by his direction, inserted as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-7\">, \u201c John Bell\u2019s note, $661.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-8\">\u201c Interest, April 5, 1845, 342.06</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ab3\">$1003.06.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-10\">When the executor settled his account, he refused to charge himself with this note, alleging that it was barred by the Statute of Limitations \u2014 and whether or not he' is bound to account for it is the question before this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b93-11\"><em>Purman, Lindsey, </em>and <em>Buchanan, </em>for appellants. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlY\">The executor, by accepting the trust without protest, precludes himself from the protection of the statute. 2d. His act in filing the inventory (as stated above) is a direct acknowledgment of the debt, which takes it out of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-12\">The statute takes away the remedy only, it does not extinguish the debt: <em>Chit, on Contracts, </em>6th Am. ed., 806, 2 <em>Bouv. Inst. </em>\u00a7 2002, 488.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-14\">If the note had not been barred by th\u00e9 statute at the time he accepted the trust, yet, by his acceptance, the remedy would have been suspended, and the debt discharged by operation of law: Eichelberger <em>v. </em>Morris, 6 <em>Watts </em>42 ;%Wankford <em>v. </em>Wankford, 1 <em>Salk. </em>306; Thompson <em>v. </em>Thompson, 2 <em>Johns. </em>473. If the statute takes away the remedy only; and if the appointment of a debtor to be his creditor\u2019s executor merely suspends the remedy, when the debt is not barred by the statute; and if equity allows the estate to. help itself when the remedy is suspended, and treats the debt as paid and the amount as assets; for what reason should equity refuse to allow the estate to help itself, even .if the debt were' barred by the statute, when the claim comes to the hands of the executor ? In support of these principles the counsel cited Dalton \u2022\u2022y. Pool, 1 <em>Ventris\u2019 It. </em>318; Brooks <em>v. </em>Smith, 2 <em>Young </em>&lt;f <em>Colyer </em>58, where it is said, \u201c The statute does not absolutely bind courts of equity;\u201d and the Orphans\u2019 Court is absolutely a court of equity: Lewis <em>v. </em>Pratt, 2 <em>Whart. </em>81; Irwin <em>v. </em>Dunwoody, 17 <em>Ser. </em>\u00bff <em>It. </em>61, 2 <em>Ball. </em>190; Glover <em>v. </em>Wilson, 6 <em>Barr </em>290; Harrisburg Bank <em>v. </em>Foster, 8 <em>Watts </em>12. Equity will hot allow the bar of the statute to prevail in aid of manifest injustice: Deloraine <em>v. </em>Browne, 3 <em>Brown\u2019s Ch. Bep. </em>633, 646 ; Raw <em>v. </em>Potts, <em>Precedents in Chancery </em>35, 2 <em>Vernon\u2019s Bep. </em>239. So when a party accepts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>a place inconsistent with his denial of his liability, he is estopped: The East India Company <em>v. </em>Campion, 11 <em>Bligh R. </em>158,186,187; 3 <em>Bligh R. </em>1; 3 <em>Mass. </em>'201. The statute cannot be pleaded on a trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-6\">The filing .the note -as stated was equivalent to a renewal of it between the parties.-</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-7\"><em>Black </em>and <em>Phelan, donney </em>and <em>Sayers, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXW\">The statute does not merely take away the remedy. The debt itself is virtually blotted out by the legal bar. A promise does not revive the old debt, but is evidence of a new obligation, resting in a moral duty to pay. At law the appointment of a debtor executor was a discharge of the debt: 11 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>146. But our -Act of 24th February,. 1834, keeps alive a valid claim, and directs each debt to be. included in the inventory. Nor does the appointment and acceptance of the office by the debtor suspend the remedy: the 22d section provides that no executor shall be compelled to <em>pay </em>for one year. But in\u2022 this' there is no suspension; the creditor may have his action though he may not compel payment for a year.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-8\">The statute would .have been an insuperable bar if John Bell, senior, had been living; .the debt was eight years old when the appellee became executor. His devisee cannot do that which he would have been harmless to do himself; and if the appellee had declined the executorship, the acting executors - could not have collected it. By what reason can he be then held -liable by the mere force of his position, unless it can be shown that his acceptance deprived the devisee of some right ? 1</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-9\">Where a party has his remedy at law and lies by, and then resorts to equity, he is bound wherever he -would be at law: Kane <em>v. </em>Bloodgood, 7 <em>Chan. Rep. </em>90; and see 20 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>585; <em>Story\u2019s Eq. </em>J 1520; Smith <em>v. </em>Clay, 3 <em>Bro. Ch. R. </em>640. Cited 2 <em>Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. </em>\u00a7 1521 and note. See specially the case of App Executor of App <em>v. </em>Driesbach, 2 <em>Raw. </em>287. An executor cannot be considered a trustee unprotected-by the Statute of Limitations for money which he denied to be due.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-10\">So a creditor, who has been -appointed-executor, cannot take credit for a. claim .'barred- by the statute. -A testamentary trust \u25a0for payment -.of .debts does not-revive- debts -barred1 by the statute; \u2022but, when-clear and .not merely implied, suspends the statute on .debts due&gt;at-testator\u2019s death: Agnew\u2019s Administratrix v. Fetterman\u2019s Executors, <em>4 </em>Barr 56; Burke <em>v</em>. Jones, 2 <em>V. &amp; Beames </em>275. The-whole .position of .the appellants -is b\u00e1s\u00e9d upon an implied'- trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-11\">.In placing his note \"in the inventory, the appellee-acted in conformity to the -requirements of the Act of 1834. \u2022 See sections 2, 5, and 6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-12\">See Christy <em>v. </em>Flemington, 10 <em>Barr </em>129. An acknowledgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>to take a case out of the statute must be clear, 'plain, unambiguous, and express: 9 Watts 380 ; 6 <em>Id. </em>172; 10 <em>Id. </em>19; 9 <em>Barr </em>258; 6 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>213; 2 Jones 264; 10 <em>Watts </em>152.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"pASq\">The opinion of the Court wais delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b95-6\">Lewis, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWE\">It is the duty of an executor to produce to the appraisers \u201c all evidence of debt\u201d, and \u201c all claims for money,\u201d in order that they may be included in the inventory. The object of the inventory is merely to enable the;parties interested in the estate to call the executor to account. ' It precludes no one from making defence against the claims included in it. The executor Las an equal right with others to.'protect his own interests; and the insertion of a note against himself in the inventory, with his assent, does not preclude him from making defence-against it. It is not such an acknowledgment of the debt as takes it out of the Statute of Limitations. Independent of the special circumstance, showing that the justice of the demand was not acknowledged by the executor, the case was properly decided 'in his favour.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai9\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
