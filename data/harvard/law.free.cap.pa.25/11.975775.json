But the words, \u201c <em>a true verdict give according to the evidence,\u201d </em>are entirely omitted, and this takes the very life and soul out of the oath: 2 <em>Green\u2019s Iowa Rep. </em>285, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Harmon <em>v. </em>State.

The Act 1 July, 1829, requires that \u201c Every person convicted shall be sentenced to undergo imprisonment, and be kept in separate or solitary confinement at labour.\u201d. Neither the judgment rendered, nor the record, shows such sentence as the law requires.

It is to the judgment the writ of error issues, and this is to be tested by the record. The sentence cannot be right if the record is wrong, though the judgment may be wrong even if the prior record is right; and neither here nor in England can you restore a defective oath, indictment, or verdict, by modifying the sentence based upon them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-12\">This case in England would be reversed on the second exception, on the ground that no sentence could be pronounced; and there is no case to be found in which the Court below had no legal right to pronounce <em>any </em>sentence in which the record has been remitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>or the sentence modified. The counsel1 compared the English statute of 11 &amp; 12 Vict. c: 78; sect. 5, with our statute of 16 June, 1886; but denied that, under .the latter, this Court could disregard the defects excepted to, or that they eould affirm, modify, or remit the record ; and examined the cases Daniel <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 7 <em>Barr </em>317; Clellans <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 8 <em>Barr </em>223; Dunn <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 6 <em>Barr </em>384; Drew <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 1 <em>Wh. </em>279. In England, where the defendant can enter bail upon appeal after conviction, the available sentence is pronounced in the superior Court, and no punishment is suffered in the mean time; but here there is no bail after conviction, and the sentence goes forthwith into effect. The modification of a sentence in England may work no harm to the defendant; here it would divide the sentence into two branches; under the <em>first </em>he is imprisoned, say half the time, at hard labour; under the second, the <em>other half, </em>to solitary confinement. Will this Court sustain such an anomaly ?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b14-6\"><em>W. B. Reed, </em>District Attorney, and <em>W. B. Mann, </em>for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0g\">The form of the record in this case was specially directed by Judge King, holding an Oyer and Terminer in 1848, and since that time has been the invariable form in the county of Philadelphia. There, are no less than fifteen convicts of homicide alone, not to speak of other crimes, now in the penitentiary, the records of whose convictions are precisely as this is. The entry in this case is that the jurors \u201c were <em>duly </em>impannelled, <em>sworn, </em>or <em>affirmed, </em>to try the guilt or innocence of the defendant, of <em>the charge whereof he stands indicted. </em>\u201d The record is never meant to show the precise form in words of the oath administered, and does not comprise a direct reference to the evidence, that being implied; and there is no substantial variance between the record and the oath administered. The mere omission of the words \u201c according to the evidence,\u201d would not be error. It is sanctioned by the general practice of the state (and the counsel named some thirty counties in which this was the practice), and the only precedent in which the words are inserted in Pennsylvania, is to be found in the case of Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Harris Bell, in Wayne county, tried for murder in 1847; and cited several cases exhibiting peculiarities in the record as to the mode of swearing, but all omitting the words \u201c according to the evidence.\u201d In neither of these cases had there been any revision of the records, and this was attempted in but one of them. If a witness is said to be <em>sworn, </em>he is presumed to be sworn according to law: 10 <em>Harris </em>353; and see Jewell\u2019s Case, 10 <em>Harris </em>98, and 6 <em>Bin. </em>804. In Hamilton <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 4 <em>Harris </em>129, the record of the oath was in the words, \u201cwho upon their oaths and affirmations respectively do say,\u201d without other words; yet no allusion was made in the errors assigned as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>swearing of tbe jury, and tbe judgment was reversed on entirely different grounds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-6\">There is no form of oath for jurors in criminal cases prescribed by statute in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-7\">In Haneman <em>v. </em>The State, 2 <em>Green\u2019s Iowa Rep. </em>285, where a common law form was used, it was held erroneous, because the <em>statute </em>prescribed a different form.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-8\">The recitaste of the record never correspond to the forms in the books.

It is enough that the record be certain to a certain intent <em>in general. </em>It is not necessary that it be certain to a certain intent in <em>particular. </em>A substantial error must be shown, to reverse a judgment in a criminal case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-10\">But a trial on the merits, on a plea voluntarily pleaded, and his taking the chance of a verdict in his favour, conclude the prisoner: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Immell, 6 <em>Bin. </em>404; <em>Greene </em>285; 9 <em>Mass. </em>107. In our Courts but one rule has prevailed, the <em>spii'it </em>of the Act of 1814, and the decision in the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Immell, being carried out, though in terms the Act applies only to \u201c drawing, summoning, or returning any juror or panel of jurors Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Richard Smith, in 1816, 2 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>301.

If it did appear, one error cannot be justified by showing fifteen others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-7\">The record shows a different issue and a different o\u00e1ffih from those known to the law; and if not required to show the precise form of the oath, it must <em>not </em>show, that in form and in substance too, it was wrong; and the record of a case essentially wrong cannot be cured by implication or intendment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-8\">There is in this case an exclusion of the evidence and a creation of an issue never joined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-9\">If it <em>did </em>appear that the words, \u201c according to the evidence,\u201d had been omitted in several eases, it-would not affect the question. The question may not have been made; and they <em>are </em>found in the record of the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Harris Bell, tried in 1847.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-10\">No record which.,presents the issue of \u201cguilty or innocent,\u201d can be found anywhere, and therein is a substantial difference from the issue required by law. It matters not whether the oath be prescribed by common law or by statute. If by statute, its directions must be pursued; if no statute, the common law must be our guide: 2 <em>Green\u2019s Iowa Rep. </em>285.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-11\">But it is said that \u201cif the jury were sworn in the words of the record, a trial on the merits, voluntary plea, and taking the chance of a verdict, conclude the prisoner.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-12\">If this w'ere the law it would give validity to a worthless indictment, to lynch law, to anything most foreign and adverse to the principles of humanity and justice; and a defendant, put upon his trial \u2014 it matters not how \u2014 never can revise or reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-13\">Defective indictments are not cured by verdict: 4 <em>Blade. Com. </em>375. The Act of 1814 does not make a trial on the merits a waiver of all errors like this; it actually.excludes this conclusion, and by pointing out what shall be considered waived, implies more clearly what shall not be waived.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-14\">The Act directs that \u201c the trial shall be a waiver of all errors and defects appertaining to the said precept, <em>venire, </em>drawing, summoning, and returning of jurors.\u201d No exception is taken to any matter cured by the Act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-15\">The cases cited by the District Attorney are decisions upon questions, the waiver of which are authorized by the statute, and have no application to those here excepted to.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b16-16\">The following opinions were delivered.</p>\n<author id=\"b16-17\">Woodward, J. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AFU\">This writ of error was allowed for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>of raising but two questions, the first of which is, Does it sufficiently appear from the record that the jury were duly sworn or affirmed ?</p>\n<p id=\"b17-6\">We have no statute that prescribes the form of the juror\u2019s oath in criminal cases; but in capital cases, and in cases that ever were capital in Pennsylvania, we have retained the common law form of oath, which is as follows: \u201c <em>You do swear that you will well and truly try, and true deliverance mahe between the Commonwealth and the prisoner at the bar whom you shall have in charge, and a true verdict give according to the evidence: so help you Grod.\u201d </em>Thisjs the oath that ought to have been administered here, for the offence charged was rape, and anciently it was punishable with death, both in England and Pennsylvania. Were we free to resort to presumptions and to evidence <em>dehors </em>the record, it is most likely the fact could be established beyond controversy that the jury were sworn in the very words of the above oath; but sitting as a Court of review we can know nothing of the facts that transpired at the trial except what we learn from the record, and therefore the question now to be decided is not the general one, whether that oath was in point of fact administered, but the more special one whether the record proves that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-7\">The record informs us that on the 24th of October, 1854, the defendant being present in Court and having been arraigned and pleaded not guilty, a jury was called, examined by the Court and chosen by the defendant, and (after naming them) are duly impannelled, sworn, or affirmed, respectively to try the guilt or innocence of the defendant of the charge whereof he stands indicted, and are placed in charge of the Court\u2019s officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b17-8\">This is a succinct narrative of what was done, without professing to detail the formularies. We are not told how the defendant was arraigned, how the jury were examined, nor how they were sworn. The general purpose or object of calling and swearing them is described \u2014 to try the guilt or innocence of the defendant \u2014and truly described; for the very question submitted to the jury was, Is the defendant guilty or not guilty of the charge whereof he stands indicted ? but the oath is not set out, either in form or substance. Nor is it usual to set forth the oath of the jurors in criminal records. The precedents, both English and American, have been examined in vain for an instance. I suppose the form of record which is found in the Appendix to the 4th volume of BlaGkstone is as high evidence of the law of records in criminal cases as any precedent that can be found; and that does not set forth the oath administered to the jurors, but says, in the same historical manner of this record, that they were <em>\u201c sworn to speale the truth of and concerning the premises.\u201d </em>So in the cases cited by counsel from thirty-six different counties in our own state, the records do not, in a single instance, set forth the oath as administered, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>they exhibit considerable diversity in the mode of announcing the fact that an oath was administered. In most of them the entry is simply, Sworn or affirmed; in one the English form is followed\u2014 \u201csworn to.speak the truth of and concerning the premises;\u201d in another, \u201csworn to try the issue aforesaid;\u201d in another, \u201cwell and truly to try, and true deliverance make between the Commonwealth and the prisoner at the bar;\u201d but none of them detail the oath, nor- even allege that the jury were <em>duly </em>sworn. These diversities relate not to the body of- the oath \u2014 that has been uniformly the same \u2014 but to -the mode of docketing the fact that an oath wag administered. And such a number of cases occurring in every .part of the state, and under the eyes of a great variety of learned judges and counsel, are high evidence of the law. The uniformity with which -the records show that the jury were sworn proves that w\u201ee are to look to them for that fact, whilst the diversity of phrase in which they announce the fact, proves that we ar.e not to \u00ablook to them for the form of the oath.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">How then are we to get at the form of the oath as actually administered ? By taking the form prescribed by the common law, and applying the maxims that belong to judicial records \u2014 that all things are presumed to be rightly done where the contrary doth not appear \u2014 and that judicial records are to be received for verity.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-7\">Because the law enjoined an oath in the form I have stated, and because the record says the jury were sworn, we are bound to presume they were sworn in that form. True, this presumption might be rebutted by something contained in the <em>record; </em>but in the case before us it is not, because the words, found there do not profess to describe the oath, but the fact and purpose of the swearing. And this presumption, negatived by nothing on the record, is aided, strengthened, and confirmed by the word \u201c duly.\u201d That adverb qualifies the act of administering the oath to the jury\u2014 they were <em>duly </em>sworn. When a party is duly sworn he is sworn according to law: Edge <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 7 <em>Barr </em>277; Clarke <em>v. </em>Benford, 10 <em>Harris </em>855. If this record imports absolute verity, it tells , us that the jury were .sworn in the forms of th,e. law, because <em>duly </em>sworn, and against that no allegation whatever can be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-8\">Thus we ar.e brought by an inspection of the record and the application of the appropriate legal maxims, to the conclusion, that the oath actually administered was the very oath the law furnished for the occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-9\">We are not-to expect too much from records of judicial proceedings. They are memorials of the judgments and decrees of the judges, and contain a general but not a particular detail of all that occurs before them. If we should insist upon -finding every fact fully recorded which must occur before, a citizen can b.e <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>punished for an offence against the laws, we should destroy public justice, and give unbridled license to crime. Much must be left to intendment a.nd presumption, for it is often less difficult to do things correctly than to describe them correctly. This record is unusually full, \u2014 its fullness indeed is the source of the objections urged against it, \u2014 and y.et it does not tell us how the defendant was tried, whether .in the course of common law trials by jury, or in some of the various , other modes that have been known in the world. Is the judgment to b.e reversed for that reason ? By no means. We intend .that the trial was by jury and by witnesses confronting the accused, because the record certifies us of a trial; and we know that a jury and witnesses are indispensable to a constitutional and legal trial. In the same manner we infer the presence of the jury throughput the trial, though the record takes no notice of them from the 24th to. the 27th of .October; and that the testimony was delivered <em>ore.tenus, </em>though the names of the witnesses in the margin is all that is said about witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-5\">These legal intendments are made in favour of Courts of particular and inferior jurisdiction. When such a Court assumes to proceed it must set forth such facts as show that it has jurisdiction, but it need no.t set forth all the -facts out of which its jurisdiction arises. If it appear anywhere upon the face of the proceedings that the inferior Court has jurisdiction, it will be intended that the proceedings are regular.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">But here we have to deal, with the .record no.t of a Court of inferior and limited jurisdiction, but of o.ne of the. constitutional tribunals of the Commonwealth \u2014 a Court of large common law powers, and of general criminal jurisdiction; and surely the presumptions in favour of such a record are not to be less conclusive than those which apply to the records of inferior Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-7\">These views result necessarily in overruling the error assigned in regard to the oath of the j,urors.; and it is well for public justic.e that they do, for if we should reverse this judgment on the ground assumed, we should.throw open prison doors to a large number of culprits no.w suffering the just penalties of the law under records equally defective. It. is stated by the district attorney, and the fact is unquestioned, that there are now in the penitentiary, serving out their sentences, no. less than fifteen convicts of homicide along, not to speak of other, aggravated crimes, the records of which are precisely like this. A review of all the prisons of the state would doubtless exhibit a vast amount of penal justice that would be arrested and cancelled at pnce if this judgment should be reversed. We.are called pn virtually to make a general jail delivery \u2014 to decide, that, .the criminal .records of. the state from the beginning have been defective, an.d that. the,, many felons who haye paid the forfeit of their prinjes on .the gallows have been put to death contrary to.law. Sejipus .as these consequences are, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>are not, I agree, sufficient ground for withholding from this defendant our judgment of reversal if he were entitled to it under the law of the land. Justice, according to law, is to be done, though the heavens fall. But these numerous convictions on similar records are expressive indications of the measure of exactness required in criminal records; precedents which we are not only justified in following, but which we have no right to disregard to the detriment of the community. A prudent judge will always look to consequences before he subverts a long-established practice, or gives his sanction to a new rule of criminal law. In my opinion there is no occasion for innovation here. It would be neither wise, nor just, nor safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">The only remaining error has reference to the sentence. The 11th section of the Act of 8th April, 1842, relating to the Philadelphia county prison, upon which the sentence was founded, provides for \u201cimprisonment by separate or solitary confinement at labour,\u201d but the defendant was simply sentenced to undergo \u201chard labour in the Philadelphia county prison\u201d for four years and a half. This is a departure from the statutory rule, not so much in the use of the word <em>hard, </em>for that perhaps is implied hy the statute, as in omitting the qualification of separate or solitary confinement, which was a new system in Pennsylvania, and which must be strictly followed where it is plainly enjoined. It has its advantages to the prisoner himself, and where he claims them he is entitled to them. The sentence, therefore, must be reversed. It cannot be amended. It might have been during the term, but not afterward.</p>\n<author id=\"b20-7\">Lewis, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6s\">In a criminal case we have no power to review the decisions of the Court below, in admitting or rejecting evidence, or in charging the jury. Nor can we reverse for errors of the jury, however gross. If the forms of the law have been observed, and the proceedings, as stated on the record, are legal, we have no more power to relieve the defendant from an unjust verdict against or without evidence, than \u201c any other five citizens of the state:\u201d Jewell <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 10 <em>Harris </em>99. We may, in such cases, feel it our duty, <em>as citizens, </em>to perform the common obligations of humanity, by presenting our views to that department of the government which alone can grant relief. But, <em>as judges of the. Court of review, </em>we must confine ourselves to the record; and, as already intimated, neither the evidence nor the instructions submitted to the jury form any part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-8\">Among the errors assigned, there are but two which deserve consideration. One has relation to the oath administered to the jury; the other to the sentence pronounced by the Court. The first is of some importance to the prisoner, because, if sustained, he will be entitled to a new trial. The law requires that the jurors, in a criminal c\u00e1se, shall be sworn or affirmed that they will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>\u201c well and truly try, and true deliverance make between the Com-' monwealth and the prisoner at the bar, whom they shall have in their charge, and a true verdict give according to the evidence:\u201d 1 <em>Chit. Crim. Law </em>552. But the law does not require that this oath shall be set forth on the record. On the contrary, when a record is made up in the ancient and approved form, it is sufficient, if it state that the jury were sworn to \u201c speak the truth of and concerning the premises:\u201d 4 <em>Blackstone\u2019s Com. App. </em>332; or \u201c of and upon the premises:\u201d <em>Crown Circuit Companion </em>87, 91, 92. In the case before us, the record states that the jury were \u201c <em>duly </em>impannelled, sworn or affirmed respectively, to try the guilt or innocence of the defendant of the charge whereof he stands indicted.\u201d Is there any substantial difference between this entry and that which has been sanctioned by authority and immemorial usage? When the record informs us that the jury have been sworn to \u201c speak the truth of and concerning the premises,\u201d we are bound to understand that the oath prescribed by law has been properly administered to them. Why are we not bound to understand the same thing from the entry made in this case ? We are informed by the record that the jury were <em>\u201cduly\u201d </em>sworn to try the guilt or innocence of the defendant.\u201d How could they be <em>\u201cduly\u201d </em>sworn in any other way than in the form prescribed by law ? The word \u201c duly\u201d means \u201c properly,\u201d \u201c fitly,\u201d \u201c regularly,\u201d \u201cin a suitable or becoming manner.\u201d But to administer an oath to a jury, which was contrary to that prescribed by law, could not have been <em>proper, fit, regular, </em>or <em>becoming. </em>A substantial departure from the oath prescribed would have been very <em>improper </em>and grossly <em>irregular. </em>Such an oath could not, in any true sense, be said to have been duly administered and taken. It is true that we might, by a nice construction, understand this record to mean that an illegal and void oath was administered to the jury with all the proper formalities required by law. But would this be a fair construction of the entry? We think not. A void and unlawful oath cannot be duly or regularly, or properly administered. After careful consideration, we construe the entry to mean that the jury were sworn in the manner prescribed by law; and that they were required by their oaths to \u201c try the guilt or innocence of the defendant\u201d properly and regularly according to law. The entry before us as plainly means this as does the ancient one which has been sanctioned by usage and precedent. Our constitution gives the people the right of electing the clerks of the several Courts of original jurisdiction, and of bestowing these offices from time to time upon inexperienced men. If the records made up by these public servants are not construed with great liberality, justice cannot be administered. On the whole, we are of opinion that there is nothing on the record which authorizes us to infer that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>illegal oath was administered to the jury. The presumption from the entry is the other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">But the sentence is clearly, erroneous. It imposes \u201c <em>hard\u201d </em>labour without statutory authority, and omits to require that the imprisonment shall be \u201csolitary,\u201d in disregard' of the positive directions of the Act of Assembly. We are bound to presume that every convict has a deep interest in his own reformation. He has,' therefore, a right to all the means, provided by law, to produce that desirable result. Social intercourse has its pleasures and advantages ; but there is a personal discomfort, as well as a moral injury, to every prisoner who is condemned to indiscriminate intercourse with convicts of every shade of guilt. The plaintiff in error has a right to have these errors in the sentence corrected.' The record will therefore be remitted, in order that the Court below may substitute for \u201c imprisonment at <em>hard </em>labour,\u201d \u201c <em>separate </em>or <em>solitary </em>confinement at labour,\u201d as the law requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">The doubts which formerly existed respecting the power of the Supreme Court, upon reversing a judgment in a criminal case, are entirely dissipated. We have authorities to' show that the Supreme Court, on reversal of a judgment in a criminal case for error in the sentence, has power to pass such sentence as th\u00e9 Court below ought to have passed: Drew <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 1 <em>Wharton </em>281; Daniels <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth; 7 <em>Barr </em>375; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Ellis, 11 <em>Mass. </em>465; Kane <em>v. </em>The People, 8 <em>Wend. </em>211. It has also the power to award a <em>procedendo </em>in a criminal case: Rex <em>v. </em>Kenworthy, 1 <em>B. $ C. </em>711; and it may,- in its discretion, remit the record with orders to proceed on the indictment after the reversal of an erroneous judgment: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>M\u2019Kisson, 8 <em>Ser. </em>&amp; <em>R. </em>422; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Church, 1 <em>Barr </em>110. The Act of 16th Jun\u00e9, 1836, conferred fio new powers in this respect. It was designed to remove doubts which had arisen, in consequence of conflicting decisions: The common law embodies in itself sufficient reason and common sense to reject the monstrous doctrine, that a' prisoner whose guilt is est\u00e1bli'shed by a regular verdict is to escape punishment altogether/ because the Court committed an error in passing the Sentence. If this Court sanctioned such a rule, it would fail to perform the chief duty for which it was established. Our duty is to correct errors, and to \u201cminister justice'.\u201d But such a course would perpetuate error, and produce the most intolerable injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">It is considered that the judgment of the Court of Oyer and Terminer, for th\u00e9 city and county of Philadelphia; in this ease, be reversed and annulled. And it is ordered that the record be remitted to said Court, for further proceedings in conformity with the opinion of this Court herein expressed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
