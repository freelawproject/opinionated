The cause being submitted to the Court below upon a case stated, judgment was entered for the plaintiff below; to reverse which the defendant sued out this writ.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-11\"><em>Mellon </em>and Stanton, for plaintiff in error. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhX\">The presumption of law and of fact is, that the annual salary compensated no more than the regular and defined duty; and it being shown that this duty was not within the enumeration, and it being admitted to have been worth the full amount of $200, the law implies an undertaking to pay for it. The work being shown to be extra, is therefore entitled to extra compensation; for it is a well established principle of law \u201c that, if work additional to that contemplated in the original contract be done at the request of the party benefited by it, he will be liable therefor, upon an implied promise to pay for it: <em>Story on </em>Contracts, \u00a7 15, citing Lovelock <em>v. </em>King, 1 <em>Moody &amp; Rob. </em>60; Dubois <em>v. </em>Canal Co., 12 <em>Wend. </em>334; Damin <em>v. </em>Granby, 2 <em>Pick. </em>345; Hoadly <em>v. </em>McLean, 4 <em>Manning &amp; Scott </em>340.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b337-12\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b337-13\">Black, J. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AXrU\">A person employed as the secretary of a private corporation, at a fixed rate of compensation, cannot demand extra pay for services in that capacity, which were not anticipated at the time of his appointment, or which were not enumerated in the charter or by-laws. The fair construction of his contract is, that he will do whatever his employers may have occasion to employ a secretary about.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">' Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
