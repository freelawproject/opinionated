Hall, Margaret Hall Ms wife [late Margaret Ewing), John Ewing, and Elizabeth Woods, the two former being the children, and the latter the late widow of John Ewing, deceased, now intermarried with Stephen Woods, presented their petition to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny county, alleging they were the owners of a tract of land in said county, and that the railroad company had entered upon and appropriated a portion of the said land for the purposes of their road. On the same day the Court appointed viewers, and on the 1st of March following, the report was filed, finding for the petitioners $1500 damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-9\">To this report the railroad company filed exceptions, one of wMch was to the effect,, that the viewers had made no apportionment of the damages among the petitioners, according to their several interests in the land.

A payment of the amount assessed would exonerate the company: 1 <em>Harris </em>500. It is not necessary to set forth the title of the parties. The petitioners were bound to make out their title before the viewers, and in the absence of contrary proof, it will be presumed that they have done so: 7 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>236.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b336-14\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b336-15\">Black, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aii\">All the exceptions in this case are abandoned ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>cept one.
