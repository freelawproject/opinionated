Shipper associations are also organized to obtain the benefit of volume freight rates; they are composed of groups of independent shippers of freight who have banded together for this purpose. However, they do not hold themselves out to the public but perform services on a nonprofit basis only for their dues-paying members.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, these business entities are similar but nonetheless distinct, and the difference between them has been recognized by Congress. A freight forwarder is subject to the provisions of Part IV of the Interstate Commerce Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1022, and is defined in relevant part in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(a) (5), as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_W\">any person which * * * holds itself out to the general public as a common carrier to transport or provide transportation of property * * * for compensation, in interstate commerce, and which, in the ordinary and usual course of its undertaking, (A) assembles and consolidates * * * shipments of such property, and performs * * * break-bulk and distributing operations with respect to such consolidated shipments, and (B) assumes responsibility for the transportation of such property from point of receipt to point of destination, and (C) utilizes, for the whole or any part of the transportation of such shipments, the services of a carrier or carriers subject to chapters 1, 8, or 12 of this title [i. e., rail, pipe line, motor or water carriers].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APt\">Freight forwarders are required to obtain operating permits from the Commission and are subject to regulation in various other ways. On the other hand, the Act also takes note of shipper associations; thus, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(c) specifically precludes from regulation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\">the operations of * * * a group or association of shippers, in consolidating or distributing freight for * * members thereof, on a nonprofit basis, for the purpose of securing the benefits of carload, truckload, or other volume rates * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">Although the Act recognizes and defines both types of organizations, whether a particular entity is one or the other \u2014 the issue presented here \u2014 may be a troublesome question.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This case began in October 1963, when the Commission on its own motion <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> commenced an investigation of Piggy-Back\u2019s activities to determine, among other things, whether it had been operating as a freight forwarder without a permit. There ensued a hearing before an examiner, a decision by Division 1 of the Commission, and denial of reconsideration by the full Commission. The Commission discontinued the proceedings against Piggy-Back, finding that although it had operated unlawfully in the past, Piggy-Back had sufficiently reformed to become a bona fide shipper association. Plaintiffs argue here that (1) the Commission\u2019s conclusion is not supported by substantial evidence and should be set aside; and (2) the Commission committed legal error in refusing to rule upon plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Piggy-Back is improperly participating in joint loading operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">Our discussion of plaintiffs\u2019 first point requires a close examination of the facts. Piggy-Back was organized in 1962 as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>unincorporated association under Florida law. Theodore Helin, the moving party in its formation, conceived the idea of forming a shipper association to combine highway trailers on railroad flatcars, so-called \u201cpiggyback\u201d service. Because of cost considerations, this service is used only when there are two trailers to ship; moreover, the rail tariffs provide that there must be a mixture of commodities.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, as a practical matter, many shippers, who have only one trailerload or one commodity to ship, could not use piggyback service unless they banded together. Helin contacted the initial group of shipper members, drew up the association\u2019s articles and by-laws, called the organizational meeting, actually appointed the \u201celected\u201d members of the board of directors, and obtained a contract as general manager with compensation at the rate of 10 cents per hundred pounds of freight handled. Thereafter, Helin exercised a free hand, unencumbered by effective control by the board of directors, whose principal decisions at meetings amounted to approval of new membership applications secured by Helin. By August 1963, Helin had run the association into about $20,000 debt. All of these findings by the examiner and Division 1 are undisputed, as is the legal conclusion reached from these facts \u2014 that up to this time, because Helin and not the members exercised full control over operations, Piggy-Back was not a bona fide shipper association entitled to non-regulated status.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">At this point, the positions of the parties diverge. The following additional findings are under particular attack: Beginning in August 1963, the theretofore passive directors became alarmed by the financial condition into which Helin had led their association and took an active interest in its management; a new general manager was appointed, this time on a straight salary basis; the new manager was not permitted to sign checks independently; he was required to submit weekly financial reports to the board and reports to the members as well; indeed, the board exercised complete supervision and control over him; efforts were being made, and had been modestly successful, to pay off the association\u2019s debts; and no freight other than that of shipper members was being handled by the association. Thus, the examiner and Division 1 found generally that PiggyBack was no longer \u201ca \u2018paper\u2019 creature\u201d of the general manager\u2019s own conception or a cloak under which an independent entrepreneur was acting.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Plaintiffs contend that the evidence of steps taken to reform Piggy-Back in the six months or so prior to the hearing was not substantial enough to justify the Commission\u2019s conclusion that Piggy-Back had now become eligible for the non-regulated status to which it was admittedly not entitled during the Helin regime.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">The scope of our review of the Commission\u2019s findings is narrow: It is limited to determining whether the Commission\u2019s findings are based on \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,\u201d or, phrased differently, on enough evidence to justify a refusal to direct a verdict, had there been a jury trial. Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 619-621, 86 S.Ct. 1018, 1026, 16 L.Ed.2d 131 (1966). Applying this standard, we conclude that based on the entire record there is substantial evidence for the findings that \u201cthe \u2018coming to life\u2019 of the association * * * appears to have put an entirely different complexion upon the subject,\u201d and that as of the time of the hearing Piggy-Back was a bona fide shipper as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>sociation. We need not feel enthusiastic about this conclusion. Whether a sinner has reformed is hardly ever free from doubt, a reason why the Commission has recently suggested that the Act \u201cbe amended to require associations to satisfy the Commission that they are bona fide shipper associations before they begin operations.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In any event, exercising the appropriate review, we will not set aside the Commission\u2019s findings on the extent or significance of the change in Piggy-Back\u2019s operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Plaintiffs attack not only the evidentiary basis for these key findings but also the legal criteria applied by the examiner and Division 1 to decide whether Piggy-Back qualified as a non-regulated shipper association or was instead an illegally operating freight forwarder. In Atlanta Shippers Ass\u2019n\u2014Investigation of Operations, 316 I.C.C. 259, 278 (1962) (Division 1), reconsidered, 322 I.C.C. 273, 283 (1964) (full Commission), the Commission engaged in a full-scale analysis of the distinctions between the two; one of the tests there announced was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">Are the freight consolidating and distributing operations such that any person or persons other than the shipper-members of the association (a) have any right or ability to control, direct, or dominate such operations, or (b) bear the essential risks and burdens, financial and otherwise, of conducting the operations under consideration?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0aD\">Negative answers to both questions are necessary to justify non-regulation. Plaintiffs argue that these criteria, which the Commission applied in this case, are insufficient because they do not require that association members be liable jointly and severally for the association\u2019s debts. Such an additional requirement was tangentially stated by Division 1 in its initial decision in the <em>Atlanta Shippers </em>case, 316 I.C.C. at 278. However, the full Commission modified Division l\u2019s test in its subsequent opinion in <em>Atlanta Shippers, </em>322 I.C.C. at 285-88, expressly rejecting the need for joint and several liability of shipper association members. Indeed, in that opinion, the Commission ruled that a shipper association could be incorporated (unlike Piggy-Back), even though this might tend to reduce individual liability.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Commission noted that, whether incorporated or not, shippers who are members of a non-regulated association are responsible as the beneficial owners of the goods moved and cannot insulate themselves in that respect from third persons,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that certain other risks are readily insurable, and that the major risk run by a shipper association is that the savings on volume rates will be eaten up by uneconomical operating costs. We agree with the Commission that it is sufficient that these risks <em>not </em>be borne by any party other than the shipper association itself, whatever its limitations on individual member liability, as long as the members in good faith exercise responsible control over their association\u2019s operations. See <em>Atlanta Shippers, </em>supra, 322 I.C.C. at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">Plaintiffs argue that despite the full Commission\u2019s rejection of the requirement that members be both jointly and severally liable, we should defer to the statement of the court in Freight Consolidators Coop., Inc. v. United States, 230 F.Supp. 692, 696 (S.D.N.Y.1964), which, in affirming an order of the Commission in <em>Atlanta Shippers, </em>quoted Division l\u2019s language to the contrary. Plaintiffs point out that the court rendered its decision after the full Commission\u2019s decision reversing Division 1 on this point, and plaintiffs add that the court refused to amend its opinion to take account of the full Commission\u2019s reversal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>As to the latter argument, we think the court\u2019s denial of motions to amend its opinion is at most ambiguous; the court denied them without further elaboration on the dual grounds that the motions were untimely and without merit. Moreover, alteration of the opinion would not have changed the judgment. See orders dated Sept. 23, 1964, Freight Consolidators Coop., Inc. v. United States, 63 Civ. 55, S.D.N.Y. Finally, we think it apparent from a careful reading of the court\u2019s opinion that the issue of joint and several liability could not have been of much weight, considering its brief mention in contrast to all the other gross violations of the Act recited in detail. Therefore, we do not regard <em>Freight Consolidators </em>as necessarily inconsistent with our decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"> Plaintiffs also urge that since Piggy-Back\u2019s conception and early growth were due to Helin\u2019s unlawful activities, the Commission cannot reward PiggyBack now by allowing it to continue. Plaintiffs in effect ask for the draconian rule that once a shipper association has violated the Act, its operations must be stopped. However, no adequate reason is given for thus hamstringing the Commission in determining the appropriate remedy for past illegal activity, a discretion it exercises in analogous situations.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, the precedents plaintiffs urge upon us are either distinguishable or actually support giving the Commission latitude.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Finally, plaintiffs and intervening defendants earnestly debate the issue of whether the Commission or Piggy-Back had the burden of proof, with much discussion of the difference between a \u201cclarifying provision\u201d and an \u201cexception\u201d in a statute. This exercise in semantics, while interesting, is beside the point. In Division l\u2019s decision below, 323 I.C.C. at 673, 675, and in its brief here, the Commission accepts the proposition urged by plaintiffs that \u201cone who claims the benefit of an exception to such a statute has the burden of proof that he comes within such exception.\u201d See Freight Consolidators Coop., Inc. v. United States, 230 F.Supp. 692, 699 (S.D.N.Y.1964). However, the Commission argues that Piggy-Back met this test and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second contention is that the Commission arbitrarily failed to rule upon the merits of a material issue before it and thereby violated section 8(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S. C. \u00a7 1007(b), which provides, inter alia,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">All decisions * * * shall * * * include a statement of (1) findings and conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis therefor, <em>upon all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record </em>* * *. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">The issue not decided was whether a non-regulated shipper association may engage in the practice of \u201cco-loading\u201d or \u201cjoint loading.\u201d The examiner found that at times Piggy-Back placed one of its truck trailers on the same railroad flatcar with a trailer of another non-regulated shipper association in order to take advantage of the cheaper railroad rate available through sharing an entire flatcar. Although the examiner characterized Piggy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Back\u2019s co-loading as \u201csporadic and infrequent,\u201d its present manager testified that \u201cif it were necessary [to continue], we would.\u201d While the examiner did find that a limited type of co-loading had occurred and ventured the opinion that it was permissible, he did not make a formal determination of its legality. Division 1 also refused to decide the issue, stating (323 I.C.C. at 675):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">The extent of the service performed and the pertinent facts involved are not sufficiently detailed in the present record to permit an authoritative determination respecting joint loading.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Plaintiffs contend (to summarize briefly) that non-regulated shipper associations are forbidden to co-load for two reasons: (1) When one of two associations \u201cmarries\u201d the two trailers on a flatcar and executes the single bill of lading for that flatcar showing itself as the car\u2019s consignor, :t is consolidating freight for others than itself or its members contrary to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(c), quoted above;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and (2) the saving each association effects by co-loading is compensation or profit to the association, destroying its non-profit status.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The co-loading issue was raised at the very start of these proceedings in the hearing before the examiner. The record amply demonstrates that the matter was presented to the examiner and to the Commission at every stage. For example, the Commission\u2019s Bureau of Inquiry and .Compliance fully briefed this issue before the examiner rendered his report and again afterward in its statement of exceptions thereto. So did various intervenors. After the decision of Division 1, several of the parties filed a joint petition with the Commission asking it to find that the proceeding involved issues of general transportation importance.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The first of the two issues raised in that petition was the legality of co-loading by a shipper association. The full Commission granted the petition, and thereafter intervening parties filed additional briefs arguing both sides of the co-loading issue. Then, without discussion, the full Commission affirmed Division l\u2019s decision on the merits, including, of course, its failure to rule on co-loading.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">Defendants argue that the requirement of the Administrative Procedure Act was met when Division 1 gave its reason for refusing to decide the co-loading issue, i. e., that the extent and nature of PiggyBack\u2019s co-loading was not sufficiently detailed to permit \u201can authoritative determination.\u201d However, Piggy-Back has been found to share railroad flatcars with other non-regulated associations and the manager.of Piggy-Back stated that he intended to continue the practice when necessary. Moreover, reliance on inadequacy of the record is questionable since the Commission itself initiated this proceeding on its own motion. The observations of a former Interstate Commerce Commissioner, quoted with approval by this court in Isbrandtsen Co. v. United States, 96 F.Supp. 883,892 (S.D.N.Y.1951), aff\u2019d per curiam by an equally divided Court sub nom. A/S J. Ludwig Mowinckels Rederi v. Isbrandtsen Co., 342 U.S. 950, 72 S.Ct. 623, 96 L.Ed. 706 (1952), apply here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-11\">[Administrative agencies] are not expected merely to call balls and strikes, or to weigh the evidence submitted by the parties and let the scales tip as they will. The agency does not do its duty when it merely decides upon a poor or nonrepresentative record. As the sole representative of the public, which is a third party in these proceedings, the agency owes the duty to investigate all the pertinent facts, and to see that they are adduced when the parties have not put them in * * *. The agency must always act upon the record made, and if that is not sufficient, it should see the record is supplemented before it acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">Accord, Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. FPC, 354 F.2d 608 (2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 941, 86 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>1462, 16 L.Ed.2d 540 (1966). Defendants suggest that the co-loading issue may be decided soon in another proceeding which has also been designated as one of general transportation importance.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> However, the record here does not reassure us that such designation is a sound basis for assuming that the question will be decided. The issue certainly is important to plaintiffs, since if their position is accepted, the competition they face from Piggy-Back and other associations that co-load may well be eliminated. We realize that not all significant issues are \u201cmaterial\u201d in the sense that their resolution would affect the result in a particular case. Thus, in this proceeding, it would not be necessary to decide the co-loading issue if the Commission had for other reasons found Piggy-Back not to be a bona fide shipper association.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> But in the posture of the case now, the issue is plainly material.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">In an analogous situation, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Minneapolis Gas Co. v. FPC, 111 U.S.App.D.C. 16, 294 F.2d 212, 215 (1961), said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">We think the Commission cannot terminate a proceeding after it has actually conducted a hearing to the point of receiving an Examiner\u2019s initial decision, without rendering a decision upon the issue presented * * *. We do not have before us, and therefore do not decide, whether the Commission may terminate a proceeding, once entered upon, at some point prior to the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing. A change of mind, midstream so to speak, may or may not be permissible. But we are of opinion that the Commission, having received all the evidence the parties wish to present, and having before it an Examiner's findings, conclusion and decision, cannot at that point change its mind wiping out the hearing as though it had never occurred, and in effect decide that it will not enter upon a hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">See also American Boiler Mfrs.

But in contrast, in that case, the Supreme Court noted:<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-11\">This is not a case in which the Commission has walked right up to the line and then refused to cross it \u2014 a case, in other words, in which all the evidence necessary to a determination had been received but the determination was not made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-12\"><em>Wisconsin </em>was also clearly distinguishable because the Commission there stated that \u201cit does not have the facilities to reopen this case * * * and at the same time to proceed expeditiously with its area investigations.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> There is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>suggestion that any such problem is presented here. The Commission on this record was able, if it saw fit, to rule that Piggy-Back\u2019s co-loading was perfectly proper as a matter of law or so minor as to be <em>de </em>minimis; <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> in either event, plaintiffs would then have had an opportunity to test the rulings. We do not suggest that the Commission must determine all aspects of the co-loading problem in this proceeding. We realize that the practice takes more than one form and that the Commission may wish to defer ruling on other types not practiced by Piggy-Back until it obtains a more representative view of the factors involved. Indeed, recognizing that there may be circumstances justifying an agency\u2019s refusal to exercise its unquestioned jurisdiction, cf. NLRB v. Denver Bldg. &amp; Const. Council, 341 U.S. 675, 684-685, 71 S.Ct. 943, 95 L.Ed. 1284 (1951), we hold only that the Commission has shown no such justification here. However it decides in this case, the Commission will not seriously be foreclosed from later amplification or reconsideration in another, perhaps more general, proceeding.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Under all of these circumstances, we feel that on this record, the Commission was required to rule on the legality of Piggy-Back\u2019s co-loading.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\"> But plaintiffs ask us to decide the co-loading issue here and now.
