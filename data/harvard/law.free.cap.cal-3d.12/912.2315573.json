Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 56 [41 L.Ed.2d at p. 572].)</p>\n<p id=\"b902-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>Since the date of that mandate, however, the governing provisions of the California Constitution have been changed by vote of the people. At the general election of November 1974 the language of article II, section 3, and article XX, section 11, which formerly disfranchised persons convicted of crime, was deleted; instead, the Legislature is simply directed by new section 3 of article II to provide for the temporary \u201cdisqualification\u201d of electors while they are imprisoned or on parole for the conviction of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">This constitutional amendment took effect on November 6, 1974, the day after the election. (Cal. Const., art. XVTH, \u00a7 4.) In view of its provisions there will no longer be any possibility of unconstitutional discrimination in local enforcement of laws disfranchising for conviction of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">The issue which is the subject of the United States Supreme Court mandate in this case is therefore moot, and the proceedings herein are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">This order is final forthwith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b902-7\">Wright, C. J., McComb, J., Tobriner, J., Sullivan, J., Clark, J., and Burke, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
