(Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 242, 243.) The victim of the battery, Walter Culbertson, was not notified of the sentencing hearing. In the absence of the victim, the respondent court suspended proceedings and ordered probation for five years, with various conditions. The probation officer's report included statements by the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">At a February 2, 1984, hearing on a motion to vacate the judgment and to set aside the order granting probation, the respondent court stated that it had proceeded at the sentencing hearing in the absence of the victim on the assumption that the victim had been notified, but had chosen not to attend. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The People and the victim complain that the order of probation is unlawful in that the victim was not notified of the sentencing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">It appears that the provisions of the California Constitution, article I, section 28,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Penal Code section 1191.1,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are directory, as distin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>guished from mandatory, in their effect. The failure of the probation officer to comply with that officer\u2019s duty to notify the crime victim of the probation and sentencing hearing, and the resultant absence of the victim at such hearing, does not deprive the trial court of its jurisdiction to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">No procedures to enforce the duty of notification or remedies for the failure to do so are provided by the constitutional provision in article I, section 28, as reflected in Penal Code section 1191.1, or by the Legislature in Penal Code section 1191.2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Unless and until the Legislature establishes appropriate guidelines to accomplish the purpose of Penal Code section 1191.1, this court has no authority to afford any relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The petitions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Petitioners\u2019 application for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied May 31, 1984.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b284-12\">Before Lillie, Acting P.

[\u00b6] (b) It is the unequivocal intention of the People of the State of California that all persons who suffer losses as a result of criminal activity shall have the right to restitution from the persons convicted of the crimes for losses they suffer, [\u00b6] Restitution shall be ordered from the convicted persons in every case, regardless of the sentence or disposition imposed, in which a crime victim suffers a loss, unless compelling and extraordinary reasons exist to the contrary. The Legislature shall adopt provisions to implement this section during the calendar year following adoption of this section, [\u00b6] (c) All students and staff of public primary, elementary, junior high and senior high schools have the inalienable right to attend campuses which are safe, secure and peaceful.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Penal Code section 1191.1 provides: \u201cThe victim of any crime, or the next of kin of the victim if the victim has died, has the right to attend all sentencing proceedings under this chapter and shall be given adequate notice by the probation officer of all sentencing proceedings concerning the person who committed the crime. [\u00b6] The victim or next of kin has the right to appear, personally or by counsel, at the sentencing proceeding and to reasonably express his or her views concerning the crime, the person responsible, and the need for restitution. The court in imposing sentence shall consider the statements of victims and next of kin made pursuant to this section and shall state on the record its conclusion concerning whether the person would pose a threat to public safety if granted probation, [\u00b6] The provisions of this section shall not be amended by the Legislature except by statute passed in each house by rollcall vote entered in the journal, two-thirds of the membership concurring, or by a statute that becomes effective only when approved by the electors.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Penal Code section 1191.2 provides: \u201cIn providing notice to the victim pursuant to Section 1191.1, the probation officer shall also provide the victim with information concerning the victim\u2019s right to civil recovery against the defendant and the victim\u2019s opportunity to be compensated from the Restitution Fund.
