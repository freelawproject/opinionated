His complaint alleged the machine was manufactured by General Motors, his employer. General Motors filed affidavits and answered a series of interrogatories, indicating it had built the machine. When General Motors later discovered Hamblen Gauge was the manufacturer,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it notified Guzman who moved for an order imposing sanctions, alleging the incorrect answer was intentional, an effort by General Motors, immune from suit, to shield Hamblen Gauge. Heard on the same day were General Motors\u2019 motions for (1) leave to file supplemental responses to interrogatories or (2) relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court denied Guzman\u2019s request for sanctions, apparently ignored General Motors\u2019 separate motion for leave to file supplemental answers, but granted the Code of Civil Procedure section 473 motion \u201cupon condition defendant pays to plaintiff, as attorney fees, $15,000.\u201d Following General Motors\u2019 motion for reconsideration, the court modified its prior ruling: \u201cto grant [\u00a7 473] relief as requested and further to grant General Motor\u2019s [sic] leave to file supplemental responses. [\u00b6] The Court, having exercised its discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>tion in granting the relief sought, finds that a just term for its having done so is that defendant General Motors pay to plaintiff, as attorney fees the sum of $15,000, which General Motors is hereby ordered to do within 90 days of the date hereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Subsequently, General Motors was awarded summary judgment based on the workers\u2019 compensation exclusive remedy provisions of Labor Code sections 3600 and 3601.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">General Motors contends the imposition of attorneys\u2019 fees was incorrect, claiming it had an affirmative duty to amend answers to interrogatories and its motion to amend should have been granted apart from its alternate section 473 motion. It further argues, even assuming section 473 relief was correct, it cannot be unconditionally ordered to pay the fees and the fees were excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">A panoply of remedies is available to a proponent of interrogatories faced with a recalcitrant opponent. The discovery statutes provide for motions to compel both answers and further answers, with appropriate sanctions. But no definitive authority exists to guide an answering party as to how to initiate the filing of amended answers. Therefore, the central issue we address is the necessity of, and method by which, a party who has incorrectly responded to interrogatories may change, amend or supplement those answers. We then determine when attorneys\u2019 fees, if any, may be imposed as a consequence of the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\u201cInterrogatories expedite the resolution of lawsuits . . . [by detecting] sham claims and defenses . . . [and] may be employed to support a motion for summary judgment or a motion to specify those issues which are without substantial controversy.\u201d <em>(Deyo </em>v. <em>Kilbourne </em>(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 779 [149 Cal.Rptr. 499].) It is patently obvious ungrounded refusal to answer, prolonged delay and incorrect answers to interrogatories seriously inhibit \u201cthe principal aim of discovery procedures in general [which] is to assist counsel to prepare for trial. ...\u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Circle P Ranch Co. </em>(1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 267, 273 [150 Cal.Rptr. 828].)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Parties must \u201cstate the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth in answering written interrogatories\u201d <em>(Deyo </em>v. <em>Kilbourne, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783), and \u201c[w]here answers are erroneous, or misleading, they should be corrected long before the pretrial conference.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>p. 785, fn. omitted.) However, no explicit statutory duty to amend or supplement answers exists in California as it does under the federal rules.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">There are few cases examining a responding party\u2019s attempts to change interrogatory answers. The court in <em>Singer </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 318 [5 Cal.Rptr. 697, 353 P.2d 305] noted \u201c[a]nswers to these interrogatories now, if compelled, will not prevent the defendant at the trial from relying on subsequently discovered facts, including facts produced at the trial by plaintiff or his witnesses, or by any of the other parties to this lawsuit, or their witnesses. In fact, such answers would not even prevent production of facts now known to defendant but not included in the answers, upon a proper showing that the oversight was in <em>good faith. </em>\u201d (Id., at p. 325, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1967) 250 Cal.App.2d 722 [58 Cal.Rptr. 870], a party, 18 months after answering interrogatories, sought to reverse its position. Amended answers were filed without leave of court followed by a motion to modify the pretrial order to reflect the change. The moving party was denied leave to amend as there was no showing the original answer was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The California Supreme Court in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>American Cas. Co. </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 266 [98 Cal.Rptr. 814, 491 P.2d 398] condoned \u201csupplemental answers\u201d filed during trial. Recognizing the answers \u201cdid not in reality supplement the earlier answers but instead completely repudiated them\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 275), the court stated \u201cthe insurer is not bound, as a matter of law, to its initial answers to these interrogatories.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Acceptance of the varying answers resulted in disadvantage to the insurer who contended at trial the policy was unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Both <em>Universal </em>and <em>Williams </em>were decided when section 2030 required \u201cthe party upon whom the interrogatories have been served [to] <em>file </em>and serve a copy of the answers . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) In its present form, section 2030 merely requires the answering party to <em>\u201cserve </em>the answers on the party submitting the interrogatories\u201d (\u00a7 2030, subd. (a), italics added) and \u201cany responses thereto shall not be filed unless the court, on motion and notice and for good cause shown, so orders.\u201d (\u00a7 2030, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Neither Guzman\u2019s interrogatories nor General Motors\u2019 original responses were filed with the court, but were merely served on the opponent as now required by section 2030. When a change in response became necessary, section 473 was not the applicable code section for relief. The suggestion to the contrary in <em>Deyo </em>v. <em>Kilbourne, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.3d 771, 785, footnote 13\u2014\u201camendments to correct a mistaken factual statement are usually permitted under section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Cal. Civil Discovery Practice [Cont.Ed.Bar 1975] \u00a7 8.61.)\u201d\u2014is obsolete after the changes in section 2030.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">In the usual section 473 situation, the moving party will reap a benefit\u2014 adding a cause of action or defense, vacating dismissal of his complaint or a default judgment taken against him. Thus the condition imposed involves consideration of the prejudice or injustice resulting to the other party if <em>otherwise unavailable </em>relief is granted to the moving party. Discovery of an incorrect answer to interrogatories does not place a party in default.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor does the correction amend a \u201cpleading or proceeding\u201d (\u00a7 473, par. 1) and, unless sanctions have been awarded or other judicial action taken, there is no \u201cjudgment, order or other proceeding\u201d (\u00a7 473, par. 3) from which relief need be requested.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">We hold a party wishing to amend its answers to interrogatories need only serve the corrected answers on the proponent. If the contents are relevant, as they were here, to a motion for summary judgment, a party may lodge the responses with the court in conjunction with a motion to file them pursuant to section 2030, subdivision (b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">General Motors was entitled to merely serve its amended answers or lodge them with the court and move to file them as requested, pursuant to section 2030, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>When the proponent receiving amended responses wishes attorneys\u2019 fees or further sanctions, the issue may be raised by independent motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">If timely answers are submitted but deemed incomplete by the interrogator, \u201che [she] may move the court for an order requiring further response.\u201d (\u00a7 2030.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A motion may also be brought pursuant to section 2034, subdivision (a)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> when the opposing party refuses or fails to answer any interrogatory.  In the latter case, the court may impose \u201creasonable expenses incurred in obtaining the order, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> where the omission is found to be \u201cwithout substantial justification.\u201d (\u00a7 2034, subd. (a); <em>Deyo </em>v. <em>Kilbourne, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.3d 771, 789.) Where a party \u201cwillfully fails\u201d to answer, more severe penalties are available as well as \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d (\u00a7 2034, subd. (d).)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">We can only assume the court, in denying Guzman\u2019s section 2034 motion for sanctions, found the original noncompliance was not \u201cwithout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>substantial justification\u201d and General Motors had not \u201cwillfully fail[ed]\u201d to answer for \u201c[a] willfully false answer to an interrogatory must be treated as the equivalent of no answer at all if the purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 2030 are to be achieved.\u201d <em>(Thoren </em>v. <em>Johnston &amp; Washer </em>(1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 270, 274 [105 Cal.Rptr. 276].)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, Guzman was not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees as a consequence of the amended responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">There is independent authority, in addition to section 2034 relief, for a trial court to award attorneys\u2019 fees. The injured party may seek relief via section 128.5<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>if </em>notice is given by the proponent in its \u201cmoving or responding papers,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the fees were incurred \u201cas a result of tactics or actions not based on good faith\u201d <em>and </em>the court order is in writing and \u201crecite[s] in detail the conduct or circumstances justifying the order.\u201d (\u00a7 128.5, subd. (b); <em>Corralejo </em>v. <em>Quiroga </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 871 [199 Cal.Rptr. 733].)  This section was not raised below and in light of the court\u2019s denial of sanctions under section 437c,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> based on similar requirements of \u201cbad faith\u201d and \u201cdelay,\u201d the request would have been equally unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">We find attorneys\u2019 fees may only be awarded to the proponent of interrogatories, when an answering party serves or moves to file amended or corrected answers, after appropriate motion by the proponent. Attorneys\u2019 fees then may be imposed, pursuant to sections 128.5, 2030 or 2034 after the requisite findings are made.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>In light of our decision, we do not reach General Motors\u2019 other contentions. The court\u2019s order under section 473 is stricken and General Motors\u2019 amended answers are deemed filed pursuant to its original motion and section 2030, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Trotter, P. J., and Crosby, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-10\">Three identical machines were in use at the plant: two manufactured by Hamblen Gauge and one by General Motors. The error surfaced following the court ordered deposition of Roy Selby, taken by Guzman. Selby, General Motors\u2019 designer, had answered the original interrogatories 18 months earlier. At that time he worked at a plant in the east and did not personally view the machine. He gave the original answers following a phone call from the Anaheim superintendent who identified the machine as \u201cNo. 5.\u201d The three machines at the Anaheim plant were numbered \u201c4\u201d (manufactured by HG), \u201c5\u201d (by G.M.), and \u201c6\u201d (by HG). When Selby\u2019s deposition was taken in January 1982, he testified the machine was manufactured by Hamblen Gauge (\u201cNo. 4\u201d). He contends he was unaware of the mistake until his deposition trip to Anaheim. Only then did he personally check the identifying characteristics of the machine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-11\">All code section references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise identified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b386-9\">General Motors was found to be immune from suit.
