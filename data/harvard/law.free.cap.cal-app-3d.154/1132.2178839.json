An information charged Hetherington with 82 sex offenses. In a written plea bargain containing a <em>Harvey </em>waiver <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harvey </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 754, 757-759 [159 Cal.Rptr. 696, 602 P.2d 396]), Hetherington pleaded guilty to five counts of Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (counts 16, 38, 42, 70 and 81) and three counts of section 288a, subdivision (c) (counts 77, 79 and 82). He was sentenced to a total term of 21 years, 4 months: an aggravated principal term of 8 years on count 77 (\u00a7 288a, subd. (c)) and 13 years, 4 months representing the total consecutive subordinate midterms for the balance of the crimes. In extending the total subordinate term beyond five years the court treated section 288, subdivision (a) as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under section 667.5, subdivision (c)(6). Hetherington challenges that treatment, as well as the court\u2019s sentence choice reasons and refusal to apply the now repealed mentally disordered sex offender statutes. We affirm the judgment and remand for resentencing on counts 70 and 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">I<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">Hetherington contends his total subordinate term of thirteen years and four months must be reduced to five years under section 1170.1, subdivision (a). That subdivision limits the total of the subordinate terms under section 1170.1 for consecutively sentenced nonviolent offenses to five years. The limitation does not apply, however, to subordinate terms imposed for any offense which is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under section 667.5, subdivision (c). (See \u00a7 1170.1, subd. (a).) Section 667.5, subdivision (c)(6) defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d as including \u201c[l]ewd acts on a child under 14 <em>as defined in Section 288.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Notwithstanding this express language to the contrary, Hetherington contends section 288, subdivision (a) is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under section 667.5, subdivision (c)(6), and thus the five-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>year subordinate term limitation of section 1170.1, subdivision (a) must be applied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">As a threshold matter, Hetherington points out the Legislature itself distinguished \u201cviolent\u201d and \u201cnonviolent\u201d section 288 offenses when it added subdivision (b) in 1979.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> From this observation, Hetherington reaches a number of conclusions. First, Hetherington argues the Legislature must have had a reason for adding subdivision (b) to section 288 because it would not have done so if the \u201cnew\u201d subdivision (b) offense was to be no different than the \u201cold\u201d subdivision (a) offense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> From this correct premise Hetherington draws an incorrect conclusion: the Legislature\u2019s reason for adding subdivision (b) was to provide the basis for a \u201cnarrowing\u201d of section 667.5, subdivision (c)(6) by limiting its applicability to \u201cviolent\u201d subdivision (b) offenses while removing \u201cnonviolent\u201d subdivision (a) offenses from its scope. The problem with this conclusion is that section 667.5, subdivision (c)(6) still refers generally to \u201cSection 288\u201d rather than specifically to section 288, subdivision (b). Hetherington proposes oversight as the explanation for the Legislature\u2019s failure to amend section 667.5, subdivision (c)(6) to refer specifically to section 288, subdivision (b). We believe, however, the Legislature would not have overlooked amending section 667.5, subdivision (c)(6) if its reason for adding subdivision (b) to section 288 was to provide the basis for just such an amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">A better explanation for the Legislature\u2019s addition of subdivision (b) to section 288 appears from the legislative history. When it added subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>(b) to section 288, the Legislature also amended or added seven other statutes in the Penal Code (\u00a7\u00a7 667.6, subds. (a), (c), (d), 1170.1, subd. (h),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 1192.5, 1203.065, subds. (a),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (b), 12022.8) and the Welfare and Institutions Code (\u00a7\u00a7 707, subd. (b)(6), 1732) in which it made specific references to subdivision (b). (Stats. 1979, ch. 944, \u00a7\u00a7 10, p. 3258, 12, p. 3260, 13, p. 3261, 15, p. 3262, 18, p. 3263, 19, p. 3264, 20, p. 3265.) Thus the Legislature demonstrated both its reasons for adding subdivision (b) and its ability to make corresponding changes in affected statutes. In this context, it appears the Legislature\u2019s failure to amend section 667.5, subdivision (c) (6) to refer specifically to subdivision (b) was by design rather than by oversight.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Hetherington next observes section 288, subdivisions (a) and (b) provide identical punishment. (See fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em>However, if the two subdivisions are to be distinguished for sentencing purposes, Hetherington reasons their respective punishments must somehow differ and the punishment for a \u201cviolent\u201d subdivision (b) offense must be more severe than the punishment for a \u201cnonviolent\u201d subdivision (a) offense. The difference, he concludes, is that section 667.5, subdivision (c)(6) removes subordinate terms for subdivision (b) offenses (but not for subdivision (a) offenses) from the five-year subordinate term limitation of section 1170.1, subdivision (a). Again, we agree with Hetherington\u2019s premise but not with his conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Beyond the identical three terms provided in section 288, subdivisions (a) and (b), a subdivision (b) offender is vulnerable to more severe punishment than a subdivision (a) offender. By concurrent statutory changes enacted in 1979 (see <em>ante), </em>the Legislature provided longer sentences (\u00a7 667.6, subds. (c), (d)) and more enhancements (\u00a7\u00a7 667.6, subd. (a), 1170.1, former subd. (h), 12022.8) for subdivision (b) offenders. It also restricted plea bargaining (\u00a7 1192.5) and the availability of probation (\u00a7 1203.065, former subd. (a), subd. (b)), treatment as a minor (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707, subd. (b)(6)) and commitment to the Youth Authority (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 1732). Thus, apart from section 667.5, subdivision (c)(6), a section 288, subdivision (b) conviction results in proportionately more serious consequences (see \u00a7 1170, subd. (a)(1)) than does a section 288, subdivision (a) conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>Returning to his oversight theme, Hetherington notes the Legislature over the years has removed all \u201cnonviolent\u201d felonies<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>except </em>section 288, subdivision (a) from section 667.5, subdivision (c). Hetherington therefore concludes the Legislature intended to remove subdivision (a) offenses as well and specifically enacted subdivision (b) to provide the basis for that change.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Contrary to Hetherington\u2019s presumption, section 288, subdivision (a) is <em>not </em>the only \u201cnonviolent\u201d felony remaining in section 667.5, subdivision (c). At least two other felonies which, by definition, can be committed without causing physical injury to a person (\u00a7\u00a7 37, 218) are included in section 667.5, subdivision (c)(7).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Consequently, the inclusion of section 288, subdivision (a) offenses in section 667.5, subdivision (c)(6) looks more like a legislative intention which should be judicially respected and less like a legislative aberration which should be judicially excised. Furthermore, even if section 288, subdivision (a) was the only \u201cnonviolent\u201d felony remaining in section 667.5, subdivision (c), its continuing presence following the Legislature\u2019s removal of other formerly included \u201cnonviolent\u201d felonies is equally consistent with either inadvertence or an intent to <em>retain </em>subdivision (a) offenses as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under section 667.5, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">In addition to the above, two other points are particularly persuasive indicators the Legislature intended to include section 288, subdivision (a) offenses within section 667.5, subdivision (c)(6). Foremost is the clear and unambiguous language of the statute: \u201cLewd acts on a child under 14 <em>as defined in Section 288.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)  We must follow the plain meaning of the statute unless doing so will produce absurd results or will frustrate the manifest purpose of the legislation considered as a whole. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Belled </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 879, 884 [157 Cal.Rptr. 503, 598 P.2d 473].)  As shown above, we need not be concerned with producing absurd results by including section 288, subdivision (a) offenses within section 667.5, subdivision (c)(6). We must be concerned, however, with following the manifest purpose of section 667.5, subdivision (c). That concern leads to the second indicator of legislative intent. Section 667.5, subdivision (c) states: \u201cThe Legislature finds and declares that these specified crimes merit special consideration when imposing a sentence to display society\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>condemnation for such <em>extraordinary crimes of violence against the person. </em>\u201d (Italics added.) We consider it significant that the statute refers simply to \u201cviolence\u201d rather than to \u201cphysical violence,\u201d \u201cphysical injury\u201d or \u201cbodily harm.\u201d The statute\u2019s unadorned language indicates the Legislature intended to impose increased punishment via section 667.5, subdivision (c) not only for certain felonies which are \u201cviolent\u201d in a physical sense but also for other selected felonies which cause extraordinary psychological or emotional harm. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Caudillo </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 562, 582 [146 Cal.Rptr. 859, 580 P.2d 274] [reference to \u201cphysical injury\u201d in \u00a7 12022.7 does not include psychological or emotional distress].) By adding subdivision (c) to section 288 in 1981 (see fn. 5, <em>ante), </em>the Legislature recognized <em>both </em>subdivisions (a) and (b) violations often cause irreparable psychological and emotional damage to child victims. Therefore, \u201cto display society\u2019s condemnation for such extraordinary crimes of violence against the person,\u201d the Legislature included <em>both </em>subdivisions (a) and (b) within section 667.5, subdivision (c)(6). The Legislature acted within its discretion, based on its proper concern for the welfare of children, to include subdivision (a) offenses (but not to include other physically \u201cnonviolent\u201d sex offenses) within the scope of section 667.5, subdivision (c). Accordingly, we hold Hetherington\u2019s section 288, subdivision (a) offenses are \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under section 667.5, subdivision (c)(6) and thus the five-year subordinate term limitation of section 1170.1, subdivision (a) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Hetherington also challenges the court\u2019s statement of reasons for the sentence it imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">He first argues the court failed to consider mitigating circumstances. The court said: \u201cI recognize the factors in mitigation. He is 67 years old. He\u2019s been employed all of his life. And as People\u2019s counsel states, he has no prior record; however, the law tells me I have to balance the circumstances in aggravation [and] the circumstances in mitigation and not even\u2014 not only by a preponderance of the evidence, but clearly and beyond a reasonable doubt, circumstances in aggravation outweigh the circumstances in mitigation, and the law tells me that\u2019s what I ought to do, and I\u2019m doing it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">The court properly examined and weighed the relevant factors in imposing Hetherington\u2019s sentence.  Even if this court were to weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances differently, absent an abuse of discretion we may not substitute our judgment for that of the sentencing court. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Evans </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 1019, 1022 [190 Cal.Rptr. 633].) \u201c[I]n the absence of a clear showing that its sentencing decision was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>arbitrary or irrational, a trial court should be presumed to have acted to achieve legitimate sentencing objectives . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Giminez </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 68, 72 [120 Cal.Rptr. 577, 534 P.2d 65].)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Hetherington further contends the court violated California Rules of Court rule 441<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> by (1) using the same facts to impose the upper term on the principal count as to impose consecutive sentences (rule 441(c)), and (2) relying on an element of a crime to impose an upper term. (Rule 441(d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The court did not use the same facts to impose both the upper term and the consecutive sentences. In imposing the upper term on the principal count the court relied on the facts that Hetherington, as a day care center operator, occupied and took advantage of a position of trust, he demonstrated callous disregard of the ages and unsophistication of the children, the victims were particularly vulnerable and the three-year period of the crimes demonstrated scheming, careful planning and premeditation. Each of these factors is set out in rule 421.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To impose consecutive sentences the court relied on the separate and distinct nature of each act involving different victims and different times. (See post.) These factors are not the same as those the court relied on under rule 421 and consequently there was no dual use of facts. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Ratcliffe </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 808, 821-822 [177 Cal.Rptr. 627].)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">The court did not violate rule 441(d) by relying on an element of the crime to impose the upper term. The court stated: \u201cI also note that he demonstrated callous disregard to the ages and unsophistication of the victims, and I know that these are crimes perpetrated on children under the age of 14, which is a statutory definition of the crime, but these were particularly vulnerable people under the circumstances being taken to a child\u2014 of all places, to a child care home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">The supervision and control Hetherington exercised over his victim at the day care center provided a sufficient basis for the court\u2019s finding the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>of this age range offense was particularly vulnerable. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 1103, 1106-1107 [195 Cal.Rptr. 494].)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Hetherington also argues the court failed to state specific reasons for imposing consecutive sentences on the subordinate counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">In imposing a consecutive sentence for the first subordinate count the court stated: \u201cCount 79 is predominantly independent of Count 77, independent in its objective. It\u2019s a separate act, violence, separate victim, separate time, different time, different place, different act of violence. For that reason, I am ordering the term to be consecutive to the prior term.\u201d Each factor expressed by the court is contained in rule 425.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Hetherington additionally claims the court failed to articulate fully its reasons for imposing consecutive sentences on <em>each </em>subordinate count. A consecutive sentence was imposed on count 82 \u201cfor the same reasons outlined above [in count 79],\u201d on count 16 \u201cfor the exact reasons outlined above,\u201d on count 38 \u201cfor the reasons stated above\u201d and on count 42 \u201cfor the same reason as expressed just a while ago.\u201d The court, however, failed to state reasons for imposing consecutive sentences on counts 70 and 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Obviously, the court\u2019s statement of reasons for counts 82, 16, 38 and 42 is less complete than for count 79. Under the circumstances of this case, however, the court\u2019s failure to formally repeat reasons for counts 82, 16, 38 and 42 does not require remand. For purposes of appellate review, the record sufficiently reveals the reasons the court relied on for imposing the four consecutive sentences on those counts after imposing the first consecutive sentence on count 79. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Powell </em>(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 513, 519 [161 Cal.Rptr. 803].)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Hetherington finally asserts the court\u2019s use of the same facts as a basis for more than one consecutive sentence was improper. However, \u201c[n]othing in the statute or rules precludes the sentencing court from using the same fact(s) as a basis for more than one consecutive sentence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bejarano </em>(1981) 114 Cal.App.3d 693, 705 [173 Cal.Rptr. 71].) Moreover, <em>Bejarano </em>aside, even though the court mentioned the same <em>factors, </em>it actually relied on different facts in imposing consecutive sentences on counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>79, 82, 16, 38 and 42 because each of those counts involved criminal conduct with a different victim at a different time. The court also articulated its reasons in a manner which enables this court to review each sentence for uniformity under the determinate sentencing law. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 436, 449 [172 Cal.Rptr. 652].)</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">As sympathetic as we are to the burden imposed on sentencing courts by the complexity of the sentencing rules, we cannot overlook the court\u2019s failure to state reasons for imposing consecutive sentences on counts 70 and 81. We cannot assume harmless error by speculating on the probability the court will impose the same sentences on remand. The court\u2019s omission requires a remand for resentencing on counts 70 and 81. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Edwards, supra, </em>117 Cal.App.3d at p. 450.)</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">The judgment is affirmed.
