J.</author>\n<p id=\"AO\">Petitioner John J. Morehouse seeks review of the order of respondent Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board) denying reconsideration of the findings and order of the workers\u2019 compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>judge disallowing benefits to Morehouse for alleged discriminatory acts by respondent Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (Goodyear) under Labor Code section 132a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As we shall explain, petitioner is entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Petitioner Morehouse was employed by Goodyear for more than 33 years, commencing July 11, 1946. From 1948 until February 18, 1980, he was employed in the Los Angeles plant as a checker stock clerk. His duties included loading and unloading tires from boxcars. Intermittently throughout his employment, he was an officer, including service as the president, of the union representing Goodyear employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">On January 20, 1978, he fell and injured himself while unloading tires. He claimed and received compensation benefits, including disability benefits. On April 20, 1978, he returned to work and continued working until February 18, 1980, when Goodyear closed the Los Angeles plant and \u201claid him off.\u201d Morehouse requested preferential rehiring and was subject to recall if Goodyear reopened its Los Angeles plant. He also received periodic payments from Goodyear of supplemental unemployment benefits, remained in contact with Goodyear regarding potential job openings, and did not obtain employment elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In February 1981 Morehouse filed an application for reemployment as a warehouseman in Goodyear\u2019s Los Angeles warehouse. Goodyear\u2019s foreman, Mr. Bunderson, indicated that Morehouse would be reemployed. On July 23, 1981, Bunderson telephoned Morehouse and said that if he was ready, he could go to work. In response to Bunderson\u2019s inquiry regarding Morehouse\u2019s back and knee, Morehouse said they were as good as when he was laid off. Bunderson said, \u201cWell, great. Come down tomorrow morning and [we] will send you over to the doctor and you can go to work Friday evening.\u201d However, later that afternoon, Bunderson telephoned again and said he had changed his mind, and Morehouse would have to be interviewed by Mr. Konnecke, Goodyear\u2019s western zone manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">At the ensuing interview on July 29, 1981, Konnecke told Morehouse that Goodyear could not rehire him because he had the industrial injury claim against Goodyear and it was against company policy to hire anyone who had such a claim. There was also evidence that Goodyear would not rehire him because of his past union activities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Goodyear also cancelled a sched<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>uled physical examination which had been set to determine whether petitioner had the ability to perform the job for which he was applying.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">On August 12, 1981, Morehouse signed a \u201cCompromise Agreement and Release\u201d (WCAB Form 15) settling his injury claim for $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The compromise agreement includes recitals that on January 20, 1978, Morehouse sustained injury to his back and leg in the course of his employment by Goodyear; his present disability is still in dispute; he has not returned to work; and the parties \u201cagree to settle any and all claims on account of said injury by the payment of the sum of $25,000.00,\u201d and request that the compromise agreement be approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Under the subheading, \u201cReasons For Compromise,\u201d the agreement provides: \u201cThere exists between the parties a dispute as to permanent disability, apportionment, injury as to parts of body and need for medical care.\u201d The agreement contains no reference to a Labor Code section 132a claim for discrimination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Paragraph 11 of the agreement sets forth the standard form 15, paragraph 11, as follows: \u201cUpon approval of this Compromise Agreement by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board or a Referee, and payment in accordance with the provisions hereof, said employee releases and forever discharges said employer and insurance carrier from all claims and causes of action, whether now known or ascertained, or which may hereafter arise or develop as a result of said injury, including any and all liability of said employer and said insurance carrier and each of them to the dependents, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>heirs, executors, representatives, administrators or assigns of said employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">On August 25, 1981, a board referee issued an order approving the compromise agreement. Pursuant thereto, Morehouse received $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">On June 22, 1982, Morehouse filed a petition for benefits for discrimination, pursuant to section 132a.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) concluded that the evidence clearly established an act of discrimination by Goodyear on the \u201cdual motives\u201d of barring reemployment of Morehouse because of his industrial injury claim and prior union activities. However, he further concluded that Morehouse was not an employee within the meaning of section 132a when the act of discrimination occurred and therefore was not entitled to any benefits under that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">On reconsideration, the Board acknowledged that the WCJ had found that the evidence established a discriminatory act by respondent Goodyear. Nevertheless, the Board concluded that the compromise agreement settled any section 132a claim which Morehouse may have had. The Board quoted paragraph 11 of the agreement and stated: \u201cPursuant to the above-quoted provisions [paragraph 11] of the Compromise and Release Agreement, applicant agreed to settle all claims arising from the industrial injury herein. The alleged discriminatory act occurred before the Compromise and Release Agreement was approved. Thus, the claim of Labor Code Section 132a discrimination was settled by the Compromise and Release Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">We find that the workers\u2019 compensation judge erred in determining that Morehouse was not an employee within the meaning of section 132a when Goodyear\u2019s discriminatory act occurred, and that the Board erred in determining that the compromise agreement settled Morehouse\u2019s section 132a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">We first note that, viewed in the light of the entire record, the evidence indisputably established that Goodyear engaged in a discriminatory act within the meaning of section 132a by refusing to rehire on the grounds of Morehouse\u2019s industrial injury claim against the company and his union activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">Thus, we turn to the question whether Morehouse was an employee within the meaning of section 132a when Goodyear\u2019s discriminatory act occurred, bearing in mind the declared policy that section 132a must be construed liberally with the purpose of extending its benefits for protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>of the injured person. (\u00a7 3202; <em>Judson Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 658, 668 [150 Cal.Rptr. 250, 586 P.2d 564]; see <em>Braewood Convalescent Hospital </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 159, 168 [193 Cal.Rptr. 157, 666 P.2d 14].)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Section 132a applies to <em>\u201cAny </em>employer who discharges, or threatens to discharge, or <em>in any manner discriminates </em>against <em>any </em>employee . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Here, Goodyear\u2019s discriminatory act occurred in the process of reemploying someone who had worked for them for 33 years, who at that time was on \u201claid off\u201d status, was subject to recall by Goodyear, was receiving supplemental unemployment benefits from Goodyear, remained in contact with Goodyear regarding reemployment, was not employed elsewhere, and was qualified for the open position. In light of these circumstances and recognizing that section 132a must be liberally construed to protect the injured worker, we find that Morehouse was an employee within the meaning of section 132a when the discriminatory act occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Once a prima facie case of employer discrimination has been established, the employer has the burden of producing evidence to show that the applicant for an open position was unqualified or that a position was no longer available. <em>(See Judson Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 658, 667; <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Southern California Rapid Transit District </em>(1983) 48 Cal.Comp.Cases 418.)  Here, the record indicates respondent Goodyear did not sustain its burden of producing evidence that petitioner was unqualified or that a position was no longer available.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Proceeding to the issue whether the Board erroneously concluded that the compromise agreement settled Morehouse\u2019s section 132a claim, we note that, in addition to the declared policy regarding section 132a claims <em>(Judson Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 658 at p. 668), the Supreme Court has repeatedly expressed strong criticism of the Board\u2019s form 15 compromise and release form, and, in particular, par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>agraph 11 thereof. <em>(Sumner </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 965, 967, 969-970, 972-974 [191 Cal.Rptr. 811, 663 P.2d 534].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">In <em>Sumner, </em>the Supreme Court reiterated its mandate in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 964 [88 Cal.Rptr. 202, 471 P.2d 1002], that the Board devise a form for compromise and release which \u201c. . . \u2018(1) notifies the applicant of the consequences of the release in clear and non-technical language, and (2) does not compel the release of death benefits when the parties and the referee lack sufficient information to weigh the desirability of releasing these benefits and the adequacy of the compensatory consideration.\u2019\u201d <em>(Sumner </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>33 Cal.3d 965, 967.)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In <em>Sumner, </em>the injured employee signed a form 15 compromise and release settling his industrial injury disability claim for $25,000. There was no specific reference in the agreement to claims for death benefits by the employee\u2019s dependents in the event the employee died. The form 15 agreement included the standard paragraph 11. The Supreme Court noted the workers\u2019 compensation judge\u2019s criticism of the meaning of paragraph 11 when read by a layman, or even by attorneys (33 Cal.3d at p. 969), and stated: \u201c. . . \u2018Although paragraph 11 of that form by logical import releases death benefits, it does not expressly refer to them, and a layman executing that form might be unaware of the fact that he was releasing any claim of his spouse or children to such benefits.\u2019 \u201d (Id., p. 971.)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The court in <em>Sumner </em>stated further that after the applicant executes a release on form 15, the referee must independently determine whether to approve it, and, in so doing, may need to inquire into the consideration given for the release of death benefits. The court noted, however, that the evidence before the referee at that time would not usually be sufficient to resolve the consideration issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">In the instant case, the Board expressly relied on paragraph 11 of form 15 in concluding that the compromise agreement settled Morehouse\u2019s section 132a claim. Yet, neither paragraph 11 nor any provision in the agreement specifically referred to the section 132a claim. To the contrary, it merely referred to the July 20, 1978, claim for industrial injury to More-house\u2019s back and leg, and provided that his present disability from that injury was \u201cstill in dispute,\u201d that the parties desired to settle all claims on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>account of \u201csaid injury,\u201d and that the reason for the compromise is that \u201c[t]here exists between the parties a dispute as to permanent disability, apportionment, injury as to parts of body and need for medical care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Moreover, the record does not indicate that the section 132a issue, or any evidence relating to consideration given for release of the section 132a claim, was before the referee on August 25, 1981, when he made his independent determination approving the agreement. It should also be noted that in workers\u2019 compensation practice, a petition for discrimination benefits under section 132a is procedurally separate and distinct from an application for ordinary benefits. (\u00a7 132a; Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 8, ch. 4.5, \u00a7 10447; <em>see Ray </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1956) 146 Cal.App.2d 393, 397 [303 P.2d 793],)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">We conclude that petitioner Morehouse has a valid claim against respondent Goodyear under section 132a.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The order of respondent Board denying reconsideration, and the order and findings of the workers\u2019 compensation judge on petitioner\u2019s claim for benefits under section 132a are annulled. The matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Ashby, J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied May 8, 1984.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-8\">All further section references herein will be to the Labor Code unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\">In Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge Daraban\u2019s opinion on decision dated March 8, 1983, he stated: \u201cThe second and perhaps dominate motive was the fact that Goodyear would not rehire Mr. Morehouse because of his prior union activities <em>as candidly admitted by Mr. Konnecke.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Section 132a provides: \u201cIt is the declared policy of this state that there should not be discrimination against workers who are injured in the course and scope of their employment.

There, employee Brazz sustained industrial injury while employed by the city, returned to work, then voluntarily resigned and took a similar job with a water company. Subsequently, Mr. Love, a city representative, telephoned the water company manager, stated that Brazz had been an unsatisfactory employee, and suggested that the water company discharge him. The water company rejected the suggestion, and did not discharge Brazz. Thus, as the court noted (124 Cal.App.3d at p. 612), Brazz \u201csuffered no loss of employment or other adverse consequence as a result of what Mr. Love had said.\u201d To the contrary, in the instant case Goodyear\u2019s discriminatory act directly resulted in adverse consequences to Morehouse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The Board uses form 15 \u201cas a mandatory form for compromise and release of disability claims.\u201d <em>(Sumner </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp.
