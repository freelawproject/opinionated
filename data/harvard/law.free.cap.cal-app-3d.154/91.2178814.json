Vorys is located in Ohio; Ryans are California residents and a California partnership. Ryans signed a written agreement for the purchase of Witroska from Halsted Arabians, an Ohio business. Ryans delivered its check for $42,500 to Halsted in Ohio and were to receive Witroska later, in Kentucky. Neil Chur, a third party, filed suit against Halsted in Ohio, claiming he had purchased Witroska from Halsted before the agreement between Halsted and Ryans. Halsted had refused to deliver title or possession of Witroska to Chur.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Ryans\u2019 California attorney arranged for Vorys to intervene in the Ohio lawsuit, to protect Ryans\u2019 claim to Witroska. Ryans became dissatisfied with Vorys over the fee it charged Ryans for making an unsuccessful motion. Maurice and Jeffrey Ryan went to Ohio and negotiated a settlement of the lawsuit, but felt the settlement papers prepared by Vorys were defective. Ryans refused to pay Vorys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Vorys filed an action in Ohio for payment of its fees. Ryans failed to appear and the Ohio court rendered a default judgment for Vorys. Vorys subsequently obtained a \u201csister state judgment\u201d in Contra Costa County Superior Court. Ryans moved to vacate this judgment contending the Ohio court lacked personal jurisdiction to render the original judgment. Ryans appeals from the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to vacate. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">A defendant in an action to enforce a foreign judgment is permitted to show \u201cthat the foreign judgment is in excess of jurisdiction,\u201d except when the jurisdiction issue was expressly litigated in the foreign state. <em>(Craig </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 675, 680 [119 Cal.Rptr. 692].) Vorys won a default judgment without the Ohio court ever hearing a challenge to its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Ohio\u2019s long-arm statute allows service of process on a nonresident \u201cwho, acting directly or by an agent, has caused an event to occur out of which the claim which is the subject of the complaint arose, from the person\u2019s: (1) Transacting any business in this state. ...\u201d (Ohio Civil Rule 4.3(A) (amended eff. July 1, 1980).) California\u2019s long-arm statute contemplates a similar exercise of jurisdiction. (See the Judicial Council Comments to Code of Civil Procedure section 410.10.) Courts have interpreted subsection (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>of the Ohio statute as extending personal jurisdiction to its constitutional limits. <em>(Welsh </em>v. <em>Gibbs </em>(6th Cir. 1980) 631 F.2d 436, 439; <em>In-Flight Devices Corp. </em>v. <em>Van Dusen Air, Inc. </em>(6th Cir. 1972) 466 F.2d 220, 225.) (2) The federal constitutional standard for a state to exercise personal jurisdiction over a party is that the party must have \u201ccertain minimum contacts with [the state] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>(International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1945) 326 U.S. 310; 316-317 [90 L.Ed. 95, 102, 66 S.Ct. 154, 161 A.L.R. 1057]; see <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 338, 345-346 [316 P.2d 960].)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">A three-part test has been used to determine when a defendant has \u201cminimum contacts\u201d with a forum state. \u201cFirst, the defendant must purposefully avail himself of the privilege of acting in the forum state or causing a consequence in the forum state. Second, the cause of action must arise from the defendant\u2019s activities there. Finally, the acts of the defendant or consequences caused by the defendant must have a substantial enough connection with the forum state to make the exercise of jurisdiction over the defendant reasonable.\u201d <em>(Pickens </em>v. <em>Hess </em>(6th Cir. 1978) 573 F.2d 380, 385; see also <em>Buckeye Boiler Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 893, 898-899 [80 Cal.Rptr. 113, 458 P.2d 57].)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Ryans clearly availed itself of the privilege of acting in Ohio. Its intervention in the lawsuit between Chur and Halsted Arabians was voluntary; it was not legally compelled to appear in Ohio. It hired an Ohio law firm to do legal work in Ohio. This work was done at Ryans\u2019 request and for its benefit. The participation of Ryans and Vorys in settlement negotiations in Ohio further supports the conclusion that the Ryan Group was transacting business there.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">To justify personal jurisdiction, a plaintiff need not show multiple transactions by defendant within a forum state; a single transaction of business within the state may constitute sufficient contact. (See <em>Didactics Corporation </em>v. <em>Welch Scientific Company </em>(N.D. Ohio 1968) 291 F.Supp. 890, 894-895; <em>Henry R. Jahn &amp; Son </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1958) 49 Cal.2d 855, 861 [323 P.2d 437]; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Detroit Lions, Inc. </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 472, 475 [108 Cal.Rptr. 23].)  Ryans\u2019 contract for legal services was sufficiently connected with Ohio so that Ohio\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction was reasonable. <em>(McGee </em>v. <em>International Life Ins. Co. </em>(1957) 355 U.S. 220, 223 [2 L.Ed.2d 223, 226, 78 S.Ct. 199].)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">No California case has considered whether retaining an attorney in another state gives that state personal jurisdiction in subsequent disputes over attorneys\u2019 fees. Most reported cases from other states uphold the exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>of personal jurisdiction. (See <em>Mouzavires </em>v. <em>Baxter </em>(D.C. 1981) 434 A.2d 988; <em>Elman </em>v. <em>Belson </em>(1969) 32 App.Div.2d 422 [302 N.Y.S.2d 961]; M<em>ayer </em>v. <em>Goldhaber </em>(1969) 63 Misc.2d 605 [313 N.Y.S.2d 87]; <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Lanpar Co. </em>(Tex. 1966) 399 S.W.2d 340; <em>Toulouse </em>v. <em>Swanson </em>(1968) 73 Wn.2d 331 [438 P.2d 578]; but see <em>Winick </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1966) 49 Misc.2d 1009 [268 N.Y.S.2d 768].) We reach the same conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Ryans also contend that Ohio\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over this case is constitutionally unreasonable because Ohio does not provide for mandatory arbitration of attorneys\u2019 fees disputes as does California. (See Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6200 et seq.) Although California considers arbitration a superior method of resolving attorneys\u2019 fees disputes, its unavailability in Ohio does not \u201coffend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d <em>(International Shoe Co., supra, 326 </em>U.S. at p. 316 [90 L.Ed. at p. 102].) Even if this action had been brought originally in California, arbitration of fee disputes is not applicable to attorneys from other states who maintain no office here and rendered no material services in California. (See Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6200, subd. (a)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to vacate the entry of the sister state judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Low, P.
