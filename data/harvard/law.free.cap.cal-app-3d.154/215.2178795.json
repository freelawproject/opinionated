Code, \u00a7 995)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> charging him with possession of cocaine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350), possession of cocaine for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11351) and possession of marijuana for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11359). The sole issue presented is whether the trial court properly remanded the instant felony prosecution to the committing magistrate to correct minor errors pursuant to newly enacted section 995a, subdivision (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Police executed a search warrant on petitioner\u2019s home, the fruits of which formed the entire basis for the charges alleged in both a complaint and subsequent information. In the affidavit in support of the warrant, a police officer described a number of drug purchases alleged to have been made between a confidential informant (designated FM-210) and petitioner. The affidavit further contained a description of a \u201ccontrolled buy\u201d made while the police watched petitioner\u2019s home. They saw the informant, who had been searched and provided with marked money, enter the home and later exit with cocaine sans money. The affidavit alleged the informant was reliable based upon the controlled purchase, the informant\u2019s long, personal history of drug use,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the allegation he had voluntarily sought out the police seeking to assist them in making drug arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">At the hearing on a motion to traverse and quash the search warrant held prior to petitioner\u2019s preliminary examination, the only contested issue was whether the affidavit contained all information possessed by the police on the credibility of the informant. Specifically, petitioner argued anyone with such extensive drug involvement had to have criminal arrests and convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>tions, and if the police recklessly or intentionally omitted this information from the affidavit, the warrant as a matter of law had to be quashed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cobb </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 290 [194 Cal.Rptr. 96].) Petitioner asked three questions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but the magistrate sustained relevancy objections to each one. Petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress was denied and he was held to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">In superior court, petitioner sought to have the information set aside (\u00a7 995).  The trial court properly held the evidentiary objections should have been overruled. Although real party in interest persists in arguing the questions would have elicited wholly irrelevant information, it has been consistently held the criminal background and present circumstances bearing upon an informant\u2019s credibility are relevant areas of inquiry. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kurland </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 376 [168 Cal.Rptr. 667, 618 P.2d 213]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cobb, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.3d 290; <em>In re Larry C. </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 62 [184 Cal.Rptr. 505]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 512 [180 Cal.Rptr. 368].) Further, petitioner\u2019s concession to the magistrate that juvenile convictions are inadmissible for purposes of impeachment was unnecessary. The United States Supreme Court long ago held to the contrary. <em>(Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska </em>(1974) 415 U.S. 308 [39 L.Ed.2d 347, 94 S.Ct. 1105].)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The superior court additionally found the restriction of cross-examination denied petitioner a substantial right. <em>(Jennings </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 867 [59 Cal.Rptr. 440, 428 P.2d 304].) The purpose of petitioner\u2019s line of questioning was to elicit whether the affiant was in possession of information bearing upon the informant\u2019s credibility and not disclosed in the affidavit. Whether the magistrate, trial court, or appellate court ultimately utilizes a <em>Kurland </em>standard <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kurland, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d 376 [reckless or intentional omission of such information requires quashing the search warrant]) or the federal approach <em>(Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware </em>(1978) 438 U.S. 154 [57 L.Ed.2d 667, 98 S.Ct. 2674] [adding and retesting the warrant])<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is academic. Since the magistrate precluded inquiry into what was clearly relevant cross-examination, petitioner was ultimately prevented from testing the search warrant. <em>(Cuevas </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 406 [130 Cal.Rptr. 238].)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Rather than set aside the information, however, the superior court concluded the error was minor and instituted procedures provided for in section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>995a, subdivision (b). When petitioner would not stipulate to the superior court \u201csit[ting] as magistrate,\u201d the matter was remanded to the committing magistrate. We stayed proceedings and issued an order to show cause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The Legislature amended section 995a to permit, on motion of the prosecutor,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the remand of a felony prosecution to the committing magistrate to correct minor errors of omission, ambiguity or technical defect in the commitment. The circumstances when section 995a may be utilized are further limited to instances where the error is expeditiously correctable without a substantial rehearing of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Historically, trial courts have been prohibited from remanding felony prosecutions to correct errors in the commitment. In <em>Burnett </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 865 [117 Cal.Rptr. 556, 528 P.2d 372], the Supreme Court ordered the trial court to rule on defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the information rather than remand errors in the commitment to the magistrate for correction. The court concluded section 997 did not authorize a remand to correct anything more than a procedural irregularity or inadvertency not encompassing a judicial act. <em>(Id.., </em>at pp. 872-873.) Under <em>Burnett, </em>a magistrate was no more empowered to correct post bind over judicial error than a trial court was authorized to correct post judgment judicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Whether section 995a, subdivision (b) is an attempt by the Legislature to codify <em>Burnett </em>or to nullify <em>Burnett </em>to permit correction of some species of judicial error is open to speculation. (See <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 622 [198 Cal.Rptr. 741].) Unfortunately, finding a bright line of demarcation to provide courts with guidelines in applying section 995a is an impossible task.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We therefore join those who came before us attempting to apply section 995a to particular facts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>We begin by identifying the type of error committed. As noted, the magistrate, by sustaining relevancy objections to questions designed to test the integrity of the search warrant, effectively denied petitioner the right to seek suppression of evidence at the preliminary examination. The error was not \u201cof ambiguity\u201d; the actions of the magistrate were clear and unequivocal. Similarly, the error was not \u201cof technical defect,\u201d as where the magistrate simply fails to sign the commitment order (\u00a7 872). The issue narrows to whether the magistrate\u2019s evidentiary ruling is a minor <em>omission.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">In <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>151 Cal.App.3d 622,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the magistrate improperly sustained a hearsay objection to the testimony of a police officer who was asked to describe a radio broadcast supplying probable cause for arrest. The effect of the erroneous ruling and the magistrate\u2019s subsequent denial of Butler\u2019s motion to suppress was to violate the Harvey-Madden requirement the informant or dispatcher testify to the facts supplying probable cause. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Madden </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 1017 [88 Cal.Rptr. 171, 471 P.2d 971].) The trial court, on a motion to set aside the information (\u00a7 995), remanded to the committing magistrate to either permit the answer or allow additional testimony. In denying a writ of mandate, the appellate court held the magistrate\u2019s erroneous evidentiary ruling was an omission, minor in nature and expeditiously curable.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">We cannot accept the notion an evidentiary ruling can be characterized as an omission, no matter how minor. The evidence excluded by the magistrate in <em>Butler </em>and in the instant proceeding <em>resulted </em>in the omission of critical<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> evidence, but the error itself was not \u201cof an omission\u201d as required by section 995a.  We must construe statutes according to their fair import, with a view to effect their objective and promote justice. (\u00a7 4; cf. <em>Carlos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 131 [197 Cal.Rptr. 79, 672 P.2d 862].)  An omission is the act of failing to include, of forgetting. (The American Heritage Diet. (College Ed. 1982) p. 867.) The errors in <em>Butler </em>and the instant proceeding are anything but omissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The magistrate\u2019s erroneous evidentiary ruling was the direct result of the prosecutor\u2019s attempt to limit inquiry into the affiant\u2019s knowledge regarding the informant\u2019s background. The prosecutor, for reasons we are not privy to, purposely objected to the admission of relevant information. The magistrate in turn excluded the evidence. Without question, the error was the result of volitional decisions, unequivocal in nature. Since the error does not satisfy the \u201cof omission\u201d requirement of section 995a, subdivision (b), a remand to the committing magistrate is therefore not authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>The alternative writ is discharged.

The court may remand the cause to the committing magistrate for further proceedings, or if the parties and the court agree, the court may itself sit as a magistrate and conduct further proceedings.
