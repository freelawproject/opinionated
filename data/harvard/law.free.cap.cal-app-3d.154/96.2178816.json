He was immediately placed on probation without the imposition of sentence. However, in accordance with a previously effected agreement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the court also purported to order that he spend the first six months of his probationary term in custody but with execution thereof \u201cstayed\u201d pending the receipt of future reports concerning his \u201cprogress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The objective of this \u201cprobation\u201d within \u201cprobation\u201d is obscure since a court is always free to require periodic reports if it so desires.  Furthermore, if a probationer fails to demonstrate proper rehabilitative efforts, the court may require him to spend appropriate periods in custody at any time during his original probationary term, or any extension thereof. In no event, however, may probation, once granted, be made more onerous without affording the probationer an opportunity to be heard. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vickers </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 451 [105 Cal.Rptr. 305, 503 P.2d 1313]; <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 471 [33 L.Ed.2d 484, 92 S.Ct. 2593].)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">It is true, of course, that temporary \u201cstays of execution\u201d to a date certain, i.e., stays that are essentially self-executing and not conditional upon a probationer\u2019s good conduct, are permissible and require no further hearing. Although not certain, it appears that the People, the probation department and the trial court may all have believed that this type of true \u201cstay\u201d could be enlarged to encompass indefinitely \u201csuspended punishments\u201d of the present variety. If so, they were in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Perhaps the principal reason an initial period of confinement is included in a probationary plan is the hope it will capture the recently convicted defendant\u2019s attention by affording him (1) a time to reflect upon his actions and their consequences before assuming his other probationary responsibilities, and (2) a mild foretaste of his future living conditions should he fail to mend his ways. However, when this hopefully \u201crehabilitative punishment\u201d is indefinitely postponed, it loses its meaning and purpose, simply blending into the potential sentence itself, a punishment that also remains undetermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">In the present instance, petitioner\u2019s probationary jail term was \u201cre-stayed\u201d from time to time for over two years. Then, upon receipt of a relatively unfavorable \u201cprogress report,\u201d although not one which recommended either the termination of probation or the \u201cexecution\u201d of the \u201cstayed\u201d term, the court, without according petitioner a hearing on the issue, announced, \u201cI don\u2019t think he has good conduct.\u201d It thereupon declared, \u201cThe stay is no longer stayed\u201d and ordered that \u201cprobation will terminate upon completion of that service of time.\u201d Under the terms of Penal Code sections 17, subdivision (b)(3), and 1203.4 such a conclusion could actually prove more onerous than a clear cut \u201crevocation\u201d of petitioner\u2019s probation followed by the imposition of a six-month misdemeanor sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>The court\u2019s order of October 21, 1983, is vacated and the cause remanded to the Los Angeles Superior Court in order that it may conduct a formal probation violation hearing if it deems it appropriate so to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Compton, Acting P. J., and Beach, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
