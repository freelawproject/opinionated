The issue presented is whether enhancement of an adult criminal offender\u2019s sentence based on prior juvenile adjudications of criminal misconduct is permissible. We find it is not and shall modify defendant\u2019s sentence accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">A jury convicted defendant of burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459), robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211), and assault (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)), with findings he was armed with a pistol and personally inflicted great bodily injury on the victim as to both the robbery and the assault. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12022, 12022.7.) The trial court imposed the upper term of five years for the robbery and a consecutive term of three years for the great bodily injury enhancement. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 213, 12022.7.) A concurrent term of one year was imposed for the firearm enhancement. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.) Execution of sentence on the burglary and assault counts was stayed pursuant to Penal Code section 654 and the weapon and great bodily injury findings as to the assault were ordered stricken. Defendant admitted he had suffered two prior juvenile adjudications of burglary of a residence and, purportedly, pursuant to article I, section 28, subdivision (f) of the California Constitution and Penal Code section 667, subdivision (a), the trial court imposed a five-year enhancement for each prior juvenile adjudication. The total unstayed term of imprisonment was 18 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Defendant urges the imposition of enhancements for the prior juvenile adjudications was improper and asserts insufficiency of the evidence to support the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">On July 10, 1982, the victim, 64-year-old Arnold Lommen was working in his front yard. He observed defendant and another man on motorcycles at a stop sign in front of his house. As they started to leave, the chain on defendant\u2019s motorcycle broke. Lommen approached them and offered assistance. The men entered Lommen\u2019s residence and defendant used the telephone. The two men then left on the other motorcycle to obtain some repair links. They returned shortly, borrowed some tools from Lommen, and repaired the chain. As they left, the men thanked Lommen and said \u201c \u2018One of these days we\u2019re going to come back and we\u2019re going to pay you for this.\u2019\u201d The words were prophetic but the payment hardly appropriate for Samaritan acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>About a week later, on July 18th, defendant and his companion knocked on Lommen\u2019s door and were invited in by Lommen. The three conversed in the kitchen area for 10 to 15 minutes and then walked to the living room where Lommen and defendant\u2019s friend began discussing an antique telephone on the wall. Lommen was then struck down from behind. When he came to, he was bound hand and foot. He was lying face down and one of the men was holding a gun to his head. The men demanded money and threatened to shoot him. Lommen told them about what money he had. He was then beaten unconscious. It was eventually determined that Lommen\u2019s truck, a tape deck, some firearms, several musical instruments and other miscellaneous items had been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The defense was alibi. Defendant conceded he had been to the victim\u2019s home on July 10th. On July 18th, however, according to the testimony of Mrs. Higby, a friend and neighbor of defendant\u2019s mother, defendant spent the entire afternoon at a picnic with her family at Folsom Lake. Defendant also testified he spent the entire day at the picnic and did not return to Mr. Lommen\u2019s on the 18th.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Defendant initially contends the evidence is insufficient to sustain his convictions because the victim\u2019s identification was based on suggestive pretrial photographic lineups and was unreliable. Further, the trial identification was discredited when the victim also identified a photograph of defendant\u2019s companion, Terry Poore, as defendant. As there was no physical evidence linking him with the robbery, defendant concludes the questionable identification evidence is insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdicts. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">\u201cA conviction based on eyewitness identification at trial after a pretrial display of photographs, including photographs of the defendant, \u2018will be set aside . . . only if the photographic identification procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hunt </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 888, 894 [140 Cal.Rptr. 651, 568 P.2d 376], citing <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 377, 384 [19 L.Ed.2d 1247, 1253, 88 S.Ct. 967].) In making this determination, several factors are pertinent: the opportunity of the witness to view the defendant at the time of the crime; the witness\u2019 degree of attention; the accuracy of the witness\u2019 prior description of the defendant; the level of uncertainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation; and the length of time between the crime and the confrontation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Savala </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 41, 49 [171 Cal.Rptr. 882].)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>The photographic lineups in the instant case were shown to the victim on July 27, 1982, and August 4, 1982, nine months and fourteen days after the incident. On each occasion he identified the defendant without hesitation. On July 10th and 18th the victim had ample time to view the defendant. The victim\u2019s degree of attention was undoubtedly high on these occasions as he had invited the defendant into his home. Defendant concedes the victim identified defendant as his assailant at both the preliminary hearing and at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Against this consistent positive identification, defendant urges the black and white photographic lineup was suggestive because defendant\u2019s face was turned a different direction than the others and the color photographic lineup was suggestive because defendant\u2019s picture had a \u201cyellow cast.\u201d We have examined these exhibits, and conclude they are not impermissibly suggestive. The black and white lineup contains a full face and profile picture of each person. While defendant\u2019s profile is facing the opposite direction from the other five pictures, the point of concern to the witness is the person\u2019s features, not the direction he is facing. In the color lineup, the fact defendant\u2019s face has a \u201cyellow cast\u201d is unimpressive as photograph number six has a distinctly \u201cred cast,\u201d number four has an \u201corange cast,\u201d and others have differing color characteristics. The minor variations in these photographic lineups do not render them unduly suggestive. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Guillebeau </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 531, 557 [166 Cal.Rptr. 45] [defendant\u2019s picture \u201cdarker-complected\u201d than the others]; <em>In re Charles B. </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 541, 545 [166 Cal.Rptr. 729] [defendant is the only one shown wearing a bandana on his head]; <em>People </em>v. <em>De Angelis </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 837, 841 [159 Cal.Rptr. 111] [defendant\u2019s picture has \u201cincreased depth of shading and sharpness of detail\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">While conceding \u201cthese procedures may not have been overly suggestive in and of themselves,\u201d defendant urges the victim\u2019s misidentification at trial of photographs of other persons as defendant reveals his confusion. The People concede the victim identified a photograph of Terry Poore as defendant. It further appears that at trial the victim identified a photograph of one Gary Holt, Terry Poore\u2019s brother, as defendant. Examination of Poore\u2019s photograph, which the victim identified as defendant, discloses Poore was wearing a hat in the picture; the victim identified Poore as being partially bald. Poore\u2019s face in the picture appears similar to that of defendant as depicted in the black and white photo lineup. The picture of Poore\u2019s brother, who is hatless and not bald, also looks similar to the black and white photograph of defendant. Though the victim exhibited some confusion as to single photographs of other persons which appeared similar to defendant\u2019s photograph, he correctly picked defendant out of two photographic lineups and twice identified him in person as his assailant.  Viewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>this evidence in the light most favorable to the People, it was reasonable for the jury to view the misidentifications as understandable based on the quality of the individual photographs and to credit the in-person and lineup identifications as reliable. The reliability of the in-court identification was corroborated by defendant\u2019s statements shortly after arrest that he knew where the stolen goods had been sold, and when asked about the whereabouts of Mr. Poore, stated \u201cI\u2019ll take this ship to sea alone.\u201d Presuming in support of the judgment every fact the jury could reasonably deduce from the evidence <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 576 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738, 16 A.L.R.4th 1255]), we conclude there is substantial evidence in support of defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Defendant contends he was improperly sentenced for two prior serious felony convictions pursuant to Penal Code section 667, subdivision (a). That subdivision provides in part: \u201cAny person convicted of a serious felony who previously has been convicted of a serious felony in this state . . . shall receive, in addition to the sentence imposed by the court for the present offense, a five-year enhancement for each such prior conviction on charges brought and tried separately. The terms of the present offense and each enhancement shall run consecutively.\u201d Defendant\u2019s attack is threefold: (1) Notwithstanding the mandatory language of subdivision (a) of section 667, the trial court has the discretionary power to strike such an enhancement pursuant to Penal Code section 1385;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) if the imposition of enhancements pursuant to Penal Code section 667, subdivision (a) is indeed mandatory, it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment; and (3) because defendant\u2019s prior juvenile adjudications are not \u201cfelony convictions\u201d they are not within the purview of Penal Code section 667, subdivision (a). We conclude the last contention is dispositive of the issue and requires that we strike the imposition of the enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Section 667 was added to the Penal Code as part of Proposition 8 at the June 8, 1982, primary election.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The voters also added article I, section 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>to the state Constitution (the \u201cVictim\u2019s Bill of Rights\u201d) at that time. Subdivision (f) of article I, section 28 provides in relevant part: \u201cAny prior felony conviction of any person in any criminal proceeding, <em>whether adult or juvenile, </em>shall subsequently be used without limitation for purposes of . . . enhancement of sentence in any criminal proceeding.\u201d (Italics added.) The People contend this language is clear and mandatory.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They urge the reference in article I, section 28, subdivision (f) to <em>juvenile </em>\u201cconvictions\u201d can refer to nothing other than wardship adjudications under Welfare and Institutions Code section 602.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since such \u201cjuvenile convictions\u201d are to be used without limitation for purposes of enhancement, it is urged, it was proper for the trial court to impose the two 5-year enhancements for defendant\u2019s prior juvenile adjudications.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">As was recently stated in <em>In re Joseph B. </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 952, 955 [196 Cal.Rptr. 348, 671 P.2d 852], \u201cminors charged with violations of the Juvenile Court Law are not \u2018defendants.\u2019 They do not \u2018plead guilty,\u2019 but admit the allegations of a petition. Moreover, \u2018adjudications of juvenile wrongdoing are not \u201ccriminal convictions.\u2019\u201d [Citation.] As section 203 [of the Welf. &amp; Inst. Code] states, \u2018[a]n order adjudging a minor to be a ward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>of the juvenile court shall not be deemed a conviction of a crime for any purpose, nor shall a proceeding in the juvenile court be deemed a criminal proceeding. \u2019 \u201d  A distinction is made between criminal convictions and juvenile adjudications because of the fundamentally different purposes the two bodies of law are designed to serve. \u201cJuvenile court proceedings are designed for the <em>rehabilitation of minors and not </em>punishment. \u201d <em>(In re Dennis J. </em>(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 755, 762 [140 Cal.Rptr. 463].) (Italics added.) The purpose of such proceedings goes beyond the mere protection of the public from crime. The proceedings are intended to secure for the minor such care and guidance as will best serve the interests of the minor and the state, and to impose upon the minor a sense of responsibility for his own acts. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 202.) The purpose of imprisonment pursuant to the criminal law, on the other hand, is <em>punishment. </em>(Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170, subd. (a).) There are numerous procedural differences between a juvenile proceeding and a criminal proceeding, most notably in the area of due process (e.g., right to a jury trial). (See <em>In re Joseph H. </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 627, 631 [159 Cal.Rptr. 681].)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">If we read article I, section 28 of subdivision (f) in the manner the People urge, we are compelled to conclude this subdivision works an implied repeal of Welfare and Institutions Code section 203.  Such repeals by implication are not favored and are recognized only when there is no rational basis for harmonizing two potentially conflicting laws. <em>(Fuentes </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 1, 7 [128 Cal.Rptr. 673, 547 P.2d 449].)  The fallacy of the People\u2019s argument is that it assumes there are no other \u201cconvictions\u201d or \u201ccriminal proceedings\u201d to which the word \u201cjuvenile\u201d could refer in subdivision (f) of article I, section 28, other than wardship proceedings under Welfare and Institutions Code section 602. The juvenile court is empowered to determine that a minor over the age of 16 is not a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the Juvenile Court Law. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707.) If such a finding of unfitness is made, the minor may be certified to a court of <em>criminal jurisdiction </em>and the district attorney acquires the authority to prosecute the juvenile according to the laws applicable to a criminal case. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707.1, subd. (a).) In this manner, a <em>juvenile </em>person may suffer a \u201cfelony conviction\u201d in a \u201ccriminal proceeding,\u201d and the use of the word \u201cjuvenile\u201d in article I, section 28, subdivision (f) is given meaning consistent with Welfare and Institutions Code section 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Moreover, we disagree that the intent of the electorate was to alter existing law and make juvenile adjudications \u201cconvictions\u201d for purposes of enhancement.  Where an enactment follows voter approval, as in this case, \u201cthe ballot summary and arguments and analysis presented to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>electorate in connection with a particular measure may be helpful in determining the probable meaning of uncertain language.\u201d <em>(Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 208, 245-246 [149 Cal.Rptr. 239, 583 P.2d 1281].) The analysis of the legislative analyst appended to Proposition 8 contains a discussion entitled: \u201cLonger Prison Terms.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Proposed Amends, to Cal. Const., with analysis by the legislative analyst, Primary Elec. (June 8, 1982) p. 54, hereafter referred to as Analysis.) The analysis first sets out existing law and states, \u201c[c]onvictions resulting in probation or commitment to the Youth Authority generally are not considered for the purpose of increasing sentences, ...\u201d (Analysis, at p. 54.) The analysis continues that under the new law, \u201cupon a second or subsequent conviction for one of these [specified] felonies, <em>the defendant </em>could receive, on top of his or her sentence, an additional five-year prison term for <em>each such prior conviction. . . . </em>Second, <em>any </em>prior felony <em>conviction </em>could be used without limitation in calculating longer prison terms.\u201d (Analysis, at pp. 54-55.) (Italics added.)  While it might be argued that \u201cconvictions resulting in . . . commitment to the Youth Authority\u201d was a reference to juvenile adjudications under Welfare and Institutions Code section 602, we must assume the legislative analyst was aware of existing law and was not so inartful as to include wardship adjudications under the incorrect heading of \u201cconvictions.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 203; see <em>Estate of McDill </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 831, 837 [122 Cal.Rptr. 754, 537 P.2d 874].) We therefore assume the analysis <em>correctly </em>states the then existing law that <em>adult </em>convictions, which result in commitment to the Youth Authority under Welfare and Institutions Code section 1731.5, which grants the trial court discretion to commit certain defendants between the ages of 18 and 21 to Youth Authority, may not be used to enhance a sentence under Penal Code section 667.5. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Redman </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 317, 323 [178 Cal.Rptr. 49], disapproved on another point in <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Mendella) (1983) 33 Cal.3d 754, 760, fn. 5 [191 Cal.Rptr. 1, 661 P.2d 1081].) The analysis then advises that such adult convictions <em>may </em>be used for enhancement purposes under article I, section 28, subdivision (f). The legislative analyst\u2019s analysis of Proposition 8 is particularly significant in that it specifically omits any mention of juvenile wardship adjudications and discusses only \u201cconvictions\u201d in connection with \u201cLonger Prison Terms.\u201d As we assume the legislative analyst was aware that juvenile adjudications are <em>not </em>convictions, we must also assume this omission was intentional. Accordingly, the only evidence of the intent of the electorate in this regard must be gleaned from this omission. The voters were <em>not </em>told that juvenile wardship adjudications would be considered \u201cconvictions\u201d for purposes of enhancement but were told the status of other prior <em>adult convictions </em>was being changed; we may therefore presume they did not intend to change the status of prior wardship adjudications under Welfare and Institutions Code section 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>We do not question the power of the electorate to require the imposition of a five-year enhancement onto a new conviction for each prior juvenile adjudication. But the question presented here is whether they have done so by the enactment of the constitutional provision \u201cAny prior felony conviction of any person in any criminal proceeding, whether adult or juvenile, shall subsequently be used without limitation for purposes of . . . enhancement of sentence . . . .\u201d (Art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (f).) To interpret the word \u201cjuvenile\u201d in article I, section 28, subdivision (f) as modifying either the words \u201cconviction\u201d or \u201ccriminal proceeding\" would require a drastic change in the law which was neither explained to the electorate nor apparent on the face of the enactment. Construing the provision in a manner consistent with existing law, the word \u201cjuvenile\u201d must modify \u201cperson,,\u201d so that article I, section 28, subdivision (f) permits the unlimited use of prior felony <em>convictions </em>for enhancement purposes, whether the person convicted was an adult or juvenile being tried as an adult at the time of the prior conviction. Moreover, the constitutional provision is merely an enabling enactment. It is the statutory enactment, Penal Code section 667, subdivision (a), which actually requires the imposition of an additional five-year term for \u201ceach such prior conviction. \u201d Penal Code section 667, subdivision (a) does not define \u201cprior conviction.\u201d Accordingly, we determine the defendant\u2019s prior juvenile adjudications were not \u201cprior conviction[s] \u201d within the meaning of Penal Code section 667, subdivision (a). The trial court erred in imposing the two five-year enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">The judgment is modified by striking therefrom the two 5-year enhancements imposed pursuant to Penal Code section 667, subdivision (a). As so modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Regan, Acting P.

The issue with an adult prior conviction was whether the language of subdivision (f) of section 28 was modified by subdivision (b) of section 28 to preserve the <em>Beagle </em>line of cases in determining if a prior <em>conviction </em>could be used for impeachment purposes.
