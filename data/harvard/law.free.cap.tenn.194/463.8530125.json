W. 229; <em>Troutman </em>v. <em>Crippen, </em>186 Tenn. 459, 212 S. W. (2d) 33; <em>Crewse </em>v. <em>Beeler, </em>186 Tenn. 475, 212 S. W. (2d) 39; <em>Donathan </em>v. <em>McMinn County, </em>187 Tenn. 220, 213 S. W. (2d) 173; <em>House </em>v. <em>Creveling, </em>147 Tenn. 589, 250 S. W. 357; <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Rhea County, </em>189 Tenn. 383, 225 S. W. (2d) 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">It is insisted that the Chancellor erred in holding that the County Manager is an employee rather than a county officer. We think that under the Act, the County Manager is an employee and therefore the provision for his appointment by the council does not violate Article XI, Sec. 17 of the Constitution, providing that a county officer shall be elected by the County Court or the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">It is further insisted that the Chancellor erred in holding that the caption of the Act does not embrace more than one subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The Act has only one subject and that is \u201cto reorganize the government and administration of Hamilton County\u201d. The other provisions in the Act are necessary to the accomplishment of the single purpose of the administration of Hamilton County. <em>Crewse </em>v. <em>Beeler, </em>supra; <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>152 Tenn. 258, 269, 277 S. W. 71; <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Rhea County, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">It is also insisted that the Act is invalid because it contravenes general statutes which provide a quarterly county court form of government for the remainder of the counties of the state by divesting rights and powers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>out of the county court. The purpose of the present Act is to change the agency to govern and administer the affairs of the county. Such change does not contravene any general statute. <em>Troutman </em>v. <em>Crippen, </em>186 Tenn. 459, 212 S. W. (2d) 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">We have considered all the assignments of error and find them without merit. The decree of the Chancellor is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
