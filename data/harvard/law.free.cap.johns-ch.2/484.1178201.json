Franklin, </em>to <em>Henry Franklin; </em>and that he state, on oath, to the master, the parts of the real estate conveyed by him, and to whom, and the time when, and the consideration for each parcel; and that he also state, on oath, the personal estate received by him from the above defendants, or from any other person, on their account; and that he account for the same; and that the *master report whether the said <em>Henry Franklin </em>had possessed himself, by assignment or otherwise, of the several judgments of <em>J. Mowatt </em>of <em>J. &amp;f N. Heard, </em>and of <em>W. Miller </em>and others, against <em>Franklin, Robinson &amp;/\u25a0 Co., </em>and whether he so possessed himself of the said judgments, as the agent of, and with the funds of <em>Robinson, Franklin </em>Sf Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-10\">In support of this motion, they cited 4 <em>Johns.

That if the decree was defective in this respect, it could not be corrected on motion, but there must be a rehearing; and even if the cause was now reheard the bill itself did not entitle the plaintiff to this relief, for he had not established any title to the real estate of <em>Abraham </em>and <em>John Franklin, </em>being only a judgment creditor, and the rent and profits belonged rather to their assignees.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b374-13\"> <em>Ante, </em>p. 283.

It is questionable whether the reference could be granted under the circumstances of this case, even upon a rehearing; but, without giving any opinion on that point, this motion must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
