That for the support of <em>Jemima, </em>and the poor of the society, she purchased, on the 5th of <em>January, </em>1792, certain lands, in the bill described, and paid the purchase money, and that, as a rule of the society forbade any estate being vested in her, she nominated one of her followers, by the name of <em>Sarah Richards, </em>to be her trustee, and the deed was taken in the name of the *said <em>Sarah, </em>without any expression of the trust in the deed. That <em>Sarah Richards </em>died on the 29th of <em>December, </em>1795, and by her will devised the lands in question to the plaintiff, and devised other property to her only child, <em>Eliza Richards. </em>That the said <em>Eliza, </em>afterwards left the society, and married the defendant, <em>Enoch Malin, </em>and owing to some alleged imperfection in the devise, the defendants lay claim to the lands in question, under the said <em>Eliza, </em>and have entered thereon. That the said <em>Jemima </em>is restrained by her profession and conscience from becoming a party to any suit or proceeding at law whatever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-12\">The defendants having ansxyered the bill, and issue being joined, and proof taken, the cause was brought on to a hearing.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-13\"><em>Gold, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-14\"><em>E.

The ease of <em>Kirk </em>v. <em>Clark (Prec. in Ch. </em>275.) is precisely to the point; and the same rule was declared in <em>Adams </em>v. <em>St. Ledger, </em>(1 <em>Ball &amp; Beatty, </em>181.) The cause must, therefore, go off, to the end that the <em>cestui que trust </em>be made a party. In the case of <em>Kirk </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>the objection was taken, as in this case, at the hearing, *and the chancellor ordered the bill, answer, and depositions to stand, and the next day the <em>cestui que trust </em>was made plaintiff, by her next friend. If <em>Jemima W. </em>has religious scruples which cannot be surmounted, and this shall be made to appear, either by affidavit or the report of a master, as may be directed, perhaps she may be permitted to become plaintiff by her <em>prochien amy. </em>A person incompetent to protect himself, from age, or weakness of mind, or from some religious delusion or fanaticism, <em>quern urget fanaticus error vel iracunda Diana, </em>ought to come under the protection of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">N. B. The counsel, afterwards, mutually consented that the name of <em>Jemima W. </em>should be added as a party plaintiff, and the cause, on the same day, proceeded to a hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
