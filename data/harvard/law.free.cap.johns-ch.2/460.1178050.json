He read an affidavit, stating that the plaintiffs commenced an action of ejectment at law, in 1809, against the defendant <em>Wynlcoof, </em>on which a verdict and judgment were obtained for the defendant <em>W. </em>That, in 1811, the plaintiffs commenced ejectments at law against the defendants <em>Dubois </em>and <em>Astor, </em>in each of which suits the plaintiffs were nonprossed. That the defendants became entitled to the costs of those suits, which have not been paid, and that the plaintiff <em>Demarest </em>was, and still is, insolvent. That the bill sets up some claim of title to certain portions of the land, under pretence of which the ejectments had been prosecuted. That the cause is at issue in this Court, and testimony taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b355-11\"><em>H.

In all other cases, if the two suits had not been in the same Court, yet they were in Courts of the same nature, and proceeding upon the same principles, and in the same mode. Thus, in <em>Melchart </em>v. <em>Halsey, </em>(3 <em>Wils. </em>149.) a suit in the C. B. was stayed, until the costs of a former suit in the K. B. were paid; and in <em>Holbrooke </em>v. <em>Cracraft, </em>(5 <em>Vesey, </em>706. note.) the Court of Chancery required the costs of a former bill between the same parties in the exchequer to be previously paid. The interference has, in no instance, been carried further. There is a great distinction between legal and equitable jurisdictions, as to the mode of proof, the mode of trial, and the nature of the relief. Such a change in the remedy does away the presumption of vexation. The party having tried the question at law, may apply to the defendant\u2019s conscience; and Lord <em>Eldon </em>says, it was never asserted, that a plaintiff must not bring an ejectment until he has filed a bill, and he thought it might be productive of mischief to apply the principle to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">On the strength of the reason and authority of thdt case, and in the absence of all practice and precedent to the contrary, I shall deny the motion, but without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
