That the defendant <em>Doty, </em>in 1815, gave the plaintiffs his note for 1,255 dollars, for other goods sold, and which note was due, and a balance thereon unpaid of 609 dollars and 18 cents. That <em>W. </em>and A. <em>Green </em>lately became endorsers of sundry notes for the defendants to 4.000 dollars, who, to secure them, in <em>February </em>last, executed to them a judgment bond for 4,000 dollars, on which a judgment was, at the time, entered. That the defendant <em>A. </em>then became endorser for <em>D., </em>on the notes aforesaid, and exonerated <em>W. </em>and <em>S. Green, </em>who assigned the judgment to the defendant <em>A. </em>That D., in <em>October </em>last, recommended the defendant <em>M. </em>to the plaintiffs for the purchase of goods, and <em>M. </em>purchased goods of the plaintiffs to 1,627 dollars and 9 cents,' on a credit of 6 months. That the notes endorsed by the defendant <em>A. </em>have been reduced to 1,800 dollars. That <em>M. </em>and <em>D. </em>are embarrassed, and <em>to defraud the plaintiffs, D., </em>in collusion with <em>A. </em>gave a judgment to <em>A. </em>for 15.000 dollars, in <em>March </em>last, and <em>M. </em>and <em>D., </em>in collusion with <em>A., </em>have jointly given a judgment to <em>A. </em>for 18,000 dollars, in <em>March </em>last. That the plaintiffs have commenced suits against <em>D. </em>and <em>M., </em>but have not yet obtained judgment. That the two last judgments were voluntary, and without consideration, *and with intent to defraud the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs prayed for relief, and for an injunction against proceeding on the judgments by execution, &amp;c.; and an injunction was granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-11\">No answer had been put in by the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A0v\"><em>Emott, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiZ\">now moved to dissolve the injunction, on the ground that the plaintiffs are not <em>judgment </em>creditors, and have not obtained any <em>lien </em>on the property of the defendants, and, therefore, have no right to question the judgments.

My first impression was in favor of the plaintiffs; but upon examination of the cases, I am satisfied that a creditor at large, and before judgment and execution, cannot be entitled to the interference which has been granted in this case. In <em>Angell </em>v. <em>Draper, </em>(1 <em>Vern. </em>399.) and <em>Shirley </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>(3 <em>Atk. </em>200.) it was held, that the creditor must have completed his title at law, by judgment and execution, before he can question the disposition of the debtor\u2019s property ; and in <em>Bennet </em>v. <em>Musgrave, </em>(2 <em>Ves. </em>51.) and in a case before Lord <em>Nottingham, </em>cited in <em>Balch v. Wastall, </em>(1 <em>P. Wms. </em>445.) the same doctrine was declared, and so it is understood by the elementary writers. (Mitford, 115. <em>Cooper, Equ. Pl. </em>149.) The reason of the rule seems to be, that until the creditor has *established his title, he has no right to interfere, and it would lead to an unnecessary, and, perhaps, a fruitless and oppressive interruption of the exercise of the debtor\u2019s rights. Unless he has a certain claim upon the property of the debtor, he has no concern with his frauds. On the strength of settled authorities, I shall, accordingly, grant the motion for dissolving the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
