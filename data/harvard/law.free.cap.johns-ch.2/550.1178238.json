ROBINSON, </em>on the part of the defendant <em>H. Hodgson, </em>moved for an order to examine the defendants <em>Eastburn </em>and <em>Downes, </em>as witnesses for him. He contended, that it appeared from the pleadings, that they were not interested, and were made defendants, <em>pro forma. </em>He cited 1 <em>P. Wms. </em>596. 1 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep. </em>246, 247.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-9\"><em>Emmet, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUI\">objected, on the ground that a replication had been filed to the answers of <em>Eastburn </em>and <em>Downes. </em>He cited 2 <em>Madd. Ch. </em>316., in which it is said, that if the answer of a defendant be replied to, he is considered as interested, and cannot be examined.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b427-10\">The Chancellor</author>\n<p id=\"Agoi\">[ * 551 ]</p>\n<p id=\"AEZG\">said, he thought the mere fact of filing a replication was not sufficient to prevent the examination of a co-defendant, who appeared by the pleadings not to be interested in the cause. The <em>dictum </em>in <em>Maddock </em>was without reference to any authority to support it. If the filing a replication, was, of itself, decisive proof of interest, it would be in the power of the plaintiff to deprive a defendant of any witness. The rule to examine these *co-defendants must be granted, <em>subject to all just </em>exceptions; and if it should appear on the hearing that the co-defendants were interested, their depositions would, of course, be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">Rule accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
