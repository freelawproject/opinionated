Norton, </em>and <em>Sarah </em>his evife. It set forth the will of the testator <em>W.

F., </em>but which they were unable to particularize, the deeds, papers, &amp;c., being in the hands of the defendants, or some of them. That the tracts of land referred to, at a fair valuation, were worth 200,000 dollars, and that sum could have been obtained for them, if reasonable pains had been taken for the disposal thereof. That <em>Mary Osgood, </em>as surviving executrix, had no power to sell the real estate; but if she had power, the sale ought not to be carried into effect, because the plaintiffs alleged that <em>Samuel Osgood, </em>and <em>Mary </em>his wife, <em>John L. Norton, </em>and <em>De Witt Clinton, </em>well knew the value of the said residuary estate, and corruptly and collusively agreed among themselves, for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiffs of their just proportions of the same; that the said <em>Samuel Osgood, </em>and <em>Mary </em>his wife,-by virtue of her supposed authority under the will of <em>W. F., </em>should execute conveyances in fee to <em>Norton </em>and <em>Clinton, </em>for all the residuary estate, for the small and inadequate sum, compared with its real value, of 25,000 dollars; and, in pursuance of such corrupt and fraudulent agreement, the sale and conveyance was made; and they insisted, that if <em>Samuel Osgood </em>and his wife have sold the lands for this inadequate considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>tion, through ignorance of their real value, their negligence in not ascertaining the value thereof, which might have been easily done, was so gross and inexcusable as to render them responsible for the full value of the lands. The bill prayed for an account; and that the sale and conveyances of the residuary estate might be set aside, and the estate sold, and the proceeds thereof distributed, &amp;c.; or that <em>Samuel Osgood, </em>and <em>Mary </em>his wife, might account for it, at its true value, and all the title deeds, &amp;c. be brought into Court, and that they account for the personal estate, &amp;c. &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>[ * 7 ]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>[ * 8 ]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-6-pl-split\">[ * 9 ]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Al\">*The <em>answer </em>of <em>Samuel Osgood, </em>and <em>Mary </em>his wife, to the cross bill, was filed the 29th of <em>September, </em>1809. They stated, that the executors were appointed on condition of not being discharged from their debts owing to the testator. That the power to sell, in the will, was in these words: \u201c I give to my executors <em>that may act, </em>and to the major part of them, their heirs, or executors, full power to sell,\u201d &amp;c., according to an authenticated copy thereof in their possession ; that the original will was not in their possession, nor did they know where it was, unless it was in the possession of the representatives of <em>John </em>and <em>Samuel Franklin, </em>as the defendant <em>Mary Osgood, </em>a few days after the death of the testator, delivered it to them, and it never has been in her possession, nor has she seen it since; nor has the said <em>Samuel Osgood </em>ever seen the original will. That <em>John </em>and <em>Samuel </em>were the only acting executors during their lives; that after the death of <em>Samuel, </em>the defendant <em>Mary, </em>and her husband, acted as executor; that all the debts and specific legacies had been paid. They admitted all the representative capacities and rights of the plaintiffs; that they have received 347 dollars, being the whole personal estate, except what may be due from those who are entitled to distributive shares ; and that the debts so due ought to be deducted from their shares; that, as to the <em>real </em>estate of <em>W. F., </em>all they know is, that among the papers delivered to them by the plaintiffs <em>Abraham </em>and <em>John, </em>executors of <em>Samuel Franklin, </em>deceased, there was a deed from <em>Peter Dubois </em>and others, to <em>W. F., </em>dated <em>November, </em>1772, for 12 lots of land, containing about 3,800 acres, on the south side of the <em>Mohawk; </em>another deed from the same persons to <em>If. F., </em>for 4,400 acres, on the south side of the <em>Mohawk; </em>another deed from the same persons, except <em>Dubois, </em>dated 5th of <em>January, </em>1775, for 14 lots in <em>Tryon </em>county, containing 4,600 acres; that considerable parts of these three tracts were sold and conveyed by <em>W. *F. </em>in his lifetime, and that other parts thereof were disposed of by <em>Samuel Franklin, </em>the acting executor, in his lifetime, by deed, in fee, perpetual lease, or by contracts with allowance for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>improvements; but how much had been sold they did not know, though .they had diligently inquired, particularly of the plaintiffs <em>Abraham </em>and <em>John, </em>who had refused to give any information on the subject; that nearly the whole of these three tracts was covered with settlers claiming title to the lands occupied by them; that, in 1791 and 1795, what land remained unsold of these tracts, was offered for sale by <em>Samuel </em>and <em>John Franklin, </em>the executors, for 5,000 dollars, being the original price paid by <em>W. F. </em>That after the death of <em>Samuel Franklin, </em>these defendants endeavored to trace the title of <em>W. F. </em>to these lands, and found that he purchased them at auction; that no information could be obtained from the plaintiffs <em>Abraham </em>and <em>John, </em>executors of <em>S. F.; </em>that it could not be discovered that the grantors to <em>W. F. </em>had any title. That <em>W. F., </em>or his executors, had no actual possession of the lands, which were settled, and various persons claiming them had been in possession, in some instances 25 years, in others above 20 years, before the sale by the defendants, and in other cases 19 or 20 years; and that, according to the belief of the defendants, a large portion of these tracts was lost to the estate by the adverse possession of the tenants and occupants; that such was the belief of the defendants at the time of the sale by them, and was now their belief; that the defendants also received from the executors of <em>Samuel Franklin, </em>a deed from <em>John Brandon </em>to <em>W. F., </em>dated the 4th of <em>July, </em>1771, for an island in <em>Lake George, </em>containing 100 acres; another deed from <em>Joseph Fairlie, </em>dated 4th of <em>February, </em>1771, for 200 acres on a neck of land on <em>Lake George. </em>That if the title to these parcels were good, the land was poor, and not worth more than 300 dollars. That they know nothing of any land in <em>*Queensberry, </em>in the county of <em>Washington, </em>belonging to the estate of <em>W. F. </em>That they received from the executors of <em>Samuel Franklin, </em>a deed to <em>W. F. </em>for 2,363 acres of land on the <em>Susquehannah, </em>in 12 lots, which land is rough, and of no great value, and some of the settlers claimed title by possession. That they also received from the executors of <em>Samuel Franklin, </em>deeds for lands in the state of <em>Vermont, </em>to <em>W. F., </em>which they specified, in <em>Hillsborough, Reading, </em>and <em>Hilton, </em>being 11,000 acres in the whole ; a deed for 9 rights in <em>Cavendish, </em>and a deed for 14 rights in <em>Draper, </em>in the same state. That several of the titles were under the state of <em>New-York, </em>and were lost when <em>Vermont </em>became an independent state; that a considerable part of the lands have been sold for taxes, or lost by adverse possession; and for these causes, according to the best information and belief of the defendants, the title to all the lands in <em>Vermont </em>of <em>W. F., </em>has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>become entirely lost and extinguished, excepting about 2,000 acres in <em>Cavendish, </em>which is mountainous, and of little value, and the settlers on which dispute the title of ^ That to their knowledge, there are no other lands belonging to the estate of <em>W. F., </em>and that they were satisfied there was no land of <em>W. F. </em>in the county of <em>Greene; </em>that they cannot describe the lands, or their value, more fully or accurately; and they set forth, in a schedule,' all the deeds and papers received from the executors of <em>Samuel Franklin, </em>the 23d of <em>February, </em>1808, for which they gave a receipt; and which were the only deeds or papers ever received by the defendants, relative to the real estate of <em>W. F. </em>That they never could obtain any information from the executors of <em>Samuel </em>and <em>John Franklin, </em>relative to the situation, quantity, or value of the said lands; that during a period of about 27 years, during which time the said <em>Samuel </em>and <em>John </em>jointly, and <em>Samuel </em>alone, as acting executors of <em>W. F, </em>had the care of the estate, the lands were left exposed *to settlers and intruders, and were not taken possession of by any person in behalf of the estate; and the greater part was now claimed to be held by occupants, by adverse possession; that the lands are subject to the dower of the defendant <em>Mary Osgood, </em>and to the payment of quit-rents, large arrears of which were due. That, under all these difficulties and embarrassments, and as no part of the lands could be recovered without much litigation and expense, the defendants deemed it best for the estate, and for those interested, to sell the whole of the residue of the estate together, <em>en masse; </em>that in <em>June,.1808, </em>they agreed to sell to <em>Norton </em>and <em>Clinton </em>the whole of the said lands, for the sum of 25,000 dollars, and accordingly, on the 11th pf <em>June, </em>1808, executed a deed to <em>S. Norton </em>for <em>two thirds, </em>and to <em>Clinton </em>for one third thereof. That they were\u2019advised by counsel, that the defendant <em>Mary </em>had power to sell the real' estate under the will of the testator ; that, in their judgment and belief, the sum for which the lands were so sold to <em>N. </em>and <em>C., </em>is their full value, and more than the defendants would have given for the same, under the circumstances stated. They fully and absolutely denied any collusion, corruption, or fraud whatever in the sale, or any secret trust, understanding, or agreement, relative to the same; and they claimed <em>one eighth </em>of the sum for which the said lands were sold. They further stated, that the plaintiffs, or either of them, before the sale, never applied to them to come to any settlement or distribution of the estate; nor had any, or either of the plaintiffs, since the sale, applied to the defendants to make void the same, and to have the property resold; nor had any of the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>suggested or pretended to them, or either of them, that the price obtained for the land was not its full value. That they used all the means in their power to obtain correct information relative to the value of the lands, and as to the titles, &amp;c., and believe that the price for which *the lands were sold was a full and adequate price for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Am\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>[ * 10 ]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>[ * 11 ]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>[ * 12 ]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-10\">[ *13 ]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-4\">The <em>answer </em>of <em>De Witt Clinton, </em>filed <em>September </em>26th, 1809,-stated, that all the title deeds to the lands did not come into the hands of <em>Osgood </em>and <em>Mary </em>his wife; that the deeds from the original patentees to <em>Dubois </em>for the lands in <em>Cherry Valley </em>were supposed to be lost, and were recently discovered, by the defendant, to be in the hands of <em>W.

He denied all secret understanding, collusion, fraud, or unfairness between ,the parties in the transaction; and that he offered to give up the bargain, and <em>Osgood </em>refused.

That <em>Samuel Franklin </em>authorized settlers to occupy, and promised to pay for the improvements, which had greatly diminished the value of the lands to him and <em>Norton. </em>That most of the lands are held and claimed adversely to them, and they have been obliged to commence suits to recover *the possession of a great part of these lands, the result of which cannot be foreseen. That the county is considerably settled, but the lands are hilly and rough, and he cannot form a judgment of their real value. That the island and point of land in <em>Lake George </em>were worth one dollar per acre. That the 850 acres in <em>Queensberry </em>were on a perpetual lease, at one shilling per <em>acre; </em>and the value about 1,500 dollars.

The first question arising on the merits is, whether <em>Mary Osgood, </em>as sole surviving executor of <em>Walter Frank-</em>deceased, was authorized to sell the real estate,</p>\n<p id=\"AxK\">The part of the will of <em>Walter Franklin </em>relating to the question is as follows: \u201c <em>The whole residue of my estate 1 give </em>and bequeath as follows: one eighth to <em>Sarah Corsa, </em>&amp;c.; one eighth to <em>Mary Wistar, </em>&amp;c.; to my wife, one eighth, &amp;c.; to my daughters, <em>Maria </em>and <em>Sarah, </em>each one eighth; to my brothers, <em>John, Thomas, </em>and <em>Samuel, </em>each one eighth, &amp;c. And <em>I order that the money or effects he distributed and divided from time to time, as it can he raised from, my debts and estate by my executors, hereafter named, </em>&amp;c.; and they are to keep a sufficiency undivided, to pay off. all legacies, and to keep the <em>estate </em>as much on interest or <em>rents </em>as they can for the general benefit. And <em>I appoint my wife with my three brothers aforesaid to be executors, </em>but on this condition, that if they owe me any money at my decease, their appointment, or acting as executors, shall not be a release of their debts, but the same shall be paid; and if they do not act on this condition, they are not to be executors. <em>I give to my executors that (they) may act, and to the major part of them, their heirs or executors, full power to sell any or all my real estate not already devised, </em>&amp;c. I give to each of my executors who shall act, 2001: in lieu of all other commissions and rewards, &amp;c.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6-pl-split\">[ * 20 ]</p>\n<p id=\"AGd\">If the case turned upon the dry question, whether by the common law a naked power without interest to executors to sell, would survive, I should deem the authority of Lord <em>Coke </em>decisive. He lays down the rule repeatedly in his <em>Institutes, </em>(Co. <em>Litt. </em>112. b. 113. a. 181. b.) as one well established, that the power would not survive; and the same law was declared by <em>Dodderidge, J., the </em>contemporary of <em>Coke, </em>and author of the <em>Touchstone. (Shep. Touch, </em>tit. <em>Testament, </em>pi. 9. p. 429.) These writers were, in their time, and have been in every period since, regarded as oracles of the common *law, and they must have been familiar with the old author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>ities. I do not, therefore, consider the observations of Mr. <em>Hargrave, (Co. Litt. </em>113. <em>a. note.) </em>even after giving them all the weight justly due to his talents and learning, as being sufficient to overturn a rule so strongly established ; and especially when it has been shown by Mr. <em>Powell, (Treatise on Devises, </em>p. 292\u2014310.) that he is by no means borne out by the cases to which he refers. The statute of 21 <em>Hen. </em>VIII. c. 4. affords no small confirmation of the doctrine in <em>Coke; </em>for the preamble declares the opinion that a sale by executors under a power in a will <em>\u201c </em>can in no wise be good or effectual in the law, unless the same bargain and sale be made by the whole number of the executors named to and for the same.\u201d</p>\n<headnotes id=\"pAqS\">But if execup\u00b00\u201d\u2019er the real estate, any \u00ednfcraf7'egal or equitable, ^o'ivL^mvivl\u00ed</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"pAtQ\">So if the execuj\u00b0[,!]1aroach)j|\u00ae;d relative to the pe^dm/on the power to sell, vives.\u00b0wer sur\"</headnotes>\n<p id=\"AOB\">[ * 21 ]</p>\n<p id=\"b21-11\">But while I thus acknowledge the rule of the common law, I am equally satisfied that this cause is not governed by it. In the first place, this case comes within the exception stated by Lord <em>\"Coke; </em>for here was an interest sufficient to feed the power, and keep it alive in the hands of the surviving executors. The executors were vested by the will with an absolute interest in an undivided moiety of the whole residuary estate, on which the power was to operate, and they were also directed to keep the whole of this residuary estate as much as possible on interest, <em>or rents, </em>for the general benefit. This authority to lease, and this interest in the subject itself, must be sufficient to exempt the power from the character of a mere naked authority to a stranger. It is not necessary that the interest coupled with the power should be a legal interest. An equitable estate is sufficient, and is regarded in this Court as the real interest. So it was held by Lord <em>Hardwicke, </em>in <em>Hearle </em>v. <em>Greenbank; </em>(3 <em>Atk. </em>714.) nor does the character of the power depend upon the quantity of interest. A trustee invested only with the use and profits of the land for the benefit of another, has an interest connected with his power. This was so understood in <em>Bergen </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>(1 <em>Caines\u2019s *Cases in Error, </em>16.) and in <em>Eyre </em>v. <em>Countess of Shaftsbury, </em>(2 <em>P. Wms. </em>102.) a testamentary guardian, with authority to lease, was held to possess a power coupled with an interest, and capable of survivorship.</p>\n<p id=\"A1c\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>[ * 22]</p>\n<p id=\"b21-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>In the next place, here was a trust charged on the executors, in the direction given to them to distribute the proceeds of the residuary estate; and according to the settled doctrine of the Court, the trust does not become extinct by the death of one of the trustees. It will be continued in the survivor, and cannot be permitted, in any event, to fail of execution for want of a trustee. In this case, one of the trusts under the will depended upon a sale. In <em>Garfoot v. Garfoot, (M. </em>15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number><em>Car. </em>II. 1. <em>Ch. Cas. </em>35.) lands were devised to the wife for life, and then to be sold by the executors, for younger children\u2019s portions, and the wife and executors died, and the younger children exhibited their bill to compel the heir to sell; and on demurrer by the heir, on the ground that the executor had but an authority which died with him, the demurrer was overruled. So, also, in <em>Barnes's </em>case, (Sir <em>Wm. Jones, </em>352. <em>Cro. Car. </em>382. S. C.) lands were devised to the wife for life, and then to be sold by the executors for payment of debts and legacies, or as one of the reports of the case says, to be divided among the nephews. One of the executors died, and it was held, on a case sent from chancery for the opinion of the judges at law, that the survivor could sell, though the executors had an authority, and no interest. Whatever, therefore, might have been the character of the power in this case, the strict rule of the. common law could never be permitted, in this Court, to defeat the trust connected with the execution of the power. Whether the residuary legatees might not have come in and taken the land itself, instead of the proceeds which the executors, as trustees, were to distribute) and thereby have arrested the execution of the power to sell, is a point not now before me. No such application was ever made; the power to sell was left by the legatees to its full operation; *and they come too late, after the sale, to make their election, or to raise such a question.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"pAcq\">If residuary legatees might come in and take the land itself, instead of the proceeds, it is too late, after a sale by the make their elcc-</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"pAf_\">In the construction of powers of sale, the intention of the testator is much regarded.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">Either of these grounds appears to me to be sufficient to support the sale by Mrs. <em>Osgood, </em>as the sole surviving executor. There are other considerations, also, which add great weight to this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-9-pl-split\">The intention of the testator is much regarded in the construction of these powers, and they are construed with greater or less latitude in reference to that intent. It was evidently the testator\u2019s intention here, that the power should not fail as long as there was an executor to execute it, for the power is given even to the <em>major part </em>of the <em>acting </em>executors, and it was to descend to the legal representatives, both real and personal, of the executors. In other words, it was made transmissible by descent and by will; and though it is left doubtful as to the portion of the executors from whom that transmission was to proceed, I should take the better opinion to be, that it was to proceed, as in the case of other joint interests or trusts, from the <em>last survivor, </em>and that the testator could not have intended such incongruity and confusion as the union of the heirs and executors of a deceased executor with the surviving executors. The testator had also in contemplation the possible case of his wife acting alone; for he imposes a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>dition upon the other executors, without complying with which they were not to be considered as appointed.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"pAQ3C\">Mcreinadequaof J\u201ejj?eieast pound for set-\u2018\u201cg inadequacy be te ofUseif <em>eX </em>deuce of fraud.</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"pAaG\">But inadequacy notPsoeposs!s to^ amount u&gt; aau \u2019 sufficient ground for re-J-\u201crs\u2122ga specific performance of aalecon rac 0</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b23-3\">I am satisfied, for these reasons, that it would be repugnant to the intention of the will, to the rules of law, and to the principles of this Court, to defeat a power uniting so much trust, confidence, and interest, by applying to it the strict doctrine of the common law, relative to mere naked authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"AmX\">[ * 23 ]</p>\n<p id=\"b23-4\">2. The next point made on the part of the legatees is, that the sale was a fraudulent breach of trust, and ought either to be set aside, or, if permitted to stand, that the representatives of <em>Osgood and his wife </em>ought to account *for the. real value of the lands at the time of the sale, instead of the price at' which they were sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">The ground relied on in support of the charge of fraud, is the inadequacy of the price. I have examined the authorities on this point, and I am satisfied that it is not, of itself, and ought not to be, a justifiable cause of interference, unless the inadequacy be so gross as to be evidence of actual fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">I see no just pretext for the charge, that the sale was not made by the executrix and her husband in good faith; nor do I think that, under the circumstances of this case, there was any such inadequacy of price as to give color to the inference of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"AV0\">[ * 24 ]</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">There is no case where mere inadequacy of price, independent of other circumstances, has been held sufficient to set aside a sale made between parties standing on equal ground, and dealing with each other without any imposition or oppression. And the inequality amounting to fraud, must be so strong and manifest as to shock the conscience and confound the judgment of any man of common sense. (Sir <em>Th. </em>Clarke, in <em>How </em>v. Weldon, 2 <em>Vesey, </em>516. Lord <em>Thurlow, </em>in 1 <em>Bro. </em>9. Lord Ch. B. <em>Eyre, </em>in 2 <em>Bro. </em>179, <em>note. </em>Lord <em>Eldon, </em>in 9 <em>Vesey, </em>246. Sir <em>William Grant, </em>in 16 <em>Vesey, </em>517.) There is a very important distinction, which runs through the cases, between ordering a contract to be rescinded, and decreeing a specific performance. Though inadequacy of price is not a ground for decreeing an agreement to be delivered up, or a sale rescinded, (unless its grossness amount to fraud,) yet it may be sufficient for the Court to refuse to enforce performance. It is not an uncommon case for the Court to refuse to enforce for inadequacy, and at the same time refuse to rescind. The two cases admit of very different views and considerations. This whole subject was very fully discussed in <em>Mortlock </em>v. <em>Buller, </em>(10 <em>Ves. </em>292.) which was the case of a bill for a specific performance of a contract of sale of land by the *defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>as agent of trustees. The land was sold in <em>September, </em>foi \u00a326,500, and in <em>December </em>following, the plaintiff had contracted for the resale of a part only for \u00a334,900, and the trustees refused to ratify the sale. There was no imputation of fraud in the transaction. The character of the parties was unimpeached, and though the plaintiff had neglected no previous means of information as to the value of the land, yet the chancellor said he was at full liberty to do so, and might honestly contract with persons at arm\u2019s length, and dealing for themselves. But, he said, there was a want of care and attention on the part of the trustees, in not exerting a wise and full discretion as to a reasonable price, amounting to a breach of trust, and he thought himself not bound to afford relief to a purchaser who had contented himself with a contract, instead of a conveyance, and so dismissed the bill. There can be no doubt, from the language of the Court, that if the conveyance had been executed, it would have stood, notwithstanding the inadequacy. Thus, in <em>Day </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>cited in 10 <em>Vesey, </em>300, Lord <em>Ahanley </em>refused to enforce a specific performance of an agreement for the sale, for \u00a320,000, of an estate worth only \u00a310,000. There was no actual fraud in the case, but the inadequacy was so great that he would not enforce the contract against the seller, nor, on the other hand, would he sustain a cross bill to rescind it.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4-pl-split\">[ * 25 ]</p>\n<p id=\"AF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>[ * 26 ]</p>\n<p id=\"A4H\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>I need not multiply cases on this point. The doctrine is settled, that in setting aside contracts, on account of inadequate consideration, the ground is fraud arising from gross inequality. Unless the inadequacy does, of itself, <em>ex evidentia rerum, </em>prove fraud, the rule is, says Ch. B. <em>Macdonald, </em>(1 <em>Wightwick, </em>109.) that inadequacy, by itself, has not the weight suggested. If, indeed, advantage be taken, on either side, of the ignorance or distress of the other, it affords a new and distinct ground, not applicable to this case, and a very great inadequacy may form a presumption *of oppression. (1 <em>Wightwick\u2019s Rep. </em>28, 29. 3 <em>Ves. &amp; B. </em>117.) Dealing with young heirs, and for reversionary interests, is also watched with the utmost jealousy, and constitutes a particular class of cases, forming another exception to the general rule, that for mere inadequacy of price a contract is not to be set aside. <em>(Evans </em>v. <em>Peacock, </em>16 <em>Vesey, </em>512. <em>Gowland </em>v. <em>De Faria, </em>17 <em>Vesey, </em>20.) So, leases of charity estates will be set aside for an undervalue, if considerable, though there be no imputation of fraud, on grounds peculiar to that trust. (18 <em>Vesey, </em>315.) But none of those exceptions to the general rule apply to this case. Here is no imputation on the character of the parties, and there is no appearance of undue means or influence, or of the practice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>any kind of imposition. The most that can be said is, that the property would have been vastly more productive, if the executor had taken more pains to ascertain the title, and had made the sales in small parcels, and to settlers upon credit, As the property was situated at the time of the sale, I do not believe, from any proof in the case, that the land could have been sold at that time, in one entire parcel, at a better price. The testimony of <em>John Lawrence, </em>and of <em>Samuel Riker, jun., </em>serve to confirm me in this opinion. The land at that time was, in general, heavily encumbered with adverse claims and pretensions. The former acting executors, who were then dead, and whose representatives are among those who are now seeking to impeach the sale, had suffered all this residuary estate to lie unregarded for upwards of twenty years, and adverse possessions were fast closing upon the <em>Franklin </em>title. These possessions (I speak now of the <em>Cherry Valley </em>lands, and which, indeed, are the only lands of much moment in the case) were generally held under a contract made in 1786, by Col. <em>Corsa, </em>as assumed agent of the executors, and whose ^agency and contract the executors, or one of them, had ratified. By this contract, the settlers were to be paid *for their improvements, if they did not purchase. This claim was a great encumbrance on the title. It is well known, that improvements made by settlers are generally valued quite high; and it is in proof in this case, that such claims exceed, in many instances, the value of the land at the time the settlement was made. I do not perceive, from my present view of the claim under Col. <em>Corsa, </em>as shown by proof here, but that it might have been established in equity, if the application had been made in time. There were likewise defects in the chain of title, which had excited a general distrust of its validity; and this title was not made complete until the discovery of the release of the original patentees to <em>Dubois, </em>some time after the sale in question. It was found in the possession of <em>William North; </em>and as the former executors knew nothing of this paper, Mrs. <em>Osgood </em>had good reason to presume that it was irretrievably lost. There is no doubt this estate has suffered greatly by negligence, but it was a negligence of 20 years\u2019 standing, imputable, in a great degree, to the <em>two </em>former executors, who had the sole management of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">These difficulties, in the way of title, have been justly and strongly urged, to show that the price is not to be charged with inadequacy, under all the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>[ * 27 ]</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Lands in such a situation have no determinate value, and they are not to be estimated by the price of improved farms, or lots which have a clear title, and may yield a known and steady rent. Accidental subsequent advantage made of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>bargain, is nothing, according to Lord <em>Eldon. (Coles v. Trecothick, </em>9 <em>Vesey, </em>246.) If we were to take such a ground, every transaction of this kind would come into a Court of equity- The purchasers in this case immediately bestowed the utmost diligence to assert their title and recover the lands, and by the fortunate discovery of title deeds, and by still more fortunate suits and negotiations, they must have been able to avoid the statute of limitations, and to escape the embarrassment of the claim for improvements, and have *turned their speculation to great advantage. I see nothing unusual in this, nor any thing censurable on the part of the purchasers; and the suit as against them ought to be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"pAMyl\">A <em>trustee </em>is \u25a0 wuh'imaghary values, or more ceivei'C \"unless there is evinegHgencefr\u00b0amounting to wiliui default.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b26-5-pl-split\">[ * 28 ]</p>\n<p id=\"AZ\">I have confined my attention solely to the circumstance of inadequacy of price, because no other was stated or urged by the counsel, and no other has occurred to me, as evidence of fraud. The only question of any serious doubt in the whole case, is, whether there was not a want of attention and vigilance on the part of Mrs. <em>Osgood, </em>amounting to a breach of trust, so as to render her representatives chargeable beyond the moneys actually received. I think, upon the whole, this would be too rigorous a conclusion. A Court of equity, according to the lord keeper, in <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>(1 <em>Vern. </em>144.) never charges a trustee with imaginary values, or with move than he has received, unless the proof be very strong of supine negligence. Lord <em>Thurlow </em>said, it must amount to a case of wilful default. (1 <em>Vesey, jun. </em>193.) Mrs. <em>Osgood </em>had an interest of one eighth in this residuary estate, and though the sale was to her two sons-in-law, yet she had children living by her second husband, Mr. <em>Osgood; </em>an\u00bf s\u00a1le an\u00bf ]ier husband never could have made an intentional sacrifice of that estate, because if would have been sacrificing their own interest, and that of their other children. In that sale, then, it may be said, they took the same care of the interest of others as of their own. There were many considerations that might have had a rational and powerful influence on the minds of Mr. and Mrs. <em>Osgood. </em>This estate had been for more than twenty years under the sole care and management of the other executors, who were equally legatees, and who had suffered the estate to fall into ruin. The title was handed over to Mrs. <em>Osgood </em>in an embarrassed and doubtful state, and a very considerable part of the claim under the testator was null and void. This was the case with the <em>Wawayanda </em>claim, and *with the lands in <em>Greene </em>county, and most of the lands in <em>Vermont. </em>The only valuable property was the <em>Cherry Valley </em>lands, and they were covered with adverse possessions, and with settlers, under burdensome claims for improvements. What was the executor to do ? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>To undertake to recover these lands might lead to great expense, which would eat up the value of the estate. They aver, in their answer, that they deemed it best for the interest of the legatees, to sell, at once, the whole estate for the best price that could be obtained; and there is no reason to doubt the sincerity of this allegation. Whether that was or was not the most advisable course, under the then existing circumstances, was a difficult question, on which intelligent and prudent men might differ. I do not think that I am bound, by any principles in this Court, to deal so hardly with <em>Osgood </em>and his wife, as to make either of them responsible, as trustees, for an error of judgment, and I shall, therefore, not hold them answerable beyond the amount of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax\">[ * 29 ]</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">In arriving at this conclusion, I have been much governed by a view of the peculiar situation of the property when the trust was assumed by Mrs. <em>Osgood, </em>and of the desperate condition to which it was reduced by the folly and negligence of the former executors, and the tacit acquiescence of all parties in interest. The case would have been very different' if she had been an acting executrix from the beginning. To exact of her a responsibility for the defaults of others, would be unjust. When she assumed the trust, in 1807, she was under the necessity of commencing, at once, a series of extraordinary efforts, and of expensive litigation, sufficient to strike ordinary minds with dismay, or of closing the concern of the administration of the estate by bringing the whole interest to market. There was no time for delay. One course or the other must have been pursued immediately, or the property abandoned forever. If she did not elect the most judicious course for the interest of the trust, she elected the other, with the best *advice of her husband, and in perfect good faith. Of this there is no doubt. I cannot but think that the charge of an abuse of discretion does not come with great weight or equity from <em>cestui que trusts, </em>who are partly representatives of the former trustees, all of whom have been silent spectators of the manner in which the former trustees had conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">I shall, accordingly, decree, that the bill against the purchasers be dismissed with costs, and that the usual reference be made to a master to take and state an account between the representatives of Mr. and Mrs. <em>Osgood, </em>as executrix, on the one part, and the respective claimants of the residuary estate of <em>W. Franklin, </em>deceased, on the other: in taking which account, the estate of Mrs. <em>Osgood </em>is to be charged with the actual amount of sales and other moneys received, and no more, and the executors of <em>John, Thomas, </em>and <em>Samuel Franklin, </em>deceased, to be charged with the debts due from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>their testators respectively, to the estate of <em>Walter Franklin, </em>deceased; and the question of costs', and all other questions, to be, in the mean time, reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Decree accordingly, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b28-6\"><em> </em>This decree was affirmed by the Court of Errors, on appeal, the 8th of <em>April, </em>1817.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
