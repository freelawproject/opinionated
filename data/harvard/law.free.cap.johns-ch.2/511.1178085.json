The fraudulent judgment, therefore, created no valid subsisting <em>lien. </em>The title to the land never passed from the plaintiff; and there is no rule of law, or equity, to protect the judgment in the hands of <em>Bobbins, </em>though he may be an assignee for a valuable consideration, without notice of the fraud, for he took the assignment of the judgment at his peril. He took it subject to all the existing rights of the <em>debtor; </em>and these rights could not be varied, or affected, by the assignment, though, perhaps, the right of <em>a third person, </em>depending upon a secret trust, might be affected. <em>(Murray &amp; Winter </em>v. <em>Lylburn </em>and others.)<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> The judgment was not an article of ordinary commerce, and it would be repugnant to justice and sound policy, to permit fraud to be successful by such a contrivance.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">The land, therefore, must be decreed to be reconveyed to the plaintiff, discharged of the judgment, and a perpetual injunction awarded against the execution of the judgment upon that land.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12-pl-split\">Decree accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b396-8\"> <em>Ante, </em>441.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
