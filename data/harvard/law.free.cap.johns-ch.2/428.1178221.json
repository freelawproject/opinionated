He cited 13 Vesey, 546. <em>Hind.

He then contended, *that if the latter bond was produced, under the order, it might be an implied admission that it was taken in discharge of the legacy. That a cross bill of discovery was the only true and proper course. Whether the bond so existing was given in discharge of the legacy was <em>the very point in dispute, </em>and the party cannot produce it, without admitting it to be what, he says, it was not intended to be.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b332-6\">The Chancellor</author>\n<p id=\"AGZ\">said, the rule to produce the bonds must be vacated, under the circumstances disclosed. It was most safe, for the rights of the parties in this case, that the defendants should be put to their cross bill, or bill of discovery. Such a motion has been denied, <em>(Darwin </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>8 <em>Vesey, </em>158.) where the opposite party had not admitted the deed to be in his possession. Here the party denies his possession of one bond, and denies that the other was ever received in the sense contended for; and the order might prejudice his right.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7-pl-split\">Rule vacated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
