The affidavit stated, that subsequent to the giving of the mortgage to <em>Marks, </em>the premises had been conveyed to her with the assent of her husband, and that the equity of redemption was in her; that she had not been served with a <em>subpoena </em>to appear, and that her husband had now absconded and left her, and that she was willing to redeem the premises by paying off the mortgage debt, and bringing the money into Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-9\"><em>J. Strong, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9I\">showed by affidavit, that the process was served on the husband, and that it was understood, and so charged in the bill, that the deed from <em>Marks </em>was taken in the wife\u2019s name, to secure the property from her husband\u2019s creditors, and that the purchase money was paid out of his property.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b110-10\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"AS5\">The general rule is, that the service of a <em>subpoena </em>against husband and wife on the husband alone, is a good service on both, and the reason is, that the husband and wife are one person in law, and the husband is bound to answer for both. ( <em>Wyatt\u2019s Pr. Reg. </em>402, 403. <em>Gilbert\u2019s For. Rom. </em>41, 42. 1 <em>Harris. Ch. Practice, </em>207.) But where the plaintiff is seeking relief out of the separate estate of the wife, it has been deemed necessary, in a late case, (9 <em>Vesey, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>488.) that the wife should be served. Here *the right of redemption is exclusively in the wife, and her husband has absconded; she asks only for an opportunity to redeem, and I think it ought to be granted. If she had alleged any defence, I should have been also inclined to have granted her leave to put in a separate answer, but she admits the demand, and only asks for leave to redeem the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The motion is granted, on her bringing into Court, in four weeks, the debt and interest, together with the costs accrued prior to the decretal order of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
