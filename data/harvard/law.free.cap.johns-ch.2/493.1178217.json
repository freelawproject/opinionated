That <em>William Alexander Williams, </em>late a merchant, resident at <em>Buenos Ayres, </em>died there, the 7th of <em>January, </em>1807, leaving goods and chattels <em>now </em>in the city of <em>New-York. </em>That he has no widow, or next of kin, resident in <em>*New-York. </em>That the plaintiff had applied to the surrogate for letters of administration under the statute, and waited for the expiration of the citation, for 30 days, &amp;c. That, in the mean time, the defendants, having obtained possession of goods of the deceased, since his death, had sold part, and threatened to send the residue to <em>Europe. </em>The plaintiff prayed for an injunction against selling or parting with the possession of the goods, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-11\">The answer of the defendants stated, that the goods in question came to his possession, in <em>April </em>last, under a consignment from <em>Brown, Buchanan Sy Co. </em>of <em>Buenos Ayres, </em>and who shipped the goods from <em>Buenos Ayres, </em>since the death of <em>Williams. </em>That the defendant paid the freight, &amp;c., and proceeded to sell the goods, and sold part of them, before the injunction was issued and served. That the goods so shipped appeared to belong to the representatives of <em>Williams; </em>that the instructions to the defendants were to remit the proceeds to <em>Europe, </em>and that they had a <em>lien </em>on them, for charges, &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-13\"><em>Slosson, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUv\">moved to dissolve -the injunction, on the ground, that the case did not come within the act, which provided, <em>\u201c </em>that whenever any person, not resident within this state, shall die intestate, <em>leaving goods and chattels within the city of New- York, </em>and the widow, or next of kin, residing within this state, should not, within 30 days after citation, take out letters of administration, the same should be granted to the public administrator,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>The Chancellor</author>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">[ * 495 ]</p>\n<p id=\"A5m\">said, he was inclined to think, that the act did not apply to the case, as the goods in question were not here <em>at the death of Williams, </em>but were shipped from the <em>Brazils, </em>and consigned to.the defendants, after his death. If the plaintiff had any rights, he must be left to pursue them at law, under his letters of administration, in case they should be granted. It would *not be proper to interfere with the conflicting claims of third persons, in this way, unless in a case clearly within the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Injunction dissolved.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
