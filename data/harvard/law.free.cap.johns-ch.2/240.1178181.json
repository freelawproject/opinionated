The defendant <em>Catharine Hauett </em>was one of the next of kin, and one of the claimants of a distributive share.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aq0\"><em>M.

As it is merely a suit for the safety of the administrator, the object of the motion is reasonable, and it would cause great and useless delay, trouble, and expense, to send a commission to the state of <em>Ohio, </em>for the sole purpose of taking her answer. The case of <em>Gwillin, </em>(6 <em>Ves. </em>285.) of <em>Bayley </em>v. <em>Delvalkiers, </em>(10 <em>Ves. </em>441.) and of <em>Harding </em>v. <em>Harding, </em>(11 <em>Ves. </em>159.) are authorities in support of this course of proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">Order accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-14\">It was directed that the answer should be subscribed by her attorney, and with a copy of the power of attorney annexed thereto.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
