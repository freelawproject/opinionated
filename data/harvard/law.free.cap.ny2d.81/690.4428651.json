The academic arms of universities and colleges have been and can be treated differently without compromising the broad disclosure goals of FOIL. <em>(Matter of American Socy. for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals v Board of Trustees, </em>184 AD2d 508, 80 NY2d 757; <em>Matter of American Socy. for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals v Board of Trustees, </em>79 NY2d 927; <em>Miller v State of New York, </em>62 NY2d 506; <em>Tedeschi v Wagner Coll., </em>49 NY2d 652; <em>Matter of Mary M. v Clark, </em>100 AD2d 41; <em>Babigian v Evans, </em>104 Misc 2d 140, 97 AD2d 992.)

We hold that the items sought are subject to disclosure under FOIL. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Respondent Nassau County Community College is chartered under Education Law article 126. Nassau County sponsors the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>institution which is also partially funded by special County appropriations. The College\u2019s operations, however, are governed by its own Board of Trustees <em>(see, </em>Education Law \u00a7\u00a7 6304, 6306, 6310).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Petitioner, a Nassau County resident, requested that the College produce, for his inspection, a specified film and film strips used in a course entitled \"Family Life and Human Sexuality\u201d and listed as \"PED 251.\u201d Petitioner made several written requests for access to the course film entitled \"Sexual Intercourse\u201d pursuant to New York\u2019s Freedom of Information Law (Public Officers Law \u00a7\u00a7 84-90). Sean A. Fanelli, the president of the College, and the College attorney both denied petitioner\u2019s requests, indicating that because the film sought was part of a course curriculum, it was not a \"record\u201d as contemplated by the Freedom of Information Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Petitioner exchanged correspondence with Fanelli concerning Fanelli\u2019s assertion that copyright difficulties constituted an additional reason for the College\u2019s denial, apparently prompting petitioner to request copies of the contracts involved in the purchase of the film, filmstrips, and any other \"sexually explicit\u201d visual aids for the course. Petitioner subsequently limited his request to the opportunity to \"inspect\u201d the specified items. In addition to petitioner\u2019s written requests to the College\u2019s officials, petitioner, along with other individuals, attended public meetings of the institution\u2019s Board of Trustees seeking permission to review the items, but to no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Fanelli denied petitioner\u2019s subsequent appeals <em>(see, </em>Public Officers Law \u00a7 89 [4] [a] [delineating appeal procedures for persons denied access to records]) and referred the matter to the Committee on Open Government <em>(see, id., </em>\u00a7 89 [1] [b] [ii] [requiring the committee to \"furnish to any person advisory opinions or other appropriate information regarding (FOIL)\u201d]). The executive director of the committee responded to petitioner by letter (dated Dec. 21, 1988) concluding that the PED 251 film, filmstrips and contracts were \"records\u201d for FOIL purposes, but that copyright restrictions barred respondents from allowing petitioner to view them.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Petitioner commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding <em>(see, </em>Public Officers Law \u00a7 89 [4] [b] [authorizing article 78 review for person denied disclosure after appeal]) seeking to compel respondents to grant him access to the PED 251 specified items. Supreme Court agreed with petitioner that the items constitute \"agency records\u201d under FOIL\u2019S (Public Officers Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>\u00a7 86 [4]) broad definition of the term and rejected respondents\u2019 additional contentions that (1) the items were also protected from public disclosure because they were inter- and/or intraagency materials that were not final policy determinations pursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a7 87 (2), and (2) the release of the items would promote a \"chilling effect\u201d upon the College\u2019s academic freedom in violation of respondent\u2019s First Amendment rights. That court directed the College \"forthwith to permit the petitioner to inspect the [items].\u201d The Appellate Division reversed, declining to reach the intra/inter-agency/ final policy and constitutional issues. The Court held, as a matter of law, that the items requested did not constitute \"agency records\u201d within the meaning of FOIL. This Court granted leave to appeal and now reverses.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">The Legislature unequivocally set forth its policy regarding the purpose of the Freedom of Information Law. The Legislative Declaration (Public Officers Law \u00a7 84) states, in part, \"The people\u2019s right to know the process of governmental decision-making and to review the documents and statistics leading to determinations is basic to our society. Access to such information should not be thwarted by shrouding it with the cloak of secrecy or confidentiality.\u201d In Governor Wilson\u2019s Approval Memorandum to the FOIL bills, he stressed the view that open and accessible government is a hallmark of a free society, engendering public understanding and participation <em>(see, </em>Governor\u2019s Mem approving L 1974, chs 578, 579, 580, 1974 NY Legis Ann, at 392). He further noted, \"The bills that I am today approving expressly affirm these principles and the beliefs which I have long held \u2014 that government is the people\u2019s business and that the people have a right to know the processes by which government decisions are made\u201d <em>(id.; see generally, </em>Note, New York\u2019s Freedom of Information Law, Disclosure Under the CPLR, and the Common-Law Privilege for Official Information: Conflict and Confusion Over \u201cthe People\u2019s Right to Know\u201d, 33 Syracuse L Rev 615 [1982]; Marino, The New York Freedom of Information Law, 43 Fordham L Rev 83 [1974-1975]).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">In <em>Matter of Capital Newspapers v Whalen </em>(69 NY2d 246), this Court noted the Legislature\u2019s policy that \"FOIL is to be liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly interpreted so that the public is granted maximum access to the records of government\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 252; Public Officers Law \u00a7 84; <em>see also, Matter of Prisoners\u2019 Legal Servs. v New York State Dept. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number><em>Correctional Servs., </em>73 NY2d 26; <em>Matter of Washington Post Co. v New York State Ins. Dept. </em>61 NY2d 557, 564; <em>Matter of Fink v Lefkowitz, </em>47 NY2d 567, 571). In <em>Whalen, </em>we held that the personal correspondence of a former Albany Mayor, commingled with official government documents and \"kept\u201d or \"held\u201d by a governmental entity, constituted \"records\u201d under FOIL. That the Mayor\u2019s papers concerned matters of a personal nature did not change their public nature and susceptibility to FOIL. The focus of our inquiry under FOIL in that case, as here, was the underlying principle of granting \"maximum access to the records of government\u201d <em>(Matter of Capital Newspapers v Whalen, </em>69 NY2d 246, 252, <em>supra). </em>It is within the framework of this declared policy that we address the specific contentions before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">First, we reject the position of the intervenor-respondent Nassau Community College Federation of Teachers that the College is not an \"agency\u201d within the scope of FOIL when it engages in its educational function. Public Officers Law \u00a7 86 (3) defines an \"agency\u201d as \"any * * * governmental entity performing a governmental or proprietary function.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Intervenor claims that the doctrine of \"academic abstention\u201d and statutory construction compel the conclusion that the Legislature did not intend to \"extend FOIL\u2019S definition of an agency to a college\u2019s faculty committees and academic components when they perform educational functions.\u201d To the extent that intervenor\u2019s argument is an invitation for us to delineate distinctions between the parameters of educational, proprietary and governmental functions, we decline to do so. We do hold that for the purposes of petitioner\u2019s FOIL inquiry, this public College constitutes an \"agency.\u201d Nothing in the statute or legislative history requires a contrary holding, and the statutory language should be interpreted consistent with \"its natural and most obvious\u201d meaning <em>(see, </em>McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 94; <em>Price v Price, </em>69 NY2d 8, 15-17). Moreover, as we held in <em>Matter of Westchester Rock-land Newspapers v Kimball </em>(50 NY2d 575, 581), FOIL\u2019S scope should not be restricted to \"the purpose for which a document was produced or the function to which it relates\u201d <em>(see also, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number><em>Matter of Capital Newspapers v Whalen, </em>69 NY2d 246, 253, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">Petitioner argues, and we hold only, that Public Officers Law \u00a7 86 (4) entitles him to the PED 251 films. The statute defines a \"record\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-5\">\"any information kept, held, filed, produced or reproduced by, with or for an agency or the state legislature, in <em>any physical form whatsoever </em>including, but not limited to, reports, statements, examinations, memoranda, opinions, folders, files, books, manuals, pamphlets, forms, papers, designs, drawings, maps, photos, letters, microfilms, computer tapes or discs, rules, regulations or codes\u201d (Public Officers Law \u00a7 86 [4] [emphasis supplied]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The breadth of the statutory language, in conjunction with the purpose of FOIL, compels us to hold that the items petitioner seeks to inspect \u2014 a film and filmstrips from a college-level course taught in a public college and provided by the college \u2014 undoubtedly fall within the scope of the Public Officers Law \u00a7 86 (4) definition. To hold otherwise would frustrate the goal of liberal disclosure under FOIL and employ an extremely restricted view of what constitutes a \"record,\u201d especially when applying settled principles of statutory construction (McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 94; <em>see, Matter of Capital Newspapers v Whalen, </em>69 NY2d 246, 251, <em>supra; Price v Price, </em>69 NY2d 8, 15-17, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Respondents contend that even if we hold that the definition of \"record\u201d under FOIL encompasses the specified items for PED 251, we should exclude them from public disclosure pursuant to the statute\u2019s exemption for \"inter-agency or intra-agency materials\u201d (Public Officers Law \u00a7 87 [2] [g]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While the term \"inter-agency materials\u201d is not defined under the FOIL statute, New York\u2019s courts have construed this term to mean \"deliberative material,\u201d i.e., communications exchanged for discussion purposes not constituting final policy decisions <em>(Matter of Xerox Corp. v Town of Webster, </em>65 NY2d 131). Respondents contend that the classroom environ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>ment in which the films are used is one of \"deliberation\u201d \u2014 not \"final determinations.\u201d We disagree with respondents\u2019 characterizations of the items. Recognizing that the College has used them in the course for years, there is no valid reason to hold that the items used do not constitute \"final agency policy or determinations.\u201d Although respondents argue that the classroom environment is one of \"deliberation,\u201d that in itself does not alter the status of the items used in the classroom. Respondents have not shown that the items petitioner seeks rest \"squarely within the ambit of one of [the] statutory exemptions,\u201d thereby justifying respondents\u2019 refusal to disclose them to petitioner <em>(Matter of Fink v Lefkowitz, </em>47 NY2d 567, 571, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">We have examined respondents\u2019 and intervenors\u2019 remaining contentions and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the petition granted in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Judges Simons, Titone, Hancock, Jr., and Bellacosa concur; Chief Judge Kaye and Judge Levine taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-6\">.
