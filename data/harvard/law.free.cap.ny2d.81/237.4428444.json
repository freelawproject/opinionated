Defendant, already deprived of his right to counsel when the court denied his motion for a mistrial so that new counsel could be assigned, was then deprived of his right to due process and to represent himself when the court, after granting his application to proceed <em>pro se, </em>would not permit him to participate in sidebar conferences. <em>(People v Gulley, </em>89 AD2d 874; <em>United States v Mills, </em>895 F2d 897; <em>People v McIntyre, </em>36 NY2d 10; <em>Faretta v California, </em>422 US 806; <em>Johnstone v Kelly, </em>808 F2d 214; <em>McKaskle v Wiggins, </em>465 US 168; <em>People v Sloan, </em>79 NY2d 386; <em>People v Mullen, </em>44 NY2d 1; <em>People v Sides, </em>75 NY2d 822; <em>People v Medina, </em>44 NY2d 199.) II. Defendant was denied a fair trial when the prosecutor, referring to the <em>pro se </em>defendant\u2019s summation, urged the jury to \"consider his false statements to you yesterday when you are weighing the defendant\u2019s knowledge and intent\u201d and when the prosecutor argued that defendant\u2019s demeanor in cross-examining witnesses was proof of who was in charge. <em>(Taylor v Kentucky, </em>436 US 478; <em>People v Ashwal, </em>39 NY2d 105; <em>United States v Curtiss, 330 </em>F2d 278; <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number><em>States v Carroll, </em>678 F2d 1208; <em>United States v Wright, </em>489 F2d 1181; <em>United States v Schuler, </em>813 F2d 978; <em>United States v Pearson, </em>746 F2d 787; <em>United States v Friedman, </em>909 F2d 705; <em>United States v McLain, </em>823 F2d 1457; <em>People v Hamlin, </em>71 NY2d 750.) III. Defendant was denied a fair trial by the trial court\u2019s erroneous rulings on character evidence, which both barred inquiry into the prosecution witnesses\u2019 reputation for honesty and subverted the testimony regarding defendant\u2019s good reputation. <em>(People v Pavao, </em>59 NY2d 282; <em>People v Bouton, </em>50 NY2d 130; <em>People v George, </em>67 NY2d 817; <em>People v Ruiz, </em>102 Misc 2d 465; <em>People v Sandoval, </em>34 NY2d 371; <em>People v Kuss, </em>32 NY2d 436; <em>People v Lediard, </em>80 AD2d 237; <em>People v Matthews, </em>68 NY2d 118.) IV. Defendant was denied a fair trial when the court intruded upon his examination of a favorable witness and conveyed to the jury its disbelief in the testimony. <em>(People v Yut Wai Tom, </em>53 NY2d 44; <em>People v Mendes, </em>3 NY2d 120; <em>People v Mees, </em>47 NY2d 997; <em>People v Charleston, </em>56 NY2d 886.) V. The sentence was illegally imposed because it impermissibly punished defendant for exercising his right to trial. <em>(People v Patterson, </em>106 AD2d 520; <em>Corbitt v New Jersey, </em>439 US 212; <em>United States v Hutchings, </em>757 F2d 11; <em>People v Miller, 65 </em>NY2d 502; <em>People v Pena, </em>50 NY2d 400; <em>People v Kilpatrick, </em>143 AD2d 1.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-5\"><em>Robert M.

Monroe </em>of counsel), for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsB\">I. The court\u2019s resolution of the trial management questions raised by defendant\u2019s decision to represent himself was proper, particularly since defendant did not protest the rulings and acquiesced in the role his standby counsel was playing. <em>(People v Narayan, </em>54 NY2d 106; <em>Matter of Kunstler v Galligan, </em>168 AD2d 146, 79 NY2d 775; <em>Matter of Brostoff v Berkman, </em>170 AD2d 364, 79 NY2d 938; <em>La Rocca v Lane, </em>37 NY2d 575, 424 US 968; <em>Matter of Peck v Stone, </em>32 AD2d 506; <em>McKaskle v Wiggins, </em>465 US 168; <em>People v Sawyer, 57 </em>NY2d 12, 459 US 1178; <em>People v Mirenda, 57 </em>NY2d 261; <em>United States v Mills, </em>895 F2d 897, 495 US 951; <em>People v Kinchen, </em>60 NY2d 772.) II. The court was not required to abort this trial simply because defendant became disenchanted with his counsel\u2019s perfectly competent performance. <em>(People v Sawyer, 57 </em>NY2d 12, 459 US 1178; <em>People v Sides, 75 </em>NY2d 822; <em>People v Medina, </em>44 NY2d 199; <em>People v Arroyave, </em>49 NY2d 264; <em>People v Tineo, </em>64 NY2d 531; <em>People v Baptiste, </em>72 NY2d 356; <em>People v Ortiz, </em>54 NY2d 288; <em>Hall v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number><em>Potoker, </em>49 NY2d 501; <em>People v Michael, </em>48 NY2d 1; <em>Matter of Napoli v Supreme Ct. of State of N. Y., </em>40 AD2d 159, 33 NY2d 980, 417 US 947.) III. Defendant\u2019s unpreserved attack on four comments in the People\u2019s summation is without merit. <em>(People v Dien, </em>77 NY2d 885; <em>People v Rivera, </em>73 NY2d 941; <em>People v Balls, </em>69 NY2d 641; <em>People v Love, </em>57 NY2d 1023; <em>People v West, </em>56 NY2d 662; <em>People v Maschi, </em>49 NY2d 784; <em>People v Nuccie, </em>57 NY2d 818; <em>People v Jackson, </em>76 NY2d 908; <em>People v Hoke, </em>62 NY2d 1022; <em>United States v Curtiss, </em>330 F2d 278.) IV. Since there was no foundation offered for Clark\u2019s \"knowledge\u201d of Lewis\u2019s reputation, the court properly barred inquiry into this area. <em>(People v George, </em>67 NY2d 817; <em>People v Pavao, </em>59 NY2d 282; <em>People v Streitferdt, </em>169 AD2d 171; <em>People v Bouton, </em>50 NY2d 130; <em>People v Carlo, </em>46 AD2d 764; <em>People v Loris, </em>131 App Div 127; <em>Carlson v Winterson, </em>147 NY 652; <em>Williams v United States, </em>168 US 382.) V. The cross-examination of defendant\u2019s character witnesses about his million dollar tax lien and his huge unpaid gambling debt was proper. <em>(People v Dien, </em>77 NY2d 885; <em>People v Rivera, </em>73 NY2d 941; <em>People v Love, </em>57 NY2d 1023; <em>People v West, </em>56 NY2d 662; <em>People v Bendell, </em>111 AD2d 87, 67 NY2d 724; <em>People v Matthews, </em>68 NY2d 118; <em>People v Ruiz, </em>102 Misc 2d 465; <em>People v Nuccie, </em>57 NY2d 818.) VI. Defendant\u2019s unpreserved attack on 10 questions the Judge asked during Jean Clark\u2019s cross-examination plainly fails to make out a valid claim of improper judicial interference. <em>(People v Charleston, </em>56 NY2d 886; <em>People v Yut Wai Tom, </em>53 NY2d 44; <em>People v Maschi, </em>49 NY2d 784; <em>People v De Mauro, </em>48 NY2d 892; <em>People v Ortiz, </em>54 NY2d 288; <em>Hall v Potoker, </em>49 NY2d 501; <em>People v Michael, </em>48 NY2d 1; <em>Matter of Napoli v Supreme Ct. of State of N. Y., </em>33 NY2d 980, 417 US 947; <em>People v Jamison, </em>47 NY2d 882; <em>People v Moulton, </em>43 NY2d 944; <em>People v Hinton, </em>31 NY2d 71, 410 US 911.) VII. Defendant\u2019s prison sentence was a fair reflection of his personal culpability for this $152 million larceny, and not, in any sense, a retaliation against him for proceeding to trial. <em>(People v Hurley, </em>75 NY2d 887; <em>People v Ruz, </em>70 NY2d 942; <em>People v Ingram, </em>67 NY2d 897; <em>People v George, </em>67 NY2d 817; <em>People v Lemon, </em>62 NY2d 745; <em>People v Oliver, </em>63 NY2d 973; <em>People v Green, </em>54 NY2d 878; <em>People v McGowen, </em>42 NY2d 905; <em>United States v Hutchings, </em>757 F2d 11, 472 US 1031; <em>People v De Jesus, </em>69 NY2d 855.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"Axt\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b323-3\">Chief Judge Kaye.</author>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">A defendant in a criminal trial who has exercised the right to self-representation may not be arbitrarily and categorically excluded from sidebar conferences. That having occurred here, a new trial is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Defendant Louis Rosen, along with nine others, was indicted on charges of conspiracy, grand larceny and other felonies arising out of a complex scheme to defraud investors through the sale of real estate limited partnership tax shelters. The evidence at trial revealed that 2,400 investors lost an aggregate of $152 million and that four financial institutions were brought to the brink of collapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The conspiracy, headed by John Galanis, extended from February 1984 through June 1986. Defendant was hired by the Galanis organization in late 1984 to assume high-level financial and administrative responsibilities. Of the indicted conspirators, only defendant went to trial. The others pleaded guilty, and some cooperated with the prosecution and testified against defendant. Defendant\u2019s trial strategy was to concede the existence of a fraudulent scheme but to deny knowledge or intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">After the prosecution\u2019s first witness testified, defendant\u2019s assigned counsel sought a mistrial, arguing that questions posed by the court to the witness assisted the prosecution and that the court could not provide a fair trial because it had expressed an opinion regarding defendant\u2019s guilt in an off-the-record discussion. The court denied counsel\u2019s motion, adding: \"For that matter you told me you thought Mr. Rosen was guilty in our off the record conversation.\u201d The court also stated that its intercession in the examination was necessary because defense counsel did not ask questions properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The next morning, defense counsel moved for a mistrial and assignment of new counsel, reporting that his client had lost confidence in his ability based on the previous day\u2019s colloquy. The motion was denied. The following week, after several more witnesses testified for the People, defendant informed the court that he wished to represent himself for the remainder of the trial because of his counsel\u2019s numerous factual mistakes and inadequate cross-examination. The court explained the dangers inherent in defendant\u2019s proposed course, but after conferring with his counsel, defendant insisted. Accordingly, the court granted defendant\u2019s request to proceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>as his own lawyer, with counsel remaining as defendant\u2019s \"legal advisor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The court imposed two absolute restrictions on the arrangement. First, either defendant or his legal advisor, but not both, could question a witness; and second, defendant would not be allowed to attend any sidebar conferences. Defendant\u2019s request to attend sidebars was rejected in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">\"[counsel]: Yes, there is a matter that needs to be cleared up at this time. If Mr. Rosen plans on questioning as he does and if there is a sidebar, or if there is a sidebar which has occurred prior to this time, Mr. Rosen requests that he be allowed to attend the sidebar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">\"the court: I won\u2019t be having sidebars with Mr. Rosen. If it is necessary I will excuse the jury. There will be no sidebars with Mr. Rosen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Defendant thereafter assumed active control of his defense. He personally cross-examined 10 of the People\u2019s 11 remaining witnesses, some examinations lasting hours. (The eleventh witness was not cross-examined.) Defendant also examined five defense witnesses, introduced exhibits, made motions and delivered the summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Nevertheless, as the court had instructed, sidebar conferences did not include defendant. Some involved purely \"housekeeping\u201d matters, others substantive issues, others were off the record. Some were held in the jury\u2019s presence, others not; some were initiated by the court, others by standby counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">After the People rested, defendant (who had ordered daily copy of the transcript) complained that off-the-record conferences were unfair because reports of the conferences were secondhand and \"diluted.\u201d Defendant cited as an example a 12 to 15 minute sidebar that was summarized for him in two minutes. In the course of his request \u2014 which was granted\u2014 that all future conferences be recorded, defendant recited his understanding of the court\u2019s previous ruling whereby defendant would \"not [be] attending bench conferences, and if necessary * * * you would have the jury leave; or if the jury wasn\u2019t here you would instead of having a bench conference, you would have it in open court and on the record,\u201d to which the court responded, \"Exactly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">Defendant was convicted of conspiracy, grand larceny, securities fraud, offering a false instrument for filing and scheme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>to defraud, and sentenced to a term of imprisonment totalling 16 to 48 years, which by operation of law was reduced to 10 to 20 years. At the Appellate Division, defendant argued, among other things, that the trial court erred in excluding him, as a <em>pro se </em>defendant, from sidebar conferences. The Appellate Division affirmed, noting however that the issue was \"not free from doubt\u201d (185 AD2d 128, 130) in light of recent decisions of this Court. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Our State Constitution declares: \"In any trial in any court whatever <em>the party accused shall he allowed to appear and defend in person </em>and with counsel\u201d (NY Const, art I, \u00a7 6, emphasis added; <em>see also, People v McIntyre, </em>36 NY2d 10, 15; <em>People v Koch, </em>299 NY 378, 381; <em>People v Price, </em>262 NY 410, 411). Unlike the Federal right to self-representation, which is only implicit in the Sixth Amendment <em>(see, Faretta v California, </em>422 US 806, 818-819), the State constitutional right is explicit and unambiguous.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">It is helpful at the outset to note what this case is <em>not </em>about. A defendant v/ho has elected to proceed <em>pro se </em>is both an accused and an attorney. Accordingly, cases discussing defendant\u2019s right to be present at sidebar \u2014 solely in the role of the accused <em>(see, e.g., People v Antommarchi, </em>80 NY2d 247, 250; <em>People v Velasco, </em>77 NY2d 469, 472-473) \u2014 are inapposite. A defendant\u2019s right to be present at material stages of trial stems from the Due Process Clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions as well as statute <em>(see, People v Morales, </em>80 NY2d 450, 453-457), while the right to appear at trial in the role of attorney derives primarily from article I, \u00a7 6 of the State Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the Federal Constitution <em>(see, People v McIntyre, </em>36 NY2d, at 10; <em>Faretta v California, </em>422 US, at 818).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Nor, contrary to the People\u2019s contention, is this case about discretionary trial management. Although a Judge may reasonably limit the conduct of sidebar discussions, the court\u2019s summary order that there \"will be no sidebars with Mr. Rosen,\u201d arbitrarily impacting as it did only defendant (but not standby counsel or the two prosecutors) reveals that the preclusion was not evenhandedly imposed to manage the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>orderly progress of the proceedings. Indeed, the court offered to dismiss the jury if defendant wished to address the court, a more disruptive measure than simply allowing defendant to stand at sidebar.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The issue that <em>is </em>presented here is whether the trial court may, consistent with the State constitutional provision securing the right to \"appear and defend in person,\u201d arbitrarily bar only the <em>pro se </em>defendant from sidebar conferences despite his specific request to attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">A defendant\u2019s desire to conduct the defense may arise from a variety of reasons, ranging from the practical to the nefarious <em>(see, People v McIntyre, </em>36 NY2d, at 16). Here, defendant was motivated by dissatisfaction with his counsel\u2019s performance. Indeed, by all accounts, defendant was considerably more familiar than counsel with the intricate workings of Galanis\u2019 operation and the 12,000 pages of discovery material. His motion for a mistrial to obtain new counsel having been denied, defendant concluded, after appropriate judicial admonition, that his interests would be furthered by self-representation. Such a decision obviously entailed both risks and benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">A defendant lacking legal training and courtroom experience may be at a decided disadvantage in carrying out the complex task of presenting a defense. Thus, most defendants choose to be represented by counsel, and necessarily delegate substantial control of the case to the lawyer, except for certain fundamental decisions \u2014 for example, whether to testify or waive a jury <em>(People v Ferguson, </em>67 NY2d 383, 390). Hence, the accused ordinarily plays a relatively passive advocacy role and is bound by the innumerable strategic choices made by counsel during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">By contrast, the status of a defendant who elects to proceed <em>pro se </em>changes dramatically. The defendant has perforce rejected a passive role and has chosen, for better or worse, to participate actively in all aspects of the case. Indeed, the law confers upon that defendant \"certain specific rights to have his [or her] voice heard\u201d <em>(McKaskle v Wiggins, </em>465 US 168, 174):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-9\">\"The <em>pro se </em>defendant must be allowed to control the organization and content of his [or her] own defense, to make motions, to argue points of law, to participate in <em>voir dire, </em>to question witnesses, and to address the court and the jury at appropriate points in the trial.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at 174.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>In the present case, the trial court \u2014 although not required to do so <em>(see, People v Mirenda, </em>57 NY2d 261, 264)\u2014 allowed the defense to flexibly fashion the roles of the <em>pro se </em>defendant and standby counsel. Thus to the extent standby counsel joined in the proceedings without defendant\u2019s protest, it may be presumed that defendant waived the opportunity to personally execute the particular function <em>(see, McKaskle v Wiggins, </em>465 US, at 182). On this record, however, that presumption may not be invoked with respect to the sidebars.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Indisputably, a defense representative, acting as counsel, was entitled to attend sidebars. While the People argue that standby counsel\u2019s appearances at the conferences reflected the \"division of labor\u201d chosen by defendant, and that the trial court could not have known that defendant wished to participate, those claims are belied by defendant\u2019s specific request to be present. On this record, the logical conclusion is that the division of labor, at least in connection with sidebar conferences, was imposed, not chosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">We also reject the argument that defendant\u2019s claim is unpreserved. The People fault defendant for \"dropping] the subject without further discussion\u201d after the court announced its ruling denying defendant\u2019s request to attend sidebars. However, defendant\u2019s specific application and the court\u2019s equally specific ruling were sufficient to preserve the issue for appeal <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.05 [2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Moreover, at the close of the People\u2019s case, defendant again expressed an interest in the sidebars. Acknowledging the court\u2019s previous ruling that he could \"not attend[ ] bench conferences\u201d \u2014 which the Judge confirmed \u2014 defendant requested that the sidebars at least be recorded. Defendant\u2019s acquiescence in the court\u2019s unequivocal preclusion order, and his attempt to salvage what he could by seeking to have the conferences transcribed, cannot be deemed a waiver of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">The right to appear <em>pro se </em>exists, in part, \"to affirm the dignity and autonomy of the accused\u201d <em>(McKaskle v Wiggins, </em>465 US, at 176-177). Those values are threatened when a defendant who has assumed the risks inherent in self-representation is arbitrarily denied, despite specific request, the opportunity to attend sidebar discussions. Additionally, to the extent sidebars are conducted in the jury\u2019s presence, there may be a danger that the \"jury\u2019s perception that the defendant is representing himself [or herself]\u201d will be destroyed <em>(id., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>at 178). Of course, the right to attend sidebars is no broader than the right to self-representation itself, which may within an appropriate exercise of discretion be denied or divested <em>(see, People v McIntyre, </em>36 NY2d, at 17-18). Here, however, the trial court advanced no reason for its refusal to permit defendant to attend sidebars. In these circumstances, we conclude that defendant\u2019s State constitutional right to self-representation was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In light of this conclusion, we need not consider defendant\u2019s alternative arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Judges Simons, Titone, Hancock, Jr., and Bellacosa concur; Judge Smith taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\"> While the 1777 and 1821 State Constitutions merely provided that the accused \"shall be allowed counsel\u201d (NY Const art XXXIV [1777]; NY Const, art VII, \u00a7 7 [1821]), the explicit right to \"appear and defend in person\u201d was added in 1846 (NY Const, art I, \u00a7 6), and has been retained in our Constitution ever since.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
