In 1984, the Legislature amended that paragraph to expand the scope of its exclusion (L 1984, ch 670). The issue in this appeal is whether the previously existing requirement that the People must exercise \"due diligence\u201d in locating an \"absent\u201d defendant or obtaining an \"unavailable\u201d defendant\u2019s presence applies to cases arising under the amendment. We hold that, far from exempting such cases from the \"due diligence\u201d requirement, the amendment expressly incorporates it. Accordingly, the People cannot obtain the benefit of the exclusion in these circumstances without satisfactorily demonstrating their compliance with that precondition.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">The underlying facts are not in dispute. Defendant was arraigned on a felony complaint charging him with first degree robbery and related offenses on September 19, 1987. Three days later, he was released on his own recognizance <em>(see, </em>CPL 180.80). The felony complaint was subsequently replaced by an indictment that was filed on November 13, 1987. Defendant failed to appear for his arraignment on that indictment, which was scheduled for November 24, 1987. On December 7, 1987, a bench warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest was issued. Defendant was not returned to court on the warrant until April 28, 1988, which was some 143 days after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>warrant\u2019s issuance. The People did not declare their readiness on the record at any point during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">On May 10, 1988, defense counsel moved to dismiss the indictment under CPL 30.30, arguing that there had been a total of 198 unexcused days of delay attributable to the People and that, consequently, the People had failed to satisfy the statutory six-month readiness requirement. With regard to the 143-day period between the issuance of the bench warrant and defendant\u2019s return on that warrant, defense counsel asserted that \"[d]uring that time, the defendant\u2019s location [at a specified address] was known to the prosecution and defendant\u2019s presence could have been obtained had the prosecution exercised due diligence.\u201d The People\u2019s only response was that the entire period in question was excludable from the People\u2019s time to become ready because \"[i]n light of the 1984 statutory amendment to [CPL] \u00a7 30.30 (4) (c), due diligence need not be shown.\u201d The People did not dispute defense counsel\u2019s factual assertions concerning defendant\u2019s whereabouts during the contested period. Additionally, they did not dispute the contention that they should be charged with the 55-day period between defendant\u2019s initial arraignment on the felony complaint and the November 13, 1987 filing of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The trial court adopted the People\u2019s position and denied defendant\u2019s dismissal motion. The court observed that the 1984 amendment on which the People relied had been enacted \"to exclude from statutory speedy-trial considerations, the period of time during which a bench-warranted defendant voluntarily fails to appear in court.\u201d Thus, the court concluded, the need for the People to demonstrate due diligence in attempting to secure the defendant\u2019s return had been \"obviated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Defendant was subsequently tried before a jury and convicted of attempted first degree robbery and fourth degree criminal possession of a weapon. On appeal, the Appellate Division, Second Department, upheld the judgment of conviction, holding that the 1984 amendment to CPL 30.30 (4) (c) had been intended to eliminate any \"due diligence\u201d requirement in these circumstances (174 AD2d 111). The Court specifically rejected the First Department\u2019s holding in <em>People v Quiles (see, </em>176 AD2d 164), in which the contrary conclusion had been reached (174 AD2d, at 116, n). Defendant then took a further appeal by leave of a Judge of this Court. We now reverse the order of the Second Department and hold that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>People\u2019s failure to exercise due diligence in attempting to locate defendant or secure his presence is fatal to their claim for an exclusion under CPL 30.30 (4) (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">CPL 30.30 requires that the People become ready for trial within six months of the commencement of a felony prosecution, subject to certain enumerated exclusions. Among those exclusions is the one described in CPL 30.30 (4) (c), which, as originally enacted, excepted from the time in which the People must become ready \"the period of delay <em>resulting from </em>the absence or unavailability of the defendant\u201d (emphasis supplied). As amended in 1984 (L 1984, ch 670), the paragraph now also permits an exclusion for \"the period <em>extending from </em>the day the court issues a bench warrant * * * to the day the defendant subsequently appears in the court\u201d in situations \"where the defendant is absent or unavailable and * * * has previously been released on bail or on his own recognizance\u201d (emphasis supplied). The paragraph\u2019s final clause provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">\"A defendant must be considered absent whenever his location is unknown and he is attempting to avoid apprehension or prosecution, <em>or his location cannot be determined by due diligence. A </em>defendant must be considered unavailable whenever his location is known <em>but his presence for trial cannot be obtained by due diligence\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The first issue in this appeal is whether this definitional clause, which was part of the statute before 1984, was intended to apply to the class of \"absent\u201d or \"unavailable\u201d defendants referred to in the amendment, as well as to the \"absent\u201d or \"unavailable\u201d defendants referred to in the preexisting portion of the statute. The second issue is whether this clause, if applicable, was intended as the <em>exclusive </em>definition of the statutory terms \"absent\u201d and \"unavailable\u201d in these circumstances. The underlying question is whether the final clause\u2019s requirement that the People exercise \"due diligence\u201d in attempting to locate an \"absent\u201d defendant or secure the presence of an \"unavailable\u201d one is applicable where a bench warrant has been issued and remains outstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Despite the seemingly clear language of the statute, the People contend that the clause defining \"absence\u201d and \"unavailability,\u201d which includes the \"due diligence\u201d requirement, was not intended to apply to claims for exclusion based on the 1984 amendment. According to the People, \"absence\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>\"unavailability\u201d under the amendment mean something different than they mean elsewhere in the subdivision. In the People\u2019s view, a defendant is \"absent\u201d or \"unavailable\u201d within the meaning of the amendment simply because he has escaped or failed to appear in court when required. However, there is no support for the premise that \"absent\u201d and \"unavailable\u201d mean one thing when the period of delay in question involves an outstanding bench warrant and something else when the delay merely \"resulted] from\u201d the defendant\u2019s absence or unavailability.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Initially, the argument the People advance is inconsistent with basic principles of statutory construction. It is elementary that \"where the same word or phrase is used in different parts of a statute, it will be presumed to be used in the same sense throughout, and the same meaning will be attached to similar expressions in the same or a related statute\u201d (McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 236, at 401; <em>see, Mangam v City of Brooklyn, </em>98 NY 585).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Furthermore, it is unreasonable to suggest that the Legislature, which was at pains to provide a statutory definition for \"absent\u201d and \"available\u201d when it initially enacted CPL 30.30 (4) (c), would ignore the structure it had created and use those exact terms in a different sense when it amended that paragraph. Such an inference is particularly far-fetched in this context, where the statute in question is detailed, precisely worded and contains numerous interlocking provisions. Given the Legislature\u2019s precision in drafting all of the other subdivisions of CPL 30.30, the Legislature would undoubtedly have used different words if it intended the terms \"absent\u201d and \"unavailable\u201d to have a different meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Further, contrary to the dissenter\u2019s contentions, there is nothing in the legislative history or the circumstances surrounding the enactment of the 1984 amendment to suggest that the Legislature intended not to incorporate the statute\u2019s requirement of prosecutorial \"due diligence\u201d into the amendment\u2019s new exclusion for periods of \"absence\u201d and \"unavailability\u201d that are accompanied by outstanding bench warrants. It is beyond dispute that the 1984 amendment to CPL 30.30 (4) (c) was intended to overrule this Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v Sturgis </em>(38 NY2d 625), in which it was held that the exclusion for periods of the defendant\u2019s absence should not be applied where there was no causative relationship between the defendant\u2019s absence or unavailability and the People\u2019s delay in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>preparing their case <em>(see also, People v Colon, </em>59 NY2d 921).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This holding was based directly on the language of CPL 30.30 (4) (c), which at that time provided for an exclusion only for periods of delay \"resulting from\u201d the defendant\u2019s absence or unavailability.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The <em>Sturgis </em>holding created what some policy-makers perceived as an untoward consequence, in that it \"forced [prosecutors] to present cases to grand juries even after defendants have jumped bail\u201d (Governor\u2019s Program Bill Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1984, ch 670; <em>but cfi, People v Bratton, </em>65 NY2d 675, <em>affg </em>103 AD2d 368). Accordingly, the Governor proposed, and the Legislature passed, an amendment to CPL 30.30 (4) (c) whose specific purpose was \"to correct [the] problem created by the * * * decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Sturgis\u201d </em>(Governor\u2019s Approval Mem, 1984 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 3628; <em>see also, </em>Mem from Attorney-General Robert Abrams, June 8, 1984, Bill Jacket, <em>op. cit). </em>The specific mechanism chosen to accomplish that goal was the addition of narrow language exempting from the \"resulting from\u201d proviso those cases in which the absent or unavailable defendant had previously been released on bail or recognizance and was the subject of an outstanding bench warrant. Nothing in the language or history of the amendment suggests an intent to delete, rather than incorporate, the preexisting requirement of prosecutorial diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Indeed, since the holding in <em>Sturgis </em>did not concern the \"due diligence\u201d requirement of CPL 30.30 (4) (c), the most that can be said is that the drafters of the <em>Sturgis </em>amendment were unconcerned about that aspect of the exclusion. Thus, notwithstanding the dissenter\u2019s arguments, no inferences can be drawn from the fact that several of the memoranda in the Bill Jacket use formulations such as \"escape[ ] from custody\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>or \"fail[ure] to appear in court when required\u201d and do not specifically repeat the statutory \"due diligence\u201d element in connection with their use of the terms \"absent\u201d and \"unavailable\u201d <em>(see, e.g., </em>Governor\u2019s Approval Mem, 1984 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 3628). In fact, to the extent that any of the memoranda in the Bill Jacket <em>do </em>focus on the requirement of prosecutorial \"due diligence,\u201d they assume without extended discussion that that requirement would continue to be applicable (Letter from Off of Ct Admin, July 18, 1984, Bill Jacket, <em>op. cit.; </em>Letter from Richmond County Dist Attorney, June 13, 1984, Bill Jacket, <em>op. cit.). </em>The fact that these memoranda also advocate <em>additional </em>legislation to eliminate the \"due diligence\u201d requirement \u2014 a fact on which the dissent relies \u2014 only serves to strengthen our conclusion that the 1984 amendment was not itself directed toward accomplishing that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">To be sure, the legislative goal underlying the enactment of the <em>Sturgis </em>amendment was, as the Appellate Division observed, \"to lessen the People\u2019s burden in discharging their 'speedy trial\u2019 obligation where a defendant has absconded\u201d (174 AD2d, at 115, <em>supra; see, </em>1984 Supp Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11 A, CPL 30.30, 1992 Supp Pamph, at 64-65). However, the specific burden that the amendment was aimed at reducing was the People\u2019s duty to show a causative relationship between the defendant\u2019s absence and their delay, not their wholly independent duty to show \"due diligence\u201d in locating or producing the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We also reject the People\u2019s alternative argument that, despite CPL 30.30 (4) (c)\u2019s language, the courts are free to consider defendants to be \"absent\u201d or \"unavailable\u201d in \"other unspecified circumstances,\u201d including those in which no prosecutorial diligence has been shown. Even assuming that CPL 30.30 (4) (c)\u2019s definition of \"absent\u201d and \"unavailable\u201d defendants was not intended to be exhaustive, as the People contend,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it would defy common sense to suggest that the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>ture, which was at pains to incorporate a requirement of prosecutorial diligence where the defendant\u2019s \"location cannot be determined\u201d or \"his presence for trial cannot be obtained,\u201d also intended to include as \"other unspecified circumstances\u201d cases that would fit the statutory definition <em>but for the absence of the diligence element.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The People\u2019s final argument concerns the impracticality of requiring them to make diligent efforts to enforce bench warrants as a condition to invoking the exclusion provided by the 1984 amendment. In support of this argument, the People point out that in 1991 there were a total of 435,574 bench warrants outstanding in New York City and that fully a third of these had been issued in the preceding year alone. Further, in an argument that has been adopted by the dissent, the People stress what they perceive as the undesirable consequences of permitting absconding defendants to benefit from their own misconduct by obtaining CPL 30.30 dismissals for delays occurring during periods when they have absented themselves. Such arguments, however, entail questions of policy that go well beyond the question of statutory construction that we are empowered to resolve on this appeal. Where a statute is clear and unambiguous, our role is limited to ensuring that the Legislature\u2019s will is implemented. Unambiguous statutes must be read as written, unless changed circumstances have rendered it anachronistic <em>(Doctors Council v New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>71 NY2d 669, 674-675).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">In this instance, the legislative design is clear. By adopting the 1984 amendment to CPL 30.30 (4) (c), the Legislature relieved the People of their burden of showing a causative relationship between the defendant\u2019s absence and their delay, but the <em>quid pro quo </em>was that the People had to obtain a bench warrant as precondition for availing themselves of the relaxed burden of proof. Manifestly, having taken the trouble to inject the new requirement of a bench warrant into the equation, the Legislature did not intend the bench warrants to be treated as empty paper symbols. Nor did it contemplate that our law enforcement authorities would be relieved of their obligation to attempt to enforce judicially issued process because of the large number of outstanding bench warrants or the limited chances of success. To the contrary, the more plausible inference is that the Legislature expected and <em>intended </em>that the People would exercise \"due diligence\u201d in the enforcement of the bench warrants that the new statute required. To the extent that the People perceive such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>expectation to be unrealistic or unworkable, their arguments would be more appropriately addressed to the Legislature, which has the authority to make the necessary policy choices.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Contrary to the People\u2019s contentions, it is hardly an absurd result from the judiciary\u2019s perspective for this, the State\u2019s highest Court, to adopt a construction requiring the People to make reasonable efforts to enforce the warrants issued by the lower court Judges of this State.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In sum, both the legislative history and the unambiguous language of CPL 30.30 (4) (c) point inexorably to the conclusion that prosecutorial diligence in locating the defendant and/or securing his presence must be shown in order to invoke the exclusion for periods when the defendant was \"absent\u201d or \"unavailable\u201d and a bench warrant for his apprehension was outstanding. Here, no such showing was made. In fact, the People did not even attempt to refute defendant\u2019s claim that his address was known to the People during the entire period in question and that his presence could have been secured had the People exercised the required diligence. Nor did they attempt to show that defendant\u2019s \"location [wa]s unknown and he [wa]s attempting to avoid apprehension or prosecution,\u201d a circumstance that would not require a showing of due diligence under the literal terms of the statute (CPL 30.30 [4] [c]). To the extent that the People now attempt to bring themselves within this category, their claim is unpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>served and is therefore not cognizable in this Court <em>(see, e.g., People v Cortes, </em>80 NY2d 201).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">In the absence of any statutorily cognizable ground for doing so, the 143-day period when a bench warrant for defendant\u2019s apprehension was outstanding should not have been excluded from the People\u2019s time to become ready. And, since this period, when added to the 55 other days of unexcused delay, exceeds the six-month period in which the People were statutorily required to become ready under CPL 30.30, the indictment against defendant should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss granted and the indictment dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-7\">. The dissenter\u2019s reliance on <em>People v Patterson </em>(38 NY2d 623) is puzzling. First, since that decision was published in 1976, it could have no bearing on the meaning or significance of the 1984 amendment to CPL 30.30 (4) (c). Second, and more importantly, the outcome in <em>Patterson </em>was premised on the existence of a period \"when it could be found that defendant\u2019s location was unknown <em>and he was attempting to avoid prosecution </em>(CPL 30.30, subd 4, par [c])\u201d (38 NY2d, at 625 [emphasis supplied]). Under the plain language of the statute as it existed both before and after the 1984 amendment, the quoted language constitutes a separate and independent ground for categorizing a defendant as \"absent,\u201d without regard to whether the People have exercised \"due diligence.\u201d Thus, the holding in <em>Patterson </em>has no relevance to this dispute, in which the People did not even attempt to argue in the trial court that defendant was \"attempting to avoid prosecution\u201d by his absence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\">. Contrary to the dissenter\u2019s argument (dissenting opn, at 158), our holding does not in any way \"increase\u201d the People\u2019s burden. Rather, it simply leaves intact the burden they had before the 1984 amendment of showing \"due diligence\u201d as a precondition to claiming excludable time under CPL 30.30 (4) (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b235-8\">. We express no opinion at this point as to whether, as a general proposition, there may be circumstances other than those enumerated in the statute when a defendant may be considered \"absent\u201d or \"unavailable\u201d for the purpose of determining the People\u2019s entitlement to the exclusion set forth in CPL 30.30 (4) (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b237-6\">. Similarly, the dissenter\u2019s suggestion that legislation such as CPL 30.30 and Family Court Act \u00a7 340.1 \"provides inducements to incorrigibility and disregard for the law and its processes\u201d (dissenting opn, at 157) involve matters of policy that are exclusively within the legislative province. We note only that CPL 30.30, the statute at issue here, was designed to regulate the conduct of prosecutors, not criminal offenders, and that, consequently, our interpretative efforts must be directed toward encouraging prosecutorial compliance, rather than to the larger goal of deterring crime. Further, no legislative choice or decision of this Court relating to a technical provision like CPL 30.30 or Family Court Act \u00a7 340.1 could promote \"incorrigibility and disregard for the law\u201d as much as the conceded inability of the State to enforce judicially issued bench warrants and the equally disturbing suggestion that we should construe CPL 30.30 (4) (c) so as to accommodate and excuse that shortcoming.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b237-7\">. Contrary to the dissenter\u2019s expressed views, our interpretation of CPL 30.30 (4) (c) does not relieve absconders of \"their singularly personal responsibility to honor the original court process\u201d nor does it \"make[ ] it worthwhile for defendants to abscond\u201d (dissenting opn, at 156, 159). What the dissenter overlooks is that the law already provides substantial penalties in the form of criminal sanctions for the offense of bail jumping <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 215.55-215.57; <em>see also, </em>\u00a7 70.25 [2-c] [requiring sentence for bail jumping to run consecutively absent \"mitigating circumstances\u201d]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b238-7\">Bellacosa, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY\">(dissenting). We respectfully dissent and vote to affirm the conviction for attempted robbery in the first degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">A bench warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest had to be issued on December 7, 1987 because, after having been released on his own recognizance, he failed to return to court on two separate occasions to answer criminal charges. He was finally apprehended and returned on the warrant on April 28, 1988. Defendant, as appellant before this Court, now contends that the time during which he violated the terms of his release should be counted against the People\u2019s responsibility to be ready for trial within a prescribed period. This bold argument succeeds and the indictment against him is dismissed because the People failed to use \"due diligence\u201d to go out and again bring him back to court.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">In our view, this result contradicts the spirit and letter of CPL 30.30 (4) (c), the ready trial rule. That statute does not retain the requirement of prosecutorial due diligence in circumstances such as these, where defendants render themselves fugitives necessitating that the People seek a judicial warrant for their arrest and return to stand trial. To hold the People accountable for this time relieves defendants of their singularly personal responsibility to honor the original court process that freed them pending criminal charges. This statutory construction grants defendants an irresistible incentive not to appear to answer criminal charges because the reward is the ultimate, ironic windfall \u2014 dismissal of those very charges. In like fashion, the Legislature has created a parallel universe with Family Court Act \u00a7 340.1, which is the func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>tional equivalent of CPL 30.30, and thus provides inducements to incorrigibility and disregard for the law and its processes by countless juveniles <em>(see, Matter of Randy K., </em>77 NY2d 398; <em>see also, Matter of Natasha C., </em>80 NY2d 678).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The ready trial rule, CPL 30.30 (4) (c), was amended in 1984 to exclude \"the period extending from the day the court issues a bench warrant pursuant to section 530.70 because of the defendant\u2019s failure to appear in court when required, to the day the defendant subsequently appears in the court pursuant to a bench warrant or voluntarily or otherwise\u201d. The demise of the due diligence requirement in situations in which a bench warrant has been issued is also readily deducible from <em>People v Patterson </em>(38 NY2d 623), which was decided the same day as <em>People v Sturgis </em>(38 NY2d 625). In <em>Patterson, </em>the defendant, who was employed at a parking lot \"in close proximity to the county jail\u201d during the time that there was an outstanding bench warrant for his arrest due to his failure to appear in court, indicated that he was waiting for the authorities \"to come and get him\u201d (38 NY2d, <em>supra, </em>at 625). Without discussing due diligence, the Court held that this period of time was not to be counted against the People because the defendant was attempting to avoid prosecution <em>(id.). </em>Notably, <em>Patterson </em>has recently been construed as holding that defendants do not have to act affirmatively \u2014 if they fail to appear in court as required, the People are not charged with that time <em>(see, People v Jackson, </em>150 AD2d 609, 610; <em>People v Yanez, </em>128 Misc 2d 716, 719). To relegate <em>Patterson </em>into solitary oblivion \u2014 \"no bearing on the meaning or significance of the 1984 amendment to CPL 30.30 (4) (c)\u201d (majority opn, at 152, n 1) \u2014 is puzzling, because if the Legislature did not overrule it, this Court should not do so <em>sub silentio </em>in this context. Since the Legislature is presumed here to have been aware of it and did not touch it, apparently because its holding is consistent with the amendment, it should still be binding and useful law.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In any event, we all agree that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v Sturgis </em>(38 NY2d 625, <em>supra) </em>was the impetus for the 1984 amendment. However, the conclusion next drawn by the Court that the amendment addresses only the narrow issue of reducing \"the People\u2019s duty to show a causative relationship between the defendant\u2019s absence and their delay\u201d (majority opn, at 153) is too restrictive and lacks authoritative statutory construction support.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>The definitions and categories of excludable or includable time and circumstances in this complex statute are not mutually exclusive and must each be given effective meaning <em>(Anglin v Anglin, </em>80 NY2d 553, 555-556). The central thrust of the amendment and the Legislature\u2019s manifest intent were evidenced in the most overt way \u2014 an explicit overruling of a prior precedent of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">It is axiomatic that legislative intent is \u201ccollected from the context, from the occasion and necessity of the law, from the mischief felt, and the objects and the remedy in view\u201d (1 Kent, Commentaries on American Law, at 462, quoted in <em>Matter of Di Brizzi, </em>303 NY 206, 220). The remedial objective of the statute must be considered in construing a statute <em>(see, Matter of Toomey v New York State Legislature, </em>2 NY2d 446, 448; McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 95). A standard proposition of statutory construction is that the courts should not interpret in such a way that produces \u201cabsurd\u201d results <em>(Milbrandt v Green Refractories Co., </em>79 NY2d 26, 36; <em>People v Boston, </em>75 NY2d 585, 588; <em>Doctors Council v New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>71 NY2d 669, 675). As the Court acknowledges, the underlying purpose of the amendment to CPL 30.30 (4) (c) was \u201c 'to lessen the People\u2019s burden in discharging their \u201cspeedy trial\u201d obligation where a defendant has absconded\u2019 \u201d (majority opn, at 153, quoting <em>People v Bolden, </em>174 AD2d 111, 115). This goal is turned on its head if the People must exert due diligence in returning a defendant against whom a bench warrant has been issued for failure to appear in court as required to answer criminal charges. The People\u2019s burdens are increased, not \"lessened,\u201d by the Court\u2019s construction of the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Weighty legislative history of the 1984 amendment supports the argument tendered by the People, whose position was accepted by the Appellate Division and which we, too, find persuasive. The Governor\u2019s Approval Memorandum stated that the amendment excludes the period that a bench warrant is outstanding against defendants who are absent or unavailable <em>because </em>they have \u201cescaped from custody or [have] failed to appear in court when required\u201d (1984 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 3628). The absence of any discussion of an additional requirement of a showing of prosecutorial due diligence is strong evidence that none was thought or intended to survive. Additional support for this view is found in several other legislative memorandums supporting the amendment <em>(see, e.g., </em>Letter from Dept of Correctional Servs, June 8, 1984, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Bill Jacket, L 1984, ch 670 [time when defendant is a fugitive is excluded]; Mem of State Grim Justice Coordinator [Kurlander], June 11, 1984, Bill Jacket, <em>op. cit. [\"all of the time </em>during which a bench warrant is outstanding against the defendant will expressly not be counted\u201d (emphasis added)]; Letter of State Commn of Correction, June 22, 1984, Bill Jacket, <em>op. cit. </em>[time where defendant is a fugitive is excluded]), as well as in memorandum submitted in opposition <em>(see, e.g., </em>Letter from Legis Representative of Legal Aid Socy, June 18, 1984, Bill Jacket, <em>op. cit. </em>[exclude time where \"defendant is absent or unavailable <em>because </em>either he has escaped from custody or, his having been released, he fails to appear in court when required\u201d] [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The Court cites two bill jacket memorandums to support the reversal in this case (majority opn, at 153). While those items assume that the due diligence requirement survived the statutory amendment, insufficient attention is given to the underlying current of those memorandums \u2014 strong dissatisfaction with the retention of the due diligence burden in instances such as this case. Indeed, the memorandum of the Office of Court Administration includes a recommendation that the requirement be clearly removed (Legislative Mem from Off of Ct Admin, May 31, 1984, Bill Jacket, <em>op. cit. </em>[communicating opposition of the Advisory Committee on Criminal Law and Procedure \"to the extent that it continues to condition excludability of the period during which a bench warrant is outstanding upon the people\u2019s exercise of due diligence in attempting to locate defendant\u201d]). In any event, none of the memorandums cited by the majority or this dissent constitutes an authoritative or unequivocal manifestation of the Legislature\u2019s intention to retain or abandon the due diligence requirement when a bench warrant situation is interposed. The job of unearthing that intent rests uniquely and ultimately on this Court, which may not draw definitive inferences from the collective or competing viewpoints of various nonneutral special interest depositors into the legislative \"Bill Jacket\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Public policy considerations, manifest in the legislative history, further fuel the conclusion that due diligence is irrelevant in the bench warrant situations. Imposition of that requirement on the People induces and makes it worthwhile for defendants to abscond, since the massive number of outstanding bench warrants renders it not only highly unlikely, but near to impossible, that any of such defendants will be returned other than accidentally or for new criminal conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>within the ready time limits <em>(see, </em>Letter from Richmond County Dist Attorney, June 13, 1984, Bill Jacket, <em>op. cit. </em>[as of December 1983 more than 300,000 outstanding bench warrants in the City of New York]; Letter from New York State Defenders Assn. Inc., June 12, 1984, Bill Jacket, <em>op. cit. </em>[bill should be rejected \"because it may actually encourage defendants to abscond\u201d]; Legislative Mem from Off of Ct Admin, May 31, 1984, Bill Jacket, <em>op. cit.). </em>This is precisely the undesirable consequence that the Legislature targeted in overruling <em>People v Sturgis </em>(38 NY2d 625, <em>supra; see, </em>Letter from Off of Mayor of City of NY, June 13, 1984, Bill Jacket, <em>op. cit.; </em>Letter from Nassau County Dist Attorney, June 11, 1984, Bill Jacket, <em>op. cit). </em>Moreover, it is hard to imagine anything more self-defeating than the expenditure of finite prosecutorial resources to chase after hundreds of thousands of bench warrant scoffers in lieu of using those resources to try the cases themselves. Indeed, and most unfortunately, prosecutors and courts are likely to be far more wary and reluctant to allow for pretrial releases in the teeth of the likely denouements of this interpretation of CPL 30.30. This does not well serve defendants\u2019 interests or that of the fair and speedy administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">We completely support the view that the ready trial statute strikes an important balance, including necessary protections to defendants against prosecutorial delays <em>(see, People v Santana, </em>80 NY2d 92, 110 [concurring opn, Titone and Bellacosa, JJ.]). The statute is designed to accomplish its laudable goals, however, without superimposing a self-contradictory due diligence requirement on the People in these circumstances \u2014 a time factor attributable solely to the actions of released defendants, who are either negligently or intentionally scornful of the law\u2019s express dictates to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">We would affirm the order of the Appellate Division upholding the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Acting Chief Judge Simons and Judges Kaye and Hancock, Jr., concur with Judge Titone; Judge Bellacosa dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion in which Judge Smith concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
