HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b738-19\">The question in this case is whether the wages \u2014 as distinct from maintenance and cure \u2014 due to a seaman who has fallen ill upon a ship, sailing under the Panamanian Flag, end when he gets back to the port where he has signed on, or whether they continue thereafter until he recovers. Both sides offered translations, which differed slightly, of the controlling article of the Panamanian Code \u2014 Article 1217. The li-bellant\u2019s reads as follows: \u201cA seaman who may become ill or receive injury or mutilation shall be entitled not only to wages up to the time of his recovery but up to the day on which he shall be fit to return to the port of his enrollment, and shall further be entitled to a reasonable sum for his return expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-20\">The respondent\u2019s version is: \u201cAny member of the crew who is ill, wounded or mutilated shall have the right not only to his wages until he recovers, but also until the day in which he may be back in the port of his engagement and he shall receive in-addition a reasonable sum for repatriation expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-21\">The only significant difference is that in the respondent\u2019s version the words \u201cthe day on which he shall be fit to return to the port\u201d appear as: \u201cthe day in which he may be back in the port.\u201d The respondent called a witness, versed in Spanish law and in the law of Panama, who swore that the libel-lant\u2019s translation was based upon a misunderstanding of the Spanish phrase: \u201cpueda estar de regreso.\u201d Although it was true, he said, that \u201cpueda\u201d was from the verb, \u201cpoder,\u201d and meant \u201cto be able to,\u201d yet when it was used as here in conjunction with \u201cestar,\u201d it merely put that verb into the subjunctive mood, so that the phrase as a whole did not mean the day on which the seaman was able \u2014 \u201cfit\u201d\u2014to return to port, where he had signed on; but that day on which he might arrive at that port. The judge found that the expert\u2019s translation was correct, but that in the case before him it did not matter which was right, because in any event the libellant was \u201cfit\u201d to go to New York \u2014 where he had signed on \u2014 when the ship reached Baltimore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>where he was discharged. This is true; and, for that matter, the respondent\u2019s translation was more favorable to seamen anyway than the libellant\u2019s, for they might be \u201cfit\u201d to return to the port where they had signed on before they actually did return.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Having disposed of this irrelevant issue, the judge held that the period defined by the clause beginning \u201cbut\u201d was necessarily an addition to that defined by the clause beginning \u201cnot only\u201d; and in this too we agree. If the order of the two clauses be reversed, so that they read that a seaman is entitled to wages, not only until the ship returns, but until he recovers, there could be no doubt that any period of recovery would be added to the duration of the voyage, if the seaman continued ill; and, if so, a corresponding construction ought to be given to the sequence actually chosen. What the libellant must really maintain is that the clauses mean the same thing as though they had read: \u201cuntil the seaman recovers, or the ship returns, whichever is later.\u201d It needs no argument to show that that would have been a very different locution. Moreover, the respondent\u2019s reading is far more reasonable. It is one thing to secure to a seaman his wages for the whole voyage though he may still be unable to work the ship: it is quite another thing to give him wages (as distinct from maintenance and cure), for as long as he remains ill after the voyage has ended. The second would be nothing short of indefinite sickness insurance at full pay: certainly a purpose not gratuitously to be imputed to a maritime statute, in which it would be unique, so far as we know.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Finally, the provenance of Article 1217 puts the respondent\u2019s interpretation beyond question. It appeared at the trial that the Republic of Panama had retained a legal expert, named Anderson, to prepare its code; and that he used as his model the Colombian Code, which was based upon the Chilean Code, which in its turn came from the Spanish Code. The corresponding article of the Chilean and Colombian Codes\u2014 which are literally the same \u2014 is that a seaman who falls ill shall have \u201cthe wages agreed upon up to his return to the port of departure\u201d; in the Spanish Code the phrase is that he \u201cdoes not lose his right to wages during the voyage.\u201d It is utterly incredible that Anderson, by the change in diction which he adopted, intended so radical a transformation of the rights of seamen as that which the libellant asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
