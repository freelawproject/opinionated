Schlueter v. Watkins, 67 F.Supp. 556. We agree with him that the statute authorized the making of an order of removal of an alien enemy without a court order and without a hearing of any kind, except on the issue of whether or not the relator actually is an alien enemy which was not controverted in this case. Minotto v. Bradley, N.D.Ill., 252 F. 600. 50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 24 refers, disjunctively, to executive action pursuant to \u00a7 21 or to a court order. Court jurisdiction, conferred solely by \u00a7 23, arises only when a \u201ccomplaint\u201d is filed by a citizen. When the procedure is through executive action, the statute calls for no hearing in court or elsewhere. Early in its history, the statute was so construed by Mr. Justice Washington; Lockington v. Smith, C.C.D.Pa., 1817 15 Fed.Cas. No. 8448, p. 758.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-24\">We agree with Judge Rifkind, and with Judge Prettyman\u2019s opinion in Citizens Protective League v. Clark, App.D.C., 155 F.2d 290 that the statute, thus construed, is constitutional. The President duly exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>cised his statutory power in Proclamations Nos. 2526 and 2655. They did not compel a hearing which would meet the requirements of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-25\"> See also Lockington\u2019s Case, Brightly N.
