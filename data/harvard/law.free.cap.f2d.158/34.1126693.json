R. Herndon,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Claimant, appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-19\">The case was presented on an agreed statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-20\">On November 9, 1945, Investigators for the United States Alcohol Tax Unit entered the premises of the Claimant and seized the liquor in question, all of which contained more than four per cent of alcohol by volume. The search and seizure was made under the authority of a search warrant issued by a United States Commissioner. At the time of the seizure, the Claimant had a United States Retail Liquor Dealer Special Tax Stamp, which had been purchased about September 1, 1945, but he did not hold a permit allowing transportation of liquor into Kansas, issued by the State of Kansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-21\">All of the liquor had been distilled and bottled in states other than Kansas, having been bottled at various dates subsequent to August 1, 1943, and prior to November 9, 1945, and all of it bore United States Government liquor stamps and state liquor stamps of the States of Illinois, Nebraska, and Missouri. The liquor had been brought into Kansas from other states subsequent to January 1, 1944, and prior to November 9, 1945, by persons unknown, from whom Claimant purchased it in Sedgwick County, Kansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-22\">Kansas is a state in which all sales (except for scientific, sacramental, medicinal, and mechanical purposes) of intoxicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>liquor containing more than four per cent of alcohol by volume are prohibited.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">The Claimant was not arrested by the United States Officers, and no prosecution is contemplated by the United States Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The trial court found that the liquor in question was not brought into the State of Kansas for \u201cscientific, sacramental, medicinal, or mechanical purposes,\u201d which statement was not included in the agreed statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"Az\">27 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 223 provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">\"(a) Whoever shall import, bring, or transport any intoxicating liquor into any State in which all sales (except for scientific, sacramental, medicinal, or mechanical purposes) of intoxicating liquor containing more than 4 per centum of alcohol by volume are prohibited, \u2022* * * shall: (1) If such liquor is not accompanied by such permit or permits, license or licenses therefor as are now or hereafter required by the laws of such State; * * * be guilty of a misdemeanor * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">\u201c(b) In order to determine whether anyone importing, bringing, or transporting intoxicating liquor into any State, * * * is acting in violation of the provisions of this chapter * * * the definition of intoxicating , liquor contained in the laws of such State shall be applied, but only to the extent that sales of such intoxicating liquor (except for scientific, sacramental, medicinal, and mechanical purposes) are prohibited in such State. * * * \u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">27 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 224 provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-12\">\u201cAll intoxicating liquor involved in any violation of this chapter * * * the containers of such intoxicating liquor, * * * shall be seized and forfeited. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-16\">As grounds for reversal, the Claimant asserts: First, that the trial court went outside the agreed statement of facts in the findings of fact; second, that the court erred in holding that the liquor was subject to forfeiture under the statute, in absence of a showing that the Claimant intended to defraud the United States of a tax at the time of the seizure, or that there was an arrest or conviction of the person bringing the liquor into the state; and, third, that the liquor was not subject to forfeiture to the United States, because, as far as Federal statutes are concerned, the Claimant was in lawful possession of the liquor in the State of Kansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-17\">It is stipulated that the liquor in question was whiskey, sloe gin, and rum, and, therefore, it could not come within the exceptions of the Kansas statute, which apply only to wine and alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-18\">Further, when a criminal statute sets forth an exception, which exception is not a part of the crime, but operates to prevent an act otherwise included in the statute from being a crime, the burden is on the defendant to bring himself within the exception.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since there was nothing on the face of the stipulation to bring the Claimant within the exception, it was, therefore, inferable that the exception did not apply. Moreover, the facts set forth in the challenged finding were reasonably inferable from the stipulated facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-19\">This action was not instituted under a revenue statute, but was brought under 27 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 223, which makes it an offense to transport liquor into a state where importation of intoxicants is prohib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>ited. And there is nothing in that statute, or in \u00a7 224, which requires that the liquor he transported into the state with the intent to defraud the United States of a tax. Neither is it necessary to prove that there has been an arrest or conviction of the person bringing the liquor into the State of Kansas. Section 224 applies to all liquor involved in a violation of \u00a7 223. In order to require forfeiture, it is only necessary to prove that the liquor was brought into the State of Kansas in violation of \u00a7 223, and the violation is shown on the face of the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The liquor was not lawfully in Claimant\u2019s possession at the time of the seizure. Forfeiture occurs at the point and time when the liquor is unlawfully transported across the state line, and title to the liquor passes to the Federal government at that time. The confiscation proceeding, then, dates back to the date of the unlawful entry of the liquor into the state.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Claimant\u2019s contention that he was lawfully in possession of the liquor is not well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The liquor was subject to forfeiture to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-23\"> 27 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 221-228.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b91-24\"> Hereinafter called tke Claimant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b92-13\"> 1939 S.L.Kansas, c. 179, p. 299, reads in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-14\">\u201cSection 1.
