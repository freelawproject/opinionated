Thus the goods are in part identical and it seems to be conceded that the appellee is senior in the use of its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-23\">The mark of appellant in this proceeding is the same mark sought to be registered in the application involved in the appeal in J. S. Ivins\u2019 Son, Inc., v. Lamont, Corliss &amp; Company, C.C.P.A., Patents, 158 F.2d 399, the opinion in which case is handed down concurrently herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-24\">The examiner stated the issue presented, which is the same issue as presented here, and held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-25\">\u201c * * * The only question for consideration herein * * * relates to the similarities of the marks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-27\">\u201cWith respect to the marks, applicant contends that the word \u2018House\u2019 has been used by others as a part of two-word notations applied to similar goods and hence that this word is not a distinctive part of the mark and should be given little consideration in the comparison of the marks herein. The fact, however, that others may have used this word in their marks is immaterial to applicant\u2019s right of registration, the only question before the examiner for consideration herein. The Pepsodent Co. v. Comfort Mfg. Co., 83 F.2d 906, 23 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1224, 472 O.G. 258.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-28\">\u201cIt seems to the examiner that the word \u2018House\u2019 is a prominent, if not a dominant, portion of the spoken mark, and since the goods are identical, inexpensive, and consumed in use, the examiner is of the opinion that confusion in trade is likely to result. This conclusion is deemed to be in accordance with the following decisions in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>volving the marks indicated: Young-Timers\u2014Two Timer C. B. Shane Corporation v. Henri Bendel, Inc., 557 O.G. 592, 166 Ms.D. 348, 59 U.S.P.Q. 308; Town Tavern\u2014Kentucky Tavern Glenmore Distilleries Company v. National Distillers Products Corp., 533 O.G. 1057, 163 Ms.D. 858, 51 U.S.P.Q. 329; Red Horse\u2014White Horse D. J. Bielzoff Products Company v. White Horse Distillers, Ltd., 107 F.2d 583, 27 C.C.P.A., Patents, 722, 511 O.G. 801; Lion Head\u2014Wolf\u2019s Head Gilmore Oil Company Ltd. v. Wolverine-Empire Refining Company, 69 F.2d 532, 21 C.C.P.A., Patents, 943, 445 O.G. 775; Diamond Blossom\u2014Orange Blossom Traub Manufacturing Company v. R. Harris &amp; Company, 53 F.2d 416, 19 C.C.P.A. 704, 414 O.G. 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">\u201cAccordingly, the notice of opposition is hereby sustained and it is further adjudged that the applicant is not entitled to the registration for which it has made application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The commissioner agreed in all particulars with the examiner and stated that the word \u201cHouse\u201d was the dominant portion of the respective marks and that: \u201cA town house and a gate house are both houses, differing only in style, location, or purpose. And casual purchasers would be less likely to recall the exact type of house described in either trade-mark than to remember merely that it is some kind of house. I am constrained to agree with the examiner of interferences that \u2018since the goods are identical, inexpensive, and consumed in use,\u2019 their concurrent sale under these particular marks may well lead to confusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Substantially the same- arguments are made in this case as were made in the companion case and need no extended discussion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Appellant has pointed out certain decisions of this court involving \u201cWashington Park\u201d and \u201cFashion Park\u201d (Rosenberg Bros. &amp; Co. v. Horowitz, 35 F.2d 784, 17 C.C.P.A., Patents, 641, \u201cGem-of-the-Sea\u201d and \u201cChicken of the Sea\u201d (Franco-Italian Packing Corp. v. Van Camp Sea Food Co., Inc., 142 F.2d 274, 31 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1029, and other marks which were held not to be confusingly similar. It also cited in the companion case, supra, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc., 150 F.2d 439, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1074, involving \u201cAir Chief\u201d and \u201cAirline.\u201d These cases are easily distinguished, but regardless of this fact this court has often said that each case must rest upon its own bottom and that the facts and the circumstances of each case must be closely scrutinized and that even then it is frequently not helpful to rely upon certain phases of analogy between cases in deciding a trade-mark issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">It might be observed, however, that in the marks \u201cGate House\u201d and \u201cTown House\u201d the first words in each mark are descriptive and are composed of four letters, and that the term \u201cHouse\u201d in each of the marks is that portion of the marks which is the chief factor in directing the purchaser\u2019s attention to the origin of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">The reasons set out by the tribunals below, we think, are sound and require but little discussion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">Appellant has complained quite earnestly, of the statement by the commissioner that \u201ca town house and a gate house are both houses, differing only in style, location, or purpose,\u201d and urges that the style, location, or purpose of the house is what distinguishes his trade-mark \u201cGate House\u201d from \u201cTown House.\u201d It does not seem to us that the purchaser of the particular kind of goods with which we are here concerned would spend much time, or should be required to do so, in distinguishing between the particular styles, locations, or purposes of houses in selecting his cookies, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">The decision of the commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AxL\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
