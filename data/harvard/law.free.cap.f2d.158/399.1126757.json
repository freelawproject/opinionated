The words, \u201cCookies by Ivins\u201d were disclaimed except in combination with the other features.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-21\">The appellee filed notice of \u00abpposition to such registration, basing the same upon its registered trade-marks, \u201cToll House\u201d for chocolate and the same notation for cookies. Appellee\u2019s seniority of use is not questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-22\">The Examiner of Trade-mark Interferences held there was confusing similarity between the marks when applied to the goods involved and sustained the notice of opposition, which holding, upon appeal to the Commissioner of Patents, was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-23\">Appellant has appealed here from the commissioner\u2019s decision, 65 USPQ 51, and, as below, stresses the contention that there is no possibility of confusion between \u201cToll House\u201d and \u201cGate House.\u201d It calls attention to the fact that numerous so-called \u201cHouse\u201d trade-marks have already been registered and are in use, such as \u201cWhite House,\u201d \u201cDoll House,\u201d \u201cKent House,\u201d etc., and argues that to refuse registration is equivalent to holding that the appellee has the exclusive right to use the word \u201cHouse\u201d in the sale of goods of the character here involved. Appellant stresses the fact that by reason of its frequent use in this connection the \u201cHouse\u201d feature of the mark is not the portion which would indicate origin of the goods and urges that there is no similarity between \u201cToll\u201d and \u201cGate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-24\">It is our view that appellant\u2019s contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-25\">If registrations in the Patent Office of the word \u201cHouse\u201d have been improperly allowed, it does not help the situation any to further confuse the purchaser by registering such a mark as appellant here seeks to register. Whether or not appellant has the right to use its mark is not before us. The statute under which we are operating makes likelihood of confusion the test for registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-26\">The commissioner, in his decision, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-27\">\u201cApplicant\u2019s mark as a whole differs considerably from opposer\u2019s mark in appearance and in sound. The dominant feature of applicant\u2019s mark, however, is the expression \u2018Gate House.\u2019 As pointed out by the examiner of interferences, this expression may have precisely the same meaning as \u2018Toll House;\u2019 and it is thus quite probable \u2018that to many purchasers, at least, both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>notations would give rise to the same mental picture.\u2019 In view of the character and identity of the merchandise to which the marks are applied, it therefore seems reasonably likely that confusion would result from their concurrent use in trade, and that opposer would be damaged by the proposed registration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The examiner had held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">\u201cWhile it is true that applicant\u2019s mark is a composite one having a quite elaborate picture of a house and gate, it nevertheless seems to the examiner that the notation \u2018Gate House\u2019 is the dominant feature of this mark since this is the name by which the goods will be called by prospective purchasers and would probably be the only name by which the goods would be known in the case of radio advertising and word of mouth recommendation. Both this notation and opposer\u2019s mark are, identical in the use of the word \u2018house,\u2019 and further it seems to the examiner that when viewed in their entireties they are susceptible of very similar significances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">\u201cWebster\u2019s New International- Dictionary, edition of 1939, defines tollhouse as \u2018a house where a tollgatherer is stationed, esp. such a house at a toll-gate or at the end of a toll bridge.\u2019 Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary, edition of 1930, defines tollhouse as \u2018a toll-collector\u2019s lodge adjoining a toll-gate.\u2019 Furthermore, the same dictionary defines gate-house as \u2018a house beside, over, or at a gate, as a toll-house.\u2019 It seems to the examiner therefore that to many purchasers, at least, both notations would give rise to the same mental picture; and under such circumstances where, as here, the marks are applied to identical goods, confusion in trade is deemed reasonably likely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">We agree with the position of the examiner and the commissioner that there is an association of ideas between \u201cToll House\u201d and \u201cGate House\u201d that would be likely to promote confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">As we have so frequently said, one who really wishes to distinguish his goods from those of another has a wide field to select from without going into disputed territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">The decision of the commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
