It is settled law that such information will support a finding that a search of an automobile based upon it was not unreasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-24\">Appellant in each case argues it as though the law were otherwise, as though, in short, such a search can be justified only where the officers know, as distinguished from having information as to, the facts on which they base their search.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-25\">This will not do.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The denial of the motions to suppress was not error. The judgment in each case is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1011-13\"> Cannon and Smith v.
