The thickness of the cylinder wall between the fins \u201cis but a fraction of the thickness through the cylinder wall and fins,\u201d the bore of the cylinder being hardened \u201cto a predetermined uniform depth less than the cylinder wall thickness between the fins, * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-10\">The claim calls for the steps of providing an annular blank of metal having a substantially uniformly thick wall of sufficient thickness to permit the machining of cooling fins on the outer wall thereof, \u201cinductively hardening the bore of the blank\u201d by heating and quenching to a predetermined depth and thereafter machining the outer wall of the blank to produce the cooling fins thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-11\">The patent to Gray et al. relates to a method of producing cylindrical couplings having \u201ca case-hardened shell and a threaded soft tough steel inside wall * * The patentee\u2019s cylindrical couplings are hardened by a carbonization process. The process hardens the outer surface, as well as the surface of the bore of the cylindrical coupling. After the carbonization process is completed, the carbonized or hardened metal of the bore is drilled out so as to produce a soft, tough inside surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-13\">In each of the patents to Denneen and Farr the hardening of the inner surfaces of hollow cylindrical metal articles is accomplished by electro-magnetic induction and quenching. The outer surface of the cylinder is not hardened. It is conceded by counsel for appellant that each of those patents discloses \u201cinduction hardening, with flux heating of a thin layer and quenching\u201d and that \u201cInduction hardening is merely one of the known factors which applicant employs to obtain his new total effect. Induction heating is well adapted to harden a thin.layer without heating an article through' its whole section, * * In each of the patents to Denneen and Farr the outer surface of the cylindrical metal articles remains soft and tough, as in appellant\u2019s cylinder. Neither of those patents-discloses the machining of the outer walls-of cylindrical metal articles to produce-cooling fins, as called for by the appealed claim. However, it is old, as stated in appellant\u2019s application, to provide cooling fins on the outer walls of cylinders for internal combustion engines of the air-cooled type.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-16\">The patent to Gehret rel\u00e1tes to a method of producing cylinders for internal combustion engines and discloses a method of producing an internal combustion engine cylinder in which a hollow cylindrical blank is first machined to form an annular rib having a flange which, the patentee states, is' \u201cused in securing the cylindrical block to the crank-case and to leave the wall of sufficient thickness for subsequent machining of the barrel to leave integral annular [reinforcing] ribs, * <em>* </em>The patentee\u2019s cylinder is water-cooled instead of air-cooled! as is appellant\u2019s. The bore of the cylinder block in the \u25a0 patentee\u2019s disclosure is machined and, as he states, \u201c * * * varied along its lengths to compensate for the distortions resulting from subsequent steps, in the method of manufacture,\u201d that is to say, the bore of the cylinder block is. machined to form a central portion, \u201ca flared outer portion * * * extending from the upper end of a cylinder portion\u00bb * * * to the upper end to which the cyl- - inder head is to be attached, and a tapered, portion * * * extending from the lower end of the [middle] cylinder portion * * * to the lower end of the cylinder * * *. This contour leaves sufficient stock on the-outer diameter of the barrel to prevent distortion and to allow removal of the nitridedi case on all surfaces except the internal diameter.\u201d The patentee\u2019s cylinder block., is then subjected to a nitriding process\u2014 - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>chemical process \u2014 to harden the cylinder block, particularly, as the patentee states, \u201cin the metal of the internal periphery or bore of the cylinder for purposes well understood in the art.\u201d The outer surface of the cylinder is then machined to form annular ribs or fins.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">We think it is clear from the patentee\u2019s disclosure that his process of heat hardening hardens both the outer surface of the cylinder and the surface of the bore therein. The machining of the outer surface of the cylinder removes the hardened portion thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">In addition to stating in his application that it is old in the art to provide radiating cooling fins on the external walls of cylinders for internal combustion engines of the air-cooled type, appellant states that such cylinders are relatively thin; that the cooling fins are \u201cdeep and closely spaced\u201d; and that it has been the practice prior to his alleged invention to harden the entire cylinder by nitriding or by carbonizing \u201cor by some other similar process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">Appellant further states in his application that by hardening substantially the entire cylinder structure, \u201cwarpage or distortion due to heat stresses\u201d results, because hardening of the cylinder was effected after the machining of the cylinder to produce the cooling fins, and because the hardening of substantially the entire cylinder having thin walls can not be restricted to a proper depth so as to \u201cpermit the machining of deep fins subsequent to hardening upon the exterior of the cylinder without running into hardened metal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-8\">Because of the difficulty, hereinbefore stated, appellant dispensed with the heating and quenching of the entire cylinder and by means of electro-magnetic induction, disclosed in the patents to Denneen and Farr, hardened merely the surface of the bore of a cylinder to a uniform depth and then by a machining process produced the cooling fins called for by the appealed claim. In other words, instead of first machining the cylinder and then hardening the entire cylinder, appellant first hardens the surface of the bore of the cylinder and then machines the outer surface of the cylinder in order to prevent the warpage or distortion, hereinbefore referred to. First hardening and then machining a cylindrical article is clearly disclosed in the patents to Gchret and Gray et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-10\">It is obvious that there is no invention in employing electro-magnetic induction, disclosed in the patents to Denneen and Farr, to harden the surface of the bore of a cylinder to a predetermined uniform depth and to machine the outer wall of the cylinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-11\">It is true, as argued by counsel for appellant, that none of the patents of record anticipate the process defined by the appealed claim. However, it was not held by the tribunals of the Patent Office that any one reference anticipated appellant\u2019s alleged invention but, on the contrary, it was held that the process defined by the appealed claim was not patentable in view of the disclosures in the references of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-12\">It will be observed that the appealed claim calls for \u201crelatively deep cooling fins in which the thickness through the cylinder wall between the fins is but a fraction of the thickness through the cylinder wall and fins, * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-13\">Not only does the patent to Gehret disclose that the cylinder wall between the ribs is but a fraction of the thickness through the cylinder wall and the ribs, but it would seem to be obvious that cooling fins could not very well be produced in appellant\u2019s cylinder so as to prevent the cylinder wall between the fins being but a fraction of the thickness through the cylinder wall and the fins.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-14\">Counsel for appellant earnestly argue here that the process defined by the appealed claim produces a superior cylinder for internal combustion engines of the air-cooled type; that the references of record do not disclose a process for producing such a cylinder; and that, therefore, the appealed claim is patentable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-15\">We have given careful consideration to the arguments presented by counsel but are of opinion that the tribunals of the Patent Office were right in rejecting the appealed claim in view of the prior art disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-16\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
