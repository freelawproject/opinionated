That motion was denied, and defendant by answer asserted several defenses: (1) A denial that any of the gas was used off the premises, and an affirmation that all of it was used for the manufacture of gasoline, some going directly to the gasoline plant and some being exchanged for equivalent amounts of gas which were so used; (2) a denial that during the period in question there had been no prevailing market rate for gas and that the value of the gas was <em>6$ </em>per m.c.f. or any other such sum; (3) that plaintiffs and defendant had agreed in writing that the royalty for the gas taken should be computed upon the market value of such gas at the mouth of the well, determined in the manner set forth in the division and transfer orders, that all gas had been accounted for scrupulously in accordance with the provisions of those orders, and that there was now tendered to plaintiffs the amounts due in accordance with their provisions; (4) the statutes of limitations as to all royalties accrued more than four years prior to August 13, 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">Owners of fractional royalty interests under the lease intervened on the side of plaintiffs, putting forward substantially the same claims and taking substantially the same positions, and defendant replied substantially as it had done to plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Plaintiffs and intervenors filed full replications, setting out why the gross proceeds provision of the lease rather than the prevailing market rate provision applied, and those plaintiffs and intervenors, who had signed division orders alleging that they were without consideration, denied their binding force.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">As to the defense of limitation, they all alleged that fraud and concealment on defendant\u2019s part had tolled the statute, while plaintiffs, whose funds had been impounded, pleaded the agreement for and the impounding as preventing the running of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">A jury was demanded by and allowed defendant over the objection of plaintiffs. The appointment of a master was requested and allowed plaintiffs over objection of defendant. Defendant\u2019s theory that the prevailing market rate clause of the royalty provision was controlling was rejected, and, over its objections, the cause was extensively heard before the master and submitted on special issues<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to the jury on plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>theory that the gross proceeds clause of the royalty provision controlled. Judgment was entered for plaintiffs and intervenors on the verdict of the jury in the aggregate sum of $155,331.50, and defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Appellant\u2019s main and primary contention here is that the applicable royalty provision of the lease was that obligating the defendant to pay as royalty one-eighth of the prevailing market price, and that the record having been made, the verdict returned, and the judgment entered on the entirely erroneous theory advanced by plaintiff that the applicable provision was that for payment of gross proceeds, the judgment must be reversed with directions to enter judgment for defendant or for trial anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Subordinate contentions urged by appellant are: (1) That the payments made by defendant directly to intervenors -and into the impounded account for the benefit of plaintiffs, on the basis prescribed in the division and transfer orders, constituted full and final payment of all amounts then due; (2) that, assuming that the district court correctly construed the royalty covenant, the evidence does not support the jury\u2019s finding; (3) that the court erred in admitting the master\u2019s report as evidence for the consideration of the jury; (4) that the statute of limitations bars the claims of intervenors for gas produced more than four years prior to the filing of their interventions; and (5) that plaintiffs were not entitled to recover interest on royalties held to be due and unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">Appellees do not deny that the gas in question or its equivalent received in a swap was carried to defendant\u2019s gasoline extracting plants where the gasoline was extracted from it and the residue made use of for other purposes. They insist, however: That the expression in the lease \u201cuse of gas for manufacture of gasoline\u201d has the special and peculiar meaning, of \u201cused only; \u201d that this meaning limits its application to situations where the gas is used only in the manufacture of gasoline, that is where, after the gasoline is extracted, the residue is popped off or wasted into the air; and that where, as here, after the gasoline is extracted, the residue is applied to other uses, it may not be said that the gas was \u201cused\u201d in the manufacture of gasoline within the meaning of the clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">A careful examination of the record as to what was done with the gas and of appellees\u2019 evidence and arguments in support of their theory leaves us in no doubt that there is no basis whatever for the restricted and special meaning appellees would place upon the clause in question. The gas, for the royalty on which they sue, was used\u201e for the manufacture of gasoline, the applicable royalty provision, therefore, is that for the payment of the \u201cprevailing market rate for gas\u201d and not that for \"the payment of gross proceeds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-14\">On careful consideration of a royalty clause identical in language with the clause in question here and of facts as to the use of the gas identical with those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>shown here, we so held in Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Record, 5 Cir., 146 F.2d 485. Nothing in the record in this c^se, nothing in appellees\u2019 arguments, causes us to withdraw or in anywise modify the views we there expressed. The evidence offered in this case and made so much of here by ap-pellees, in support of its argument for construing the word \u201cused\u201d as meaning \u201cused only,\u201d as to the practice prevailing when the lease was written, of using the gas only for extracting the gasoline and then popping the residue gas into the air, is without relevance to the issue on which it was tendered, the meaning of the lease. Certainly it may not be given the effect ascribed to it here, of reading the word \u201conly\u201d into the clause so that it will be held to apply to gas used for the manufacture of gasoline only if the residue is popped into the air, and not to apply to gas where, after the gasoline is extracted, the residue is directed to other uses. The fact that the residue is not wasted but a valuable use is made of it should have, and undoubtedly has had, a bearing on the prevailing market rate, or if there is none, the prevailing value of the gas used for the manufacture of gasoline since the new practice of making profitable use not only of the gasoline extracted from it, but of the residue, has been in vogue. But while the change of use and the value it has added to the gas in the lessee\u2019s hands is, as an economic fact, of great importance in fixing \u201cthe prevailing market rate,\u201d or, if there is no prevailing market, the value of the gas, and therefore, the amount to be paid lessors for it in accordance with the basis fixed in the contract, it is without effect upon the determination of what the contract means.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Since the cause was tried below on a completely erroneous theory, and because it was, the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance herewith, it is unnecessary for us to consider or discuss any of the other contentions of appellant as to the errors committed on this trial, except its contentions one, four, and five, which have to do with matters which, on a retrial in accordance herewith, will have to be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">As to contention one, the division and transfer orders, with their definite declaration that the market value of the gas at the mouth of the well is to be the measure of lessors\u2019 rights and lessee\u2019s obligations, and their clear and full provisions for precisely arriving at the value, we agree with defendant, that, until withdrawn or modified, they constitute the precise and definite basis for payments, and payments made in accordance with them are final and binding. The very existence of this and the numerous other litigations which have arisen over the meaning and effect of market price or rate provisions and over what was the market price or value of the gas, and the fact that these agreements fix, as due, sums which may from time to time be more or less than the prevailing market price, give full support to and make binding payments and settlements made thereunder. Binding as they are, however, in respect of payments made and accepted under them, these division or transfer orders did not rewrite or supplant the lease contract. They are binding only for the time and to the extent that they have been, or are being acted on and made the basis of settlements and payments, and from the time that notice is given that settlements will not be made on the basis provided in them, they cease to be binding. As to persons who did not sign division or transfer orders, payments made to and accepted by, or settlements made with them, on the basis provided for in these orders, will be equally binding. If, however, the evidence shows not that the payments were received upon the basis provided in these agreements, but that they were received merely as payments tendered by the company and accepted by the recipients on the faith and in the belief that they were being paid the amount due them, the mere acceptance of these payments would not constitute an accord and satisfaction or a binding settlement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">As to contention four, the statute of limitations, it is quite plain, we think, that, on the record before us, as to the intervenors whose funds were not impounded, the statute of limitations has been running, and there was no basis for the jury\u2019s fmd-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>ing that there was fraud on the part of defendant which tolled the statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On another trial, unless it -is shown that something affirmative and fraudulent was done by defendant to deceive lessors or to keep them in ignorance of the fact that the amounts paid them were not being reported truly, the defense of limitation should be sustained.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">As to contention five, that interest may not be allowed, whatever may be said of the state of the law in Texas, and as to whether recovery of interest was properly denied in Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Johnson, 5 Cir., 155 F.2d 185, we think that on any sums which, on retrial in accordance herewith, may be found to be due on the basis of prevailing market rate, or if there is no prevailing market rate, of the value of the gas taken, interest should be allowed from the date the payment of those sums became due.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further and not inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-15\"> \u201c2nd.

I do not think that interest will be allowable on any recovery that may be had. The Texas statutes and decisions on the question of interest on unliquidated sums due under written contracts are not plain. The court in Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Johnson, 5 Cir., 155 F.2d 185, did its best to follow them by distinguishing situations in which the sum payable could have been ascertained by the debtor with reasonable certainty from those in which a trial on evidence was fairly necessary to ascertain it. That distinction applied here would allow interest if there was a prevailing market .rate for gas, for a market price is a definite and ascertainable fact. But interest should be denied if there was no certain market rate and the fair value of the gas had to be ascertained by a trial. Value is a matter of opinion, and the value of gas in Texas, as the cases of Phillips Petroleum Co. in this court show, has hitherto been very difficult to fix.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
