It follows that the only question open upon this appeal is the correctness of the charge. Although the plaintiff did not except to any part of it, we have read it with care, and we hold that it fairly presented the questions which the jury had to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-24\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
