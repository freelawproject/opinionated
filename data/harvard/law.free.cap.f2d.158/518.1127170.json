The issue was submitted to the jury which found against the plaintiff and delivered a verdict for the manufacturer in the amount of the unpaid bills. Upon this appeal the plaintiff claims that the evidence was so clearly in its favor that it was entitled to a directed verdict' for the loss of profits\u2019 on the undelivered goods. Our examination convinces us that a jury question was involved for the reasons fully set out in the opinion of District Judge Harry E. Watkins, (65 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>F.Supp. 298) in overruling the motion of the plaintiff to set aside the verdict and judgment for the defendant and to enter a judgment for the plaintiff, or, in the alternative, to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
