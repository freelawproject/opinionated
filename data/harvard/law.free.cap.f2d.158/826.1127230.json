The answer denied allegations (a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-16\">On the issue tendered whether the shipment \u201coriginates at the mill rather than at a distribution yard,\u201d appellant\u2019s brief claims error in the district court\u2019s holding in its order granting appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss, that appellant failed to prove that appellee\u2019s shipments of shingles had not \u201coriginated\u201d from a distribution yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-17\">It was admitted that the sales of certain red cedar shingles were at a price higher than the maximum price under paragraph 1381.1 of the Administrator\u2019s regulations which provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-18\">\u201c\u00a7 1381.1. Maximum prices for red cedar shingles. On and after June 29, 1942, regardless of any contract, agreement, or other obligation (a) Where the shipment originates at the mill rather than at a distribution yard, no person shall sell or deliver red cedar shingles, and no person shall buy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>or receive red cedar shingles in the course of trade or business, at prices higher than the maximum prices set forth in Appendix A, incorporated herein as \u00a7 1381.11.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">It is obvious from the reading of paragraph 1381.1 that the burden of proof upon the Price Administrator is to show that each of the shipments in question \u201coriginates at the mill rather than at a distribution yard.\u201d This regulation fixes no maximum price when the shipment is not from a mill, even though not from a distribution yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The evidence shows that the shipments first originated at the town of Toledo, Oregon, and that they came from a firm named Warrenton Shingle Co. Appellant\u2019s brief contends that he has shown that shipment from Toledo was from a mill by his, (plaintiff\u2019s) exhibit 1. This exhibit is of railway shipping documents which disclose no more than that firm\u2019s name as the shipper of the shingles from Toledo.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">To meet this absence of proof, appellant-plaintiff contends that if the character of the origin of the shipment is \u201cpeculiarly within the defendant\u2019s knowledge,\u201d appellant is relieved of his burden and the burden of proof shifts to the appellee. We do not agree, but if such were the law it has no application here. There is no evidence that appellee, a lumber dealer in Los Angeles, knew whether the firm of Warrenton Shingle Co. of Toledo, Oregon, manufactured the shingles in their own mill there or merely bought shingles from small and large shingle makers and resold them from a distribution yard there, or merely sold in their own name the shingles owned by others as the others\u2019 agents. Also it is, obvious that the character of the establishment at Toledo is not peculiarly within the knowledge of the appellee in Los Angeles. It is within the knowledge of and best provable by the testimony of the members of that firm and its employees at Toledo, Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">The appellant having failed to maintain his contention with regard to the or-' igin of the shipments from a mill in Oregon, contends they were in fact from two California cities. It appears that the shipments from the Oregon company were in railway cars diverted from their original destination by appellee to Bellflower and Riverside, California, and that possession of the shingles was taken by appellee on the railway tracks there. From there the deliveries of sales by the appellee were made from these shingles there in its possession. Assuming appellant\u2019s contention that these places may be deemed the shipments\u2019 origins, shipments from railway cars are not shipments from a mill, and regulation 1381.1 does not create a maximum price for the shingles. To meet this situation appellant again attempts to attach to the shipments from the cars an origin at Toledo, Oregon. As seen, no shingle mill of the Toledo shipper is shown to have existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">Since appellant has failed to maintain his burden of proof on issue (a), it is unnecessary to consider issue (b), that is, appellant\u2019s claimed error that the district court erred in holding appellant had not maintained his burden of proving that the purchases by appellee\u2019s customers were for use or consumption other than in the course of trade or business.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
