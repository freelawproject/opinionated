While appellant\u2019s train, on which appellee was a passenger, was standing in the Baltimore station, ap-pellee was injured by the falling of a suitcase which a man was trying to place in the baggage rack. Appellee\u2019s theory is that the man was a red cap porter. Appellant\u2019s theory is that the man was a passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-19\">J. C. Solomon, a young colored man, corroborated appellee\u2019s testimony that a porter dropped the suitcase. He testified that he and his sister, Mabel Solomon, were seated in the next to the last seat on the left side of the coach. He gave his address as 524 West Preston Street, Baltimore. Appellant offered testimony of its conductor that shortly after the accident he took the names of witnesses, including \u201ca colored man \u2014 a colored boy \u2014 whom he is prepared to describe, and whose description reasonably fits that of J. C. Solomon, who has testified here in court\u201d; that this man gave the name of J. C. Young; that he was sitting with his sister, Mabel Young, in the next to the last seat on the left side of the coach; that he gave his address as 524 West Preston Street, Baltimore; and that he said he himself had dropped the suitcase. Appellant also offered testimony of one of its claim agents that he \u201cmade a search of Baltimore\u201d but was unable to locate J. C. Young and Mabel Young at 524 West Preston Street or elsewhere. The court excluded the evidence of the conductor and of the claim agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-20\">We think this evidence should have been admitted, whether it did or did not lead the judge, as it might reasonably have led the jury, to believe that J. C. Solomon and J. C. Young were the same person. Young\u2019s story to the conductor was directly material, and the fact that no one answering to the name of Young actually lived at 524 West Preston Street was indirectly material, to the basic issue in the case. Young\u2019s story to the conductor contradicted Solomon\u2019s testimony on the basic issue. If Young and Solomon were the same person, Young\u2019s story impeached Solomon as a witness and was admissible for that reason. If they were different persons, Young\u2019s story was admissible because his acknowledgment of responsibility was against his interest and he was shown to be unavailable as a witness. It did not matter whether Young, if he was a different person from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Solomon, was alive or dead, for the necessity of using the conductor\u2019s account of his story was the same in either case. Wig-more on Evidence, 3d ed., \u00a7\u00a7 1455-1457; Am.Law Institute, Model Code of Evidence, Rule 509 and Illustration 3; Weber v. Chicago R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co., 175 Iowa 358, 151 N.W. 852, 860-864, L.R.A.1918A, 626; Sutter v. Easterly, Mo.Sup., 189 S.W.2d 284, 288-290, 162 A.L.R. 437. We need not consider whether Young\u2019s story was a spontaneous account of the accident and admissible on that independent ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The conductor should have been allowed not only to testify but to refresh his recollection by consulting a routine report which he made soon after the accident. We need not now decide whether the report itself should have been admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
