Jerry Vogel Music Co., 53 F.Supp. 191. The evidence is sufficient to sustain the findings of fact, and none of them can be reversed as clearly erroneous. Also the questions of law which the appeal presents were correctly decided. The second and third causes of action are ruled by Fred Fisher Music Co. v. M. Witmark &amp; Sons, 318 U.S. 643, 63 S.Ct. 773, 87 L.Ed. 1055. Contrary to the appellant\u2019s contention the Dillon assignments to Von Tilzer were bilateral contracts imposing mutually enforceable rights and duties. See Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, 222 N.Y. 88, 118 N.E. 214. The testimony of Bernstein and Caesar was admissible to interpret the words \u201cprinted copy\u201d in the Dillon contracts, and it supports the finding that the words did not refer to \u201cfolios.\u201d See Gumbinsky Bros. Co. v. Smalley, 203 App.Div. 661, 197 N.Y.S. 530, aff\u2019d 235 N.Y. 619, 139 N.E. 758. The decision as to the sixth cause of action is justified by Edward B. Marks Music Corp. v. Jerry Vogel Music Co., 2 Cir., 140 F.2d 268, 269-270. All the other causes of action involved in the appeal turned on questions of fact and it is unnecessary to add anything to the district court\u2019s opinion. The case involved seven causes of action, each requiring separate proof and resulting in a very extensive record. We see no abuse of discretion in the amount of the attorneys\u2019 fee awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-22\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
