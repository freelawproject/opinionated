All of them draw a distinction between the power of the Administrator to delegate his authority to issue subpoenas under the Act in question and the like power of the Administrator under the Wage and Hour Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 201 et seq., which the Supreme Court held could not he delegated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Sixth Circuit in the Mohawk case took a contrary view and concluded the Administrator could not delegate his power to issue subpoenas. We think that the decisions by the Court of Appeals for the District of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>Columbia and by the First, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits in the cases listed in Note 1 state the correct rule and we adhere thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">The stay order heretofore issued staying the order of the lower court pending appeal to this court is accordingly dissolved and the order and judgment appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-16\"> See Pinkus v.
