This is concerned with the 'application for equitable relief. This relief was granted by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-15\">Second. There was asked for and granted a judgment for treble damages in the amount of $1,257.15 for sales at over-ceiling prices of certain styles of articles which the defendants manufactured. Judgment for the plaintiff was given on these items.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-16\">Third. This is a claim for treble damages for alleged overceiling sales on other articles manufactured and sold by defendants. These sales, it was alleged, amounted to $49,611.39 and for them the plaintiff claims treble damages of $148,834.17. On this part of the claim recovery was denied. Both parties appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-17\">With regard to the defendants\u2019 appeal, little need be said. Defendants did not deny that sales of the articles in question (second division above) were made but press the point that it was not shown that the sales were to wholesalers and retailers, which was necessary to bring them within the defined category in an order fixing maximum ceiling prices. This point cannot be sustained. The court found the sales in violation of the order and the evidence on which that finding was based was such that we cannot possibly say that the finding was clearly erroneous. Furthermore, the court found that the sales by defendants which were at prices in excess of the maximum prices \u201cwere either wilful or the result of defendants\u2019 failure to take practical precautions against the occurrence of such violations. Defendants\u2019 conduct was in complete disregard of the requirements of the General Maximum Price Regulations and the duties imposed upon them by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>We think these findings dispose of the \u25a0case so far as the defendants\u2019 appeal is concerned. They clearly justify the action of the court in awarding treble damages in the sum named above and in giving to the plaintiff the injunctive relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">We now turn to the phase of the case brought <em>up </em>by the Administrator\u2019s appeal. This poses a difficult question and is the chief one discussed in briefs and argument for each side. We shall try to state it briefly in order to bring the issue into focus, leaving details for elaboration in the margin.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The defendants are manufacturers of underwear in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The articles which were sold at the alleged improper price were men\u2019s and boys\u2019 shorts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The sales took place between March, 1943, and April, 1944. The articles in question were not part of the general line of such garments manufactured by the defendants in 1942 and were not, therefore, within the terms of the general \u201cfreeze\u201d with regard to price.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-14\">During the period when these sales were made, a method of fixing ceiling prices of articles not included in a manufacturer\u2019s former line of goods was fixed by the Office of Price Administration. Up until May 29, 1943, the manufacturer was directed to get specific authorization from the Office of Price Administration to calculate a proper maximum price according to a prescribed formula and then to report the calculated price within ten days, subject to adjustment by the Administrator<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On May 29, 1943, the process was simplified to eliminate the necessity of prior authorization for calculating the maximum price under this Section.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These defendants did not conform either to the regulation in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>original form or as amended.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They simply went ahead and manufactured the goods and sold them for the price fixed by themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The chronology of events thereafter is important to bear in mind. In June, 1944, the plaintiff began an investigation of the defendants\u2019 records. In July, 1944, the plaintiff\u2019s complaint was filed. In August, 1944, -after the complaint was filed and about three months after the sale of the garments had ended, the defendants filed the type of report required by regulations. This report included prices for but two of the three styles manufactured, sold, and subject to investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Now we come to the critical dates. By an order on October 20, 1944, the Administrator stated that the determination of maximum prices by defendants was not in line with the level of maximum prices and made an order establishing a maximum price for styles 467 and 259 with which we are here concerned. These prices were lower than those submitted by defendants and lower than the prices at which the garments had been sold.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Then, finally, on May 8, 1945, this order was amended to make the'adjusted maximum prices cover, retroactively, the period during which the sales in question were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">These dates constitute the material out of which our legal problem is made. The Administrator is seeking damages to recover three-fold the differences between what the defendants did sell their goods for and what' the Administrator says they should have sold them for. But the Administrator did not make his order fixing the price at which he says the goods should have been sold until ten months after his lawsuit was begun. Defendants urge with great force that the Administrator cannot have a recovery for violation of a price ceiling which was not established for nearly 13 months after the sales in question were made. This view appealed to the Trial Judge who held that the plaintiff could not recover for these items. He based his decision on the well established rule of law that a plaintiff cannot recover unless the facts which constitute his cause of action are in existence at the time he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>begins his lawsuit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The general principle is, of course, indisputable. If it applies here the conclusion reached in the District Court must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">It is well, at the outset of the discussion, to rid the case of any suggestion that we have here an instance of a citizen pursuing his ordinary lawful business and, while so doing, being harrassed by a bureaucracy. These defendants were pursuing their business in wartime. They, and everybody else, were being subjected to certain controls devised to win the war and preserve the domestic economy so far as possible. They were engaged in the production of a line of merchandise which was subject to <em>emergency </em>wartime regulation. Part of that regulation required them to give notice and submit data when they introduced to the trade a new article not covered by already existing regulations. This defendants did not do, as already shown in the quotation from the finding of the facts of the Trial Judge. But, instead, they proceeded \u201cin complete disregard of * * * the duties imposed .011 them by law.\u201d Had they done what they were required to do by way of furnishing to the Office of Price Administration the relevant data and fixed their ceiling price in accordance with the requirements, they would have had complete protection for themselves as to all sales made up until the time the Administrator objected to such price as they fixed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We regard this fact as of high importance. In view of it any equity to be urged for the defendants disappears.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">We think it no answer to the importance of this point to say <em>that the </em>Administrator might have demanded the information from the defendants and secured court help <em>to </em>get it if they refused. It is true that the statute makes provision for such process,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> although the road to it with regard to <em>acts </em>done by defendants before the Administrator asks for the information is not entirely a path of roses.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In discussing what the Administrator could or could not do, we must keep in mind the situation in which his office operated. The undertaking to police prices in every industry of the country was, in itself, a tremendous one. Whether the undertaking was too ambitious to be successfully accomplished is a matter upon which judicial opinion is irrelevant. The point is that the undertaking was immense. It is a matter of common knowledge that manufacturers, embarrassed by price ceilings in established lines, introduced new items which were not subject to the general freezing regulations. The Office of Price Administration could not possibly know, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>simultaneously with the appearance of these thousands of items, what their nature was and whether they were being brought out in conformity with the general plan of price regulation. It did provide a way, as already indicated, by which a manufacturer with a new item could bring his facts to the Office of Price Administration and secure from it a ruling upon them. If the regulation was believed to be improper the party aggrieved had recourse to court review in the Emergency Court of Appeals. It is in the light of what the defendants-failed to do and the administrative, legal and judicial machinery provided to protect their rights that this case must be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">We get down, therefore, to the legal question whether the Administrator can recover statutory damages for a violation of a regulation when the amount of damages is to be measured by a ceiling price which was not in existence at the time the violation occurred. We may dismiss quickly the proposition that such recovery, even at treble damages, is in violation of the ex pbst facto provisions of the Constitution. Art. 1, \u00a7 9, cl. 3. The limitation of this clause to actions strictly criminal in their nature is too well established to require learned elucidation at this late date.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">It is established, also, that retroactive requirements are not in violation of any Constitutional right if they are reasonable in their nature.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Retroactivity within the law has been a recognized principle in-cases to correct administrative errors,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and in situations where administrative orders were required to establish liability in suits already pending.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The effect of retroactivity also has been applied in order to effectuate a legislative policy.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Currently it has been used in litigation involving rent controls.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> For a considered study of retroactivity in the law see Stimson\u2019s discussion \u201cRetroactive Application of Law \u2014 A Problem in Constitutional Law.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-21\">We think the rule cited by the learned District Judge is not applicable to block this suit. The operative fact out of which the action grows is the sale. That sale took place after the price control act had been passed and regulations under it established which forbade sales of new commodities prior to being priced in accordance with a regulatory formula, and prior to notice to and approval of the Administrator.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The regulation also required that a seller\u2019s maximum price be in line with the level of maximum prices established by the regulation. These defendants made a series of sales. They did not know whether the sales were over price ceiling or in line with the level of maximum prices which existed at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the sales. This ignorance was caused by their failure to furnish the information, as required by the regulation, which would have permitted the necessary mathematical determination of a ceiling price. The defendants did not furnish the information until after a suit against them had been started. Then they were told, a conclusion not surprising in view of the evidence, that they had charged too much. The reason that the statutory damages for the defendants\u2019 sales without ceiling prices could not be determined at the commencement of the suit was because of their withholding of information which would have enabled the Administrator to compute a ceiling price. We think, under the circumstances, that they are in no position to complain of the legal consequences of what they knowingly did, which could not be ascertained at the moment the act was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">We think there is another reason why the defendants must lose on this phase of the case. Jurisdiction to determine the validity of a regulation of the Office of Price Administration is vested exclusively in the Emergency Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The learned Trial Judge recognized this perfectly, but in deciding the case on the basis he did,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> was he not necessarily passing on the validity of the regulation one way or the other? That question is not easily answered. We think, however, that in reaching the result which was obtained, in declaring the defendants not liable for the sales made without compliance. to the policy of the Emergency Price Control Act and the requirements of a price control regulation, there was in effect a determination that the regulation is not binding. That is, we think, a determination of the validity of a regulation and something which neither the District Court nor we are given authority to pass upon. That question must go to the tribunal provided by Congress for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">Only one question remains, that has to do with defendants\u2019 argument that a subsequent amendment to regulations so changed the procedure as to make the violation complained of not applicable to them. This argument results from the defendants\u2019 consideration of the General Maximum Price Regulation solely as a \u201cfreeze\u201d regulation. Such a consideration lacks an appreciation of the immensity of the price control program. It is accurate to regard Section 1499.2 of the regulations as announcing a price freeze policy of commodities and services according to a 1942 reference point.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The regulations were designed, however, with recognition of the fact that new commodities, differing from 1942 products, would he produced and in-fairness demand a more elastic method of price computation. Therefore Section 1499.3 was published at the inception of the regulatory program to control the prices of new commodities, and is still in force.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Ever since the origin of the regulations in 1942 the policy has been that of keeping individual maximum prices in line with the level of maximum prices established by the regulations. To effectuate this policy the Administrator has always had the power to adjust submitted maximum prices at any time. Upon inspection of the subsequent amendments it is evident that only a change in the form of statement has occurred and not a change in the Administrator\u2019s powers of adjustment.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>The defendants\u2019 argument upon this point must, therefore, be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Since this case was submitted, a decision in the 9th Circuit has come down in which the result reached by the court is in line with the view we have expressed above. Martini et al. v. Porter, Administrator, 9 Cir., July 18, 1946, 157 F.2d 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The judgment against the defendants for $1,257.15 and the injunction against the defendants is affirmed in regard to appeal No. 9193. In regard to appeal No. 9156 the dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s claim for treble damages regarding sales of styles 467, 259 and 259(b) is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"auk-dedup-0\"> \u201c(e) <em>If any person selling a commodity violates a regulation, </em>order, or price schedule prescribing a maximum price or maximum prices, the person who buys such commodity for use, or consumption other than in the course of trade or business may, within one year from the date of the occurrence of the violation, except as hereinafter provided, bring an action against the seller on account of the overcharge.

The Trial Judge awarded no statutory damages to the plaintiff. He reasoned that the plaintiff did not state a cause of action for treble damages based upon the sales made by the defendants because no ceiling prices had been in existence at tile time the suit was filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b497-11\"> General Maximum Price Regulation \u00a7 3499.2, 7 Fed.Reg. 3153 (1942), 2 OPA Gen. 20,103 (1944).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b497-12\"> General Maximum Price Regulation \u00a7 3.499.3(b), 7 Fed.Reg. 3154 (1942), as amended by Amendments 54 and 63, 8 Fed.Reg. 6962 (3943), 9 Fed.Reg. 5369 (1944).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b497-13\"> \u201cSec. 2.
