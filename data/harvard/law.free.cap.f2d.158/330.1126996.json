Relying on the McNabb case, 318 U.S. 332, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L.Ed. 819, appellant complains of the admission in evidence of a confession which he made on the day after his arrest. But this confession was a mere reiteration of one which appellant made within 15 or 20 minutes after his arrest and which was properly introduced in evidence. Since there was no \u201cinexcusable detention for the purpose of illegally extracting evidence\u201d and no \u201cdisclosure induced by illegal detention,\u201d United States v. Mitchell, 322 U.S. 65, 67, 70, 64 S.Ct. 896, 897, 88 L.Ed. 1140, the principle of the McNabb case does not apply. The admission of the later confession was probably not erroneous and certainly not prejudicial. Appellant\u2019s other contentions are likewise without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-25\">Affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
