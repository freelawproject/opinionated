They own a leasehold interest in certain real property whereon they maintain artificial ponds supplied with water from springs upon the premises. In these ponds appellants place fertilized trout eggs (which they purchase already fertilized from another hatchery), hatch the eggs, and raise the trout to a marketable size. The trout are then killed, dressed, placed in refrigerating units, distributed to the trade and sold for human consumption as food.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-23\">The leasehold interest was mortgaged to the appellees and when the obligations under the mortgage were not met, appellees began foreclosure proceedings in the state court. Appellants then sought relief by instituting, in the district court, farmer debtor proceedings under Section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203. Appellants\u2019 petition was dismissed by the district court because appellants were not \u201cfarmers\u201d and therefore not within the Act. They appeal from this decision which presents the only issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-24\">Are appellants \u201cfarmers\u201d, within the meaning of Section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act? The pertinent part of the applicable statute is as follows : \u00a7 75, sub. r. \u201cFor the purposes of this section * * * the term \u2018farmer\u2019 includes not only an individual who is primarily bona fide personally <em>engaged in producing products of the soil, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>but also any individual who is primarily bona fide personally <em>engaged in dairy fanning, </em>the <em>production of poultry or livestock, </em>or the production of poultry products or livestock products in their unmanufactured state, or the principal part of whose income is derived from any one or more of the foregoing operations, * * 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203, sub. r. [Emphasis supplied]</p>\n<p id=\"AV\">Clearly appellants are not \u201cengaged in producing products of the soil,\u201d nor \u201cin dairy farming,\u201d nor in the \u201cproduction of poultry\u201d and no such contention is made. Therefore if the appellants are to be adjudged \u201cfarmers,\u201d this court must hold that \u201cfish\u201d are \u201clivestock\u201d. This we are not prepared to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">This court is without the power to so expand the plain terms of the statute. \u201cLivestock\u201d is an ordinary word and should be given its ordinary meaning, and ordinarily fish are not considered to be livestock. We cannot agree with the contention made by appellants that because livestock are animals, and fish are animals, therefore fish are livestock.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">If additional support were needed it can be found in the legislative history of the Act. Before 1935 this section was general in its terms,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but in 1935 Congress saw fit to make the language of the statute more specific by listing and enumerating <em>products of the soil, dairy farming, poultry </em>and <em>livestock.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Here we have an instance where the statute specifically enumerates certain activities the nature of which is a matter of common understanding. It seems obvious that by this precise enumeration Congress clearly intended to exclude activities not enumerated. By so holding we do not narrow or broaden the meaning of the statutory language. We interpret the term \u201clivestock\u201d in the sense in which it is commonly employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">We hold that fish are not livestock. For the reasons indicated appellants are not \u201cfarmers\u201d and the order of dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-9\"> \u201cFor the purpose of this section and section 74, the term \u2018farmer\u2019 means any individual who is personally bona fide engaged primarily in farming operations or the principal part of whose income is derived from farming operations.\u201d Act of March 3, 1933, 47 Stat. 1467, 1473.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
