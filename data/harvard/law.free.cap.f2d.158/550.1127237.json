The court offered to appoint ari attorney to represent him, hut he declined the offer. No point is raised here as to the absence of counsel, because it is apparent that the right to have the assistance of counsel for his defense was intelligently waived by the accused. He is, however, represented by a competent attorney on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The United States Attorney, on cross-examination in the court below, put before the jury the only defense that was available to the defendant. He claimed exemption as a minister of religion under Section 5(d) of the above-cited Act, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 305(d). The court below charged the jury fully and fairly upon the law as announced m Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 66 S.Ct. 423. No exception was taken to the charge by either side. The decisive question before us is whether there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict of guilty, and we shall turn our attention to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Three witnesses testified on behalf of the Government. From their testimony and the official records produced, the following appears: The appellant was born on July 14, 1925; he registered with his local draft board on July 14, 1943, which was his 18th birthday. He was given a classification of 1-A by the appeal board. He was ordered to report for induction on July 30, 1945. No appeal was pending in his case on the date of entry of this order. He failed to report, but requested a personal appearance before the board, which request was granted. He came before the local board and was given a hearing that lasted about 15 minutes, but his classification was not changed. He then received his preinduction physical examination and was found qualified for service. He was again ordered to report for induction. This order commanded him to report on August 23, 1945. He says that he did not report because \u201che was not supposed to report under the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-15\">At the time appellant testified in the court below, he was 20 years of age and claimed to have been a minister of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses since he was 11. He said he was ordained by God. He had no certificate of authority except a representative card signed by himself.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was no proof as to his means of livelihood, as to the amount of time devoted to his ministry, as to his compensation as a minister, or as to the time devoted by him to any other business or calling.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-16\">The questions before the court below were as to whether the local board had given him a fair hearing; and, if it had, whether there was a reasonable basis in fact for his classification in 1-A. The second question depends in turn upon whether there was a rational basis for the board\u2019s finding that the registrant was neither a regular nor duly ordained minister of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-17\"> First, the burden of proving that he had not been given a fair hearing and was a regular or duly ordained minister of religion was upon the defendant, and he failed to meet it in any respect.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The registrant did not request a hearing before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>local board until after an order to report for induction had been mailed to him. His request was granted and a hearing was had, but the board was forbidden to reopen the classification after it had mailed the registrant an order to report for induction, unless the board first specifically found that there had been a change in his status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant had no control.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There was no such finding by the board arid could not have been, because there was no proof of a change in his status. The appellant invoked the hearing, and is not contending that it ought not to have been granted. He is complaining that it was inadequate and unavailing. He was not affected by this hearing, either beneficially or prejudicially, and we find no merit in his contention with respect to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">As to the second point, there was substantial evidence to support the board\u2019s finding that the appellant was not a regular or duly ordained minister of religion. If it be conceded that the evidence would have sustained a contrary finding, nevertheless the determination of the issue was within the jurisdiction of the local board, and its decision was final unless reversed on appeal. We have seen that the appeal board sustained the local board, and no appeal was taken to the President.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Under the scheme of the selective service law, as construed by the Supreme Court, the claim for exemption is decided first by an administrative board of local citizens who are familiar with the common acceptation of ordinary words; and upon judicial revi'ew in a criminal prosecution the issues of fact are submitted to a jury who are also presumed to know the meaning of words in common use, such as \u201cregular or duly ordained ministers of religion.\u201d This interpretation avoids a metaphysical discussion, and puts the decision of the question as to who are ministers of religion upon a practical basis.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">It appears, therefore, that both local and appeal boards, judge and jury, in administrative hearings and by judicial review, have decided against appellant the respective issues submitted to them. The latter has wholly failed to prove that either his classification or induction was void. Resolving all conflicts in the evidence, and all conflicting inferences therefrom, against the registrant, an appellate court must affirm the judgment of the district court in this case unless a fair and impartial tribunal was in reason bound to find as a fact that he was a regular or duly ordained minister of religion within the usual and ordinary meaning of those words.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">After an examination of the entire record, we find no reversible error therein, and the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-28\"> 54 Stat. 894, Sec. 11, 50 U.S.C.A.
