Adams and Ruth Adams, husband and wife, residents of California, acquired title to some real property in Inglewood, California. By a declaration executed, acknowledged and filed for record on November 5, 1943, they selected that property as their homestead.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to June 2, 1944, Federal taxes \u2014 withholding taxes, insurance contributions taxes, unemployment insurance taxes and coin-operated amusement device taxes \u2014 aggregating more than $12,000 were assessed against Bert O. Adams. On June 2, 1944, Bert O. Adams was adjudged a bankrupt. The case was referred, and Willianm I. Heffron was appointed trustee. On October 20, 1944, appellant, the United States, filed its claim in bankruptcy for the taxes assessed as aforesaid. On or about November 7, 1944, the trustee sold the homestead property, free and clear of liens, for $8,935.92, subject to the bankruptcy court\u2019s approval. On December 6, 1944, the referee in bankruptcy entered an order approving the sale. On April 26, 1945, the referee entered an order directing that the proceeds of the sale ($8,935.92) be distributed as follows: $6,967.96 to Ruth Adams and $1,967.96 to appellant\u2019s collector of internal revenue. From a judgment affirming the referee\u2019s order of April 26, 1945, this appeal is prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-14\">It is conceded that the interests of the bankrupt and Ruth Adams in the homestead property were equal interests, and that therefore $4,467.96 (the proceeds of the sale of Ruth Adams\u2019 interest in the homestead property) should be distributed to her. The question here is: How should the other <em>$4,467.96 </em>(the proceeds of the sale of the bankrupt\u2019s interest in the homestead property) be distributed?</p>\n<p id=\"b714-15\">Ruth Adams contends that, by reason of the homestead declaration of herself and the bankrupt, the $4,467.96 here in question is-subject to an exemption of $2,500 (one-half of $5,000)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which should be distributed to her, leaving only $1,967.96 for appellant. This contention,, which the court below upheld, must be rejected for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b714-16\">The Federal taxes assessed as aforesaid constituted liens in favor of ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>pellant upon all property of the bankrupt,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> including his interest in the homestead property, and, that interest having been sold, constitute liens upon the proceeds thereof \u2014 the $4,467.96 here in question.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Against such liens, exemptions prescribed by State laws are ineffective.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Bankruptcy does not invalidate such liens or prevent their enforcement.8 Section <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 24, recognizes exemptions prescribed by State laws, but does not render such exemptions effective against Federal tax liens. It follows that the $4,467.96 should be paid to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Judgment reversed and case remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-17\"> See \u00a7\u00a7 1237-1269 of the Civil Code of California.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"a4h-dedup-0\"> See \u00a7 1260 of the\u2019 Civil Code of California.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b715-23\"> 26 U.S.C.A.
