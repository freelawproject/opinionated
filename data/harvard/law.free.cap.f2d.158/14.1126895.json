It has failed to appear or in any manner to respond to said notices, and the Board\u2019s findings and orders are before us unchallenged by the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">We have examined the Board\u2019s findings and orders and we are of the opinion that said findings in each cause are sufficient to support the respective order, and the orders entered by the Board in each cause are in accordance with said findings and the statute. Since there is no reason shown why said findings and orders are not valid and should not be enforced, the petitions of the Board are granted, and the orders -of the Board will be enforced.
