Harris afterwards signed an agreement to employ appellant Friedman as her attorney and to pay him one-third of \u201cthe sum allowed or recovered.\u201d Appellant filed suit for Harris against the Terminal Company, which answered. Other attorneys, Kamerow and Doherty, moved on behalf of Harris to dismiss the suit, on the ground that Friedman was not authorized to file it. Appellant opposed this motion and also moved for leave to intervene in the suit. Depositions and affidavits which were filed make it plain that Harris then wished to be represented by Kamerow and Doherty and not by appellant, but are in conflict as to whether Harris\u2019 dismissal of appellant occurred before or after he filed the suit. The validity of Harris\u2019 original employment of appellant is also in dispute. The District Court, without giving appellant an opportunity to present oral testimony, denied his motion for leave to intervene and granted Harris\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-28\">Appellee contends that an attorney has no lien for his charges before judgment. But this court has held that during the progress of a suit an attorney of rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>ord under a contingent fee contract has an \u201cinterest in the cause of action.\u201d Kellogg v. Winchell, 51 App.D.C. 17, 20, 273 F. 745, 748, 16 A.L.R. 1159. He may intervene to protect this interest and after judgment \u201cthe lien * * * relates back and takes effect from the time of the commencement of the suit.\u201d Continental Casualty Co. v. Kelly, 70 App.D.C. 320, 322, 106 F.2d 841, 843. If Harris dismissed appellant before he filed the suit appellant has no lien and no right to intervene. Cf. Mitchell v. Mitchell, 143 App.Div. 172, 127 N.Y.S. <em>1065; </em>Woodbury et al. v. Andrew Jergens Co. et al., 2 Cir., 69 F.2d 49. In that case his only claim is to recover in a separate suit the value of his services. But if appellant had appellee\u2019s authority when he filed the present suit, he has a lien for the value of his services and a right to intervene to protect it. Even in that case, however, he can claim only the value of the services which he actually performed. Otherwise his client\u2019s right to choose her ownjawyer would have little practical value.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">The basic issue on the present appeal is whether, when appellant filed the present suit on behalf of Harris, he had her subsisting authority to do so. We think the District Court should have given him a full hearing, including an opportunity to present oral testimony, on that issue. Jacobsen v. Jacobsen, 75 U.S.App.D.C. 223, 126 F.2d 13; Farrall v. District of Columbia Amateur Athletic Union, 80 U.S.App.D.C. 396, 153 F.2d 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
