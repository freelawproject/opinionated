HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b896-17\">This appeal and two other appeals are from an order and two ancillary orders of the Bankruptcy Court, refusing to submit an \u201calteration\u201d of a plan of reorganization to the creditors and shareholders of the debtor. The debtor is the owner of a large office building in lower Manhattan known as the Equitable Office Building, which on April 10, 1941, filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter X, 11 U.S.GA. \u00a7 501 et seq. It had but one class \u2019of capital stock, which was without par value and consisted of 862,098 shares; it had issued bonds of $16,000,000, secured by a first mortgage; second mortgage bonds, of which only $3,000 remained outstanding; and $4,754,000 outstanding of five per cent debentures, due May 1, 1952. The court approved the petition on the day it was filed; but it was not until nearly three years later \u2014 on February 24, 1944\u2014 that the trustee filed any plan of reorganization under \u00a7 169, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 569. Various amendments were proposed to this from time to time thereafter; but the plan had taken substantially its present form by May 11, 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-18\">It provided that the, first mortgage of $16,000,000 should remain untouched; that the $3,000 remaining due on the second mortgage should be paid; that a new company should be formed which should issue to the debenture holders convertible income bonds for 60 per cent of their holdings, as well as 10 shares of new stock for every $100; that the claims of the unsecured creditors should be paid in full in cash; and that the old shareholders should receive new shares in the ratio of one to 10. The new convertible income bonds were to bear cumulative interest at five per cent, were to mature in 35 years and were to be secured by a second mortgage; the bondholders had the right to convert them into new shares, within two years after issue, on the basis of 16 for each $100; and, within three years after issue, on the basis of 10 shares for each $100. The authorized capital of the new company was to be 1,017,-993.8 shares, of a par value to be ascer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>tained by the trustee and approved by the court: 475,400 of which would be issued at once to the debenture holders, 456,384 would be reserved against the conversion privilege of the new bonds; and 86,209.8 shares would go to the old shareholders. Administrative and reorganization expenses were to be paid out of the cash in the hands of the trustees. On October 31, 1945, the current liabilities of the debtor were $242,000, together with $950,000 back interest upon the debentures.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Other amendments were proposed by creditors and shareholders after May 11, 1945, but on December 4, 1945, the court approved the plan under \u00a7 174, 11 U.S. C. A. \u00a7 574, as it had finally taken shape. Notice was then given under \u00a7 175, 11 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 575, \u201cto all creditors and shareholders who are affected,\u201d and the plan came on for confirmation under \u00a7 221, 11 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 621, on May 13, 1946, when the judge entered an order of confirmation. He signed various auxiliary orders during June and July, which are not important; and on July 8, 1946, entered an order of \u201cconsummation.\u201d This was not the \u201cfinal decree required by \u00a7 228, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 628, which presupposes earlier \u201cconsummation\u201d \u2014performance\u2014of the plan; it merely provided in detail the steps necessary to \u201cconsummate\u201d the plan. Before the prescribed transfers had been made, two shareholders, Knight and Doyle, on July 11, 1946, filed the petition which is the basis of this appeal, and which proposed, as an \u201calteration\u201d or \u201cmodification\u201d of the plan, an offer, made to the judge and the trustee in a letter of the City Investing Company (a large real estate company). This offer was to give the old shareholders an option to bu'y the new company\u2019s shares at $4.50 a share; to underwrite the issue; to receive as a commission 69,686 shares; and with the money so raised, together with the debtor\u2019s liquid assets, to pay off the debentures, principal and interest. The option price was later raised to $5.50, and finally (on July 19) to $6; the offer was to expire on October 17, 1946.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The judge held extensive hearings at which attorneys representing a substantial number of shareholders appeared and urged the acceptance of the offer; and at which the debenture holders unanimously opposed it, as was readily understandable, since the price of the-bonds had risen far above the amount of principal and interest. The court denied the petition in a short memorandum, as follows: \u201cThe deliberate and fully considered adjudication of a responsible court made and entered without objection on the part of any person in interest \u2014 and after all parties were afforded ample opportunity to be heard on the merits of the issues involved \u2014 -and when they and the public \u2014 as they had a right to do \u2014 confidently relied upon its integrity, should be something more stable than a weather vane * * * For this reason, my consummation order of July 8, 1946, will stand. It follows that the application to reopen the reorganization proceedings of the debtor will be denied.\u201d It was from this order and two other orders, which it is not necessary here to consider, that Knight and Doyle have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">The appellees argue that the appeal should be dismissed for two reasons: (1.) because the bankruptcy judge denied the motions, not for lack of power, but in his discretion; (2.) because the offer of the City Investing Company has now long since expired, and the whole controversy has become moot. We agree that the judge did not decide from lack of power, and that he exercised his discretion; indeed, wc should have had to assume as much anyway, had not his opinion, just quoted, proved it. Therefore, the order may not be disturbed unless he overstepped the permissible limits of his discretion. We also overrule the other ground for dismissing the appeal: i.e., that it has become moot. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>is indeed true that the offer of the City Investing Company has long since lapsed, and that at present there is no outstanding offer; but it does not follow that a new offer may not be made of enough cash to pay off the debentures. That depends upon whether the City Investing Company, or some other company will make such an offer; we cannot say on this record that the value of the debtor\u2019s property has so fallen in the past- six months that the equity has for practical purposes disappeared; and indeed the strong resistance of the debenture holders to the appeal suggests that it has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">The first question on the merits is whether the judge had the power, as he supposed, to submit the offer to the shareholders, because, if, as the appellees insist, he had not, it makes no difference whether he did not keep within the bounds of a sound discretion. We agree that he did have the power. Chapter X requires that a plan shall first have the \u201capproval\u201d of the judge (\u00a7 174) after the hearing provided in \u00a7 169 and \u00a7 170, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 569, 570. The parties interested must then accept it at a second hearing as provided in \u00a7 174, after which it is ready for \u201cconfirmation\u201d under \u00a7 221. It must then be performed, \u201cconsummated\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 224-227, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 624-627), and when \u201cconsummated,\u201d the judge must enter a \u201cfinal decree\u201d (\u00a7 228), which discharges the debtor from all its debts, cuts off' the shareholders, and discharges the trustee.' The Act makes no provisions for any \u201corder of consummation\u201d such as the judge entered on July 8, 1946; and, although it is a <em>convenient </em>way of specifying exactly how the plan is to \"be performed, - as we have already said, it is not to be confused with the \u201cfinal decree.\u201d The order of \u201cconfirmation\u201d 'is not conclusive, for \u00a7 222, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 622, expressly provides that the plan may be \u201caltered or modified\u201d after, as well as before, the plan has been confirmed. If an \u201calteration\u201d or a \u201cmodification\u201d does not \u201cmaterially and adversely affect the interests of creditors or stockholders,\u201d tliis may be done without further hearing; otherwise, if it does. It must be observed that, so far as concerns merely the grant of power, the statute makes no difference between the periods before and after confirmation.' That does not indeed mean that the fact of confirmation should play no part in the decision whether to use the power; but it does mean that confirmation is only a circumstance in the whole nexus of facts which will determine the question. Against this-the debenture holders invoke our decision in Country Life Apartments v. Buckley,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and the decision of the Seventh Circuit in Diversey Building Corp. v. Metropolitan Trust Co.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> In the first, the plan had provided for an outright sale of the property for cash at auction, and the \u201cmodification\u201d required the creation of a new corporation, the shares in which were to be exchanged for claims against the debtor; in the second, the plan had been in operation for nearly eight, years after confirmation; under it,an old bond issue had been divided into two parts of different priorities; and the \u201cmodification\u201d proposed an exchange of one of these new issues for preferred and common shares, and the outright cancellation of the other. We said in our opinion that there was a limit to what might be considered an \u201calteration\u201d or a \u201cmodification\u201d and that the proposal had exceeded it; and the Seventh Circuit spoke of the court\u2019s not having \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to act upon the proposal; we agree that, although there appear to be no limits to the changes which may be made in a plan before \u25a0 \u201capproval,\u201d and indeed thereafter, until .\u201cits submission for acceptance\u201d under \u00a7 179, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 579, nevertheless any changes after submission must be' to some extent congruent with the plan.. We cannot, however, agree that there are narrower or more definite limits than this. There is- nothing whatever in the joint report of the House and Senate Committee on \u00a7 77B, 11 U.S.C. <em>A. </em>\u00a7 207, to support such a conclusion. It is true that one clause of that report explained subdivision (f) \u2014 the precursor of \u00a7 222 \u2014 - as directed to the correction of \u201cerrors, mistakes and omissions\u201d; indeed, Congress may have had such modifications in mind as those which would not \u201cadversely affect the interests of creditors or shareholders.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>But the same clause begins with the words \u201cmatters not foreseen,\u201d and the proposed \u201cmodification\u201d at bar was of that kind: it provided for \u201cmatters not foreseen.\u201d The plan as confirmed, went back at least to December, 1945, and more properly to May, 1945, and the rise in value of the debtor\u2019s property which prompted the offer of the City Investing Company could not have been then foreseen. Nor were the proposed changes themselves so radical as to fall within our decision in Country Life Apartments v. Buckley, supra.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The first mortgage was to remain as before; the balance upon the second mortgage was to be paid as before; a new corporation was to be organized with the same capital as before; the old shareholders were to have the same number of new shares as before; the current liabilities were to be paid as before. The only change was that the debenture bonds were to be paid in cash instead of refunded in new bonds and new shares, and that to do this the shares which had been reserved for them, either immediately, or to answer their conversion privilege, were to be sold to the old shareholders, taken up by the City Investing Company, or were to go to that company for its underwriting commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">There remains the question whether the judge, having power to accept the \u201calteration,\u201d was free as matter of discretion to reject it. The only considerations which, so far as we can see, might properly have moved him to do so were (1.) a conflict of interest between the debenture holders and the shareholders; (2.) the fact that after long years of delay the reorganization had finally culminated in a confirmed plan, and (3.) doubts that the new company would be too much stripped of liquid assets to keep afloat. These we shall take up seriatim. We cannot agree that the debenture holders had as yet any legally protected interest in the property beyond the principal and accrued interest of their bonds, which could be weighed against the shareholders\u2019 interest. If in fact they had relied upon sharing in an equity in the property above that amount, it was without warrant of law and constituted no reason for depriving the shareholders of whatever chance might remain of realizing upon their property. The debenture holders were in truth not \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the proposed \u201calteration,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 222. It is of course true that there must come a time when a mortgagee or a creditor, who takes over his debtor\u2019s property in extinguishment of the debt, gets an indefeasible title, just as the mortgagee did in equity upon final decree of strict foreclosure; but Chapter X provides its own date when this shall occur; it is the date of the entry of the \u201cfinal decree\u201d under \u00a7 228. It is that decree which puts an end to \u201call rights and interests of stockholders\u201d and discharges all \u201cdebts and liabilities\u201d of the debtor. Until then creditors remain creditors; they have their claims and that is all they have; any \u201cmodification\u201d which guarantees them principal and interest on those claims, secures all the rights that a court need regard. The offer of the City Investing Company of July 11, 1946, did that; and we answer the first question that there was no party to the reorganization whose interest the judge could properly weigh against that of the shareholders, except in so far as by further delay the debenture holders\u2019 claims might be imperiled.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Next as to that delay and as to the fact that the plan had been confirmed. We recognize that, except upon the extremes! provocation, courts will not upset a judicial sale at auction, upon the ground that a new bidder has appeared who offers more than the knock-down price. Morrison v. Burnette,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In Re Burr Manufacturing- &amp; Supply Co.,<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> Currin v. Nourse.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> This unwillingness results from the effect upon such sales of knowing that a prospective bidder may abstain from bidding at the auction, may bide his time, and may then outbid the price at which the property has been struck down. That possibility tends to chill bidding at the sale, to dispose of the property by later competition on successive bids, and thu's to defeat the very purpose of an auction, which is to fetch together all those who may be interested to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>buy and to set them against each other with whatever stimulus that may provide, as opposed to other kinds of sale. None of this applies to a plan of reorganization. True, that presupposes a concourse of conflicting interests \u2014 creditors of different priorities and shareholders of different ranks \u2014 whose compromise in the plan itself will be a result of competition. But there is no occasion when all are brought together and pitted' against each other in a cash bidding: i.e., there is no occasion equivalent to an auction whose finality must be preserved if its advantages are to be preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"anj-dedup-0\">That does not indeed mean that delay in presenting an \u201calteration\u201d or \u201cmodification\u201d can never be relevant to its approval ; we recognize the force of what the judge said in his opinion, which we have quoted, that the considered judgment of a court is not to be lightly put aside. But there can be considerations more imperative than the despatch of judicial business, even after delays so long as existed in this case. If the legally protected interests of any opposing parties are fully preserved, it is not a good reason to deny others any reasonable chance to protect their own interests that they have been long in asserting them. Had it been shown that the equity which was presupposed in the proposal of the City Investing Company had existed for a substantial time before July 11, 1946, there would be force in what the judge said in his opinion; but that was not shown; so far as appears, the equity may have arisen from a recent increase in the value of the property. Delay would not cost the debenture' holders anything, for the proposal would give them interest until payment upon the full face of their bonds instead of Upon 60 per cent of it; and the property was adequate security.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The last question remains; whether the new company would have been so stripped of quick assets that it might prove unable to carry on its business: i.e., that its cash resources would have been at the danger point. This must be judged on the assumption that the debenture bonds would be paid off, and that the new company would owe nothing but its first mortgage bonds. There would be a little over a million shares of common stock behind the mortgage of which the old shareholders would hold 86,000, the City Investing Company about 70,000 and the remainder would be distributed between the two, according as the shareholders should have taken up their options. The amount of cash which would be left to carry on was necessarily speculative; but the prospect was undoubtedly of a much smaller margin than had been the company\u2019s habit in the past; perhaps it was so small that a majority of the shareholders would have preferred to take 10 per cent of their holdings, and let the option go. That was, however, not a question for the debenture holders or for the trustee; indeed, it was not even a question for the judge. It was for a majority of the shareholders, and for them alone, to decide whether they preferred to accept the chance of being able to pay the interest on the first mortgage; and if they chose to do so, the judge would not have been justified in interfering in their choice; it was a practical decision within the powers of the majority; Chapter X does not give to the bankruptcy court any larger supervision in such a situation than if the new company had been set up and sent upon its way.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">In conclusion therefore we can see no reason why the \u201calteration\u201d should not have been submitted under \u00a7 222; and we hold that it was an error to deny the petition. Upon remand the question will be whether the City Investing Company \u2014 or for that matter any other equally responsible underwriter \u2014 will within a reasonable time come forward with a reliable and practical offer which will produce enough money to pay off the debenture bonds, principal and interest. If such an offer is forthcoming, it should be treated as a permissible \u201calteration\u201d or \u201cmodification\u201d of the plan under \u00a7 222, and the judge should \u201capprove\u201d it, provided he finds that it satisfies the conditions we have just mentioned. Thereupon he should fix a hearing for its \u201cconsideration\u201d under \u00a7 222, and \u201ca subsequent time for its acceptance or rejection\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 222 and 223, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 622, 623. Since the only persons whose interests can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>\u201cadversely affected\u201d by such a change in the plan, are the shareholders, it follows that their votes alone will determine acceptance or rejection. Section 222 speaks in the alternative: creditors <em>\u201cor\u201d </em>share-</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">holders.
