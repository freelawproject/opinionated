R. O.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) Neptune Meter Company and a labor union, Independent Employees\u2019 Association of Neptune Meter Company (I. E. A.) each petition us to review and set aside a Board order, dated March 6, 1946, directing the \u201cdisestablishment\u201d of I. E. A. by the company;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Board petitions for enforcement of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The Statutory Provisions</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The Board based its orders on findings of violations by the company, as employer, of \u00a7 8(1) and (2) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(1, 2). Since experience indicates that, in argument of cases like this, the language of the statute is often forgotten, we quote the pertinent provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\">\u201cSec. 7. Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in concerted activities, for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-10\">\u201cSec. 8. It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-11\">(1) To interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-12\">(2) To dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization or contribute financial or other support to it: Provided, That subject .to rules and regulations made and published by the Board pursuant to section 6(a), an employer shall not be prohibited from permitting employees to confer with him during working hours without loss of time or pay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-14\">Section 8(2) is the principle-basis of the Board\u2019s orders. It \u201cDoes not forbid merely \u2018interference\u2019 by an employer. It also, disjunctively, provides that \u2018domination\u2019 of a union by an employer is unlawful. Domination arising from earlier acts of an employer may be violative of the Act even when the employer has stopped all active \u2018interference/ * * * And, in applying that provision, the courts and the Board must be guided by the statutory interpretation of the Supreme Court. The central factor, we are told, is the state of mind of the employees. In International Ass\u2019n. of Machinists v. N. L. R. B., 311 U.S. 72, 80, 61 S.Ct. 83, 88, 85 L.Ed. 50, the Supreme Court said that \u2018where the employees would have just cause to believe that solicitors professedly for a labor organization were acting for and on behalf of the management, the Board would be justified in concluding that they did not have the complete and unhampered freedom of choice which the Act contemplates.\u2019 And the court further said that such a conclusion may be reached by the Board \u2018even though the acts of the so-called agents were not expressly authorized or might not be attributable to\u2019 the employer \u2018on strict application of the rules of respondeat- superior,\u2019 since under that Act \u2018we are dealing * * * not with * * * technical concepts pertinent to an employer\u2019s legal responsibility to third persons for acts of his servants, but with a clear legislative policy to free the collective bargaining-process from all taint of an employer\u2019s compulsion, domination, or influence.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-15\">The Board, in connection with its first order, decided that the Neptune Company dominated E. R. O.; this the company virtually conceded in its briefs and oral argument in this court. In connection with its second order, the Board decided that the company also dominated I. E. A. The principal question for our decision is whether, in reaching this conclusion, the Board acted upon findings of fact supported by substantial evidence and upon rational factual inferences drawn from those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-16\">The Facts as Found by The Board</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>We think there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings of fact which are, in effect, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">For some sixteen years, from 1919 to August 1, 1935, the company had dominated a labor organization of its employees, the Congress of the Neptune Meter Company. The Congress consisted of a House of Representatives, a Senate, and a Cabinet. The House was composed of representatives of the non-supervisory employees of various departments; the Senate represented the foremen and supervisory employees; and the Cabinet, in which the executive power of the Congress was vested, was composed solely of representatives of the directors and officers of respondent. \u201cBills\u201d passed by the House, and concurred in by the Senate, relating to wages, hours, or working conditions as well as amendments to the constitution became effective only with the approval of the Cabinet. Membership in the Congress of all employees was automatic and conferred only the right to vote in an annual election of representatives. It carried no obligation to pay dues. No provision was made for participation in the affairs of the Congress by the employees generally. No meetings of the general membership were held. The House officers were elected, not by the employees generally, but by the representatives. The company paid various expenses to the Congress. It furnished to the Congress stenographic service, printing and mimeographing machines and paper fo' ballots and notices. It permitted the Congress to use plant bulletin boards. It paid the representatives for all time spent in meetings of the organization or on other business of the Congress. All meetings and business of the Congress were conducted on respondent\u2019s premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">On August 1, 1935, about a month after the effective date of the National Labor Relations Act, Ricketts, vice-president and manager of the company, advised a meeting of the House that the Act made it unlawful for the company to contribute support to a labor organization and that the Congress plan must be discontinued. He announced that thereafter the Senate would be a Foreman\u2019s Meeting, but that \u201cif the majority of employees so desire, they can continue this representative plan and the company will allow them to meet in the regular meeting-room once every two weeks on the company\u2019s time.\u201d Minutes of this meeting were posted on the bulletin-boards in the plant. A poll of the employees was conducted at the plant during working hours, the employees balloting on several questions including, \u201cAre you satisfied with the present form of Representation? Are you satisfied with your present Representatives?\u201d The great majority having answered yes, the president of the House appointed a Committee of Representatives to draft a Constitution for a revised representative organization, called the Employees\u2019 Representative Organization (E. R. O.). On October 1, 1935, the House amended the draft presented by the Committee and adopted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The structure of E. R. O., except for the elimination of employer participation, was substantially like that of the Congress: All employees automatically became members ; there were no dues and no membership meetings. With a few exceptions, the employees who had constituted the old House remained as representatives of E. R. O., and House officers and House Committee members continued in corresponding posts in E. R. O. The Company permitted meetings of E. R. O. on company property during working hours. It paid the representatives of E. R. O. for time spent in conducting its affairs or transacting its business during working hours. It also permitted E. R. O. elections to be conducted on its premises and during working hours. It furnished various kinds of supplies to E. R. O. and permitted it to make free use of its printing and mimeographing machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">In the latter part of 1936, when the C. I. O. became active among the employees, E. R. O. asked the company for a collective bargaining agreement, and such an agreement was executed to become effective in 1937. Similar agreements were made in the years following.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">When E. R. O. had been functioning for some nine years after the Act became effective, the Board on June 8, 1944, issued a complant against the company based on its relations with E. R. O. A copy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>complaint having 'been served on E. R. O., its president, Landi, a week later, on June IS, called a meeting of its representatives. Landi told the meeting that the practice of holding E. R. O. meetings on the company\u2019s premises might be violative of the Act. The meeting decided to \u201chold * * * future meetings on the outside and to continue to hold the Organization in its existence\u201d; it also decided to take a vote of the employees to find out whether they \u201cstill want to carry on with our Organization by holding meetings on the outside.\u201d On June 20/ a notice, signed by Landi as E. R. O. president, was posted in the company\u2019s plant, stating that the next day a vote by ballot would be taken on that subject. Such balloting was conducted on June 21, by E. R. O. representatives, in the plant and during working hours. A large number of employees voted in the affirmative. At a meeting of E. R. O. representatives, held on June 22, in the plant during working hours, Landi appointed an \u201cOrganizing Committee\u201d of five such representatives to draw plans, pursuant to the June 21 vote, to be presented to the employees at a mass meeting. Koopman, who had been Chairman of an important E. R. O. Committee, was named as one of the members of this \u201cOrganizing Committee.\u201d The minutes of the June 22 meeting, showing the appointment of this Committee and the names of its members, was posted in the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The Board conducted its hearings as to E. R. O. from July 10 to July 12. In this interval, the persons who on June 22 had been appointed members of the \u201cOrganizing Committee\u201d met informally with Dau-walter, the E. R. O. Secretary, and with another E. R. O. representative. Koopman acted as Chairman of this informal meeting which concluded that, on the basis of the evidence taken at the Board\u2019s hearing, the Board would probably hold that E. R. O. was not independent of the company. The meeting decided that it would therefore be necessary \u201cto form a brand new organization.\u201d The \u201cOrganization Committee\u201d appointed on June 22 never met or functioned. But the group, just above described, which had met informally, constituted themselves an \u201cOrganizing Committee\u201d to form a \u201cnew organization\u201d and, to that end, to solicit an initiation fee of one dollar from each employee. As a result, about $700 was thus collected. This money was turned over to Dauwalter, who was still the E. R. O. Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">At Koopman\u2019s request, Landi, the E. R. O. President, called a special meeting of some twenty employees on July 18 which was told of the \u201cbrand new organizing committee\u201d and that no further meetings of E. R. O. would be held. However, no formal action to dissolve E. R. O. was then taken, nor were the minutes of the July 19 meeting recorded or posted, nor was any formal notice then given to employees, other than the twenty present at this meeting, that E. R. O. had been discontinued.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">On July 20, the Committee decided on Independent Employees\u2019 Association (I. E. A.) as the name of the new organization. Thereafter the Organizing Committee distributed, outside the plant and not in working hours, membership cards to the employees who had previously paid initiation fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">On August 29, the Committee similarly distributed notices of an \u201cinitial organization meeting\u201d of I. E. A. to be held the next night, August 30, after working hours and outside the plant. The minutes\u2019of that meeting, referred to as \u201cthe first meeting\u201d of I. E. A., show that Koopman, described as \u201cChairman of the Organization Committee,\u201d presided. He explained that a Committee had originally been formed to devise means of continuing E. R. O. so reorganized as to eliminate the use of company time and property, but that it had been decided subsequently to form \u201ca brand new independent organization,\u201d with E. R. O. as \u201ca thing of the past.\u201d The meeting elected as temporary officers of I. E. A. persons who had in some manner previously served in some official capacity in E. R. O. The meeting also approved of a decision to retain a law-firm to advise I. E. A. This, law-firm had drafted a constitution and bylaws for I. E. A. but they were not then adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">On September 6, six days after this meeting, the Board\u2019s trial examiner issued his intermediate report finding that E. R. O. was company-dominated and recommending that the company disestablish it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>On September 7, I. E. A. representatives told the company that I. E. A. represented a majority of the employees and asked a conference for the purpose of establishing its representative status and of obtaining recognition. On September 14, the company replied that recognition of I. E. A. would be premature because the Board\u2019s decision as to E. R. O. had not yet been rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">A week later, on September 21, the company posted notices stating that E. R. O. was disestablished. At an I. E. A. meeting on October 4, the company\u2019s refusal to recognize I. E. A. was reported. It was the sense of the meeting that immediate recognition should be asked. At this meeting, the I. E. A. constitution and bylaws were adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Two days later, on October 6, a representative of the International Holders and Foundry Workers of America, A. F. of L. (the \u201cHolders\u201d) asked the company to recognize it as the bargaining representative of the employees in the company\u2019s foundry; he offered to show the application cards of those employees. The company replied that it would not bargain with any union unless and until it had been certified by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Three days later, on October 9, I. E. A., by letter, again asked the company for recognition. On October 12, six days after the company\u2019s refusal to deal with the Molders union, company representatives met with the temporary officers of I. E. A. and Koopman. At this meeting, after discussion in which mention was made of a walkout, the company agreed to recognize 1. E. A. on proof of its majority status. On October 14, I. E. A. submitted membership cards to the company; as a check showed that I. E. A. had been designated by a majority of the employees, the company thereupon recognized it.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">A week later, October 21, the Board issued its order requiring E. R. O. to be disestablished. The company then again posted notices disestablishing E. R. O.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">Subsequent negotiations resulted in execution of a collective bargaining agreement between I. E. A. and the company, to become effective January 1, 1945. The contract was to endure for a year and to be automatically renewable unless notice to the contrary was given. It included an exclusive recognition clause, provision for voluntary check-off of dues, and other clauses dealing with wages and hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">On March 22, 1945, the Board issued its complaint with respect to I. E. A. After hearings duly held, the trial examiner issued an intermediate report on June 16, 1945. On March 6, 1946, the Board made a decision and order, which adopted the examiner\u2019s report, with certain modifications, and which found the facts in effect as above set forth. Since there is substantial evidence to support these findings, we must take them as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-14\">The Board\u2019s Factual Inferences</p>\n<p id=\"b509-15\">On the basis of inferences from these facts thus found, the Board further found, in effect, as follows: The fact that the company failed to disestablish E. R. O. before the formation of I. E. A. and the fact that I. E. A. was initiated and sponsored by a group of E. R. O. officers and representatives suggested to the employees a substantial identity between I. E. A. and E. R. O.; the employees therefore would reasonably conclude that the company approved I. E. A. as it had E. R. O. and the Congress, so that the employees\u2019 choice of I. E. A. was \u201cnot as free as the statute demands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-16\">The Board so concluded despite the fact (1) that \u201c1. E. A. has made a consistent effort to divest itself of the indicia of company domination\u201d; (2) that it \u201cdiffers structurally from the E. R. O. in that\u201d its \u201cconstitution and by-laws provide for regular meetings of the general membership, membership dues and initiation fees, and in autonomy in the election of officers and further conduct of its business as a labor organization\u201d; (3) that, with few exceptions, its permanent officers have not been prominently identified with the Congress or E. R. O.; (4) that its meetings have been held away from the company\u2019s premises and outside of working hours; and (5) that its contract of January 1, 1945, with the company \u201cappears to have been agreed upon after several bargaining conferences and incorporates certain benefits not previously enjoyed by the employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>On the basis of its findings and inferences, the Board ordered that I. E. A. be \u201cdisestablished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">This Court\u2019s Limited Authority</p>\n<p id=\"A83\">We must, as above noted, accept the facts as found by the Board, regardless of whether, independently, we would have so found. The decisions of the Supreme Court put it beyond doubt that it is also irrelevant whether from those facts we would have drawn the factual inferences drawn by the Board.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">As we have heretofore stated, in opinions by Judge Learned Hand, we have interpreted those Supreme Court decisions to mean that, when we have decided that the substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s findings, our statutory authority is severely restricted to that of determining (1) whether the Board\u2019s factual inferences as to employer-domination are so irrational that they cannot stand, and (2) whether, if they do stand, those inferences justify the Board\u2019s order. See Westinghouse Electric &amp; Mfg. Co. v. N. L. R. B., 2 Cir., 112 F.2d 657, affirmed per curiam, 312 U.S. 660, 61 S.Ct. 736, 85 L.Ed. 1108; N. L. R. B. v. Standard Oil Co., 2 Cir., 138 F.2d 885; cf. Herzfeld v. Federal Trade Commission, 2 Cir., 140 F.2d 207, 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">In the Standard Oil case [138 F.2d 886,] Judge Hand said that the \u201ccrux of the matter\u201d in cases of this type is \u201cwhether the employees have been properly disabused of the earlier influences under which * * * they had been bargaining for the preceding * * * years,\u201d and went on to say, \u201cWe understand the law to be that the decision of the Board upon that issue is for all practical purposes not open to us at all; certainly not after we have once decided that there was \u2018substantial\u2019 evidence that the \u2018disestablished\u2019 union was immediately preceded by a period during which there was a \u2018dominated\u2019 union * * * Theoretically there may be situations in which the cleavage between the old union and the new is such that a court could say that there was no \u2018substantial\u2019 evidence to support an order of \u2018disestablishment.\u2019 Labor relations are after all not like the exact sciences; they do concern occurrences which, if not within the range of ordinary experience, are not totally alien to it. But any such reserve is not very real; and certainly when the sequence is not broken by a substantial period, marked at the outset by an outright repudiation of whatever has gone before, we shall regard the matter as not open to review unless the Supreme Court advises us to the contrary.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We know of no subsequent Supreme Court decision which so advises us.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-16\">We perceive no significant differences between the facts of the instant case and those in the Westinghouse and Standard Oil cases. It is scarcely debatable that E. R. O. was but the Congress under a new name. Thus, unquestionably, this employer, uninterruptedly, for some twenty-five years, dominated this two-named union, and for the last nine of those years, from 1935 to 1944, did so unlawfully, in violation of \u00a7 8 of the Act. The pivotal issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>for the Board was therefore whether this quarter of a century of domination suddenly evaporated in 1944 with the creation of I. E. A. That it did not, the Board concluded as a factual inference from the facts which it had found. We see no more reason for rejecting that inference in this case than we did for rejecting like inferences in the Westinghouse and Standard Oil cases supra. That here, as in those cases, the \u201csequence\u201d was \u201cnot broken by a substantial period, marked at the outset by an outright repudiation of what\u201d had \u201cgone before * * * \u201d appears from the following facts among others:</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Prior to September 21, 1944 \u2014 before which time the company had not in any way indicated a severance of its relations with its captive E. R. O. \u2014 these events had occurred: (1) A committee consisting of E. R. O. officials and representatives organized I. E. A.; (2) this committee grew out of a committee which, a short time previously, had been appointed by the E. R. O. President; (3) this new committee collected I. E. A. initiation fees and paid them to the E. R. O. Secretary; (4) the E. R. O. President called a special meeting of employees; (5) the minutes of this meeting describe it as \u201cthe first meeting of the Independent Employees Association\u201d; (6) Koopman, a prominent E. R. O. representative, presided at this \u201cfirst meeting\u201d of I. E. A.; (7) that same meeting elected as temporary officers of I. E. A. persons who had acted in official capacities in E. R. O. All this before the company took any steps to \u201cdisestablish\u201d E. R. O. Moreover, subsequent to the first notice of \u201cdisestablishment\u201d of E. R. O., the company refused to consider whether the Molders\u2019 Union represented a majority of the molders in the company\u2019s employ, unless and until the Board certified that union; but, six days after this refusal, the company considered the majority status of I. E. A. without imposing a similar condition of Board certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Indeed, one need not resort to any doctrines peculiar to so-called \u201cadministrative law\u201d to sustain the Board\u2019s inferences. For, if these inferences had been made by a jury, they would have been impregnable. Here, as suggested in an earlier opinion,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we derive illumination from the following: In a conspiracy suit, if it has been established that a person participated in an unlawful conspiracy, he then has the burden of overcoming the inference (sometimes erroneously labeled a \u201cpresumption\u201d) that he has continued that participation, by proof of acts satisfactorily disclosing a severance of that relation. The question of continued connection with the conspiracy is one of fact for the jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> So here, if the crucial issue (i. e., whether the company had taken sufficient steps to disabuse the employees\u2019 minds of the belief that in 1944 they were still subject to unlawful employer-domination) had been left to a jury, and if the jury had returned a general verdict against the company, we would not, on the evidence in this record, dream of disturbing the jury\u2019s verdict (i. e., its inference from the facts) even if we would not ourselves have arrived at its conclusion. Since, then, we would sustain a jury\u2019s general verdict grounded upon the evidence in this record, we cannot say that the Board\u2019s inferences are so irrational that we may reject them. For the Supreme Court has held that the specifically stated inferences of the Board \u2014 a body of \u201cspecialists in a particular field advised by experts\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 are, to say the least, entitled to as much dignity as a jury\u2019s general verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">The facts that the employees express satisfaction with I. E. A., that the structure of I. E. A. differs from that of E. R. O., and that its permanent officers with few exceptions have not been persons prominently identified with E. R. O. or the Congress, would not have rendered irrational a jury\u2019s verdict that I. E. A. was employer-dominated. No more do those facts permit us to over-turn the Board\u2019s conclusions. Considering the Board\u2019s findings, supported as they are by substantial evidence, \u201cWe must treat this case as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>simple one in which employees designate a company dominated union as their bargaining representative.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The company and I. E. A. argue, however, that the effectiveness of I. E. A. in bargaining with the company does not jibe with the thesis of company domination. Responding to a similar contention, we said in Sperry Gyroscope Co. v. N. L. R. B., 2 Cir., 129 F.2d 922, 930: \u201cIt is argued, however, that this conclusion must be wrong because, in negotiations between the company and Brotherhood, important differences developed. The argument runs that a dominated union would accept without question whatever the employer offered. But there may be \u2018domination,' within the meaning of the Act, which does not reach the point of abject servility. The test, according to the Supreme Court, is whether there is \u2018free collective bargaining free from all taints of an employer\u2019s domination * * * or influence.\u2019 International Ass\u2019n of Machinists v. N. L. R. B., supra. A minor may be under his father\u2019s influence despite the fact that he may not always accept all his father\u2019s dictates. . That a client had argued with his lawyer about the size of the lawyer\u2019s fees would not compel the conclusions that a contract between them relating to the client\u2019s property was not voidable. Proof that there were some areas, of disagreement between a guardian and ward would not alone dispel the \u2018presumption\u2019 that dealings between them were not at arms\u2019 length. Negotiations by a union only partially free of employer influence are not what the statute contemplates. It is for the Board, not the courts, to find whether the degree of independence of company influence is sufficient to escape condemnation as constituting domination forbidden by the Act. N. L. R. B. v. Link-Belt Co., supra; cf. Morgan Stanley Co. v. Securities &amp; Exchange Comm. [2 Cir., 126 F.2d 325]; Detroit Edison Co. v. Securities &amp; Exchange Comm. [6 Cir., 119 F.2d 730] * * * It is suggested that for three years, since June 1939, the Brotherhood has served as a gargaining agent to the satisfaction of a majority of the employees and that the Board\u2019s order is unwisely disruptive. But that suggestion begs the basic question, which is whether the employees were free to choose or reject Brotherhood. Since the Board finds that they were not free, and those findings are supported by the evidence, what we have here is a union company-dominated, * * * Disruption of such dominated relations is authorized by the Act. The wisdom of that statutory policy is not for the courts to consider.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">Having in mind, then, our narrowly limited authority, we think that we may not say that the Board erred with respect to the crucial issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">The Board\u2019s Orders</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">The Board\u2019s order of October 21, 1944, as to E. R. O. has not become moot, for the employer\u2019s compliance with such an order, it has been held, does not -create mootness. N. L. R. B. v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, 303 U.S. 261, 271, 58 S.Ct. 571, <em>82 </em>L.Ed. 831, 115 A.L.R. 307. However, there is now no need for enforcement as to so much of that order as requires posting of notices with respect to E. R. O.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-14\">Part of the order of March 6, 1946, forbids recognition of I. E. A. or of any other labor organization until it has been certified by the Board. We have been referred to an unreported order of the Third Circuit, entered May 2, 1941, in N. L. R. B. v. Jersey Maid Corp., adjudging the employer in contempt and enjoining it for a period of one year from recognizing any union not thus certified. Here there is no time limitation; application for certification of a union may be made at any time. In the circumstances, we consider this portion of the order within the Board\u2019s power conferred by \u00a7 10(a) and (c) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160 (a, c),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> for that \u201cPower extends to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>remedy appropriate to redress the unfair labor practices which the employer is found to have committed.\u201d NLRB v. American Laundry Machinery Co., 2 Cir., 152 F.2d 400, 401; N. L. R. B. v. Link-Belt Co., 311 U.S. 584, 600, 61 S.Ct. 358, 85 L.Ed. 368; Sperry Gyroscope Co. v. N. L. R. B., 2 Cir., 129 F.2d 922, 931; cf. Woolworth Co. v. N. L. R. B., 2 Cir., 121 F.2d 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">A helpful analogy may be found in B. B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis, 314 U.S. 495, 498, 62 S.Ct. 406, 408, 86 L.Ed. 367. There the Court held that the owner of a valid patent was not entitled to a decree for infringement because it had \u201cabused\u201d the patent by improper conditions in its patent licenses. The patent-owner advised the Supreme Court that it would forthwith cease that improper conduct and offered to grant unconditional licenses. But the Court said: \u201cIt will be appropriate to consider petitioner\u2019s right to relief when it is able to show that it has fully abandoned its present method of restraining competition in the sale of unpatented articles and that the consequences of that practice have been fully dissipated.\u201d We think that equivalent considerations justify a \u201cbreathing spell\u201d here. \u201cNothing is gained and much time and effort is lost by a discussion of the correct definition of \u2018disestablishment.\u2019 That word occurs nowhere in the Act. One suspects that it is attractive because mouth-filling. We should not be bewitched by it. It is merely a label for the allowable means to achieve enforcement where there has been a violation of \u00a7 8(2) through \u2018domination\u2019 or \u2018interference,\u2019 in which event the Board has broad statutory powers to prevent its continuance ** * * The choice of remedies is for the Board.\u201d<footnotemark>11a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The company suggests that the employees may insist on perpetuating I. E. A. and, if it be not recognized by the Board, they may strike, thus seriously disturbing the company\u2019s business. But we assume that the employees will respect our decree enforcing the Board\u2019s order; sec N. L. R. B. v. National Broadcasting Co. Inc., 2 Cir., 150 F.2d 895, 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">The orders should, however, be modified, in line with our ruling in Westinghouse Electric &amp; Mfg. Co. v. N. L. R. B., 2 Cir., 112 F.2d 657, 661, by adding a provision that the employees are not obligated to join or organize a union affiliated with a national union.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">Petitions to review denied; orders as modified affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-13\"> 58 N.L.R.B. 1240.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"am7-dedup-0\"> 66 N.L.R.B. 292.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b506-17\"> Sperry Gyroscope Co. v.

Our function, says the Supreme Court, is narrowly limited to determining (a) whether there was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings of fact and (b) whether, on <em>the </em>basis of those findings, if thus supported, the Board had the statutory power to make its order. It is our duty in this case to comply with the Act enacted by Congress, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, our personal views being entirely irrelevant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b511-10\"><em> </em>Sperry Gyroscope Co. v.

National Labor Relations Board v. Standard Oil Co., 2 Cir., 138 F.2d 885, 888. But even there we recognized that \u201cTheoretically there may be situations in which the cleavage between the old union and the new is such that a court could say that there was no \u2018substantial\u2019 evidence to support an order of \u2018disestablishment.\u2019 \u201d I think we should hold that this is such a case; for I see no justification in the facts found by the Board for inferring that, the company interfered with or dominated I. E. A. Acting independently and without any suggestion from their employer, the employees decided that it was necessary to abandon E. R. O. and \u201cform a brand new organization\u201d; they engaged an attorney to draft a constitution and by-laws for I. E. A.; these were adopted at a meeting on October 4th, which was after the company had posted the notice of September 21st disestablishing E. R. O. and notifying its employees that they were free to join C. I. O. or any oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>er labor organization; and recognition was not granted I. E. A. until after its officers had threatened to strike if it were not recognized, and after the company had determined by checking the membership cards that it represented a majority \"of the employees. Naturally, it was true that some of the leaders in E. R. O. took a leading part in organizing I. E. A, If this is enough to taint the latter, I do not see how an independent union can ever be organized, for the leaders among the employees will necessarily be the initiators of the new organization. Only in point of time was I. E. A. the \u201csuccessor\u201d to E. R. O.; for, as already noted; before its organization was completed the company had given formal notice disestablishing E. R. O.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The provision in the order of March 6th forbidding recognition of any union until it shall be certified by the Board will necessarily result either in compelling the employees to join a union affiliated with C. I. O. or A. F. of L., or in leaving them without a collective bargaining representative for an indefinite period of time, because, in view of the Board\u2019s finding as to domination, no request by I. E. A. for an election would be granted, nor would the name 'of I. E. A. be allowed to appear on the ballot if an election were held at the request of any other union. Nor can I conceive of any way in which the employees could in the near future reorganize I. E. A. or form a new unaffiliated union that the Board would hold to be untainted by domination. In short, the \u201cremedy\u201d applied destroys the very right which it purports to preserve, namely, the right \u201cto bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
