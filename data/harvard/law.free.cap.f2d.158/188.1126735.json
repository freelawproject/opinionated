(e). Appellant is a dealer in automobiles. It is not disputed that he owned the automobile and that it was willfully sold by his regular salesman at a price above the-ceiling. Appellant denies that he personally participated in the violation of the Act and attacks the evidence which tended to show that he did so. But we need not consider whether that evidence was competent and sufficient, for personal participation -by the owner of a business is not necessary to his civil responsibility for vio-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>latious of the Act by his agents.
