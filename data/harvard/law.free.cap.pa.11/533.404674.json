The plaintiffs in error were plaintiffs below, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>brought their action against the defendants, charging them as common carriers of a large quantity of goods shipped on board the steamboat Auburn, of which defendants were owners. The goods had been consumed by fire at a landing on the river.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-3\">The <em>narr. </em>set forth the delivery of the goods to the defendants, and that, in consideration, &amp;c., defendants promised to take due and reasonable care about the delivery, and that, by reason of the improper conduct of the defendants, the goods were lost to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-4\">After the preliminary proof as to ownership, &amp;c., the plaintiffs offered as proof of the undertaking of the defendants, the receipt of the clerk of the boat, as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-5\">\u201c Received from W.

The contract should be proved as laid. Exceptions must be stated. The court rejected the evidence, and verdict was taken for defendants.
