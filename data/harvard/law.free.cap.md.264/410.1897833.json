Early in 1970, having contracted to sell it, subject to rezoning, to Robert C. Reid, the editor and publisher of the Bowie Blade, they sought to have the property reclassified from R-R (Rural Residential) to 1-1 (Light Industrial). The Prince George\u2019s County Planning Board, adopting the recommendation of its Technical Staff, recommended to the County Commissioners sitting as the District Council<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>that 3.19 acres be placed in the 1-1 classification (subject to certain conditions no longer relevant), and that 3.80 acres be \u201cwithheld from consideration in order to provide for parks.\u201d *<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On 30 October 1970 the Council adopted a resolution reclassifying the property in accordance with the recommendation of the Planning Board. In June the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County (Meloy, J.) affirmed the action of the Council. The appeal to this Court followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">We have said quite often that there is a strong presumption of the correctness of original zoning and comprehensive rezoning and that to sustain a piecemeal change therefrom there must be produced strong evidence of mistake in the original zoning or else evidence of a change in conditions resulting in a substantial change in the character of the neighborhood. <em>Wells v. Pierpont, </em>253 Md. 554, 557 (1969). The burden of proof, of course, is quite onerous and it rests squarely on the one seeking the reclassification. <em>Agneslane, Inc. v. Lucas, </em>247 Md. 612, 618 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Conspicuously relevant here is what Judge Barnes said, for the Court, in <em>Montgomery v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>256 Md. 597, 602 (1970) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">\u201cInasmuch as there is no contention in the present case that there was a mistake in the original zoning [the same is true here], it was necessary that the applicants establish before the District Council (a) what area reasonably constituted the \u2018neighborhood\u2019 of the subject property, (b) the changes which have-occurred in that neighborhood since the comprehensive rezoning and (c) that these changes resulted in a change in the character of the neighborhood. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>These are the \u2018basic facts\u2019 and \u2018conclusions\u2019 which the District Council must find and express in writing when it grants or denies a map amendment or special exception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">It is in this light that the \u201cFindings of Fact and Conclusions\u201d of the District Council must be tested and to that end they are repeated below in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">\u201cFINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">\u201cThe subject property is located on the east side of Route 3, which is also shown as Route 301 on the Zoning Map, and is 1,400 feet north of Cambridge Court. It is located in the northeast quadrant of the intersection of Route 50 and Route 301-3. The Patuxent River forms a natural barrier to the east. To the west is Bowie, with its eastern boundary terminating on the west side of Route 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">\u201cAlthough the property is not located within the city limits, it is related physically and socially with the vicinity west of Route 3. The City of Bowie considered this application and opposition did come from the Bowie vicinity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-9\">We find that the neighborhood is not so clear of delineation as to exclude the City of Bowie. This is particularly true where the area is rural in character and where, as here, a plan includes the subject property within a larger one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-10\">\u201cWe are mindful of the Bowie-Collington Master Plan and note that the Planning Commission and its staff, as well as the City, recommend the zoning. We think it important because we are within the initial stages of development of this Plan to adhere to it substantially. We find that the granting of this application with conditions, so as to protect neighboring properties meets the suggestions of the plan and the development of the proposed use would be compatible with the neighboring uses. The City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>helped develop the plan and criteria for use in this area and obviously thought this application met the locational criteria newly adopted by the Plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">\u201cWe feel that the zoning changes shown on the map, the increase in density in Bowie and immediately south of the subject property, the increase of traffic on Route 3, the establishment of a fraternal organization and religious use south of the subject property, are substantial changes which have established the future development pattern. The properties along Route 3 in this area have lost their potential for residential development and can be properly called an employment area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">\u201cWe do not think the granting of this request will establish strip zoning on Route 3. The fact that this property is abutting an industrial like use, has a service road, and will not be developed under the ordinary concept of industrial use, abuts park property to the east and will be buffered from Route 3 and is adjoined by nonresidential uses to the south, negates the possibility of this kind of future zoning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Notwithstanding appellees\u2019 failure to produce any evidence tending to establish what area reasonably constitutes the \u201cneighborhood\u201d the Council had a go at it anyway. The result, the second paragraph of the \u201cFindings of Fact and Conclusions,\u201d might well have been written by Charles Dillon Stengel. <em>Ellis v. Bailey, </em>249 Md. 591, 592 (1968). How illuminating it is to be told that the \u201cneighborhood is not so clear of delineation as to exclude the City of Bowie,\u201d and to learn that this is \u201cparticularly true where <em>the area is rural in character </em>and where, as here, a plan includes the subject property within a larger one.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Just how a neighborhood can be \u201crural in character\u201d and, at the same time include, or not exclude, the City of Bowie is beyond our ken, yet that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>is what the Council seems to be trying to say. But, as we shall see, it makes little or no difference here. We shall assume that the plan mentioned by the Council is the Bowie-Collington Master Plan, adopted in July 1970. The Council begins the third paragraph of its findings with a pious acknowledgment of the existence of the plan and then, with prestidigitatory grandeur, proceeds to sweep it aside. The same paragraph implies, in a murky sort of way, that the reclassification \u201cmeets the suggestions of the plan.\u201d The Council sees support for this implication in the speculation that the City of Bowie \u201cobviously thought this application met the locational criteria newly adopted by the plan.\u201d The expression \u201clocational criteria\u201d seems to have reference to certain \u201cconditional employment areas\u201d shown on the map accompanying the plan. The hard cold fact, however, is that the nearest \u201cconditional employment area\u201d shown on the map is a good half mile south of the Dowe property. The area is in the northeast quadrant of the interchange of the John Hanson Highway (U. S. Route 50) and U. S. Route 301-Maryland Route 3, and a few hundred feet north of it.* <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As we see it the proposed reclassification is clearly at odds with the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Other than an espousal of the recommendations of the Planning Board the appellees offered no evidence of any change in conditions which might have produced a substantial change in the character of the neighborhood, whatever its area might reasonably be said to be. The Council cited \u201czoning changes shown on the map,\u201d increases \u201cin density in Bowie\u201d and south of the property, the establishment of a fraternal organization and a religious use south of the property as being \u201csubstantial changes which have established the future development pattern.\u201d One cannot but be struck by the studious avoidance of the phrase \u201csubstantial change in the character of the neighborhood.\u201d But if we look closely we see that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>there is no substance in the cited changes. There is nothing in the record about \u201czoning changes shown on the map.\u201d We assume that by \u201cmap\u201d is meant Exhibit 1A, identified as a segment of the Zoning Map adopted in 1959. The Dowes\u2019 property looks to be an island surrounded by a sea of land zoned R-R. The nearest zoning change is more than a mile away as the crow flies; by road it appears to be about two and a half miles. It is true, of course, that there has been an increase in the population of Bowie, Sherwood Manor (just south of the property) and Forest Hills (on the other side of Route 3) but as Chief Judge Hammond said in <em>Heller v. Segner, </em>260 Md. 393, 399 (1971),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">\u201c* * * [l]n some six cases at least in the last two years, we have held that intensification, even heavy intensification resulting in large population growth, of residential uses adjacent to or surrounding a residential property sought to be rezoned to commercial use * * * will not of itself justify or support the commercial rezoning * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">citing <em>Wright v. McCubbin, </em>260 Md. 11 (1970) ; <em>Hardesty v. Dunphy, </em>259 Md. 718 (1970) ; <em>Cabin John Ltd. v. Montgomery County, </em>259 Md. 661 (1970) ; <em>Chapman v. Montgomery County, </em>259 Md. 641 (1970) ; <em>Harley v. Aluisi, </em>259 Md. 275 (1970) ; <em>Miller v. Abrahams, </em>257 Md. 126 (1970) ; <em>Wells v. Pierpont, </em>253 Md. 554 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">An \u201cincrease of traffic on Route 3\u201d was mentioned but how much it may have increased was not shown. It is common knowledge, we think, that for many years Route 3 has been a heavily traveled highway. Whether its use when the zoning map was adopted in 1959 was greater or less than it is now has not been shown nor do we think it significant. <em>Surkovich v. </em>Doub, 258 Md. 263, 272 (1970); <em>Elliott v. </em>Joyce, 233 Md. 76, 81 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">The \u201creligious use south of the subject property\u201d has to do with the adjoining 4.6 acre parcel owned by the Trustees of the Belcroft Bible Church and on which they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>propose to build a church that will seat 250 people. Churches are permitted uses in the R-R zone and we have said that the location in a residential zone of improvements of a character permitted by the ordinance, even though not necessarily compatible with a residential development, is not the type of change in character of a neighborhood which will justify reclassification. <em>France v. Shapiro, </em>248 Md. 335, 343 (1968), and the cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The mention of \u201cthe establishment of a fraternal organization\u201d obviously refers to the 3.50 acre parcel adjoining the church property upon which the Knights of Columbus, at the time of the hearing before the Council, were building their clubhouse. It appears to be conceded that a special exception for this purpose was obtained. It is indeed odd, therefore, to find the Council citing as evidence of a substantial change in the character of the neighborhood a use which it must already have determined to be compatible with the R-R classification. <em>Creswell v. Baltimore Aviation Service, Inc., </em>257 Md. 712, 719 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The Technical Staff mentioned two nonconforming uses, a junkyard 500 feet north of the Dowe property and a sawmill one-half mile further north. It was careful to call them \u201cvariations from residential land uses.\u201d The notion that legal nonconforming uses are not evidence of a change in the character of the neighborhood can hardly be questioned at this late date and that, we assume, is the reason the Council avoided any reference to them. <em>Helfrich v. Mongelli, </em>248 Md. 498, 505 (1968). Nevertheless the appellees argue, and Judge Meloy seems to have agreed, that the recommendations of the Technical Staff and the Planning Board constitute probative evidence which alone is enough to make the issue of change fairly debatable, citing <em>Finney v. Halle, </em>241 Md. 224 (1966). We think the uncontradicted testimony of Kathleen Montgomery, <em>infra, </em>in light of what we said in <em>Habliston v. City of Salisbury, </em>258 Md. 350, 361-62 (1970), is dispositive of this argument. Mrs. Montgomery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>pointed out \u201c18 substantial errors\u201d in the report of the Technical Staff. She doubted the author of it \u201creally left his office\u201d but she did not \u201cbelieve that this shoddy workmanship is typical\u201d of the Planning Board. She preferred \u201cto think that the author was either ill, overworked or had not had time to study the master plan or to visit the subject area in person.\u201d She noted, with obvious relish, that \u201cthe author of this particular technical report is no longer with\u201d the Planning Board. Our review of the record persuades us she was not far off the mark. In <em>Habliston </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">\u201cAppellees attach significance to the Planning Commission\u2019s adoption of the staff report recommending the reclassification from \u2018Industrial\u2019 to \u2018Residential B\u2019 and the Commission\u2019s like recommendation to the City Council. They say we have held that \u2018these reports are \u201cprobative evidence\u201d \u2019 which, per se, can make the change issue fairly debatable, citing * * * [cases]. In a sense this is true but it must not be supposed that such reports, per se, are either inviolate or invulnerable. They are subject to the same analysis and appraisal that other types of evidence must survive to have probative force. The statements of both Creamer and Burhans, his assistant, make it quite clear that there was little, if any, investigation and study of the situation by the staff and that its conclusions do not rise much, if at all, above the level of wishful thinking; in <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs v. Oak Hill Farms, </em>232 Md. 274, 284 (1963), we said the \u2018staff report dealt largely in \u201cabstractions without meaningful specifics.\u2019 Other than the bland and entirely unsupported assumption of \u2018a change in the character of the area from industrial to predominantly residential use due to abandonment of the brickyard\u2019 there is nothing whatever in the staff report touching up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>on events or circumstances which might affect the character of the neighborhood. We find absurd the notion that this kind of \u2018tinkling cymbal\u2019 should make an issue fairly debatable merely because it was written by the Planning Commission\u2019s staff and then made a part of the record before the Council.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">There was a broad suggestion at argument that the establishment may have been bending over backward a little in order to win a few Brownie points with the publisher of the Blade. If true then, as we see it, the Council bent over a little too far. The learned trial judge should have reversed the action of the Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\n<em>Order reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the appellees.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-11\">.
