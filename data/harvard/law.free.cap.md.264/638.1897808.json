He asked that the court declare his receipt of various shares of stock in well known corporations, a present from the decedent during the donor\u2019s lifetime, to be a valid <em>inter vivos </em>gift. This claim is not disputed either by the personal representative or the beneficiaries of the estate. The appellant, the Register of Wills for Somerset County, was granted leave to intervene by the trial court (Maryland Rule 208) on the allegation that: \u201cThe State of Maryland has a substantial interest in the subject matter of the suit by virtue of certain death taxes to which the State may be entitled out of the shares of corporate stock described in the Bill of Complaint.\u201d Chief Judge Duer ruled that the donee had complete title to the stock free and clear of other claims, including the obligation to pay death taxes. This appeal ensues.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">The facts of this controversy are neither complicated nor contested. Joseph Carter Sterling, the decedent, gave his nephew 1453 shares of blue chip stock having substantial value. There was one gift in December 1967 and another in the spring of 1970. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The certificates for all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>of the shares were delivered to the nephew at the time of each gift and he in turn used them as collateral in order to obtain loans to pay for a house he intended to build. The only vestige of interest the donor retained in the securities was the right to receive the dividends for the rest of his life. The uncle died on October 4, 1970 and subsequently the nephew brought this suit to establish his ownership of the stock and apparently to avoid the consequence of paying death taxes. However, both he and the appellant have mistakenly based their arguments on the assumption that a declaration establishing the nephew\u2019s title is also determinative of whether an inheritance tax is due. Such is not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The appellant maintains it was error for the trial court to conclude that upon delivery of the stock title had passed to the appellee. He argues that the uncle did not make a completed gift to his nephew but rather demonstrated only an intention to part with the securities. Appellant says that the retention of dividends by the donor represented a dominion and control over the property which was inconsistent and incompatible with the transfer of absolute ownership. He next reasons that if a donor \u201cdemonstrates an intention to make a future gift or a conditional gift in remainder, there can be no presently perfected gift.\u201d We agree with the logic of this statement but find it inappropriate. We are not faced in this case with the unfulfilled desire to make a future gift; instead it is undisputed that actual physical delivery of the certificates was made by the uncle to the appellee. All that is involved here is whether the decedent\u2019s retention of the dividends for his life invalidated the gift. Clearly it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">If there is proper delivery, the donor of a gift can relinquish title to a vested remainder and at the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>time retain a present interest in the property. In <em>Parry v. Parry, </em>231 Md. 584, 191 A. 2d 439 (1963), we were faced with the almost identical factual situation as the one now before us involving a donor who gave away various securities but continued to receive the dividends. There Judge Prescott, speaking for the Court, said: \u201cAnd the mere fact that [the donor] retained a life interest therein did not prevent the immediate vesting of the title to the remainder in [the donee].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 586. For a similar ruling see <em>Allender v. Allender, </em>199 Md. 541, 87 A. 2d 608 (1952). In the present case Joseph Carter Sterling reserved a life interest in the securities he gave his nephew, but this dominion over the property did not invalidate the gift nor preclude title to the remainder from passing to Joseph Coulbourne Sterling.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">However, this result in no way affects the imposition of the inheritance tax. It is really inconsequential to appellant who owns the remainder interest in this stock\u2014 for if it be the uncle or his nephew \u2014 the real issue is whether the donor had any control over the securities at the time of his death. If he did, then the provisions of Art. 81, \u00a7 151 of the Maryland Code (1957, 1969 Repl. Vol.) apply. According to that law, if the decedent \u201cretained <em>any dominion </em>during his lifetime\u201d over the property, an inheritance tax is due (emphasis added). Section 151 goes on to state that: \u201cThe reservation of a beneficial interest in favor of the decedent or of a power of revocation, absolute or conditional or of a power of appointment by will or otherwise, in or over any property passing subject to the tax imposed by this subtitle, shall be deemed to constitute dominion within the meaning of this section.\u201d This Court has not had the opportunity to fully refine the meaning of \u201cdominion\u201d under the statute, but it has been the subject of some discussion. In <em>Register of Wills v. Blackway, </em>217 Md. 1, 8, 141 A. 2d 713 (1958), Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e for the Court said: \u201cThe retention of a beneficial interest, such as a life estate, is now a sufficient basis for the imposition of the tax [under the statute].\u201d In <em>Safe Dep. &amp; Tr. Co. v. Bouse,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>181 Md. 351, 29 A. 2d 906 (1943) the Court, in discussing \u00a7 111 of Art. 81 of the Code (1939), the predecessor of \u00a7 151, stated at page 360:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">\u201cIn 1936 the Maryland Legislature broadened the law of this State by declaring that the inheritance taxes shall apply to all property passing by will or under the intestate laws, or by deed, gift, grant, bargain or sale made in contemplation of death, or intended \u2018to take effect in possession at or after the death of a decedent.\u2019 The Act is applicable to all property over which the decedent \u2018retained any dominion during his lifetime,\u2019 and the Act expressly states that the reservation of any beneficial interest in favor of the decedent shall be deemed to constitute \u2018dominion\u2019 within the meaning of the Act. This Court holds that a deed of trust by which a person conveys property in trust to pay to himself the income for life, and upon his death to pay the <em>corpus </em>to designated beneficiaries passes a beneficial interest subject to the Maryland Inheritance Tax Act as a transfer intended \u2018to take effect in possession at or after the death of a decedent.\u2019 We can make no distinction in the application of the Inheritance Tax Act between a testamentary transfer and a transfer <em>inter vivos </em>intended to take effect at death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Likewise, we think that the rationale of this statement from <em>Bouse </em>controls the case now before us. See also 25 <em>Ops. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>675, which discusses this issue and comes to a similar conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">There is a sparsity of cases in Maryland which deal with the precise question here, apparently because the statute is quite clear and unambiguous. When \u00a7 151 uses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>the term \u201cdominion\u201d it is unequivocally stating that if a donor retains any control over the property until his death, then an inheritance tax is due and payable. This conclusion is consistent with rulings by federal courts which have construed similar provisions of the federal estate tax law. See 26 U.S.C.A. (I.R.C. 1954) \u00a7\u00a7 2035-38, particularly \u00a7 2036. Just a few of the many applicable cases are: <em>United States v. O\u2019Malley, </em>383 U. S. 627, 16 L.Ed.2d 145, 86 S. Ct. 1123 (1966) ; <em>Commissioner of Int. Rev. v. Church, </em>335 U. S. 632, 93 L. Ed. 288, 69 S. Ct. 322 (1949) ; <em>Guynn v. United States, </em>437 F. 2d 1148 (4th Cir. 1971) ; <em>Skinner\u2019s Estate v. United States, </em>316 F. 2d 517 (3d Cir. 1963) ; <em>Honor\u2019s Estate v. C.I.R., </em>305 F. 2d 769 (3d Cir. 1962) ; <em>McNichol\u2019s Estate v. C.I.R., </em>265 F. 2d 667 (3d Cir. 1959) ; <em>Greene v. United States, </em>237 F. 2d 848 (7th Cir. 1956) ; <em>Atkinson v. United States, </em>231 F. Supp. 933 (E.D. S.C. 1964). See also Soled, <em>Estate Tax Consequences of Inter Vivos Transfers of Stock in a Closley-Held Corporation, </em>31 Md. L. Rev. 191 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">We therefore affirm the trial court\u2019s decision but determine its order should be amended to include an additional declaration stating that the appellee owes the appropriate inheritance tax on all stock involved in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">\n<em>Order of the trial court dated July 9, 1971 amended to include the additional declaration that the appropriate inheritance tax is owed by Joseph Coulbourne Sterling on the aforementioned securities.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">As <em>amended the order of court is affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Joseph Coulbourne Sterling.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-9\">.
