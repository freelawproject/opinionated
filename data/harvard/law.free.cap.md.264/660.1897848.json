Since we conclude that there was no coverage under the policy, we shall reverse a declaratory judgment entered to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Appellant, The Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (Aetna), is a member of United States Aircraft Insurance Group (the group). The group, composed of a number of insurance companies, issued an aircraft policy to Gerald E. Weikel. The declarations provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">\u201c5. Pilots. This policy shall not apply to an aircraft while in flight unless operated by the following pilot (s) :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">Gerald E. Weikel holding an FAA Private Pilot Certificate. Also, any pilot holding an FAA Private or Commercial Pilot Certificate who has flown a minimum of 500 hours as Pilot In Command at least 100 hours of which shall have been in retractable geared aircraft.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">On October 10, 1968, Weikel and his passenger, Diane M. Twigg, were killed when the named aircraft crashed near Fort Ritchie. At the time of the crash the weather was not suitable for flying except by instruments. Aetna pointed to the fact that Weikel held only a student pilot certificate and says this did not authorize him to fly by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>instruments. Regulations introduced by it clearly forbade any student pilot to \u201cact as pilot in command of an aircraft [t]hat [was] carrying a passenger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Damages as the result of the crash were claimed by the parents of Miss Twigg in a suit filed in the Circuit Court for Washington County against John H. Urner as Administrator of Weikel\u2019s estate. One provision of the policy granted \u201c[a]ny one of the Companies [named in the policy] * * * the power to institute and maintain suits in its own name * * * for breach of any * * * obligation arising from or by reason of [the policy] and any judgment so obtained * * * by any one of the Companies * * * [is to] be binding on all of the Companies * * *.\u201d Invoking that provision, Aetna instituted a declaratory judgment action naming as parties defendant the administrator of the Weikel estate, the parents of Miss Twigg, and the administrator of her estate. It sought a declaration that none of said parties was protected by the subject policy \u201cfor any liability arising from the accident of October 10, 1968,\u201d that Aetna \u201cand its associated companies are not required to defend any claims or actions growing out of the aforesaid accident,\u201d and that Aetna \u201cand its associated companies are not required to pay any judgments, or any part of any judgments, which [might] be rendered as a result of the suit now filed arising from the alleged injuries to, and the death of, Diane M. Twigg by reason of the aforesaid accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In the circuit court a certificate was filed from the Federal Aviation Administration to the effect that Weikel never had had \u201ca private pilot certificate\u201d and that he never had held \u201cany other of higher level,\u201d a point not here disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">We do not see this case as involving the question of whether the fraud of Weikel made the policy void from the beginning, whether the insurer had a duty to inquire about the exact licensing of the insured, or whether the insurer waived its right to rescind the policy, all as con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>tended by the appellees, nor do we see the ease as involving the question of the circumstances under which a company may rescind, as seen by the trial judge, but rather we see the point as one of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Of course, what we have here is a contract and we are obliged to interpret that contract. Recognition has previously been given to the right of an insurer to limit by contract its potential liability. In <em>Galford v. Nicholas, Adm., </em>224 Md. 275, 167 A. 2d 783 (1961), this Court considered, and upheld as not in conflict with our financial responsibility law, a Virginia policy providing coverage for claims arising out of the use of any motor vehicle not owned by the insured. At the time of the accident in Maryland the insured was operating his own vehicle acquired after issuance of the policy and prior to the accident. Limitation to operation in a given territory was recognized by Chief Judge Thomsen in <em>Kelly v. Phoenix Assurance Company of New York, </em>225 F. Supp. 562 (D. Md. 1964), a point involved in the controversy that produced <em>Casualty Ins. Co. v. Messenger, </em>181 Md. 295, 29 A. 2d 653 (1943), where our predecessors determined the proper means of computing radius under such a policy. A limitation on the insurer\u2019s liability is recognized in the various cases that have considered the application of the \u201comnibus clause\u201d in an automobile liability policy, <em>e.g. Keystone Ins. v. Fidelity &amp; Cas., </em>256 Md. 423, 260 A. 2d 275 (1970) ; <em>Unsat. C. &amp; J. Fund v. U.S.F. &amp; G., </em>256 Md. 412, 260 A. 2d 279 (1970) ; and <em>Cohen v. Am. Home Assurance Co., </em>255 Md. 334, 258 A. 2d 225 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">A requirement in an aircraft policy that the pilot meet certain standards would be analogous to a requirement in a motor vehicle policy relative to the operator of the vehicle. On that subject 7 <em>Blashfield Automobile Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 314.4 (3d ed. 1966) at p. 567 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">\u201cThe policy may provide that the insurance company shall not be liable for losses or damage caused while the automobile is being driven by any person violating any law or ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>as to a driving license, and such a provision is not contrary to public policy, unreasonable, or void; under such a provision there can be no recovery against the insurance company when the accident occurred while the vehicle was being driven by an unlicensed driver, even though the breach of such provision was not a proximate cause of the accident, and although the law requiring a license became effective after the policy was issued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-4\">\u201cUnder a provision excluding coverage for injuries caused by the insured vehicle while being operated by a person violating regulations governing the licensing of drivers or a person whose license to drive has been suspended or revoked, there is no liability where the driver\u2019s license had expired, regardless of whether the violation increased the hazard. A provision in the policy that the insurer shall not be liable while the automobile is being used by a person prohibited by law from driving it is not meaningless and ineffective, and defeats liability to one hit by the insured automobile while being driven by an unlicensed driver.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">7 <em>Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 4401 (1942) states at pp. 349-50.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">\u201c[T]he insurer has a perfect right to restrict the operation to persons who are legally qualified under the state statutes to operate an automobile, and such a provision will be upheld. * * * Where an accident occurs while an unlicensed operator is at the wheel, the insurer would not be liable upon a policy containing such a restriction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">Among the decisions supporting this proposition are <em>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Coughran, </em>303 U. S. 485, 82 L. Ed. 970, 58 S. Ct. 670 (1938) ; <em>Giacomo </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number><em>v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., </em>203 Minn. 185, 280 N. W. 653 (1938) ; <em>Mondou v. Lincoln Mut. Casualty Co., </em>283 Mich. 353, 278 N. W. 94 (1938) ; and <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Belshe, </em>195 Ark. 460, 112 S.W.2d 954 (1938). In <em>Schaal v. Great Lakes Mut. Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>6 Wis. 2d 350, 94 N.W.2d 646 (1959), a policy under its exclusions provided that it should not apply while the automobile was operated by \u201cany person who [was] not legally licensed to operate an automobile.\u201d The operator at the time of the accident had no license. Although the Wisconsin statute relative to liability insurance made the provision inapplicable on that subject, it was held applicable as to claims arising from the collision portion of the policy. In <em>Universal Indemnity Ins. Co. v. North Shore D. Co., </em>100 F. 2d 618 (7th Cir. 1938), the policy did not cover any liability \u201cin respect of injuries caused in whole or in part by any automobile insured [t] hereunder while being operated or manipulated by any person violating regulations governing the licensing of motor vehicle operators, or when driven by any person whose right to drive ha[d] been enjoined by proper authority or whose license to drive ha[d] been suspended or revoked.\u201d Although the operator had had a license for a number of years prior to the accident, he had not renewed his license for the year in which the accident took place. The court held that one whose license had expired upon his failure to secure a renewal \u201cwas in the position of one whose license to drive had been \u2018suspended or revoked.\u2019 \u201d The court then went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">\u201cDefendant urges the materiality of a causal connection between the violation in question and the happening of the accident. Granting the validity of the coverage exception, it is an enforceable provision of the policy contract; and the legal consequence is that the risk of the loss under the proscribed conditions is not assumed under the contract obligation of the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>surer. \u2018Courts of high authority have held that in policies so phrased there is no need of any causal nexus between the injury or death and the forbidden forms of conduct. While the proscribed activity continues, the insurance is suspended as if it had never been in force.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 620.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">citing <em>Travelers Assn. v. Prinsen, </em>291 U. S. 576, 581, 54 S. Ct. 502, 78 L. Ed. 999 (1934). In <em>Sneed v. Concord Ins. Co., </em>98 N. J. Super, 306, 237 A. 2d 289 (1967), the policy provided coverage for certain named individuals \u201cprovided they [were] duly licensed to operate an automobile.\u201d Unfortunately, the driver of the vehicle in question permitted her license to expire on April 30. The accident took place on May 15. She renewed her license on May 17. The court held the lack of a license on the day of the accident abated the coverage of the policy in respect of the accident, stating, \u201cThe meaning of the policy language is not subject to fair doubt.\u201d It brushed aside a contention that this was a mere \u201ctechnical violation.\u201d However, it went on to hold the company liable because of estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">An insurance policy may exclude coverage when the airplane is flown by certain types of persons or pilots. 11 <em>Couch on Insurance </em>2d \u00a7 42:634 (1963), citing <em>Pacific Indemnity Company v. Kohlhase, </em>9 Ariz. App. 595, 455 P. 2d 277 (1969). In the latter case the declarations provided coverage when the aircraft was piloted by a named individual, by a second named individual \u201cwhile under the direct supervision and control of a commercial instructor pilot,\u201d or when piloted by a private or a commercial pilot \u201cproperly certificated by the FAA\u201d with certain minimum specified flying time, or when flown by a properly certificated pilot in the course of his employment by FAA or a repair station. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">\u201cWhere, however, the undisputed facts show that no coverage exists, <em>i.e., </em>that the accident is clearly within an excluded risk, then the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>court has a duty to direct a verdict for the insurer. <em>Cashen v. Camden Fire Insurance Association, </em>48 Tenn. App. 470, 348 S.W.2d 883 (1961); 46 C.J.S. Insurance \u00a7 1373, p. 636; <em>Arizona Fire Insurance Company v. Dillingham, </em>23 Ariz. 508, 205 P. 589 (1922). Here the evidence conclusively shows that there was no coverage \u2014 the aircraft was in flight and piloted by one other than a pilot designated in the declarations. (The aircraft was piloted by a student pilot having no more than 33 hours logged flying time.)\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279-80.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">To like effect <em>see Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company v. McDaniel, </em>187 F. Supp. 614 (N. D. Miss. 1960), <em>aff\u2019d </em>289 F. 2d 926 (5th Cir. 1961), where the policy was made not applicable if the aircraft were operated \u201cin violation of the terms of any Civil Aeronautics Administration Pilot Certificate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">As we see this case, the question is whether there was coverage under the policy at the time of the accident, not whether the policy was void <em>ab initio. </em>If a person other than Weikel had been flying the plane, coverage would have existed only if that person\u2019s license and experience conformed with the declarations in the policy. In other words, there could be no coverage unless such pilot held either \u201can FAA Private or Commercial Pilot Certificate\u201d and even then only if he had the hours specified in the policy as \u201cPilot In Command,\u201d including the specified experience \u201cin retractable geared aircraft.\u201d It is obvious that the type of certificate held by a pilot would have a direct bearing on the exposure of the insurance company and, consequently, upon the determination of a proper rate, just as the location o* the cabs in <em>Boyer v. Transit Casualty Co., </em>263 Md. 36, 282 A. 2d 3 (1971), had a bearing on the rate there. When the group placed the words \u201cholding an FAA Private Pilot Certificate\u201d after Weikel\u2019s name we conclude those words were just as much intended to specify the requirements which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>would be necessary for coverage of his operation of the plane as the language used relative to other pilots was intended to specify with reference to them. Since he held no \u201cFAA Private Pilot Certificate,\u201d there was no coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Insurance coverage can not be established by waiver. <em>A/C Electric Co. v. Aetna Ins. Co., </em>251 Md. 410, 419, 247 A. 2d 708 (1968), and <em>Prudential Ins. Co. v. Brookman, </em>167 Md. 616, 620, 175 A. 838 (1934). We perceive no conduct on the part of Aetna here which would estop it from denying coverage. The attempt by it to settle with the claimants is not a basis for estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">\n<em>Order reversed and case remanded for passage of a declaratory judgment consistent with this opinion; appellees to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
