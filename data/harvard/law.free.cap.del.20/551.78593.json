Although where the fact of killing is shown by the prosecution, unaccompanied by circumstances of legal justification, excuse or mitigation, the law presumes that the homicide was committed with malice until the contrary be shown; yet it merely implies malice, and therefore the legal presumption goes no further than that the killing is murder of the second degree under the statute. In such case, before a verdict of murder of the first degree can lawfully be rendered, the prosecution must show by the facts and circumstances attending the homicide that the killing was done with a sedate, deliberate purpose, and formed design to take life.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b559-15\">8. A confession of guilt reduced to writing and signed by the person making it, if deliberately made and signed, without being influenced thereto by any threats or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>promises by others, should be regarded, in the absence of testimony to the contrary, as strong and convincing evidence in the case.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b560-5\">9.

Taylor, a colored man, in Wigglesworth\u2019s livery stable, on Tenth street, near Orange, in the city of Wilmington, on the night of Sunday, January 3, 1904.

We believe that we are supported in this by the weight of authority. We would suggest to the counsel, however, that, when the confession is offered in evidence, they can object to its admissibility, and raise the question, and we will pass upon it at that time, as to what effect that confession shall have upon the jury, and you can ask us to charge the jury that the confession of one prisoner cannot be evidence against the other. We will then act upon your prayer as to instructions to the jury according as we deem the law to be.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-6\">Evidence was offered tending to prove that the statement was made by the defendant Jiner to the Chief of Police in the presence of his clerk and others, which statement was reduced to writing, smoothed up a little, copied on a typewriter, and then read to Jiner and signed by him, and that said statement was freely and voluntarily made by Jiner, without any inducements in the way of threats or offers of reward on the part of the police officers or others, but that the statement was elicited by questions asked Jiner, which questions were not embodied in the statement, but that said statement contained all that was considered of any consequence. The Attorney-General then offered the above statement in evidence as the confession of Jiner. The same was objected to by Sylvester D. Townsend, Jr., Jiner\u2019s counsel, on two grounds : <em>First. </em>That any statement made by a prisoner in the custody of a police officer, detective, or other authorities, is not a free and voluntary confession, under the provisions of the fifth amendment of the Constitution of the United States, and the police have no right to question or cross-examine any prisoner arrested or charged with a crime.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-7\">\n<em>Bram vs. U.

Because questions are asked in order to elicit a statement, and are not written down, but only the answers to them, does not invalidate the admission of the statement as evidence, for we have uniformly accepted statements given in a narrative form, without the questions which drew out the statement appearing in the confession. So that, according to our uniform practice, these statements have been admitted in this form without the questions being set out. As he has signed it after it was read over to him, it is presumably what he wanted to say and wanted to confess, and there is no evidence that there was anything said by him that he wanted put in the paper, other than what appears there. We overrule the objection, and hold that the written confession of Jiner is admissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-8\"><em>Mr. </em>Hastings:\u2014In this statement of Jiner there are certain references to the defendant Brinte which I desire to have the Court strike out of the confession, on the ground that it was not made in the presence of <em>Brinte; </em>that in the place of Brinte's name the language \u201cone other\u201d be used.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-9\">Grubb. J.:\u2014The whole confession is in evidence. We refuse to strike out the name of Brinte therefrom, upon the authority of <em>State vs. Jones, et. al., Houst. Cr., Cas., 320.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-10\">The Attorney-General offered similar proof as to the typewritten confession of Brinte, which was admitted in evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>against the objection of his counsel, on the same ground as was the admission of the confession of Jiner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-5\"><em>Mr. </em>Townsend:\u2014I ask that all that applies to Jiner in Brinte\u2019s confession be either stricken out, or put in such condition that it will be unknown to the jury, on the ground that it was not made in the presence of Jiner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-6\">Grubb, J.:\u2014We refuse your application. It is admissible, subject to your prayers for instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-7\">The Court, through Grubb, J., at this point instructed the jury that any reference made in the confession of either of the prisoners implicating the other prisoner was not to be considered by them as evidence in the case against such other prisoner, but that the confession of each prisoner was to be taken only as against the one who made it. The Attorney-General thereupon read the confession of the prisoner Brinte, and also of the prisoner Jiner,. to the jury, which confessions were as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-8\">Statement of Walter Brinte. On Sunday, January 2d, about 10.30 A. M., John Jiner came to my house over Eleventh street bridge, and asked me to go out with him. We went out and took a walk together. He asked me to come up to George Wiggles-worth\u2019s stable to see him that night. He then left me and came uptown. About 10 o\u2019clock Sunday night I went to the stable to see him, and he told me that I was too early. I left him and went back some time after the cars had stopped running, He then said to me,' Let\u2019s go back here in the house to see some onebut, instead of going into a house, he took me outside in a small street back of the stable, and asked me if I had nerve enough to hit Taylor. I told him that I didn\u2019t, and he said : 'You can hold your ears, and I\u2019ll hit him. I don\u2019t give a damn.\u2019 We then went into the stable, and went into the office, and waited there until Taylor went asleep. We then went out and pulled down the elevator, and Joiner cut the weight off. We went into the office again, and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>made several cigarettes and smoked them. After a little while he said to me, \u2018If you can\u2019t hit him, go outside and. hold your ears and turn out the lights.\u2019 I went out and turned out the lights, and Joiner hit him. He then called me in and turned on the light? and Taylor was lying there and was groaning. Joiner pulled off his pants and searched them. Then Taylor turned a little and groaned, and Joiner took the weight and hit him in the head again. He then found his money in the inside pocket of his coat. There was $25. After he got the money he took the weight and hit him again. Joiner then got Taylor\u2019s overcoat and put it on, and got all of his clothes, and we went out the back way of the stable, and along Tatnall street to Eleventh street. We went down Eleventh street to John Welsh\u2019s saloon. In the saloon Joiner treated several times, and bought a quart of whiskey, and got several cigars. We then went to John Dougherty\u2019s, and went to bed. We got up about 5 o\u2019clock Monday morning and went on the street cars as far as Shellpot Park. It was very cold, and we came back into the city again as far as Tenth and Market. We waited there for some time, and then we took a Darby car and went to Philadelphia. While in Philadelphia, Pa., Joiner paid all my expenses, and gave me three dollars to pay my lodging. He again gave me five dollars. While there he gave me a watch to keep for him. He afterwards took it from me again, We stayed all night in a lodging house on Sixth street, and the following morning (Wednesday) I came home, since which time I have not seen Joiner. I make this statement voluntarily, and without promise or reward of any kind.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-4\">Waltee Beinte.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-5\">Witnesses : Geoege Black, Chief of Police.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-6\">Chaeles E.

On Sunday night, January 3, 1904, Walter Brinte came to Wigglesworth\u2019s stable to see me. He had previously been to the stable, and we had seen Taylor with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>$200, and he had told us that he had put it all in bank but $26.04. He had two pocketbooks. In the large book he had two ten-dollar and one five dollar bill, and in the small one he had a paper dollar and four cents. Brinte suggested that we take the money from him, and I agreed to it. Early Sunday evening Brinte came to the stable, and stayed around awhile. He then went away, and came back towards midnight. We then had a talk, and Brinte got a knife, and we went to the elevator, and while I held the elevator ropes Brinte cut the weight off. I then tied the ropes up with a piece of rope I took with me. Brinte then took the weight and wrapped a piece of blanket about it. Taylor was sitting in a chair, with his head in his hands, and Brinte approached him and struck him with the weight. Taylor then commenced to moan and make considerable noise, and Brinte said to me, \u201cDon\u2019t let him holler.\u201d I then took the weight and struck him the second blow. Brinte, then searched him, and took the large pocketbook, with the twenty-five dollars in it, and I took the small one, with the one dollar and four cents in it. We then turned out the light in the stable and started out. When Brinte noticed the watch on Dr. Miller\u2019s buggy he took it, and I took Taylor\u2019s overcoat and two shirts. We went along Eleventh street to Welsh\u2019s saloon. We went into the saloon and I bought a pint of whisky for 50 cents. I took the $5 bill from the big pocketbook and paid for the whisky, in order to break the money so we could divide it. After we came out of the saloon we divided the money. Each of us got $12.77. From there we went over Eleventh street bridge and stayed all night at John Doughtery\u2019s house. Brinte paid him $1 for the lodging. The next morning we got on a Vandever avenue car and rode to Market street, where we got on a Darby car and went to Philadelphia. We stayed all day and night on Ludlow street, with a woman named Hannah Madden. On Tuesday we took the watch to a shop to have it fixed, and stayed all night Tuesday in a lodging house at Sixth and Lombard street. On Wednesday Brinte left me in Broad Street Station, and I went back to Ludlow street. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>pawned the overcoat, and gave the ticket to the Madden woman to keep for me. I left there about 3 o\u2019clock Thursday afternoon, and then started to Harrisburg, where I was arrested.

The clock taken from the carriage of Dr. Miller at Wigglesworth\u2019s stable on the night of the murder was recovered from a pawnshop in Philadelphia, where it had been pawned by Brinte, and was subsequently returned to the owner. After proving the above facts the State rested. The defendants produced no evidence.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b567-9\">Grubb, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ANs\">charging the jury :</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">Gentlemen of the jury :\u2014In this indictment Walter Brinte and John Jiner, <em>alias </em>John Joiner, the prisoners at the bar, stand charged with murder of the first degree, for the felonious killing, with express malice aforethought, of John R. Taylor, in the month of January of the present year, at Wilmington hundred, in this county. The first count of the indictment charges that the death of the said Taylor was caused by mortal wounds inflicted by Walter Brinte by the means and in the manner described therein, whilst the said John Jiner was aiding and abetting the said Brinte as his accomplice in committing said felonious assault; the second count charges that the death of Taylor was caused by mortal wounds inflicted by said Jiner whilst Brinte was aiding and abetting Jiner as his accomplice in the crime; and the third and last count of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>indictment charges that the death of Taylor was caused by mortal wounds inflicted by each and both of said prisoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">A statute of this state provides that \u201cevery person who shall abet, procure, command or counsel any other person or persons, to commit any crime, or misdemeanor, shall be deemed an accomplice and equally criminal as the principal offender, and shall be punished in the same manner and with the same punishment.\u201d <em>(Rev. Code, 1852, Chap. 133, Sec. 1). </em>Therefore, if the jury is satisfied that either of the prisoners inflicted said mortal wounds, it is sufficient for the conviction of the other, who was, if you so find from the evidence, aiding and assisting in the felonious assault upon Taylor the one who actually inflicted them, because, in contemplation of law, it becomes the act of each and all of those who were co-operating and participating in the perpetration of the crime then and there committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Under any indictment for murder of the first degree, the jury may find the accused guilty of either murder of the first or second degree, or of manslaughter, according as the law and the evidence may warrant; but, unless they shall find the accused guilty of one of these three grades of homicide, they must acquit, and render a general verdict of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Homicide is the killing of any human creature, and is of three kinds\u2014justifiable, excusable,-and felonious.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Felonious homicide, at common law, is of two kinds, namely, murder and manslaughter, the difference between which consists principally in this : that in murder there is the ingredient of malice, whilst in manslaughter there is none, for manslaughter, when voluntary, arises from the sudden heat of the passions, but murder from the wickedness and malignity of the heart. Therefore manslaughter is defined to be the unlawful killing of another without malice, either express or implied, and without premeditation.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Murder is where a person of sound memory and discretion unlawfully kills any human being under the peace of the State, with malice aforethought, either express or implied. The chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>characteristic of this crime, distinguishing it from manslaughter and every other kind of homicide, and therefore indispensably necessary to be proved, is malice preconceived or aforethought. This term, malice, is not restricted to spite or malevolence toward the deceased in particular, but, in its legal sense, it is understood to mean that general malignity and recklessness of the lives and personal safety of others which proceed from a heart void of a just sense of social duty and fatally bent on mischief. Malice is implied by law from every deliberate, cruel act committed by one person against another, no matter how sudden such act may be. For the law considers that he who does a cruel act voluntarily does it maliciously.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Under the statute laws of this State <em>(Rev. Code, 1852, Chap. 127, See\u2019s 1-2), </em>there are two degrees of murder, namely, murder of the first and murder of the second degree. The first is where the crime of murder is committed with express malice aforethought, or in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate any crime punishable with death; and the second degree is where the crime of murder is committed otherwise, and with malice aforethought implied by law. Express malice is proved by evidence of a sedate, deliberate purpose and formed design to kill another; and such purpose and design may be shown from the circumstances attending the act, such as the deliberate selection and use of a deadly weapon, knowing it to be such, stealthily lying in wait, preconcerted plans, or the previous procurement or preparation of instruments, contrivances, or other means for slaying or doing great bodily harm to the deceased victim. These, however, are but some of the instances, given for the sake of examples or illustrations, in which the external or attending circumstances will evidence the sedate, deliberate mind and formed design to kill, or to do the party killed some bodily harm, for whenever in any other instance the attending circumstances evidence such a mind and design to do the act, and death ensues, it constitutes, in law, express malice aforethought, and murder of the first degree, under the statute, and is punishable with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>death, as where one, either from motives of hatred or revenge, or with a view to rob him of his money or get possession of any other thing about his person, eooly and deliberately forms the design in his mind to kill another, or wound and disable him for that purpose, and commits the act, either by lying in wait for him, or in any other manner, and his death ensues as the consequence of such bodily injury, it is likewise murder with express malice aforethought, and of the first degree, under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">\n<em>State vs. Goldsborough, Houst. Cr. Cas., 314.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Implied or constructive malice is an inference or conclusion of law from the facts found by the jury; and, among these, the actual intention of the prisoner becomes an important and material fact for, though he may not have intended to take away life or to do any personal harm, yet he may have been engaged in the perpetration of some other felonious or unlawful act from which the law raises the presumption of malice. It is the difference between express and implied or constructive malice aforethought which distinguishes murder of the first from murder of the second degree, except, however, that under our statute murder of the first degree may be committed when the malicious killing is done in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate any crime punishable with death, as rape or arson is in this State, although from such a felonious act malice is merely implied or presumed by law. Therefore murder of the second degree is held to be proved where it is not satisfactorily shown by the evidence submitted to the jury that the killing was done with a deliberately formed design to take life, or in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate any crime punishable with death, but is so shown that it was done suddenly, without justification or excuse, and without any provocation, or without provocation sufficient to reduce the homicide to the grade of manslaughter, or was done in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate a felony not capitally punishable, or any unlawful act of violence from which the law raises the presumption of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Having thus instructed you as to murder of the first and second degrees and the lesser grades of homicide, for your proper guidance in determining the guilt or innocence of the prisoners whom you have in charge, it is also proper to remind you that, as the law presumes every accused person to be innocent until he is proven guilty, the burden is upon the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, by competent evidence, every essential ingredient of the crime charged in this indictment, before the prisoners, or either of them, can be found guilty thereof. But on the other hand, every sane man is presumed to intend that which is the ordinary and natural consequence of his own wilful act. Therefore, on the charge of murder, where the fact of killing as charged in the indictment is shown by the prosecution, unaccompanied by circumstances of legal justification, excuse or mitigation, the law presumes that the homicide was committed with malice, and hence amounts to murder, until the contrary is shown; and consequently the burden is thereupon thrown upon the accused of disproving the malice and showing by evidence to the satisfaction of the jury that the killing was not malicious, but was either justifiable or excusable homicide, or else manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">But as it has not been claimed in behalf of the accused prisoners that the alleged killing of Taylor is either justifiable or excusable homicide or manslaughter, it becomes your duty to determine, upon a careful review and consideration of all the evidence before you, whether the said slaying of Taylor is a higher grade of homicide, and, further, whether or not the prisoners, or either of them, are guilty of either murder of the first degree or of murder of the second degree, under this indictment. In considering the evidence with a view to determining this question, you must be guided by the legal definition and nature of these two degrees of murder, and bear in mind the distinction between malice aforethought express and malice aforethought implied, as these have just been defined to you. And here it is necessary also to inform you that although where the fact of killing, as charged in the indictment, is shown by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>the prosecution, unaccompanied by circumstances of legal justification, excuse or extenuation, the law presumes that the homicide was committed with malice, until the contrary appears from the evidence produced at the trial, yet it goes no further than to imply malice, and therefore the legal presumption goes no further in such a case than that the killing is murder of the second degree, under our statute. Wherefore, before a verdict by the jury of murder of the first degree can be lawfully rendered, it must be shown by the prosecution that the prisoners, or one of them, killed or participated in the killing of Taylor, if he be dead, with a sedate, delib- , crate purpose and formed design to take life. Such deliberate purpose and formed design may exist only for the briefest period of time, but it must be shown by the facts and circumstances attending the homicide to actually exist, in order to prove that express malice aforethought, without the evidence of which a conviction of murder of the first degree cannot be secured.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">But before the prisoners, or either of them, can be found guilty of murder of either degree under this indictment, it is imperatively incumbent on the prosecution to prove to you, beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>first, </em>that John R. Taylor died on or about January 8th of the present <em>year; second, </em>that his death was caused by the means, and in the manner described in this indictment, and within this <em>county; </em>and, third, that the prisoners at the bar, or one of them, committed, or aided and participated in the commission of, the fatal act, as alleged therein. In the absence of direct or positive evidence, each of these essential ingredients of the crime may be established by circumstantial evidence alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Regarding confessions of guilt in criminal prosecutions, you will remember that these are either direct confessions, or confessions inferred from the conduct, etc., of the accused, and termed indirect confessions of guilt. * Confessions of guilt should not be received where they are not free and voluntary, but procured through the influence of threats or the promise of favor. Both their admissibility and value as evidence depend upon their being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>deliberate and voluntary, and on the presumption that a rational being will not make admissions prejudicial to his interests and safety unless impelled to do so by the promptings of truth and conscience. A confession of guilt reduced to writing, and signed by the person making it, if. deliberately made and signed, without being influenced thereto by any threats or promises by others, should be regarded, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, as strong and convincing evidence in the case. The degree of credit due to a confession is to be estimated by the jury under the circumstances of the particular case. The whole of what the accused said on the subject at the time of making the confession should be taken together. The jury may believe that part which criminates the accused and reject that which is in his favor, or credit so much as is in his favor and discard that which is against him, if they see sufficient grounds, upon all the evidence, for so doing, for the jury are at liberty to judge of it, like any other evidence, from all the proven circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">After the commission of a crime has been accomplished, no one engaged in it can, by any subsequent declaration or act of his own, not made or done in the presence of another, affect that other person. His confession, therefore, subsequently made, is not admissible in evidence as such against any but himself. If the confession of one prisoner implicates any other person by name, it must be proved as it was made, not omitting such <em>name; </em>but the Court should instruct the jury, as we do you, that it is not evidence against any but the prisoner who made such confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">\n<em>1 Greenleaf on Evidence, Secs. 218, 223.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean that the guilt of the accused or any other fact shall be established with the absolute certainty of a mathematical demonstration. Matters of fact are required to be proved merely to a moral certainty. To require more in dealing with human conduct and the ordinary affairs of life would be impracticable and therefore unreasonable. It is sufficient that any disputed fact relating to these shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>established by that amount of competent or appropriate evidence which ordinarily satisfies an unprejudiced mind beyond a reasonable doubt. The circumstances which will amount to this degree of proof can never be previously defined. The only legal test of which they are susceptible is their sufficiency to satisfy the mind and conscience of a man of common sense and ordinary discretion, and so to convince him that he would act upon that conviction in matters of the highest concern and importance to his own interest. Reasonable doubt, in the legal sense, therefore, does not mean a vague, speculative, or whimsical doubt or uncertainty, nor a merely possible doubt of the truth of the fact to be proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">In civil cases it is the duty of the jury to decide in favor of the party on whose side the weight of evidence preponderates, and according to the apparent probability of truth; but in criminal cases, because of the graver consequences of a wrong decision, the jurors are required to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, or it is their duty to acquit him. In civil cases it is sufficient if the evidence in the aggregate agrees with and supports the hypothesis which it is adduced to prove, but in criminal cases it must not only do this, but also must be such as to produce a moral certainty of guilt, and to exclude any other reasonable hypothesis or conclusion but that of the guilt of the accused. In both cases a verdict may well be founded on circumstances alone, and these often lead to a conclusion more satisfactory than that produced by direct evidence. In considering the testimony, if you find that any of the witnesses contradict each other, you must decide between them after viewing the testimony of each in connection with all the facts and circumstances proved in the case, and after considering the comparative qualifications and advantages of each for knowing, observing, comprehending, recollecting, and impartially and truthfully relating the circumstances and matters concerning which they have testified. Where there is a conflict of testimony, you must reconcile it, if possible. If you cannot do so, then you may reject so much thereof as you deem the less trust<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>worthy, and accept tliat portion which you consider the more so, after due deliberation upon all the evidence submitted from the witness stand, and from no other source.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">You are the judges of the facts and of the credit due to the respective witnesses, and it is your exclusive province, subject only to the law as explained to you by this Court, to determine according to the evidence whether or not the prisoners, or either of them? have been proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, guilty of any offense under this indictment. By reasonable doubt, as we have already explained, is not meant a vague, speculative, whimsical, or merely possible doubt, but such a doubt only as intelligent, reasonable, and impartial men may honestly entertain after a careful examination and conscientious consideration of all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">It only remains for us to say in conclusion that if, after such examination and consideration of all the evidence submitted on both sides in this case, you shall be satisfied, beyond such a reasonable doubt, that the prisoners, or either of them, are the persons who, as principals or accomplices, caused the death of Taylor as alleged in this indictment, and within this county, then you are further to determine, subject to the law as we have explained it to you, whether or not the prisoners, or either of them, are guilty of murder of the first degree, or murder of the second degree, or of any kind of felonious homicide, and render your verdict accordingly. But if, after such examination and consideration of said evidence, you should not be so satisfied that the prisoners are guilty of murder of either degree, or of any kind of felonious homicide, then you should acquit them, and render a verdict of not guilty. Any one or both of the prisoners may be convicted or acquitted under this indictment, according as the evidence may justify and warrant it, in the judgment of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">With these instructions for your aid and guidance in the discharge of your solemn and responsible duty, the case is now submitted to you for your verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Verdict.\u2014John Jiner, guilty of murder of the first degree; Walter Brinte, guilty of murder of the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Motions for New Trial, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\"><em>Mr. Townsend, </em>counsel for the defendant Jiner, thereupon made motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment, basing said motions upon the following reasons for a new trial-:</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">\u201cJohn Joiner, one of the above-named defendants, by Sylvester D.

At the trial, when his name was called, his father, of the same name, answered and sat at the trial. Boynton, J., said: \u201c* * * A majority of the court are unwilling to hold, especially in a case involving life, that the accused, by neglecting to inquire of the juror whether he was the person by that name summoned, was so far guilty of negligence as to estop or prevent him from taking advantage of the juror\u2019s disqualification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>after the trial. * * * The plaintiff was apprised that one Eli Stephenson was one of the regular jurors summoned for his trial; and, when such juror was called, a person by that name appearing and answering thereto, we think he might well assume such person to be the regular juror. If the person so appearing had borne another name, and had personated the absent juror, this clearly would have been ground for a new trial, if the fact of such personation was unknown to the accused in time to correct the error before he was prejudiced thereby. * * * Yet no one can doubt that the identity of the two names was calculated to disarm vigilance, and render deception more successful and complete. Therefore, to impute a want of diligence, under the circumstances, to the accused or his counsel, in not ascertaining before the trial that the sitting juror was not the one summoned, or to hold him to have waived all objection to the juror\u2019s competency, would be to exact a higher degree of care aad caution than the law requires.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\"><em>12 Am. &amp; Eng.
