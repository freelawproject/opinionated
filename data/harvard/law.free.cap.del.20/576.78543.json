Lee and others, at this term, to change the course of a public road in Pencader Hundred. Said petition set out, <em>inter alla, </em>the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-15\">\u201cThat there is need of a change, in a part of a public, road in said Pencader Hundred for the convenience of the general public, said public road leading from Newark to Delaware City. The change needed being that part of the said public road beginning <em>at or near </em>where it crosses the right-of-way of the Newark and Delaware City branch of the Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad Company <em>at or near </em>what is commonly known and designated as Dayett <em>Station; </em>said public road continuing in a southeasterly direction on the easterly side of the said right-of-way of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>said railroad company until it reaches a point <em>at or near </em>where the said public road again crosses the right-of-way of the said railroad company <em>at or near </em>what is commonly known and designated as Kenney Station. The object of the above change being to lay out the public road on the westerly side of the said right-of-way of the said railroad company, thereby making the public road safer, shorter and better.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-5\">The return of the commissioners followed the description of the road as given in the above petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-6\">Joseph P. Nichols, one of the owners of the land affected by vacating and changing said public road, filed and relied upon the following objections to the record and return:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-7\">\u201cNo. 4.\u2014That Morris D. Crossan, one- of the persons named to lay out and change said public road described in said petition is not a suitable person to act as one of said commissioners, he being unacquainted with the locality, and being a resident of Wilmington Hundred, and was not and is not a freeholder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-8\">\u201cNo. 5.\u2014That the petition fails to describe with reasonable precision, the termini of said public road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-9\">\u201cNo. 6.\u2014That the petition fails to describe with reasonable precision, the place of beginning of said change in said public road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-10\">**********</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-11\">\u201cNo. 8.\u2014That the return fails to state what portion of the costs the persons who enclose the vacated public road ought to pay, respectively, and the same is not set out in the return, as by law required.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-12\"><em>Gooch, for </em>petitioners:\u2014I move that the above objections to the return of the commissioners be quashed and set aside, and that the return be confirmed for the following reasons:</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-13\">That the objections do not ask that the return be quashed, nor is an application for review contained therein, and none has been filed within six days after the return to the order as required by law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>\n<em>Rev. Code, Chap. 60, Sec. 7 ; Rule II, Sec. 2, Rules of Court Gen. Sessions.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-4\">That the said objections fail to allege any injury or damage to the said Joseph P. Nichols, or how he is interested in, or affected by said return.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AOh\">\n<em>Rev. Code, Chap. 60, Sec. 7.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-6\">That the said Joseph P. Nichols has failed to pay the costs of the proceedings immediately preceding the filing of his said objections as required by law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-7\">\n<em>Rev. Code, Chap. 60, Sec. 10.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-8\">That the said objections are not supported by affidavit, other than that of the said Joseph P. Nichols, the party by whom the objections are made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-9\">\n<em>Rule II, Sec. 2, Rules of Court Gem,. Sessions.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-10\">That the said <em>new </em>.road, as laid out by the commissioners, does not pass through or along the land owned by the said John P. Nichols as appears by the proceedings. He is not, therefore, interested in, or affected thereby.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-11\">When the grounds of the exceptions are not sustained, the Court will overrule the exceptions and confirm the return.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-12\">\n<em>Hickman\u2019s Case, 4 Harr., 580.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-13\">Award of referees should stand unless it is so wilfully or grossly wrong as to shock the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b586-14\">\n<em>Bailey vs. England, 1 Pennewill, 12.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-15\">The objections are answered, according to number, as follows :</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-16\">No. 4.\u2014Is insufficient in law and untrue in fact. It is insufficient in law, as no requirement is made nor does the law contemplate, that commissioners or \u201croad jurors\u201d shall be freeholders. The requirement being that the commissioners shall be \u201csuitable persons.\u201d The law refers to them by such titles as \u201cfive suitable persons,\u201d \u201cpersons,\u201d \u201croad jurors,\u201d \u201ccommissioners,\u201d etc., <em>not </em>as \u201cfreeholders.\u201d It is untrue in fact as the said Morris D. Crossan being engaged in real estate business, is familiar with the value of farming land, is acquainted with this locality and the dangers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>the railroad crossings sought to be avoided by the proposed change and is in other regards a \u201csuitable person.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-5\">\n<em>Rev. Code, Chap. 60, Secs. 5, 6, 10; Vol. 21, Laws Del., Chaps. 259, 260 ; Long Point Road, 5 Harr., 152.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-6\">Lobe, C. J.:\u2014The Court hold that the fourth objection is insufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-7\"><em>Mr. </em>Cooch:\u2014Nos. 5 and 6.\u2014The petition sets out with reasonable precision the termini and place of beginning of said change in said public road. The objection should have been made before the petition was approved and the commissioners were appointed, and3 therefore, cannot be considered at this time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-8\">Lobe, C. J.:\u2014We think the place of beginning and also the termini of the public road are described with sufficient particularity in the petition and return.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-9\"><em>Mr. </em>Cooch:\u2014No. 8.\u2014The law does not require that the return shall set out \u201cwhat portion of the costs the persons who enclose the vacated public road ought to pay respectively,\u201d when the order is made on a petition for <em>changing the course </em>of a public road, but only on an order for <em>vacating </em>a public road. The return for a change being merely that the commissioners \u201cshall determine what part of the old road shall be vacated on opening the new, and who shall enclose the same.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-10\">The return sets out the names of those who shall enclose the vacated portion of the old road being those who own land through and along which it passes. The land given them for the costs of enclosing the part adjoining their respective properties. The return follows the wording of the order and of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-11\">\n<em>Laws Del., Vol. 21, Chap. 259.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b587-12\">Lore, C.
