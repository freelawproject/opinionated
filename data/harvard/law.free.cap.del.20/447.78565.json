To recover in an action of <em>quare clausum fregit </em>for breaking and entering plaintiff\u2019s close, the plaintiff must show that he was in the actual possession of the premises where the trespass is alleged to have been committed, at the time of the trespass. He may show a legal title, either by a chain of paper title, that is, by deeds of conveyance to him and to those under whom he claims, or by an adverse possession. Such adverse possession must be exclusive, hostile to the right of ownership of all others. Inclosure of the land is not necessary to such possession; it may be proved by acts of ownership on the part of plaintiff.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>2. To establish a right of way by presumption, the defendant must show that he and those under whom he claims used the place or way in question continuously and adversely to the rights of the plaintiff, that is, under a claim of right for at least tw\u00e9hty years next before the alleged trespass. If such use was not tinder a claim of right, but under a license or permission from the owner of the land, a right of way by prescription could not thereby be acquired, since a license negatives adverse right.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b456-4\">\n<em>(December 2, 1903.)</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b456-5\">Lobe, C.

In this case the plaintiffs claim title by adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Such adverse possession must be exclusive; hostile to the right of ownership of all others.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Unless the evidence shows that the possession of the plaintiffs at the time of the alleged trespass was adverse and exclusive, they would not be entitled to your verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The defendant claims that he has a paper title running from 1823 to the present time, for the one-half of the said alley now in dispute; that during that time the alley has been open and used in common by the owners and tenants of the adjoining lands of both the plaintiffs and defendant, He also claims that he has the right of way by prescription over the said close.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">To establish such right of way by prescription, the defendant must show by the preponderance of proof that he and those under whom he claims used the alley continuously and adversely to the rights of the plaintiff; that is, under a claim of right for at least twenty years next before the alleged trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">If such use was not under a claim of right, but under a license or permission from the owner of the land, a right of way by prescription could not thereby be acquired; since a license nagatives adverse right.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">Should you be satisfied from the evidence that at the time of the commission of the alleged trespass (if any be proved), the plaintiff was in actual and exclusive possession of the alley in question, your verdict should be for the plaintiff; unless from the preponderance of the evidence you should be satisfied that the defendant has established his alleged prescriptive right to use the same in common with the plaintiffs.
