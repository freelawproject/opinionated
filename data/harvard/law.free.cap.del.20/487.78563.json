D. 1899, and on divers times between that date and the day of the bringing of this suit, the said John Jacoby under and in pursuance of the contract he had entered into with the District of Columbia, to wit, the contract recited in the said writing obligatory, was engaged in executing the work of constructing and keeping in repair the sewers and accessories therein named and described as sewers <em>\u2018A\u2019 </em>and \u2018B\u2019 and while being thus engaged the said Lanham and Brother did supply him with labor and materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in said contract, to wit, of the value of Ten Thousand Dollars and yet the said John Jacoby has not made payment to the said Lanham and Brother or to any other person for them the said sum of money due them for supplying to him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>the said labor and materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in said contract, nor any part of the same, but the same remains due and wholly unpaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-4\">\u201cBy reason of which said breaches the said writing obligatory became forfeited and thereby an action hath accrued (under the Act of Congress in this behalf) to the said United States of America for the use of said Lanham and Brother, the plaintiffs, to demand and have of and from the said Joseph L. Carpenter, Jr. and John P. Allmond who were sued with the said John Jacoby the sum of Ten Thousand Dollars above demanded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-5\">\u201cYet the said Joseph L. Carpenter, Jr. and John P. Allmond as sued as aforesaid, although often requested so to do have not as yet paid the sum of One Hundred and Seventy Thousand Dollars above demanded or any part thereof to the said Lanham and Brother or to the said United States of America for their use, but have hitherto wholly neglected and refused and still neglect and refuse so to do, to the damage of the said United States of America for the use of said Lanham and Brother of Ten Thousand Dollars and therefore they bring this suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-6\">Demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-7\">Defendants demurred to the above declaration as insufficient, for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-8\">(1) For that the said counts do not allege the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action with sufficient certainty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-9\">(2) For that the labor and materials alleged to have been furnished by the plaintiffs to the said John Jacoby, are not sufficiently specified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-10\">(3) For that the allegation of facts is too general.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-11\">(4) For that the said counts are not sufficiently particular and definite.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-12\">(5) For that the Act of Congress, under which the plaintiffs seek to recover, is not sufficiently alleged in the counts of the declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>(6) For that the said counts of the said declaration are in other respects uncertain, informal, and insufficient, etc.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b500-5\"><em>Heisel, </em>for plaintiff, cited in support of the declaration the following authorities:</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-6\">\n<em>Randall vs. Canal Co., 1 Harr., 155, 172, 175, 176; Shum et al. vs. Farrington, 1 Bos. and Pul., 640; Cornwallis vs. Savary, 2 Burrows, 772; 1 Chitty on Pleading, 332, 335, 649.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b500-7\">\n<em>A. B. Cooper for plaintiff:</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-8\">The only question is, does the narr sufficiently set forth the labor and materials furnished.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-9\">I submit that it does. To set forth all the items of the bill would make the narr objectionable for prolixity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-10\">It would exclude us from offering evidence of all details not specified in the declaration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-11\">It would be practically making us set forth a bill of particulars in the narr, which is never required.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-12\">A general count for work and labor done, and goods sold and delivered is good and cannot be demurred to, for want of certainty. Common counts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-13\">It is only necessary to allege the character of the claim, under the condition of the bond, this we have done, to wit, labor and materials furnished in the construction of a certain sewer, and the amount claimed. This fully apprises the defendant of the cause of action. The balance is simply matter of evidence to be produced at the trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-14\">This narr is carefully drawn from Chitty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-15\">\n<em>1 Chitty on Pleading, 331, 332, 334, 336, 648; 2 Chitty, 437; 3 Chitty, 1286.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-16\"><em>Randall vs. Canal Co., 1 Harr. 151, 172, 175, 176, </em>settles the question in this State, although the assignment of breaches was more objectionable there than here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Defendant fully understands the case. The narr is perfectly good, and perhaps drawn a little fuller than it was necessary for plaintiffs to allege.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-4\">How much stronger is the case at bar where the breach of the condition is simply the nonpayment of money. In Randall case it was the nonperformance of an act which might have been done in various ways. Court held these were mere matters of proof.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b501-5\">Lore, C. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"AC8Q\">While we do not attempt to specify what particularity must be entered into in assigning breaches, we hold that this narr does not assign the breaches with sufficient particularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Demurrer sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
