The transcript was filed between the adjournment of the October Term, 1902, and the beginning of the April Term, 1903, and the case was placed upon the trial list for said April Term. Counsel for plaintiff contended that the case should not be placed on the trial list, it being the first term after the filing of the transcript, and that this being the appearance term the case was not at issue and they, therefore, asked that it be continued until the next term.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-11\"><em>Mr. Ridgely </em>opposed the application, contending that the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>was properly on the trial list, and that the first term after the filing of the transcript was the trial term in appeal cases, as provided by the statute.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b299-5\">Lore, C.

As the counsel for plaintiff below, respondent asks for a trial, and no legal ground for continuance has been laid, and it being properly placed upon the trial list, we hold that it must be tried at this term.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
