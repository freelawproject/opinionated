It is impossible for <em>Pullman\u2019s Palace Car Company </em>to appear, it having gone out of existence as such. Its successor has a right, however, to defend the property of the company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-13\">If judgment were to go against Pullman\u2019s Palace Car Company, it would create a cloud upon the title if it did not make a lien.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>The owner of the property of course must have his day in court.

It is not a third party, but the actual defendant. The mechanics\u2019 lien law gives to the party sued the right to come in and defend. We are the party, but they have sued in the wrong name. We ask to appear in said suit and file therein an affidavit of defense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-7\"><em>Mr. </em>Hayes:\u2014That must be based upon an affidavit and the reasons set out. If there has been any change in the name of the corporation it should appear by affidavit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-8\">Lore, C. J.:\u2014We will give you leave, Mr. Higgins, to appear <em>specially </em>for the purpose named and file your affidavit of defense, but the affidavit must show how it is that you are using a different name from that under which you are sued, setting out all necessary facts.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b99-9\">(Mr. Hayes asked to note an exception.
