In considering the provisions of policies of insurance relating to matters required to be done by the insured subsequent to the loss, which do not alter the risk of the insurer or increase the liability, it is the prevailing practice of the courts to give to such provisions a construction favorable to the insured so far as the same can be reasonably done.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b301-6\">2. It is the duty of the Court to construe written papers which have been admitted in evidence, and to instruct the jury as to the meaning and effect of the same.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b301-7\">3. Upon an examination of the provisions of the policy of insurance sued upon in respect to the proof of loss required to be made before suit, and also the paper purporting to be the preliminary proof of loss, <em>held </em>that the requirements of the policy as to preliminary proof of loss had been substantially and sufficiently complied with. And especially so in view of the uncontroverted testimony in the case that there was a total destruction of the insured property, and that all of the books, accounts and papers of the plaintiffs were also at the same time destroyed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b301-8\">4.

The paper held by the Court to be a sufficient preliminary proof of loss to meet the requirements of the policy in that regard, is not to be considered by the jury as proving, or tending to prove, the ownership of the property at the time of the execution of the policy, or at the time of the loss, or the fact of the loss, or the amount of the loss, or any other material fact in issue in the case. Such questions are to be determined by the jury from the testimony of the witnesses.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b301-10\">6.

That where the loss is total, including all books and accounts, it is not necessary for the insured to guess at the items destroyed, but a general statement alleging the total loss is sufficient-</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-5\">4. That if the company received the proofs of loss and deemed it insufficient, they were bound to return it promptly, pointing out the defect therein, and upon their failure to do this the insured had a right to presume that such proof was sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-6\">5. That the return of the said proof forty-two days after it was filed with said company is not in time to permit it to take advantage of the insufficiency thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-7\">.Defendant\u2019s Prayers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-8\">The defendant prayed the Court, <em>inter alla, </em>to instruct the jury as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-9\">1.
