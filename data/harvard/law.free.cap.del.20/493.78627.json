It cannot sue or be sued, except where specially permitted by statute, and such permission can be withdrawn or denied at any time the Legislature may think proper.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b502-13\">\n<em>Emery County vs. Burresen, 14 Utah, 328.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-14\">Against a Sovereign there are no remedies except such as the Sovereign may accord.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-15\">\n<em>Taylor vs. Salt Lake County, 2 Utah, 405; Hunsaker vs. Borden, 5 Cal., 288; State vs. Taylor, 14 Wash., 495; Chicago vs. Hasley, 25 Ill., 595.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-16\">In this case a Sovereign is one of the contracting parties for the government of the county of Contra Costa, is a portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>State government, and as against a Sovereign there are no remedies except such as the Sovereign in the exercise of that good faith by which all governments are presumed to be attached, may accord.

J., stating \u201cthat the overwhelming weight of authority seemed to be in favor of the proposition that no action of tort will lie against such a public division of the State as the county or such a body as the levy court,\u201d and adding that \u201cthe case cited from <em>2 </em>Wallace, <em>501, Levy Court vs. The Coroner, </em>was an action of assumpsit on a contract between the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-6\">The extent of this decision was that an action of tort does not lie against a county or the levy court. There has been no express decision in this State that an action <em>ex-contractu </em>would not lie against a county, but we are not able to see our way to the conclusion that there is any essential difference, or any sufficient reason to except a case <em>ex-contractu </em>from the general common law rule that actions will not lie against a county\u2014or the levy court commissioners who represent the county.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-7\">We therefore, with regret, feel constrained to grant this motion for a nonsuit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-8\">The plaintiff has the option to refuse the nonsuit, in which case we shall instruct the jury to find for the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-9\"><em>Mr. </em>Rodney:\u2014The plaintiff declines to take a nonsuit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-10\"><em>Mr. </em>Knowles:\u2014I ask that the jury be instructed to bring in a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b504-11\">Spruance, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1X\">charging the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">Gentlemen of the jury :\u2014For the reasons which we have stated in granting the motion for a nonsuit, we instruct you to find a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">Verdict for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
