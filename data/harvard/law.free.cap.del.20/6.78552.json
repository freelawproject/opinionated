L., 2069.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-13\">Our statute follows the English statute of George IV.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-14\">\n<em>2 Wharton C.

The statute does not apply to a case of this kind. The words \u201c <em>other person\u201d </em>do not apply to or include a county govern ment, or <em>quasi </em>corporation\u2014It applies to the same character of person, first named in the act, and to which it relates.\u2014A \u201c person who shall obtain from any <em>other person\u201d </em>etc., etc. Clearly that person is intended to be a private person or individual, a natural person, one who is capable of both <em>speaking </em>and <em>acting </em>falsely, and one who is liable to the penalty of imprisonment and is capable of committing the same crime as the person first named.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-17\">If this be so, it is clear that a county government (the prosecutor or <em>quasi </em>corporation cannot commit this crime, or larceny, which is identical in principle.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-18\">It can neither talk, be imprisoned, or be guilty of malicious or criminal intent. The word \u201c person \u201d as used in the statute, is a person capable of all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-19\">The intent in this case is to defraud the government of New Castle County, which can not be construed to be a person within either the words, spirit or operation of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u2022<em>Heard Grim., Pld., 167; 3 Bishop C. L., 415 ; Jones on Neg. Mun. Corp., 33, and Note; 1 Bishop, 0. L. 417, 433; 1 Wharton C. L., 85, 88; Jones Neg. Man. Corp., 19; Bishop Stat. Crimes, 313, 31,5.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-5\">The statute could not apply to a county unless expressly so stated in it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-6\">2. The only false pretense alleged, is that the defendant, falsely represented to George D. Kelley, the Comptroller, <em>\u201c </em>That Henry A. Enos had done, performed and furnished certain work, and labor for the County of New Castle, amounting to $62.25 and thereby obtained his approval of the bill, and this not by words, but by the simple presentation of an alleged false bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-7\">What is a \u201c false pretense \u201d, is a question of law. If, from the facts alleged it is not a false pretense at law, the indictment must be quashed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b21-8\"><em>Heard Crim. Pld., 164, 165 </em>and <em>Note.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-9\">(a) It has been decided that where one has like means of knowledge, or of ascertaining whether the pretense be true or false, the statute does not apply. This broad rule may perhaps be modified.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-10\">(b) But where it [is the absolute legal duty of the person to whom it is made, to ascertain its truth for himself; has sworn so to do and bonded for that purpose and given all the means of so doing, <em>a fortiori, </em>the statute does not apply\u2014The bill on its face to Harry Enos or bearer, notified him that inquiry should be made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-11\"><em>Rev. Code, </em>95; <em>2 Bishop C. L., 432, a; 18 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. (New Ed.), 818, 819 ; 11 Allen, 266.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-12\">3. The indictment alleges all the facts :\u2014The false pretenses to the Comptroller and his approval of the bill; then follows a statement of the various and distinct matters; of the approval by the Levy Court, the order drawn and signed and finally, as a result of the whole, the obtaining of the money from Horace G. Kettew, the County Treasurer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Rettew, from the facts, knew nothing of the pretense; cared nothing for it; all he knew was the legal warrant, which he was bound to pay, pretense or no pretense. He was not influenced by it in the slightest degree. The cause alleged and the effect are too remote.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-5\">Rule.\u2014There must be a direct or proximate connection between the pretense and the obtaining of the money. The false pretense must be relied upon by the person from whom the money is obtained. It must prevail upon him and be the moving cause. His mind must be affected by it and he must part with the money, believing the pretense to be true.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-6\">Test questions :</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-7\">(a) Would he have paid the order without the pretense ?\u2014 Bound to do it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-8\">(b) In criminal actions a trespass is included, and a civil action also lies. Could White be sued by the county for this^ money? And, if so, would not the production of the legal order be a full defense ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-9\">The only proximate connection, as alleged in the indictments is between the alleged pretense and the obtaining of the order.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-10\">If I, by false pretense get a genuine check and get it cashed at the bank, out of the general funds of the bank, I am not guilty of obtaining money, only of the check. So here, if it is any offense under the statute it would be for obtaining the order.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-11\">\n<em>2 Bishop C. L., 432, 461, 462, 463, 483 ; 2 Wharton C. L., 2120, 2124, 2127, 2127 a, 2135, 2162 ; 12 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. Law (New Ed.), 814; 82 N. Y.

It must give the character and denomination of the coin and of the notes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-13\">The description must be the same as in larceny, before our statute, which relates solely to larceny.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-14\">\n<em>Code, 981; 2 Wharton C.

But we submit that there is ample remedy or means provided by the Common Law to meet just such a case as this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-5\">(The State in reply cited the following authorities and urged the following propositions in support of the indictment):</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-6\">I. <em>Rev.
