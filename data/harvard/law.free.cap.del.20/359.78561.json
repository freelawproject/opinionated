J.:\u2014As there is doubt in our minds about the effect of the prior ruling of the Court in this case, we will hear Mr. Cooper upon the question of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-8\">Argument op Rule to Strike opp Judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-9\"><em>Mr. </em>Cooper:\u2014This is an action of tort, under the statute passed March 12, 1901, <em>Vol. 22. Laws of Delaware, 498, </em>which permits a foreign attachment in tort to issue. It is to recover damages for personal injuries which occurred September 23, 1900. <em>20, Laws of Delaware, 712, </em>provides that \u201c no action for the recovery of damages upon a claim for alleged personal injuries shall be brought after the expiration of one year from the date upon which it is claimed that such alleged injuries were sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-10\">The defendant claims that the statute need not be pleaded. It can be taken advantage of by demurrer, motion or nonsuit, or in arrest of judgment, or any other appropriate proceedings. That it is a jurisdictional question. It stands by itself and cannot be construed in connection with our general statute of limitation, which refers chiefly to contracts and not to torts. It follows the <em>Statute af James I. </em>There was no statute, so far as defendant\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>was able to ascertain, prior to the statute of Pennsylvania in 1895, limiting the time for the bringing of actions for personal injuries; and it was upon the construction of that statute that defendant largely depended, although, under our general statute of limitation, if, upon the face of the record, it shows that the plaintiff\u2019s action was barred, that can be taken taken advantage of by demurrer, or motion in arrest of judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-5\">The courts have gone very far in this matter, even to the limit of quashing the writ, where the facts are undisputed, <em>afortiori, </em>when the bar appears upon the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-6\">\n<em>Wilkins on Stat.

The defendant\u2019s contention upon this branch was as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-10\"><em>{a) </em>Want of notice.

The jury returned a verdict for <em>$5000; </em>the bail was $2500.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-13\">\n<em>1 Tidd, 570; Chase vs. Christian, 41 Cal., 253.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number><em>Hittes, </em>for plaintiff, replied: That the statute of Delaware limiting the time in which an action for personal injuries shall be brought is a statute of limitation, and is to be construed in the same way and as a part of the general statute of limitation in this State.- The Court was given jurisdiction of actions in tort by the statute in question, but had that jurisdiction independent of the statute. The statute itself is worded in the same way as the other statutes of limitation in this State and is to be construed in <em>pari materia </em>with them. Advantage of a statute of limitation can only be taken by a defendant by setting the bar of the statute up affirmatively in his pleadings. The reason for this is that the only way for a plaintiff to reply an exception, or any matter which would take the ease out of the statute of limitation, is by a replication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b371-5\">\n<em>Parker vs. Whitaker, 4 Harr., 527.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b371-6\">Lore, C.
