If, when it comes back, it shows that all three referees did not act and hear the allegations and that two of them only acted and made the decision, you can then except. We remand this report to the referees to amend it according to the facts. If there be any exception we will hear it afterwards.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
