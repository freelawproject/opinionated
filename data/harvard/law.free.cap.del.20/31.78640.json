It will be observed that the language used is not only that Robert Cook played with a female child, not only that he unlawfully played with her, but that he unlawfully, lewdly and lasciviously played with Gracie Ellen Sandy, a female child, etc. We think, therefore, that it comes within the rule laid down in the case referred to where the charge was for having sexual intercourse, and we think this indictment definitely and specifically informs the defendant of the charge which he is to meet, as did the indictment in that case. The motion, therefore, is denied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-9\">The witness was asked by the Deputy Attorney-General if there was anything the matter with her after the 23d of December, 1901.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-10\">(Objected to by counsel for defendant as irrelevant. Objection sustained.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-11\">Q. After this morning, when you say that Mr. Cook came to your room and played with you, did he ever come back to you anywhere and do any such thing ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-12\">(Objected to by counsel for defendant as irrelevant; citing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>unreported case of <em>Slate vs. </em>Cunningham\u2014being an indictment for\u2019 using a female child for the purpose of sexual intercourse\u2014where a similar question had been ruled out by the Court).</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-5\"><em>Richards, Deputy </em>Attorney-General:\u2014We offer this evidence for the purpose of proving, within a very limited period of time, other acts of a lascivious and lewd nature, as going to show the intent of the defendant at the time the of\u00edense charged in the indictment was committed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-6\">Pennewile, J.:\u2014We think, under the ruling in the case of <em>Stale vs. Cunningham, </em>that this question is inadmissible.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b41-7\">Pennewill, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ABBN\">charging the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Gentlemen of the jury:\u2014The respective counsel have not asked the Court to instruct you upon any question of law, for the reason, we presume, that there are no questions of law involved in this case. The question to be determined is simply one of fact, and it is for your determination alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Robert Cook, the defendant, is charged in this indictment with unlawfully and lewdly and lasciviously playing with Gracie Ellen Sandy, she, the said Gracie Ellen Sandy, being then and there a female child under the age of 16 years. The indictment is based upon a statute of this State, which was passed February 21,1881, being <em>Chapter 545, Vol. 16, Laws of Delaware [Rev. Code, 956), </em>which\u2014 as amended by <em>Chapter 126, Vol. 20, Laws of </em>Delaware\u2014provides that if any person shall lewdly and lasciviously play with any female child under the age of 16 years, he shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">If you should believe, from the testimony in this case, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Robert Cook, the defendant, committed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>offense charged in this indictment, your verdict should be guilty, If you should not so believe your verdict should be not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Verdict, guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
