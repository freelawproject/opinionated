When one is assaulted it is his duty to retire beyond the reach of danger, if he can do so without the risk of injury, but if he cannot do so, without exposing himself to the threatened violence of his adversary, he may use such force as may be sufficient to repel the attack upon him, but such resistance must be no more than is necessary to protect himself from bodily harm. If his resistance or retaliation be excessive, or out of proportion to the provocation or the danger threatened, it will not be justifiable, but will be an unlawful assault.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b263-8\">2. If an unlawful assault and battery was committed by the defendant under the immediate influence of the passion provoked by insulting and offensive language of the plaintiff, this would not justify the jury in mitigating or reducing the compensatory damages which but for such language they might find that the plaintiff would be entitled to recover.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b263-9\">3. If the jury should find that the defendant did commit an unlawful assault upon the plaintiff, but that the injuries to the plaintiff from such assault were so trivial as not to warrant them in awarding him damages as compensatory therefor, they may find a verdict for the plaintiff for a nominal sum only.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b263-10\">4.
