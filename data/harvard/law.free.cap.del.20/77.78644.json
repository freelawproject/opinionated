D. 1881, being No. 173 to the November Term, A. D. 1881, of said court, said writ having been issued upon a judgment recovered by the Diamond State Loan Association, a corporation of the State of Delaware, against Catharine Collins, surviving mortgagor and administratrix of Daniel Collins, deceased, and tts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">\u2022\u2018That in pursuance of said writ he advertised and sold the property therein mentioned unto Joshua Maris for the sum of Two Hundred and Eighty Dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-12\">\u201c That through an error and mistake of the said Joshua Maris, as \u00a1your petitioner believes, your petitioner returned on said writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>that the said property had been sold to The Diamond State Loan Association, of which association the said Joshua Maris was then the attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">\u201c That thereafter, to wit, on the twenty-first day of December^ A. D. 1881, your petitioner, as such Sheriff, conveyed the said lands and premises unto the said Joshua Maris, by deed poll bearing date the twenty-first day of December, A.

All parties consenting thereto, the Court made the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">\u201cAnd now, to wit, this 27th day of June, 1902, the foregoing petition having been read and considered by the Court, and the same having been heard, and all parties in interest being represented and consenting thereto, it is ordered that the prayer of said petition be granted, and that the said Philip R.
