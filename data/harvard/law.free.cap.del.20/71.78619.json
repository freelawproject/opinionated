The Attorney-General further stated that if the Court should conclude *o make the order, that the physician selected be one who was agreeable to both parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-4\"><em>Mr. </em>England:\u2014I agree to that.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-5\">Lore, C. J.:\u2014We make the order that the prosecuting witness be examined by a competent physician during the noon recess, and under such circumstances as to insure entire fairness. The Court understands that Dr. Josephine M. R. White is satisfactory to both the State and the counsel for the defendant. The doctor will, therefore, make the examination under the direction of the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-6\"><em>Mr. England </em>asked the prosecuting witness, in cross examination, the following question:</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-7\">Tell the Court whether or not, about the first of April of this year, George Shelton did not, in going into a privy near the home of Lugi Pucca, find you in there with two little boys ? <em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-8\">(Objected to by the Deputy Attorney-General as immaterial.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-9\"><em>Mr. England </em>stated that he was not attempting to impeach the moral character of the prosecuting witness but was only testing her veracity; that if she denied in her reply that she was there with the two boys on the occasion mentioned, he could prove that she was and thus contradict her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-10\">Lore, C. J.:\u2014The question being entirely immaterial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>irrelevant to this issue, you could not contradict her, but would be bound by her answer. We sustain the objection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-5\">Counsel for defendant asked one of his witnesses the following question:</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-6\">\u201c Are you acquainted with the general reputation for truth and veracity of Eosalio Emiedo in the community in which she has lived up to within two months of this time, at Natalie, Pennsylvania?\"</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-7\">(Objected to by the Attorney-General as irrelevant, the proper form of the question being, whether the witness knows the reputation of the prosecuting witness in the community in which she <em>now </em>lives.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-8\">Lore, C. J.:\u2014Do you propose to follow that up and connect it with the present time ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-9\"><em>Mr. </em>England:\u2014Yes, sir. These people have just come to town and it was impossible to get anybody that knew of them here. This witness has known this prosecuting witness for years at Natalie, Pennsylvania, the town from which they moved to Wilmington some time in January of this year.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-10\">Lore, C, J.:\u2014We think it is admissible; but bring it within a month or two of the present time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-11\">(The witness then testified that he knew the reputation of the prosecuting witness at Natalie, Pennsylvania, that it was bad, and from that reputation he would not believe her on her oath. The testimony on both sides was then closed.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b83-12\">Lore, C.

This is a charge which in common experience is comparatively easy to prove, but difficult to meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">In order to find a verdict of guilty in this case you should be satisfied from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that in this county, on the day alleged, this prosecuting witness was so used, and that she was then under eighteen years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">And in considering the evidence, we would call your attention, as requested by defendant\u2019s counsel, to the fact that testimony of the previous good character of the defendant, when offered in the case, is to be taken like any other evidence tending to show the innocence of the accused, and for whatever that testimony is worth, in your judgment, under all the facts and circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">Again, it is incumbent on the State to prove all the material facts of this case. Such, for instance, as the minority of the child, the perpetration of the crime in this county, and the actual fact of sexual intercourse\u2014beyond a reasonable <em>doubt; </em>for if there be a reasonable doubt from the testimony upon any one of these essen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>tial elements of the crime) that doubt should inure to the benefit of the accused, in a verdict of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">You have heard the evidence in this case, and it is for you to say, upon that evidence, whether the prisoner, Lugi Pucca, is guilty of the crime charged or not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Verdict, not guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
