It simply states a conclusion of law\u2014an illegal sale\u2014but does not specify that the business of selling intoxicating liquor was then and there carried on even illegally. The presumption is that it was carried on legally. It states that the business of selling liquor was then and there carried on and then goes on and states that he did then and there unlawfully sell intoxicating liquors, but does not specify wherein it was unlawful, or whether he was doing an unlicensed liquor business, or whether he was a licensed liquor dealer and sold in quantities less than a quart in violation of the law, or whether he sold to minors or on Sundays. There is a special statute against violation of the liquor law, found in <em>Volume 20, Laws of Delaware, JflS, </em>which provides that no person licensed under this section shall sell or deliver any intoxicating liquor upon any public street, alley, etc., and as a penalty for the violation thereof, provides a fine of not less than fifty dollars nor more than one hundred dollars and imprisonment of not less than thirty days nor more than sixty days; and that might be the statute that is violated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-10\">Under certain regulations, certain people have a right to sell intoxicating liquors and this indictment should negative the existence of the license or authority to do the act complained of.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"seealso\" id=\"b148-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>\n<em>11 Ency.
