The complaint states the bizarre claim that, after the shift away from the gold standard, plaintiff was paid in Federal Reserve notes which are not \u201creal money,\u201d and therefore he never received any payment for his labor and accordingly owed nothing in taxes and should now receive his wages in \u201creal money.\u201d He seeks $295,-139.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">In a <em>sua sponte </em>order, the Claims Court held that there was no jurisdiction over the case because (a) there was no express contract between Zuger and the United States that he would be paid in \u201creal money\u201d (i.e., gold-backed currency); (b) the Claims Court has no jurisdiction over contracts implied-in-law; (c) if this is a claim for refund of income taxes, plaintiff filed no claim for administrative refund; and (d) in any event, there is no merit to the claim which has uniformly been rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">The Claims Court\u2019s rulings were obviously correct, both as to jurisdiction and as to the merits. On the latter question, Zuger\u2019s position has been regularly rejected by a host of cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">This is a manifestly frivolous appeal which never should have been taken.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was no arguable way of confronting Judge Yock\u2019s indisputable holdings that his court had no jurisdiction, and, as we have noted, Zuger\u2019s substantive position has been universally rejected by many courts. Zuger himself appears to be a veteran \u201ctax protester.\u201d He was convicted in the District of Connecticut of willfully failing to file income tax returns, and the Second Circuit characterized his appeal from that conviction \u201cas completely frivolous.\u201d He has thus had fair warning that he cannot attack the federal tax and monetary system by abusing the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">Accordingly, we impose, under Rule 38, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, a sanction of $500 against Zuger. We also warn that we shall likewise impose sanctions in any future \u201ctax protester\u201d ease in which the appeal is frivolous and'an unwarranted burden on the court and the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-14\">AFFIRMED AND SANCTION IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-10\">. <em>E.g., Jones v.
