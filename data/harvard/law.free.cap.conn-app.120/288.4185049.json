Thompson, appeals from the judgments of the trial court denying his motion to terminate probation. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court abused its discretion when it denied his motion because the state\u2019s delay in charging him with a probation violation constituted a violation of his due process rights. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Following convictions for larceny in the third degree, the court sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of six years incarceration, execution suspended after two and one-half years, and three years of probation. The defendant was released from incarceration and began probation on January 28, 2005. A condition of the defendant\u2019s probation was that he \u201cnot violate any criminal law of the United States, this state or any other state or territory.\u201d In September, 2005, the defendant was arrested and charged with two counts of larceny in the first degree, eleven counts of identity theft and failure to appear.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During his trial, the defendant was involved in an altercation with a judicial marshal at the Norwalk courthouse, and, as a result, he was arrested in July, 2007, and charged with assault of public safety personnel. An arrest warrant for probation violations issued in August, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>On January 2, 2008, the defendant filed an amended motion to terminate probation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-33.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On January 14, 2008, following a hearing, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion and found him in violation of probation. On appeal, the defendant does not challenge the court\u2019s determination that a probation violation occurred. Instead, he claims that the court abused its discretion when it denied his motion to terminate because the state\u2019s delay in pursuing the probation violation constituted a violation of his due process rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Although both parties agree that the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion should be reviewed for abuse of discretion, the defendant has not provided us with an adequate record to review his claim. \u201cThe duty to provide this court with a record adequate for review rests with the appellant. ... It is incumbent upon the appellant to take the necessary steps to sustain its burden of providing an adequate record for appellate review. . . . Without the necessary factual and legal conclusions furnished by the trial court, any decision made by us respecting the defendant\u2019s claims would be entirely speculative.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cotto, </em>111 Conn. App. 818, 821, 960 A.2d 1113 (2008). In this case, the court did not articulate the basis for its decision, and the defendant did not file a motion for articulation. As a result, the record before us is inadequate, and we decline to review the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\"> Following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of two counts of larceny in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-122 (a) (2) and one count of failure to appear in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-172 (a) (1).
