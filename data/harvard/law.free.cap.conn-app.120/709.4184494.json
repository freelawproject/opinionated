Jones, appeals from the judgments of the trial court revoking his probation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32. He claims there was insufficient evidence for the court to find by a preponderance of the evidence that a probation violation occurred. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-14\">\u201c[A] trial court may not find a violation of probation unless it finds that the predicate facts underlying the violation have been established by a preponderance of the evidence . . . that is, the evidence must induce a reasonable belief that it is more probable than not that the defendant has violated a condition of his or her probation. ... In making its factual determination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>the trial court is entitled to draw reasonable and logical inferences from the evidence. ... A challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is based on the court\u2019s factual findings. The proper standard of review is whether the court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous based on the evidence. ... A court\u2019s finding of fact is clearly erroneous and its conclusions drawn from that finding lack sufficient evidence when there is no evidence in the record to support [the court\u2019s finding of fact] . . . or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Oliphant, </em>115 Conn.

It is, however, well settled that \u201c[a]s the sole finder of fact in the probation revocation proceeding . . . the court was entitled to arrive at its own conclusion regarding the witnesses\u2019 credibility and what weight to afford their testimony.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>108 Conn.

The weight given to the credibility of each witness will not be retried on appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Oliphant, </em>supra, 115 Conn. App. 553.
