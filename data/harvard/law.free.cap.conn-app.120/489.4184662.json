On appeal, the defendant claims that the court abused its discretion in denying his motion because it failed to address him personally and determine that he fully understood the potential immigration consequences of his pleas pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-1j (a). We agree and, accordingly, reverse the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">The following factual and procedural history is relevant to our disposition of the defendant\u2019s appeal. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>May 22, 2007, the defendant pleaded guilty, pursuant to the <em>Alford </em>doctrine,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to one count of possession of marijuana with intent to sell and two counts of violation of a protective order. During the plea hearing, the court questioned the defendant as to his understanding of the rights he was waiving, the meaning of his <em>Alford </em>plea and the agreed upon sentence. The court then addressed defense counsel and the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">\u201cThe Court: Any immigration issues here, [defense counsel]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Yes, there are, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">\u201cThe Court: Have you talked to [the defendant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-10\">\u201cThe Court: All right. And he understands the possible consequences of his pleas?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-11\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">The court then accepted the defendant\u2019s pleas and found that they were made voluntarily. The court also made a finding that the defendant \u201chas been advised by his counsel of the immigration consequences of his acts.\u201d The discussion then turned to the start date of the defendant\u2019s sentence, and the court asked again about immigration, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-13\">\u201cThe Court: Is there an immigration sticker on him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-14\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: There is no immigration sticker as I know of. But I know that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-15\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: He\u2019s going to be deported. I looked into it when we did the . . . [and] we talked and then when we did the [violation of probation] hearing that\u2019s what they told us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>\u201cThe Court: All right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">After further discussion, the court sentenced the defendant to forty months incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">On January 13, 2009, the defendant filed a motion to withdraw his guilty pleas and vacate the judgments of conviction, claiming that the court did not fulfill its obligation pursuant to \u00a7 54-lj (a) to address him personally and determine that he understood the immigration consequences of his pleas.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On January 27, 2009, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, stating, \u201cIn reading the transcript of the sentence, the issue of immigration was directly addressed to counsel for the defendant in which he indicates he discussed the immigration issues with his client and that the client understood the immigration consequence of his plea. Along in the canvass . . . the state brought up the fact that the defendant is going to be deported.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>The defendant claims that the court did not comply with \u00a7 54-1j (a) before accepting his pleas. Specifically, the defendant contends that the court failed to address him personally or to determine that he understood that his immigration status might be adversely affected by his guilty pleas. The state contends that the court substantially complied with the mandates of \u00a7 54-1j (a) and that the defendant knew that his guilty pleas might subject him to deportation. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">\u201cThe burden is always on the defendant to show a plausible reason for the withdrawal of a plea of guilty. ... To warrant consideration, the defendant must allege and provide facts which justify permitting him to withdraw his plea .... Whether such proof is made is a question for the court in its sound discretion, and a denial of permission to withdraw is reversible only if that discretion has been abused.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carmelo T., </em>110 Conn. App. 543, 549, 955 A.2d 687, cert. denied, 289 Conn. 950, 960 A.2d 1037 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Generally, a guilty plea may not be withdrawn after the conclusion of the proceeding at which the sentence was imposed. See Practice Book \u00a7 39-26. An exception to that rule, however, is if the legislature grants the defendant the right to withdraw his plea after the time of sentencing. Section 54-lj (c) specifically requires the court to permit a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea within three years after the acceptance of the plea \u201c[i]f the court fails to address the defendant personally and determine that the defendant fully understands the possible consequences of the defendant\u2019s plea, as required in subsection (a) of this section . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Section 54-lj (a) requires the court to address the defendant personally and to instruct a defendant on possible immigration and naturalization consequences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>that may result from a guilty plea and to ensure that the defendant fully understands those potential consequences. Our Supreme Court has previously stated that the legislative intent behind \u00a7 54-lj, \u201crather than demanding that trial courts instruct defendants on the intricacies of immigration law, seeks only to put defendants on notice that their resident status could be implicated by the plea.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Malcolm, </em>257 Conn. 653, 663-64, 778 A.2d 134 (2001). The statute\u2019s purpose is simply to recognize that \u201cthis collateral consequence is of such importance that the defendant should be informed of its possibility.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 663 n.12. The court held that, in canvassing the defendant, it is not necessary for the trial court to read the statute verbatim. Rather, \u201conly substantial compliance with the statute is required to validate a defendant\u2019s guilty plea.\u201d Id., 662.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Here, the court did not substantially comply with the mandates of \u00a7 54-lj (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At no time during the plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>hearing did the court personally address the defendant regarding the potential immigration consequences of his pleas. Nor did the court recite those consequences as part of its canvass. The court\u2019s inquiry of defense counsel as to whether there were \u201c[a]ny immigration issues here\u201d and whether counsel \u201ctalked to\u201d the defendant cannot be construed as compliance with the requirement that the court personally address the defendant or the statutory advisement that the defendant\u2019s conviction \u201cmay have the consequences of deportation or removal from the United States, exclusion from readmission to the United Sates or denial of naturalization . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-lj (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The state argues that the court\u2019s lack of literal compliance with the mandates of \u00a7 54-lj (a) is irrelevant because the defendant knew that his pleas might result in deportation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Acceptance of this argument would render the requirements of \u00a7 54-lj (a) meaningless as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>applied to the facts of this case. Even if substantial compliance can be shown by the defendant\u2019s actual knowledge of the immigration consequences of his pleas, the record does not reflect that the defendant had such knowledge at the time of his pleas. The state\u2019s contention that the defendant was aware of the immigration consequences of his pleas is based on his testimony at a violation of probation hearing held several months earlier, on October 30, 2006, during which the defendant testified that he is not an American citizen and that he is \u201cdeportable.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s testimony in October that he is deportable does not demonstrate that he was aware that his convictions could result in deportation, removal, denial of readmission or denial of naturalization. In fact, the defendant\u2019s testimony indicates merely that the defendant was aware of his legal status as deportable apart from the potential consequences of a criminal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The state also argues that the defendant knew of the immigration consequences of his pleas on the basis of the prosecutor\u2019s comment <em>after </em>the court accepted his pleas that the defendant was going to be deported. Because this comment was made after the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>acceptance of the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas, it cannot be construed as part of the plea canvass.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the court did not substantially comply with the requirements of \u00a7 54-lj. Accordingly, the court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The judgments are reversed and the case is remanded with direction to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-16\"> See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 35, 91 S. Ct 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b514-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54- lj provides: \u201c(a) The court shall not accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere from any defendant in any criminal proceeding unless the court first addresses the defendant personally and determines that the defendant fully understands that if the defendant is not a citizen of the United States, conviction of the offense for which the defendant has been charged may have the consequences of deportation or removal from the United States, exclusion from readmission to the United States or denial of naturalization, pursuant to the laws of the United States. If the defendant has not discussed these possible consequences with the defendant\u2019s attorney, the court shall permit the defendant to do so prior to accepting the defendant\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">\u201c(b) The defendant shall not be required at the time of the plea to disclose the defendant\u2019s legal status in the United States to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">\u201c(c) If the court fails to address the defendant personally and determine that the defendant fully understands the possible consequences of the defendant\u2019s plea, as required in subsection (a) of this section, and the defendant not later than three years after the acceptance of the plea shows that the defendant\u2019s plea and conviction may have one of the enumerated consequences, the court, on the defendant\u2019s motion, shall vacate the judgment, and permit the defendant to withdraw the plea of guilty or nolo contendere, and enter a plea of not guilty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b516-7\"> Similarly, our courts repeatedly have held that \u201conly substantial compliance is required when warning the defendant of the direct consequences of a . . . plea pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 in order to ensure that the plea is voluntary pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 39-20.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Malcolm, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 662. \u201c[A]s determined in a case-by-case evaluation, only substantial compliance with those rules of practice is necessary to arrive at the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s pleas were made knowingly and voluntarily . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Irala, </em>68 Conn. App. 499, 510-11, 792 A.2d 109, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 923, 797 A.2d 519, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 887, 123 S. Ct. 132, 154 L. Ed. 2d 148 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b516-8\"> By contrast, we note that in <em>State </em>v. <em>Malcolm, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 653, the defendant claimed that the trial court did not comply with \u00a7 54-lj because it advised him only of the possibility of deportation and denial of readmission, but not of denial of naturalization. Our Supreme Court held that \u201c[b]y instructing the defendant that he could be deported or excluded from readmission to the United States, the trial court. . . substantially complied with \u00a7 54-lj\u201d because the defendant \u201cwas warned adequately that his immigration status could be implicated by his guilty plea.\u201d Id., 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Irala, </em>68 Conn. App. 499, 792 A2d 109, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 923, 797 A.2d 519, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 887, 123 S. Ct. 132, 154 L. Ed. 2d 148 (2002), this court held that the trial court substantially complied with \u00a7 54-lj and adequately warned the defendant of the immigration consequences of her pleas in instructing the defendant that \u201cher pleas could result in deportation if she was not a citizen of the United States.\u201d Id., 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>62 Conn. App. 805, 772 A.2d 690 (2001), this court found that the trial court substantially complied with \u00a7 54-1j when it advised the defendant, \u201c[i]f you\u2019re not a citizen of the United States, you are advised that a conviction of the offense for which you axe charged may have consequences of deportation, denial of naturalization or exclusion from the United States.\u201d (Thtemal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Section 54-lj (a) was amended in 2003 to increase the court\u2019s obligation at the time of the plea canvass. The amendment replaced the requirement that the court \u201cadvise\u201d the defendant with the greater requirement that the court not accept a plea until it \u201caddresses the defendant personally and determines that the defendant fully understands\u201d that the plea might have immigration consequences. See Public Acts 2003, No. 03-81, \u00a7 1. The amendment does not alter the applicability of the aforementioned cases to the case at hand where the court did not, in any meaningful way, comply with the mandates of \u00a7 54-lj (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b517-11\"> In making this argument, the state relies on the tests regarding substantial compliance with Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 39-19 and 39-20. In <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>197 Conn. 358, 497 A.2d 402 (1985), our Supreme Court concluded that when determining whether there has been substantial compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 (4), formerly Practice Book \u00a7 711 (4), we must conduct a two part inquiry. Id., 361-66. Our first inquiry is to determine whether the court accepted the defendant\u2019s pleas without first determining whether he was aware of and understood the maximum possible sentence to which he was exposed. Id., 364. Next, if we conclude that the court failed to determine whether the defendant was aware of and understood the maximum possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>sentence, we examine the record to determine whether, despite the court\u2019s failure, he nevertheless had actual knowledge of the maximum possible consequences of his pleas. See id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>53 Conn. App. 243, 247-52, 729 A.2d 795 (1999). If either prong is satisfied, the pleas were accepted with substantial compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">The test for substantial compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 39-20 \u201cis whether, in light of all of the circumstances, the trial court\u2019s literal compliance with [Practice Book] \u00a7 39-20 would have made any difference in the trial court\u2019s determination that the plea was voluntary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carmelo T., </em>supra, 110 Conn. App. 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">In the case at hand, there was neither literal nor substantial compliance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b518-12\"> The defendant\u2019s attorney attempted to follow up on the defendant\u2019s answer by asking, \u201cSo, does that mean\u2014what does that mean, as far as you understand that?\u201d The state objected to that question, and the court sustained the objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
